<text>The Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion is a sequence of reports sponsored by WMO/UNEP. The most recent report is from 2018. The reports were set up to inform the Montreal Protocol and amendments about ozone depletion.

== Background ==

The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established. Until the 1980s, EU, NASA, NAS, UNEP, WMO and the British government had all issued further different scientific reports with dissenting conclusions. Sir Robert (Bob) Watson, Director of the Science Division of at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), played a crucial role in achieving unified reporting. The IPCC started from scratch with a more unified approach.

== Findings ==

=== Changes in Ozone-Depleting Compounds ===

* In the troposphere observations show that the total abundance of ozone-depleting compounds continues to decline slowly from the peak that occurred in 1992-1994.
* Observations in the stratosphere indicate that the total chlorine abundance is at or near a peak, while bromine abundances are probably still increasing.
* Analyses of air trapped in snow since the late 19th century have confirmed that non-industrial sources of the CFCs, halons, and major chlorocarbons were insignificant. The data suggest that substantial natural sources exist for atmospheric methyl bromide (CH3Br).
* The abundances of HCFCs in the troposphere continue to increase.
* water vapour is a greenhouse gas that has a greater overall effect on the ozone layer than carbon dioxide because of its higher concentrations but is not affected by human activities as it is caused mainly by evaporation and condensation rates.

=== Changes in the Ozone Layer over the Poles and Globally ===

* Springtime Antarctic ozone depletion due to halogens has been large (40-50%; exceptionally 70%) throughout the last decade.
* In some recent cold Arctic winters during the last decade, maximum total column ozone losses due to halogens have reached 30%, but in warmer winters Arctic ozone loss is small.
* Ozone remains depleted in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres. The global-average total column ozone amount for the period 1997-2001 was approximately 3% below the pre-1980 average values.
* Models capture the observed long-term ozone changes in northern and southern midlatitudes.

=== Predictions ===

* Chemistry-climate models predict that springtime Antarctic ozone levels will be increasing by 2010 because of projected decreases of halogens in the stratosphere. A return to pre-1980 total column ozone amounts in the Antarctic is expected by the middle of this century.
* Arctic ozone depletion is highly variable and difficult to predict, but a future Arctic polar ozone hole similar to that of the Antarctic appears unlikely.

=== Changes in Ultraviolet Radiation ===

* Decreases in ozone amounts lead to increases in UV radiation. Calculations of UV irradiance based on relationships with total ozone and total irradiance suggest that UV irradiance has increased since the early 1980s by 6-14% at more than 10 sites distributed over mid- and high latitudes of both hemispheres. But complexities (e.g. clouds, aerosol, snow cover, sea ice cover, and total ozone) limit the ability to describe fully surface ultraviolet radiation on the global scale. Surface ultraviolet data records, which started in the early 1990s, are still too short and too variable to permit the calculation of statistically significant long-term (i.e., multidecadal) trends.
* However, estimates of surface UV radiation from satellite data (ozone and cloud cover) started in November 1978 with the launch of Nimbus-7/TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) followed by Meteor-3/TOMS in 1991, Earth-Probe/TOMS in 1996, and by OMI (Ozone Measuring Instrument on the EOS/AURA spacecraft) in July 2004. These time series are sufficient for estimates of multidecade trends in ozone, cloud cover, and UV irradiance. The results clearly show that there have been significant increases in surface UVB at latitudes greater than about 40 degrees (northern US and Canada, most of Europe, Russia, and the southernmost portions of Argentina and Chile). The percent increase depends on the wavelength, with shorter wavelengths showing a larger percent increase.
* Exposure to UV irradiance reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface is also affected by the amount of cloud cover and by the altitude above sea level. These factors affect both UVA and UVB in nearly the same manner (less cloud cover or higher altitudes increase UV radiation at the Earth&#x27;s surface). Some countries, such as Australia, have much less cloud cover than comparable sites in the Northern Hemisphere, and have much greater daily exposure to UV radiation. Australia, in particular, is known for health effects associated with UV exposure, and has a vigorous public health program to combat this problem. Satellite reflectivity data (TOMS) suggests that some populated regions (e.g., central Europe) have experienced small decreases in cloudiness, which would contribute to overall UV increases.

<text>Monica Keena (born May 28, 1979) is an American actress. Following her feature film debut in &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; (1995), she went on to play leading roles in &quot;Snow White: A Tale of Terror&quot; (1997), &quot;Crime and Punishment in Suburbia&quot; (2000), &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003), and the 2009 remake of &quot;Night of the Demons&quot;. Her other credits include &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997), &quot;Orange County&quot; (2002), and &quot;Man of the House&quot; (2005). On television, Keena played Abby Morgan on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–1999), Rachel Lindquist on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Undeclared&quot; (2001–2002), Kristen on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot; (2004–2005), and Bonnie Crasnoff on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2005; 2007).

==Early life==
Keena was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents are William Junior,
a financial sales manager, and Mary Catherine Keena, a nurse. She has a sister, Samantha, who is two years older.

Keena attended Saint Ann&#x27;s, a progressive private school in Brooklyn Heights. She auditioned for LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts at the age of 13, and was accepted into both the dramatic and vocal arts departments.

==Career==
Following her television film debut in &quot;A Promise Kept: The Oksana Baiul Story&quot;, where she played the title character, Keena took a supporting role in the 1995 romantic comedy &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;. Her first major role in a feature film came in 1997, when she starred as Lilliana &quot;Lilli&quot; Hoffman in the folklore-inspired gothic horror film, &quot;Snow White: A Tale of Terror&quot;. She appeared in a small role in Taylor Hackford&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; that same year.

In the Rob Schmidt-directed &quot;Crime and Punishment in Suburbia&quot; (2000), Keena played the principal role of Roseanne Skolnick, an outwardly popular high schooler with a dysfunctional home life. Describing it as &quot;messy but hungry ... the kind of movie that lives and breathes&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert said of Keena, &quot;[She] does a great deal with Roseanne, a character who is herself an actress–pretending to be a daughter, a girlfriend, a cheerleader, all the time screaming inside&quot;. &quot;Suburbia&quot; was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at that year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival. 

Keena starred as &quot;final girl&quot; Lori Campbell in the 2003 slasher film, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, a crossover between the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchises. Directed by Ronny Yu, &quot;FvJ&quot; was a financial success, grossing USD$117 million at the box office. A mixture of parts in mainstream and independent comedies—&quot;Bad Girls from Valley High&quot;, &quot;Man of the House&quot; (both 2005), &quot;Fifty Pills&quot; (2006)—came next, as did the Mafia drama &quot;Brooklyn Rules&quot; (2007) and a headline role in &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; (2009), a remake of the 1988 horror movie of the same name.

Alongside recurring appearances as Abby Morgan on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–1999), Kristen on &quot;Entourage&quot; (2004–2005), and a starring role as college student Rachel Lindquist on Judd Apatow&#x27;s short-lived cult hit sitcom, &quot;Undeclared&quot; (2001–2002), Keena played a string of television guest roles throughout the 2000s, on series such as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. For her portrayal of Bonnie Crasnoff—a patient who is severely injured in a train accident—on the second season of medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Keena was nominated for a 2006 Gold Derby Award. The episode attracted a U.S. audience of 16.67 million viewers and received universal praise from critics, with many since referring to it as one of the series&#x27; greatest episodes.

===Personal life===
During the filming of &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; (2009), Keena became romantically involved with her co-star, Edward Furlong. The pair dated for four years, with Furlong being arrested on three occasions between 2012 and 2013 for physically assaulting Keena, eventually spending six months in jail.

<doc id="966602" wikidata="Q363883" url="?curid=966602" title="Jake Plummer">
<text>Jason Steven &quot;Jake&quot; Plummer (born December 19, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils. Plummer was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft, spending six seasons with the Cardinals and then four with the Denver Broncos.

Since retiring from the field, he launched Umbo, a functional mushroom supplement company alongside former UFC Champion Rashad Evans. He subsequently founded MyCOLove Farm in Fort Lupton, Colorado to better understand mushrooms and mycology.

His nickname, &quot;Jake the Snake&quot;, has no connection to professional wrestler Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Roberts. Coincidentally, Plummer and Roberts each adopted the nickname as a tribute to former Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, who was nicknamed &quot;Snake.&quot;

==Early life==
Plummer was born in Boise, Idaho; he and his two older brothers grew up in Smiley Creek. They were often at the family lumber mill and warehouse in the town of 50 in the Sawtooths (the mountains of the Sawtooth Range).

In his youth, Plummer attended Pierce Park Elementary and Hillside Junior High. In third grade at Pierce Park, he started going by Jake after being asked by his teacher to use a different name because there were four other students named Jason. He graduated from Capital High School in 1993, where he was a three-sport star in high school, playing baseball and basketball in addition to football; he was also selected all-state as both a quarterback and punter and passed for 6,097 yards and 68 touchdowns in his junior and senior years. He originally wanted to play football at Stanford, but they only offered him a preferred walk-on offer; he instead accepted a full ride from California until Hue Jackson, then a coach at Arizona State, heavily recruited Plummer and eventually convinced him to recommit to the Sun Devils. He also received scholarship offers from Boise State, Idaho, Montana, Oregon State, Washington State, and Wyoming.

==College career==
Plummer accepted a football scholarship to Arizona State University in Tempe. He did not redshirt and took over as the starting quarterback (from Grady Benton) early in his freshman season in 1993. He had consistent, but not outstanding, statistical output during his career, and never led the Pac-10 in any major statistical category. He threw for an impressive 1,650 yards in his freshman season, but also had seven interceptions to just nine touchdowns. He broke 2,000 yards in 1994 as a sophomore, and upped his touchdowns to 15. As a junior in 1995, his 2,222 yards and 17 touchdowns, many coming at pivotal moments in games, earned him a strong fan base and all-conference honors despite a lackluster 6–5 record.

His senior season in 1996 was arguably the best in school history. Arizona State attracted national attention on September 21 when they shut out top-ranked Nebraska to snap the Huskers&#x27; 26-game winning streak. Plummer evaded a sack to toss a 25-yard touchdown on the game&#x27;s opening drive, and finished 20 of 36 for 292 yards, setting a new school record for career passing yards in the process. He led ASU to an undefeated regular season and a Pac-10 championship, aided in no small part by fellow all-conference linebacker and close personal friend Pat Tillman. In the Rose Bowl, he scored a sensational 11-yard go-ahead touchdown run late in the fourth quarter, but Ohio State responded and won A victory likely would have meant a national championship as the only undefeated team in the nation, but their final ranking was fourth. Plummer was third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Florida&#x27;s Danny Wuerffel and Iowa State&#x27;s Troy Davis, was a first-team All-American, and the Pac-10&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year.

Plummer ended his career with several school records; most have since been surpassed, but his 34 games with a rushing or passing touchdown remains an ASU record. A dedicated student, Plummer was also a two-time Academic All-Conference player. A 2013 review listed Jake Plummer as the best player to wear number 16 in Sun Devil history.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Arizona Cardinals (1997–2002)===
Plummer was selected in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals. He played behind Kent Graham and Stoney Case at the start of his rookie season. He took his first snap late in the 4th quarter of the seventh game, and promptly led the Cardinals on a 98-yard drive, going 4-of-6 for 87 yards and capping it with a 31-yard go-ahead touchdown. He led the Cardinals to three of their four victories that year. Already locally popular from his days at ASU, according to teammate Chad Carpenter he was now treated &quot;like a god. We go to a restaurant and people stand up and clap when he walks by.&quot; In 1998, the Cardinals drafted Plummer&#x27;s friend Pat Tillman, and the two started all sixteen games en route to a 9–7 regular season record. In the tenth game against Dallas Cowboys, he threw for a stellar 465 yards and three touchdowns. In the playoffs, he led the Cardinals to an upset of the same Cowboys for the franchise&#x27;s first postseason victory since 1947, before losing in the second round to the Minnesota Vikings.

Plummer had a disappointing season in 1999; he went 3–8 as a starter, threw nine touchdowns to 24 interceptions, and the Cardinals finished 6–10. Regarding Plummer&#x27;s season, the Football Outsiders commented: &quot;At the start of the 1999 season, Jake Plummer was being celebrated as one of the NFL&#x27;s best young quarterbacks, the man who would make the Cardinals respectable again. By the end of the 1999 season, Plummer ranked as the league&#x27;s worst quarterback.&quot; His reputation as a risk-taking &quot;gunslinger&quot; became a liability. In 2000 Plummer threw for 2,946 yards, 21 interceptions, and had a 66.0 quarterback rating. Although he reached 10,000 career passing yards (in 47 starts), Plummer compiled a 3–11 record and the Cardinals finished last in the NFC East.

Plummer bounced back in 2001 with his best statistical season with the Cardinals. He was one of only two NFL quarterbacks to take every snap for his team (Kerry Collins was the other), and he passed for 3,653 yards, eighteen touchdowns, and fourteen interceptions. During the season, he had a stretch of 142 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception. Plummer also led the NFL in fourth-quarter passing yards (1,227) and the Cardinals to a 7–9 record.

Plummer&#x27;s last season with the Cardinals was 2002 and again his statistics were down (65.7 passer rating, 2,972 yards, eighteen touchdowns and twenty interceptions). On September 22 against the San Diego Chargers, he eclipsed 15,000 career passing yards.

&#x27;s NFL off-season, Jake Plummer held at least nine Cardinals franchise records, including:
* Passing TDs: rookie season (fifteen in 1997), rookie game (four on 1997-12-07 WAS)
* Passer Rating: rookie game (119.1 on 1997-11-30 PIT)
* Sacked: game (ten on 1997-11-30 PIT), rookie season (52 in 1997)
* Yds/Pass Att: rookie season (7.44 in 1997)
* Pass Yds/Game: rookie season (220.3 in 1997)
* 300+ yard passing games: playoffs (two)

===Denver Broncos (2003–2006)===

After spending 5 seasons in Arizona, Plummer signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos in 2003, replacing Brian Griese. Though the laid-back Plummer would clash often with the domineering head coach Mike Shanahan, his guidance helped Plummer finish with a career-high 91.2 quarterback rating. On September 22, he had the longest run by a Broncos QB on Monday Night Football, a 40-yard scramble in a 31–10 win over the Oakland Raiders. He led the Broncos to a wild card playoff berth, where the Broncos were beaten 41–10 by the Indianapolis Colts.

In 2004 he matched or surpassed several of Broncos Hall of Fame QB John Elway&#x27;s passing records (including passing yardage and passing touchdowns in a single season). In the opening game victory against Kansas City, he reached 20,000 career passing yards. In the eighth game, he threw for a spectacular 499 yards and four touchdowns against Atlanta. However, continuing a career-long shortcoming, he also threw three interceptions in the loss, and led the league that season with twenty. He led the Broncos to a second straight wild card playoff berth, but the Broncos were again beaten by the Colts 49–24, despite Plummer&#x27;s 103.1 passer rating in the contest.

In 2005, Plummer experienced arguably his best season as a professional. He threw 229 passes without an interception, the longest such streak of his career. He also began serving as Denver&#x27;s holder, which he would continue to do through the 2006 season, as well. Along the way, Plummer helped the Broncos compile a 13–3 record, a #2 seed, and a first round bye in the AFC playoffs (behind the Colts). He also earned a Pro Bowl selection. The Broncos&#x27; first game was against the New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Game at Invesco Field. Although not outstanding, Plummer&#x27;s performance (15-for-26 for 197 yards, one touchdown, one interception) helped the Broncos break the Patriots&#x27; winning streak of eleven postseason games and gain their first postseason victory since Super Bowl XXXIII. However, Plummer accounted for four turnovers in the AFC Championship game and the Broncos were defeated 34–17 by the eventual Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.

On November 27, 2006, after a lackluster performance in the first eleven games, and following back-to-back losses to the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs, head coach Mike Shanahan announced that Plummer would be replaced at starting quarterback by rookie Jay Cutler. The decision to hand a 7–4 team over to a rookie quarterback was met by fans and media with mixed reactions. Those who viewed Plummer as inconsistent heralded the change as one that would revive the Broncos&#x27; struggling offense; others claimed such a move was ill-advised, especially given that Plummer had guided the Broncos to the AFC Championship game the year before; Plummer had also been 40–18 with Denver in both regular season and playoff games, while leading his teams to thirty game-tying/winning drives in his career, a league high. In the last game of the season, Plummer came off the bench against the San Francisco 49ers after Cutler suffered a concussion. He played the remainder of the first half before Cutler played the second half.

As of the 2017 NFL off-season, Plummer holds at least two Broncos franchise records, including:
* Passing Yards: game (499 on 2004-10-31 ATL)
* Passer Rating: playoff season (103.1 in 2004)

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2007)===
On March 3, 2007, Plummer was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a 2008 conditional draft pick. However, rumors began to surface that Plummer was going to choose retirement over competition with the Buccaneers&#x27; four other quarterbacks on the roster (Bruce Gradkowski, Tim Rattay, Jeff Garcia, and Luke McCown). On March 9, Plummer ended the speculation by announcing his decision to retire. Plummer also confirmed his retirement through the Jake Plummer Foundation&#x27;s website.

Since he was still under contract to the Buccaneers and had already been given his contract signing bonus, Tampa Bay coach Jon Gruden met with Plummer in July to try to convince him to reconsider and report for training camp. However, the attempt was unsuccessful and the team sued for recovery of the bonus. A settlement was finally reached on June 10, 2008, in which Plummer was required to pay back $3.5 million to the Buccaneers.

==NFL career statistics==


==Handball==
Since his retirement from the NFL, Plummer has been an avid player of four-wall handball. He attended his first professional handball tournament in 2007 when he entered the Simple Green US Open of Handball (with brother Eric) in the pro doubles division where the pair lost to future Hall of Fame members John Bike and Danny Bell. In 2008, Plummer hosted his own pro invitational and lost in the finals of the pro consolation bracket to #37 ranked, Jeff Kastner. Also in 2008, Plummer lost in the semifinals of the 2008&#x27;s Idaho State Singles Championships to his brother (the eventual champion).

==Personal life==
Plummer married former Broncos cheerleader Kollette Klassen on August 26, 2007, whom he met in 2005. In June 2010, Kollette gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child. After retiring from the NFL, Plummer moved to Sandpoint, Idaho (though the couple also has a house in Boulder, Colorado) where he lives in relative anonymity. His former agent Leigh Steinberg said he is &quot;one of the minuscule few that I could see living a completely fulfilled life away from sport... he was as close to an egoless major star as I&#x27;ve seen.&quot; When a concerned Meals on Wheels supervisor in Sandpoint insisted that a jobless, &quot;scruffy&quot;, long-time volunteer who worked for her, keep track of the miles he drove for the organization for reimbursement, she was &quot;dumbstruck&quot; to discover he was a former NFL star.

The lifestyle contrasted with the somewhat rocky moments during his playing days with much attention devoted to flipping off a fan, a loud traffic dispute, and a feud with a Denver gossip columnist. Plummer has also stirred controversy with his support of medical marijuana, which he claims to use regularly to deal with lingering post-football injuries, and hostile reaction to Jerry Jones&#x27; dismissal of NFL players with brain injuries. Plummer also started an Alzheimer&#x27;s foundation, made time during his career to walk dogs at a shelter he donated $10,000 to on retirement, and developed personal connections with children affected by 9/11.

On June 27, 1997, he struck a plea agreement rather than fight charges alleging that he grabbed four women at a nightclub in Tempe, Arizona. He received two years probation, was fined $1,020, and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. Probation ended after only 9 months due to exemplary behavior with a court spokeswoman stating, &quot;He has done everything we have asked of him, more in fact, significantly more.&quot;

In September 2007, Plummer was inducted into the Arizona State Hall of Fame. Later that year, he made a brief appearance in the 2007 Holiday Bowl, when he introduced the ASU players prior to the team playing game. On October 29, 2010, Plummer was honored, along with all Sun Devil Quarterbacks, at a Legends Luncheon hosted by the Arizona State University Alumni Association and Sun Devil Club. Other honorees included Danny White, Andrew Walter, John F. Goodman, and Jeff Van Raaphorst. Plummer has been an assistant football coach at Sandpoint High School since 2009.

==Relationship with Pat Tillman==
Plummer was a teammate of Pat Tillman, a safety, at both Arizona State and the Arizona Cardinals and the two were close friends. After the 2001 season, while Plummer was still with the Cardinals, Tillman joined the U.S. Army Rangers in response to 9/11. During leave in January 2004, the two showed up unannounced at a handball tournament in Seattle in support of Jake&#x27;s brother, Eric.

After Tillman&#x27;s death in Afghanistan on April 22, 2004, all NFL players wore a memorial decal on their helmets on September 24 in honor of Tillman and the Cardinals continued to wear this decal throughout the 2004 season. Plummer by this point was with the Broncos, requested to wear the decal for the entire season, but the NFL turned him down because his helmet would not be the same as the rest of his team. For the 2005 season Plummer grew an untrimmed, full beard and wore his hair long in honor of Tillman, who had worn that style in the NFL before he cut his hair and shaved off his beard in accordance with military uniform regulations. Plummer gave Tillman&#x27;s funeral eulogy in a suit and flip-flops in honor of his friend&#x27;s trademark style.

==Medical cannabis advocacy==

Plummer uses cannabidiol (CBD) to treat the pain, inflammation, and headaches that he has experienced as a result of his years playing football. He says that his condition improved so much after he started taking CBD that he considered a return to the NFL, almost a decade after retiring. He has served as a spokesperson for CW Botanicals, a company which manufactures CBD products. He has also helped raise funds for cannabinoid research.

In November 2016, Plummer was one of the signatories of an open letter addressed to the NFL, urging a change in the league&#x27;s policy towards cannabis. Doctors for Cannabis Regulation wrote the letter and it was signed by several NFL players. He is also a member of the Doctors for Cannabis Regulation NFL steering committee.

<text>Kenneth Colin Irving, (14 March 1899 – 13 December 1992) was a Canadian businessman whose business began with a family sawmill in Bouctouche, New Brunswick, in 1882. In 1989, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Irving was born in Bouctouche, New Brunswick to local businessman James Dergavel Irving (colloquially known by his initials &quot;J.D.&quot;), and Mary Elizabeth Irving (), both descendants of Scottish immigrants. In his early years, K. C. Irving was viewed as a tough kid from a rough sawmill town on the Northumberland Strait. He began his entrepreneurial streak early, but this was tempered by the dawn of World War I. Irving attempted to enlist while being underage, but his father disapproved of it and sent him to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. When he tried enlisting in Halifax, his father put an end to it by enrolling him at Acadia University in Wolfville. In 1918, Irving enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps and took pilot training in Britain, though he would return to Bouctouche without returning to university. Irving took a cross-country adventure to British Columbia before returning to Bouctouche.

===The 1920s===
While back in Bouctouche, Irving dabbled in the merchant trade, working as a Ford automobile salesman for a dealer in Richibucto at the age of 22. Within two years, the sales territory of southern Kent County was his. In 1924, he opened a petrol (gasoline) station under the Imperial Oil logo. He was unceremoniously dumped from that franchise within the year, whereupon he contacted Samuel Lloyd Noble in order to purchase a supply from him. By 1925 he opened a second service station in nearby Shediac. He would eventually transform what became known as Irving Oil into a 3,000 franchise distributor across the Maritimes.

At the age of 26, Irving was invited by the representative of Ford to take over the franchise in Saint John, the city he would make his home for the next 46 years. Early on, he switched his business to the Bank of Nova Scotia as the result of a fortuitous visit which acquainted him with the future president of the bank, Horace L. Enman. In 1926, he was awarded a Ford franchise in Halifax, and the concession for Ford tractors in the whole of the Maritimes. In 1929, he formed K. C. Irving Gas and Oil Ltd, in order to distribute the Noble supply. Haymarket Square Service Stations was formed in the late 1920s as a partnership with two others, one of whom he bought out after the first year. By 1930, Irving was selling petrol in Saint John, Bouctouche, Shediac, Moncton, Sussex, Campbellton, St. Stephen, Westville, Weymouth, Amherst and Truro. Also by 1930, his petrol business expanded into Prince Edward Island and Quebec&#x27;s Magdalen Islands. In 1930, he sold 8,000,000 gallons, when one of his average service stations sold 70,000 gallons; that year, he employed 212 people in Saint John and 482 elsewhere. Irving saw that the petrol business was also an opportunity to purchase land, and in 1931 erected as his headquarters the Golden Ball building at the corner of Sydney and Union streets.

===The 1930s===
Canada Veneers had been established in 1933 by Robert McMillan, chiefly to produce orange crates for another local company. In 1936, Irving underwrote $100,000 in Canada Veneer preferred shares with Frank Brennan as partners in Irving-Brennan Co. Ltd. Then in the same year, the veneer plant, which had occupied a defunct local horse race-track, burnt down. It revived, but in early January 1938 a shareholder withdrew his guarantee of a $17,000 bank loan, and in exchange for his guarantee of a $10,000 bank loan Irving gained control of the veneer firm. Irving later hired C.A. Kessler to teach his staff, in particular Art McNair, to cut thin and uniform plies, which would become a specialty of the firm.

By 1939, Irving had developed an ulcer, and tipped the scales at 215 pounds; the Lahey Clinic in Boston would in 1941 cure the ulcer.

===WW2===
Irving obtained the contract from Ottawa or London to build in Bouctouche wooden landing barges for D-Day. He set up the production facilities near the familial grist mill, and built bunkhouses on the family farm for the scores of workers.

===1963 Irving refinery strike===
After joining the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union in 1960, 145 Saint John Irving oil refinery workers pushed for the prevailing wage rate at Canadian oil refineries. The Irving refinery had high productivity but relatively low wages for the sector. Irving&#x27;s counter-offer was below the wage-rate, leading to a strike in September 1963. The strikers called for a boycott of Irving gas stations, which gained some public support. Irving secured a court injunction against pickets at the gas stations and other secondary pickets. At least a dozen Irving truck driver depots in Quebec struck in sympathy with the refinery workers. On one march through downtown Saint John, refinery workers also burned K. C. Irving in effigy.

The strike became a national issue. The union appealed for donations from across the country, asking Canadians &quot;Are you going to allow that a group of workers be slaughtered by an employer whose trade union notions are those of feudalism?&quot; In addition to court injunctions limiting pickets at the refinery as well as banning secondary pickets at other Irving facilities, Irving also hired replacement workers or scabs. When a settlement was finally achieved in March 1964, Irving conceded wage increases masquerading as &quot;merit pay&quot; while a judge ruled the union pay Irving $2,000 for damaging his reputation.

===Offshore holdings===
Irving fought many battles with the federal government over income tax, business tax and inheritance tax policies. On 23 December 1971, following a particularly tough series of battles, he left Canada, ostensibly because of the estate tax situation: the Federal government planned to abolish estate taxes while the government of Premier Richard Hatfield (along with the other Maritime governments) planned to introduce an estate tax in its place. 

Although he remained as majority shareholder, his sons controlled the daily operations of the conglomerate. From 1972 until his death, Irving would visit New Brunswick for &quot;6 months, less a day&quot; each year. In 2018, Forbes magazine estimated that the Irvings&#x27; net worth was $US12 billion.

===Later life and death===
Irving died at home in Saint John and was buried alongside his first wife in Bermuda. Later, his body was exhumed, along with his wife&#x27;s. They were re-buried outside the Scottish-style church on the Irving Manor in Bouctouche. Their graves were only marked as &quot;Grammy and Grampy&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1927, Irving married Harriet McNairn (1899–1976), a boyhood sweetheart, and the following year his first son was born. He was the father of, in 1928 James Kenneth, in 1930 Arthur Lee, and in 1932 John Ernest; the family attended St John&#x27;s and St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Church. Irving would, after his sons all had graduated, provide for a new building at Rothesay Collegiate School.

Ownership and operation of the Irving group of companies ultimately divided among his three sons and their respective children, James, the oldest brother and his (James&#x27;) two sons, Jim and Robert, took more control of forest products and several other divisions, Arthur the middle brother assumed more autonomy in Irving Oil, which owns the Saint John, New Brunswick Irving Oil Refinery, Canada&#x27;s largest refinery, and Jack who looked after much of the construction, engineering and Radio &amp; Television stations.

==Criticism==
===J.D. Irving Limited===

It was the growth of Irving Oil which largely financed K. C. Irving&#x27;s other endeavours. Several years after starting Irving Oil, Irving took over his father&#x27;s sawmill company in Bouctouche, J.D. Irving Limited, which was subsequently expanded many times. JDI was in the 1970s the largest single landowner in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Maine. JDI has also been identified as being one of the four largest private land-owners in the United States. These forest lands feed several pulp and paper plants and sawmills which in turn feed the company&#x27;s paper, tissue, and diaper factories throughout New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Maine, New York, Georgia, Quebec and Ontario.

===Diversification and vertical integration===
As the Irving industrial empire expanded during World War II and the post-war era, K. C. purchased shipyards and started various food processing, media, hardware, building supplies, transportation, engineering and construction companies - all of which are vertically integrated, meaning that each Irving company purchases the services of other Irving companies, keeping profits wholly within the conglomerate.

Irving companies are completely privately owned, and therefore all major business decisions are made by the family-members/owners. This has traditionally been a weakness among many family-owned empires. However, the Irvings have proven their ability to react to market situations much more quickly than their publicly traded competitors , a primary reason for their maintaining market share in so many industries throughout eastern North America. An example can be seen in the fact that Irving Oil undertook significant upgrades and expansions to its refinery in the late mid to late 1990s to produce low-sulphur gasoline, fully a decade ahead of the rest of the North American oil industry. As a result, Irving has been able to capitalize on the growing need for low-emission fuel in California and other U.S. markets (delivered by its own ships).

The conglomerate operates with considerable latitude which the Irving family&#x27;s wealth permits—operating somewhat as a maverick to the consternation of many of Central and Western Canada&#x27;s business leaders. Irving Oil, J.D. Irving and all subsidiary companies are actively supporting Canada&#x27;s ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, since the family has invested considerable funds into environmental controls and alternative energy for its operations and wishes to capitalize on these investments at the expense of its slow-to-respond publicly traded competitors. J.D. Irving&#x27;s food processing plants in Prince Edward Island are looking to build one of the largest wind farms in Canada in that province to completely power their operations, and many Irving-owned sawmills and factories in the rest of northeastern North America are rapidly adopting co-generation, bio-gas and solar/wind power to complement current energy usage.

The Irving family is also hoping to take advantage of deregulation of utility markets in the region by building natural gas-fired electrical generating stations and is currently building a liquified natural gas terminal near its Saint John refinery.

=== New Brunswick media concentration ===
The Irvings have an almost complete monopoly in print media in New Brunswick, owning all English and French daily newspapers but one (&quot;L&#x27;Acadie Nouvelle&quot;) and most English weekly and community papers. In the 1970s, when this concentration was limited to only four English daily newspapers, the Senate created a commission of inquiry into media concentration because of the Irving family&#x27;s control.

The grandson of J.K. Irving and son of Jim Irving, Jamie Irving became publisher of the Irving-owned New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal then vice-president of the newspaper holding company.

Irving had a near monopoly in media in New Brunswick well into the 1980s when they owned several English radio stations and CHSJ-TV, the only CBC affiliate in the province. Irving also started MITV (Maritime Independent Television) as a competitor across the Maritimes with the ATV network. The CBC affiliate was sold to the public broadcaster in 1994 at the same time as MITV was sold to CanWest Global.

===Irving family wealth===
According to the 2011 list of Canadians by net worth the combined net worth of the Irving family ranked third in Canada calculated with the net worth of Arthur Irving, James Irving and John Irving through Irving Oil Ltd. and J.D. Irving Ltd at $8.07 billion with no change from 2010. In 2008 the Canadian Business magazine&#x27;s annual report on the wealthiest Canadians calculated that the Irving family combined wealth rose 34 percent from 2007 to $US 7.11 billion. Only the Thomson family, with a net worth is US$18.45 billion, were wealthier 

However, since the conglomerate is privately held and the family is private with respect to financial matters, no information on net worth is available. Most observers have only the tangible values of real property and industrial assets upon which to base their estimates without any ability to assess the value of cash reserves or outstanding debt and obligations. Despite Forbes&#x27;s estimates, the overall Irving family fortune is likely to be grossly underestimated because of complex tax avoiding schemes which blur evidence behind a network of number companies and international holdings. In 1981, the National Film Board movie &quot;I Like to See Wheels Turn&quot; mentioned Canadian Lawyer Peter Glennie&#x27;s findings. Glennie had compiled company registrations and the rare public documents on the Irving wealth. His estimations on the Irving family wealth were 7 billion in 1981 Canadian dollars (worth 22 billion in 2019 inflation-adjusted Canadian dollars).

== Political views ==
Irving was previously a supporter of the New Brunswick Liberal Association, then-led by Louis Robichaud. Irving had long been challenged by critics for &quot;the tax concessions he and other industrialists have extracted from the province over the years&quot; as well as Irving industrial plant-caused pollution. Irving began supporting the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick after Robichaud pushed back against tax concessions.

<doc id="966606" wikidata="Q7760381" url="?curid=966606" title="Al-Awda (guerrilla organization)">
<text>Al-Awda (; ) is an Arab socialist political party in Iraq. Al-Awda&#x27;s name began appearing in Iraq in June 2003 in anti-occupation graffiti and leaflets in Baghdad and to the north and west of the capital. The group is led by Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, who is based in Syria.

==Organization==
The party was believed to be a network of underground cells, mainly in the key urban areas, composed of former Ba&#x27;ath Party officials, intelligence agents, former members of the Iraqi Republican Guard, and Fedayeen Saddam paramilitaries.

The group was believed to rely on the pre-war organization of the Ba&#x27;ath Party and the relationships forged between various individuals and organizations within Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

==Propaganda and goals==
The party propaganda indicated that its goal was to restore the regime of Saddam Hussein to power, as the name indicates, and expel multinational occupation forces from the country. Al-Awda is believed is to be the term coined by the insurgents for the Ba&#x27;ath Party following the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. The name was chosen for propaganda reasons to raise the threat of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s return to power and to evoke the Palestinian struggle against Israel.

In contrast to the JRTN, Ahmed has focused far more on securing political rehabilitation, amnesties and the repatriation of Baathist exiles than he has the violent overthrow of the Iraqi government, and a real Baathist return to power.

In his attempts to reunite the party, al-Ahmed built a close working relationship with the Syrian government, unlike al-Douri, who distrusts the Syrians due to their alliance with the Iranians. The Syrian government quietly supports Ahmed to gain more control over the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath party.

Ahmed&#x27;s attempts to recruit support in Syria from former Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists are meeting some success, particularly among the poorer Sunni Arab segment of the refugee population, due in part to Ahmed&#x27;s ability to offer cash incentives and Syrian residency permits due to their closeness to the Syrian government.

The al-Awda party led by Ahmed is believed to contain most of the remaining leading party figures who were not arrested or executed, including Mezher Motni Awad, To&#x27;ma Di&#x27;aiyef Getan, Jabbar Haddoosh, Sajer Zubair, and Nihad al-Dulaimi.

It could be said that al-Ahmed has returned to the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s original ideology of secular pan-Arab nationalism, which, in many cases, has proven successful in Iraq&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a-dominated southern provinces. However, despite his attempts, al-Ahmed failed to overthrow al-Douri. Al-Douri&#x27;s faction is the largest and the most active on the Internet, and most Ba&#x27;athist websites are aligned with al-Douri. Another failure is that al-Ahmed&#x27;s faction, which is based in Syria, does not have exclusive Syrian support and, considering that it is based in Syria, the party is susceptible to Syrian interference in its affairs. However, despite the differences between the al-Douri and al-Ahmed factions, both adhere to Ba&#x27;athist thought.

In contrast to al-Douri&#x27;s group, al-Ahmed&#x27;s faction has successfully recruited Shi&#x27;as to the party. While al-Ahmed and the faction&#x27;s senior leaders are Sunnis; there are many Shiites who are working in the organization&#x27;s middle level. Upon his election as leader, an al-Douri faction statement said he was &quot;of Shia origins and coming from Shia areas in Nineveh governorate&quot;. In contrast to al-Ahmed, al-Douri has stuck to a more conservative policy, recruiting members from largely Sunni-dominated areas.

===Saddam&#x27;s death and party split: 2006–2011===
The al-Awda party has a schism from the wider party, led by al-Douri. Following al-Douri&#x27;s succession as the Regional Secretary of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, Younis al-Ahmed called for a General Conference of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath party in Syria to elect a new leadership. This move caused a significant amount of controversy within the party, with al-Douri issuing a statement criticizing Syria for what al-Douri claimed was an American-supported attempt to undermine the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath party, although this statement was later downplayed. The conference elected al-Ahmed as Secretary-general, and al-Ahmed issued an order expelling al-Douri from the party, resulting in al-Douri issuing a counter order expelling al-Ahmed and 150 other party members. These events led to the existence, in effect, of two Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Parties: the main party led by al-Douri, and the splinter al-Awda party led by al-Ahmed. It&#x27;s been rumoured that al-Awda has fought on the side of Bashar Al-Assad in the Syrian civil war

===Attempts at reconciliation===
According to leaked diplomatic cables, in March 2009, several members of the former Ba&#x27;athist government claiming to represent the Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed led faction of the Ba&#x27;ath party approached Coalition Forces and the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Saladin Governorate. The figures met with representatives of the Coalition instead of representatives of the Iraqi Government because they claimed the Iraqi government was under Iranian influence and might seek revenge against any Ba&#x27;ath Party members.

The representatives claimed that the Younis-led faction was dissatisfied with the present government of Iraq, which they claimed was sectarian and failed to provide infrastructure and public services. The representatives claimed that the Younis-led faction wasn&#x27;t opposed to democracy and wished to participate peacefully in the democratic process. They also claimed that unlike the al-Douri-led faction, they recognized that the pre-2003 Ba&#x27;athist government had made many mistakes and that Iraq could not return to that system of government.

===Government crackdowns===
In December 2008, some 25 security officials were arrested for membership in Awda and attempting to restore the Ba&#x27;ath party, with some claiming they were planning a coup. The actual number of those involved may have reached 35, and included both Sunnis and Shiites and high-ranking generals at the Interior Ministry, some of whom Awda had allegedly recruited through bribery.

An Awda party senior official was arrested in a crackdown on the organization in Baaquba, Diyala, on 2 July 2010.

In October 2011, Iraqi security figures announced that they had detained 350 members of the Awda party in a large operation across several provinces. The government claimed the group had been trying to reorganize the Ba&#x27;ath party, and work to undermine stability in the country, with a mind to seizing power following the US withdrawal the following year. The group appeared to be quite active in Nasiriyah, with 36 Ba&#x27;ath party leaders arrested there.

<doc id="966610" wikidata="Q124914" url="?curid=966610" title="Second Avenue (Manhattan)">
<text>Second Avenue is located on the East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan extending from Houston Street at its south end to the Harlem River Drive at 128th Street at its north end. A one-way street, vehicular traffic on Second Avenue runs southbound (downtown) only, except for a one-block segment of the avenue in Harlem. South of Houston Street, the roadway continues as Chrystie Street south to Canal Street.

A bicycle lane runs in the leftmost lane of Second Avenue from 125th to Houston Streets. The section from 55th to 34th Streets closes a gap in the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway.

Second Avenue passes through a number of Manhattan neighborhoods including (from south to north) the Lower East Side, the East Village, Stuyvesant Square, Kips Bay, Tudor City, Turtle Bay, East Midtown, Lenox Hill, Yorkville and Spanish Harlem.

==History==
Downtown Second Avenue in the Lower East Side was the home to many Yiddish theatre productions during the early part of the 20th century, and Second Avenue came to be known as the &quot;Yiddish Theater District&quot;, &quot;Yiddish Broadway&quot;, or the &quot;Jewish Rialto&quot;. Although the theaters are gone, many traces of Jewish immigrant culture remain, such as kosher delicatessens and bakeries, and the famous Second Avenue Deli (which closed in 2006, later reopening on East 33rd Street near Third Avenue).

The Second Avenue Elevated train line ran above Second Avenue the full length of the avenue north of 23rd Street, and stood from 1880 until service was ended on June 13, 1942. South of Second Avenue, it ran on First Avenue and then Allen and Division Streets. The elevated trains were noisy and often dirty (in the 19th century they were pulled by soot-spewing steam locomotives). This depressed land values along Second Avenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Partially because of the presence of the El, most buildings constructed during this era were working-class tenements. The line was finally torn down in 1942 because it was deteriorated and obsolete, and the cost of World War II made upkeep impossible. Second Avenue maintains its modest architectural character today, despite running through a number of high-income areas.

Second Avenue has carried one-way traffic since June 4, 1951, before which it carried traffic in both the northbound and southbound directions.

A protected bike lane on the left, or east, side of the avenue between 59th and 68th streets was completed in 2019. This, along with previous bike lane projects, gave the avenue a continuous bike lane from 125th to 43rd Street. In March 2024, the NYCDOT announced plans to widen the bike lane on Second Avenue from 59th to Houston Street, as well as relocate the bus lane away from the curb. Work on the new bus and bike lanes began that June.
=== 2015 gas explosion ===

On March 26, 2015, a gas explosion and resulting fire in the East Village destroyed three buildings at 119, 121 and 123 Second Avenue, between East 7th Street and St. Mark&#x27;s Place. At least twenty-two people were injured, four critically, and two people were initially listed as missing. Later, two men were found dead in the debris of the explosion and were confirmed to be the ones listed as missing. There had previously been an illegal tap installed into the gas line feeding 121 Second Avenue. In the days before the explosion, work was ongoing in the building for the installation of a new 4-inch gas line to service the apartments in 121, and some of the tenants had smelled gas an hour before the explosion.

Eleven other buildings were evacuated as a result of the explosion, and Con Ed turned off the gas to the area. A few residents were allowed to return to some of the vacated buildings several days later.

==Transportation==
===Bus service===

The M15 local serves the entirety of Second Avenue south of East 126th Street. The M15 Select Bus Service, the Select Bus Service equivalent of the local M15 bus, provides bus rapid transit service along Second Avenue southbound. These two are the primary Second Avenue servers. 

Other bus routes include the following:
* The westbound runs from East 127th Street to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
* The eastbound runs from East 124th Street to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, where westbound buses run to East 126th Street.
* The westbound runs from East 97th to East 96th Streets.
* Three Queens buses hop onto the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge from one of three streets via the avenue:
** The runs from East 61st Street.
** The runs from East 60th Street.
** The runs from East 59th Street. 
* The eastbound runs from East 50th to East 48th Streets.
* The downtown M34A Select Bus Service runs from East 34th to East 23rd Streets, along with the downtown south of East 29th Street.

===Subway===

The serves Second Avenue from 96th Street to 72nd Street before turning onto 63rd Street with a stop at Lexington Avenue, which has an exit at Third Avenue. A Second Avenue Subway line has been planned since 1919, with provisions to construct it as early as 1929.

Two short sections of the line have been completed over the years, serving other subway services (the Grand Street station is served by the ), and others simply sitting vacant underground (such as the unused upper level at the Second Avenue station on the ). Portions have been leased from time to time by New York Telephone to house equipment serving the company&#x27;s principal north-south communication lines which run under the Avenue. Isolated 1970s-era segments of the line, built without any infrastructure, exist between Pell and Canal Streets, and between 99th–105th and 110th–120th Streets. Construction on Phase 1, which will eventually extend from 125th Street to the Financial District via the service, began on April 12, 2007. Phase 1 connects the BMT 63rd Street Line with the new line north to stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets, serving the . Phase 1 opened on January 1, 2017. Phase 2, which would extend the line to East Harlem at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is expected to be completed between 2027 and 2029. When the whole Second Avenue subway line is completed, it is projected to serve about 560,000 daily riders.

===Bike lane===

There is a bicycle lane along the avenue south of 125th St.

<text>The Ustyurt or Ust-Yurt (from ; ; ; — flat hill, plateau) is a transboundary clay desert shared by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The plateau&#x27;s semi-nomadic population raises camels, goats, and sheep.

==Geography==
The Ustyurt is located between the Dead Kultuk, Mangyshlak Peninsula and Kara-Bogaz-Gol of the Caspian Sea to the west, and the Aral Sea, Amudarya Delta and Sarygamysh Lake to the east.

It extends roughly , with an average altitude of . Its highest point rises to in the south-west. At its northeastern edge it drops steeply to the Aral Sea and the surrounding plain.

The Ustyurt Plateau is bounded by steep cliffs called chinks nearly from everywhere. To the east, it encompasses the historical western shoreline of the Aral Sea. In the southern region, it extends to the Kunya-Darya alluvial plain and the valley of the Uzboy, while in the west, it reaches the Karynyaryk depression. To the north, it spans the Karakum sands of the North Caspian Sea and includes the Caspian Depression. Ustyurt chinks often have multicolored layers, with colors of pale pink, blue, clear white, etc., and can form fancy landscapes.

==Protected areas==
Kazakhstan created the Ustyurt Nature Reserve (223,300 hectares) in July, 1984 in the south of Mangystausky district in Eralievsky region. It preserves rare fauna and flora such as the Ustyurt Mountain sheep and the Saiga antelope. Among its features are Sherkala Mountain and the concretions found in the Torysh (&#x27;Valley of Balls&#x27;) near the town of Shetpe.

<doc id="966612" wikidata="Q765230" url="?curid=966612" title="Konstantin Rodzaevsky">
<text>Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky (; – 30 August 1946) was the leader of the Russian Fascist Party, which he led in exile from Manchuria. Rodzaevsky was also the chief editor of the RFP paper &quot;Nash Put&#x27;&quot;. After the defeat of anti-communist forces in the Russian Civil War, he fled to Manchuria in 1925 and eventually became the leading figure of the Russian Fascist movement. He was lured by the NKVD to return to the Soviet Union with false promises of immunity and executed in a Lubyanka prison cellar after a trial for &quot;anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary activities&quot;.

==Early life==
Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky was born in a small town in the city of Blagoveshchensk, the administrative city of Amur Oblast on the 11th of August 1907. Konstantin&#x27;s family was decidedly middle class and was a part of a quite rare and frail status of Siberian bourgeoise. Vladimir Ivanovich, his father, was a gentleman who worked as a notary with a degree in law. His mother, Nadezhda Mikhailovna was from an old Blagoveshchensk family and devoted herself to raising Konstantin alongside his younger brother, Vladimir, and his two sisters, Nadezhda and Nina. Most notably, Konstantin had at some point became a member of the Komsomol during his adolescence.

==Far Eastern Fascism==
Unexpected to his family, Rodzaevsky fled the Soviet Union for Manchuria in 1925. In Harbin, Rodzaevsky entered the law academy and joined the Russian Fascist Organization. On May 26, 1931, he became the Secretary General of the newly created Russian Fascist Party; in 1934 the Party amalgamated with the All-Russian Fascist Organization of Anastasy Vonsyatsky, Rodzaevsky becoming its leader. He modeled himself on Benito Mussolini, and also used the Swastika as one of the symbols of the movement.

Rodzaevsky collected around himself personally selected bodyguards, using the symbolism of the former Russian Empire and Russian nationalist symbols; like the Italian Blackshirts, the Russian Fascists wore black uniforms with black crossed belts. Rodzaevsky&#x27;s black shirts were armed with weapons obtained from the Imperial Japanese Army. They created an international organization of White émigrés with a central office in Harbin, the &quot;Far East Moscow&quot;, and made connections in twenty-six nations around the world. The most important of these international posts were in New York City.

==Manchukuo==

Rodzaevsky had around 12,000 followers in Manchukuo. During the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire of Japan, Rodzaevsky, with a select group of people, paid his respects to Emperor Hirohito at the official celebration in the region.
The fascists installed a great swastika illuminated by neon light at their branch in Manzhouli (&quot;Manchouli&quot;), at least 3 km from the Soviet border. It was kept on all day and night to provide a show of power against the Soviet government. Rodzaevsky awaited the day when, leaving these signs on the Russian border, he would lead the White Anti-Soviet forces, joining White General Kislitsin and Japanese forces, into battle to &quot;liberate the people of Russia from Soviet rule&quot;. Their main military acts involved the training of the Asano Detachment, an entirely ethnic-Russian special force in the Kwantung Army, organized for carrying out sabotage against Soviet forces in case of any Japanese invasion of Siberia. Japan was apparently interested in creating a White Russian regime in Outer Manchuria.

==World War II and execution==
During World War II, Rodzaevsky tried to launch an open struggle against Bolshevism, but Japanese authorities limited the RFP&#x27;s activities to acts of sabotage in the Soviet Union. A notorious anti-Semite, Rodzaevsky published numerous articles in the party newspapers &quot;Our way&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;; he was also the author of the brochure &quot;&quot;Judas’ End&quot; &quot;a&quot;nd the book &quot;Contemporary Judaisation of the World or the Jewish Question in the 20th Century&quot;&quot;.

Upon the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the impending occupation, Rodzaevsky fled Harbin and moved to Shanghai, leaving his family behind. At the end of the war, Rodzaevsky had what he called a &quot;spiritual crisis&quot;. He claimed that Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime was evolving into a nationalist one. Rodzaevsky said he now understood that Stalinism was the ideal embodiment and realization of &quot;our Russian fascism.&quot; In a long personal letter, he explained himself, made excuses, and admitted his mistakes. He admitted to participating in anti-Soviet activities, but said these were &quot;acts against the motherland out of love for the motherland.&quot; He said he was wrong to support Germany, but that he&#x27;d believed Hitler could help Russia by exterminating the Jews. The letter also showed striking similarities with the doctrines of National Bolshevism, with Rodzaevsky saying he was now a &quot;national Communist and convinced Stalinist&quot;:

Rodzaevsky personally begged Stalin for forgiveness, referring to himself as &quot;your unworthy slave&quot;. In response, the Soviets offered him an amnesty and a job as a journalist in one of their newspapers. Rodzaevsky returned, only to be arrested upon arrival (along with fellow party-member Lev Okhotin). The trial, which began on August 26, 1946, was widely covered in the Soviet press. It was opened by the chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, Vasily Ulrikh. Rodzaevsky and other leaders of the RFP were charged with anti-Soviet agitation, creation of the Russian Fascist Party and distributing anti-Soviet propaganda among White army exiles and creation of similar anti-Soviet organizations in China, Europe and the United States. In addition, according to the verdict, he was involved in preparing an attack on the Soviet Union, together with a number of Japanese generals, as well as personally organizing spies and terrorist groups against the Soviet Union with the cooperation of German and Japanese intelligence. All of the defendants pleaded guilty.

Rodzaevsky was sentenced to death. Also sentenced to various punishments were Grigory Semyonov, Lev Fillipovich Vasilevsky, Aleksei Proklovich Baksheev, Lev Okhotin, Ukhtomsky and others. Rodzaevsky was executed in a Lubyanka prison cellar on 30 August 1946.

In 2001, Rodzaevsky&#x27;s final book, &quot;The Last Will of a Russian Fascist&quot; (&quot;Zaveshchanie russkogo fashista&quot;), was published in Russia. On 11 October 2010, due to a decision by the Central District Court of Krasnoyarsk, the book became recognized in Russia as extremist material, and has been included in the Federal List of Extremist Materials (No. 861).

<doc id="966614" wikidata="Q1342505" url="?curid=966614" title="Pearls Before Swine (band)">
<text>Pearls Before Swine was an American  folk rock band formed by Tom Rapp in 1965 in Eau Gallie, which is now part of Melbourne, Florida. They released six albums between 1967 and 1971, before Rapp launched a solo career.

==Early years, 1965–68==
With high school friends Wayne Harley (banjo, mandolin), Lane Lederer (bass, guitar) and Roger Crissinger (piano, organ), Rapp wrote and recorded some songs which, inspired by the Fugs, they sent to the avant-garde ESP-Disk label in New York. The group took its name from a Bible passage: &quot;Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine ...&quot; (Mat. 7:6, KJV), meaning: do not give things of value to those who will not understand or appreciate them. They were quickly signed, and recorded &quot;One Nation Underground&quot; (1967), featuring songs of mysticism, protest, melancholia, and some controversy in the case of &quot;Miss Morse&quot;, which spelled out an obscenity in Morse code. The album eventually sold some 200,000 copies, although management and contractual problems meant that the band received little reward for its success.

Rapp has said that &quot;We never got any money from ESP. Never, not even like a hundred dollars or something. My real sense is that he (Bernard Stollman) was abducted by aliens, and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was&quot;.

The strongly anti-war-themed &quot;Balaklava&quot; (1968) followed, inspired by the Charge of the Light Brigade. Rapp has said &quot;The first two albums are probably considered the druggiest, and I had never done any drugs at that point. I smoked Winston cigarettes at that time, so these are all Winston-induced hallucinations.&quot; The album covers featured paintings by Bosch and Brueghel, while the records themselves included interpretations of the writings of Tolkien and Herodotus as well as archive recordings from the 1890s, with innovatively arranged songs using an eclectic variety of instruments.

==Reprise period, 1969–72==

The band signed with Reprise Records in 1969, although by this time the other original members had left and the band name now referred to Rapp and whichever musicians he was recording or touring with, one of whom, Jim Fairs, was previously a member of The Cryan&#x27; Shames. The five albums on Reprise were generally more conventional in sound, but contained a unique blend of humanistic and mystical songs, with some whimsical touches. Some were recorded in New York and others – particularly &quot;The Use of Ashes&quot; and &quot;City of Gold&quot;in Nashville with top session musicians including Charlie McCoy, Kenny Buttrey, and other members of Area Code 615. Several also featured Rapp&#x27;s then-wife Elisabeth on vocals. The oddly upbeat &quot;The Man&quot;, from &quot;City of Gold&quot;, was sung by David Noyes and recorded at A&amp;R Studios in New York City during the summer of 1970. Noyes&#x27; friend Jon Tooker took his position when the band toured Europe that fall.

In his teens, Rapp lived close to Cape Canaveral and watched the rockets take off. The song &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, on the album &quot;The Use of Ashes&quot;written the day Neil Armstrong landed on the moonwas credited by Bernie Taupin with inspiring his hit song with Elton John of the same title: &quot;We didn&#x27;t steal that one from Bowie, we stole it from another guy, called Tom Rapp...&quot; Many of the other songs of this period reflected Rapp&#x27;s interests in mysticism, his relationship with his alcoholic father, and his experiences of living for a time in (and marrying a native of) the Netherlands. &quot;Rocket Man&quot; was based on a story by Ray Bradbury.

In 1971, Pearls Before Swine toured for the first time, the group then comprising Rapp, Mike Krawitz (piano), Gordon Hayes (bass) and Jon Tooker (guitar). Around this time, Rapp often referred onstage, not quite seriously, to the group as &quot;the house band for the SDS.&quot; A live album from this period, &quot;Live Pearls&quot;, recorded at Yale University, was released as a download in December 2008. The final Reprise album, &quot;Familiar Songs&quot;, consisted of newly conceived, arranged, and produced recordings of some of Rapp&#x27;s earlier songs, along with a few new and unreleased, featuring his then-current band, Morrie Brown (bass, guitar, mandolin and vocals), Robby Merkin (piano, organ, synth, bass and vocals), and David Wolfert (acoustic and electric guitar, 12-string, Dobro and vocals) along with drummer Billy Mundi, formerly of The Mothers Of Invention. Without Rapp&#x27;s knowledge, the label released it not as a Pearls Before Swine album, but under his name alone.

==Later years==
Two further albums followed, released under Rapp&#x27;s own name on Blue Thumb Records. The first, &quot;Stardancer&quot;, was again recorded in Nashville, followed by &quot;Sunforest&quot;. The bandby that time comprising Rapp, Art Ellis (flute), Bill Rollins (bass, cello) and Harry Orlove (guitar, banjo)toured until 1974, with Rapp from then performing solo until a final appearance in 1976 supporting Patti Smith.

After this, Rapp retired from music and, after graduating from Brandeis University, became a civil rights lawyer. After being contacted by the magazine &quot;Ptolemaic Terrascope&quot;, he re-appeared in 1997 at Terrastock, a music festival in Providence, Rhode Island, with his son&#x27;s band, Shy Camp, and began recording again with 1999&#x27;s &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;.

Tom Rapp appears on the Neil Young 2-CD tribute &quot;This Note&#x27;s For You Too&quot; with the song &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; on Inbetweens Records.

Original member Roger Crissinger left the group in 1968, joining San Francisco band One (1) led by Reality D. Blipcrotch. Lane Lederer is now a member of the Florida Orchestra.

Bass guitarist Morrie Brown became a record producer in R&amp;B music. He was responsible for mentoring up-and-coming songwriters and producers Paul Laurence and Kashif. Brown collaborated with Kashif and Laurence on creating hit singles for B.T. Express and Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King. Brown produced King&#x27;s biggest hits&quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, &quot;Love Come Down&quot; and &quot;Betcha She Don&#x27;t Love You&quot;as well as Howard Johnson&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;So Fine&quot;. Since 1992, Brown has been the owner and founder of the printing software company PrintPoint.

Guitarist David Wolfert also became a record producer, as well as session musician. Wolfert worked on albums by Barbra Streisand, Don Covay, and the Four Tops, where he would produce the song &quot;I Believe in You and Me&quot; which would later be covered by Whitney Houston. Wolfert also produced the solo debut &quot;Out of Control&quot; for Kiss drummer Peter Criss. In recent years, Wolfert composed the music for the English language version of the anime &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

Jon Tooker died in a motorcycle crash in 2008. Art Ellis died on November 2, 2017. Tom Rapp died on February 11, 2018, after suffering from pelvic cancer.

Pearls Before Swine have been cited as a key influence by various musicians including The Dream Academy,Edgar Broughton, Damon and Naomi, the Bevis Frond, This Mortal Coil, and the Japanese band Ghost. Three tribute albums have been released by Secret Eye Records.

<doc id="966619" wikidata="Q451969" url="?curid=966619" title="Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth">
<text>Anne Isabella Noel Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth (née King, later King-Noel; 22 September 1837 – 15 December 1917), known for most of her life as Lady Anne Blunt, along with her husband the poet Wilfrid Blunt, was co-founder of the Crabbet Arabian Stud in England and the Sheykh Obeyd estate near Cairo. The two married on 8 June 1869. From the late 1870s, Wilfrid and Lady Anne travelled extensively in Arabia and the Middle East, buying Arabian horses from Bedouin princes such as Emir Fendi Al-Fayez and the Egyptian Ali Pasha Sherif. Among the great and influential horses they took to England were Azrek, Dajania, Queen of Sheba, Rodania and the famous Ali Pasha Sherif stallion Mesaoud. To this day, the vast majority of purebred Arabian horses trace their lineage to at least one Crabbet ancestor.

== Life and work ==
Lady Anne was a daughter of William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace, and the Hon. Augusta Ada Byron, the world&#x27;s first computer programmer. Her maternal grandparents were the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella &quot;Annabella&quot; Noel-Byron, 12th Baroness Wentworth (née Milbanke). In childhood, she was known as Annabella, after the grandmother for whom she was named.

Lady Anne was fluent in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, a skilled violinist and a gifted artist who studied drawing with John Ruskin. She also had a lifelong love of horses, dating from childhood, and was an accomplished equestrienne. Her interest in the Arabian horse, combined with Wilfrid&#x27;s interest in Middle Eastern politics, led to their mutual interest in saving the Arabian breed and thus their many journeys.

Lady Anne travelled extensively in the Middle East and is particularly noted as the first European woman to ride through the Arabian desert to reach the city of Ha&#x27;il.
The books &quot;Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates&quot; and &quot;A Pilgrimage to Nejd&quot; are attributed to her and were based on her journals, but were extensively edited by her husband. Her own voice comes through more clearly in her published journals.

She owned a violin made by Stradivarius, since known as the Lady Blunt Stradivarius, though she was not the original owner. It was extensively refurbished in 1864 by Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, from whom she purchased the instrument upon recommendation of her instructor, Leopold Jansa. She possessed the instrument for 30 years, selling it in 1895.

Lady Anne&#x27;s 1869 marriage to Blunt was not a happy one. Her many pregnancies produced a single surviving child, Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth. Anne never ceased to grieve over her miscarriages and the babies who died soon after birth. Although a fond father to Judith when she was a child, Blunt made no secret that he would have preferred a son.

Lady Anne and Wilfrid differed over management of their horses, with Wilfrid, though the less talented horseman, often prevailing on management decisions. At times, this meant leaving valuable bloodstock in Egypt under the care of inept managers who neglected the horses to the point that some died of exposure and thirst. In England, his theory that Arabian horses should live under &quot;desert conditions&quot;, even in a cold, damp climate, often meant the animals lived with insufficient fodder and were exposed to the elements to an unnecessary degree.

Blunt also had many mistresses, often simultaneously. However, in 1906, when his mistress Dorothy Carleton (later adopted as his niece) moved into their home, Lady Anne, unable to tolerate what she termed an &quot;oriental&quot; lifestyle, left him. The Blunts agreed to a formal separation and the Stud was divided. Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid. Under its terms, Lady Anne kept Crabbet Park and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Following the separation, Lady Anne spent several months each year at her Sheykh Obeyd estate near Cairo, a 32-acre (129,000 m2) apricot orchard the Blunts had purchased in 1882 and set up as a breeding farm for the horses they owned in Egypt. Her daughter Judith lived full-time at the Crabbet estate with her own husband and children. Finally, leaving the stud under the management of Judith, Lady Anne left England permanently in October 1915 and spent the remaining years of her life at Sheykh Obeyd. 

== Legacy ==
Shortly before her death in 1917, Lady Anne inherited the Wentworth title after her niece, Ada King-Milbanke, 14th Baroness Wentworth, died childless. Wilfrid, always short of money, made a number of attempts to get Lady Anne to sign control or ownership of her portion of Crabbet to him, going so far at one point as to alienate Judith and her mother to the point that Lady Anne disinherited Judith (though she wisely chose not to favour Wilfrid). Following Lady Anne&#x27;s death in 1917, the Wentworth title passed to Judith, who by that time owned some horses and property in her own right, and Lady Anne bequeathed her remaining portion of Crabbet to Judith&#x27;s daughters, appointing a trustee to oversee the estate.

Wilfrid and Judith disputed Lady Anne&#x27;s estate and the ownership of many horses. The bitter battle went to court, where a verdict in favour of Judith&#x27;s children was rendered in 1920, invalidating the deed of partition and reunifying most of the stud. Wilfrid died in 1922, having verbally reconciled with Judith but without rewriting his will to grant her any inheritance of his remaining property. Over time, Judith had managed to buy out her daughters&#x27; shares of Crabbet and Newbuidings from the trustee, buy back many of the horses Wilfrid had sold to third parties, and the Crabbet stud continued under Judith&#x27;s management.

Under Judith, her management and breeding decisions improved upon the &quot;desert conditions&quot; theories of Wilfrid. Her addition of non-desertbred Arabian stock, such as the Polish-bred Arabian stallion Skowronek, created controversy, but the stud survived and prospered for almost fifty years until 1971, when the property itself was bisected by a motorway. Judith sold Crabbet horses all over the world, including to Dora Maclean in Australia and others in the United States, Spain and Russia. She sold some horses bred from the Blunt lines back to Egypt, where they have a legacy today. Modern studs known for Crabbet breeding include Al-Marah in America and &quot;Fenwick&quot; in Australia, which can both trace their bloodlines to large-scale importations of horses bred at Crabbet.

Today, due to the worldwide dispersal of Crabbet stock over its near-century of existence, most modern Arabian horses contain lines to Crabbet breeding, regardless of their nation of birth. Over 90% of all Arabians registered in the United States, for example, contain one or more lines to the Crabbet Park Stud. Some &quot;Crabbet&quot; breeders consider themselves preservationists, maintaining a small pool of pure or high-percentage Crabbet horses, while others use these lines as an outcross on other strains. In either situation, Crabbet-bred Arabian horses have a reputation for athleticism and classic type, good temperament, performance ability and soundness.

The Lady Blunt Stradivarius is now considered one of the best-preserved Stradivarius violins in the world. It was sold at auction in Japan in 2011 for a world record high of £9.8 million (US$15.9 million). It was previously sold for £84,500 (US$200,000), also a record at the time, in 1971.

<text>Grandmama is a fictional character in the &quot;Addams Family&quot; television and film series. First appearing in the works of cartoonist Charles Addams, she is a supporting character in the film, television, and stage adaptations.

==Character background==
Grandmama Addams is an aged witch who concocts potions and spells, and dabbles in fortune telling and knife throwing. She is the grandmother of the Addams children, Pugsley and Wednesday, although her relationship to the other family members is less consistent. Grandmama first appeared along with the then-unnamed Addams family in Charles Addams&#x27; original cartoons published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in which she was regularly illustrated with shoulder-length frizzy hair and a fringed shawl.

===Grandmama and Granny Frump===
When asked to name his characters for the then upcoming 1964 TV adaptation, Charles Addams, creator of the original &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cartoon strips, first named the household&#x27;s grandmother as Granny Frump and described her as Gomez&#x27;s mother, thus making her Morticia&#x27;s mother-in-law and Wednesday and Pugsley&#x27;s paternal grandmother. But when the show was being made, the characters were instead given the surname of Addams after their creator, yet Grandmama remains Gomez&#x27;s mother and &quot;Frump&quot; became Morticia&#x27;s maiden name instead. A different Granny Frump appears in three episodes of the show, Grandmama&#x27;s best friend Hester Frump and the mother of sisters Morticia Addams and Ophelia Frump (Hester is, probably, Fester&#x27;s sister too). These versions of the characters were also used in the TV movie &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;.

However, due to Charles Addams originally naming the character Granny Frump, both the feature films and animated television series had retconned her as being Morticia&#x27;s mother and Wednesday and Pugsley&#x27;s maternal grandmother instead. In the first film, Morticia and Fester discuss how &quot;Mother and Father Addams&quot; were killed by an angry mob. In the third film, Grandmama is named Esmeralda and is again Morticia&#x27;s mother. The character is simply referred to as Granny Frump in the two animated series. In the 1992 series, Grandmama is of Morticia&#x27;s side of the family, when she introduces herself with the line &quot;the name&#x27;s Granny Frump&quot;.

In the 1998-99 television series &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, Grandmama is again Gomez&#x27;s mother and, for the first time, Fester&#x27;s mother. A separate Granny Frump also appears, once again as Morticia and Ophelia&#x27;s mother. Here, Grandmama&#x27;s full name is Eudora Addams, while Morticia&#x27;s mother was renamed Griselda Frump.

In the Broadway musical &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Morticia refers to Grandmama as Gomez and Uncle Fester&#x27;s mother, to which Gomez reacts with surprise and says that he thought she was Morticia&#x27;s mother. Morticia later says that Grandmama &quot;may not even be part of this family&quot;.

In the animated film and its sequel, she is again Gomez and Fester&#x27;s mother while Granny Frump is long dead.
==Appearances==
===Television and film===
* The character was named &quot;Grandmama&quot; for the 1960s television series in order to avoid confusion with Granny from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. She was played by Blossom Rock, who won the role over actresses such as Minerva Urecal and Marjorie Bennett, while Alice Pearce had been rejected after the producers deemed her too young for the part. She is depicted as being good friends with Morticia&#x27;s mother Granny Frump (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton) who is also the mother of Morticia&#x27;s sister Ophelia.
* Granny Frump appears in &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; episode &quot;Wednesday is Missing&quot; voiced by Janet Waldo.
* Janet Waldo also voiced Granny Frump in the 1973 animated series.
* Due to illness, Rock was the one regular cast member from the show who did not return for the 1977 reunion film &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;, and she was replaced as Grandmama by Jane Rose. Granny Frump was also present helping with the Addams Family&#x27;s Halloween party where she was portrayed by Elvia Allman.
* Carol Channing provided Granny Frump&#x27;s voice for the 1992 animated series. In this show, she is shown to run a psychic hotline.
* Three different actresses played Granny in the three &quot;Addams Family&quot; feature films. Judith Malina, who played her in the 1991 film &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, was ostracized by others working on the movie after making an anti-war joke about burning the American flag, and was replaced by Carol Kane for the 1993 sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. For the 1998 direct-to-video picture &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;, Granny Frump was played by Alice Ghostley.
* Grandmama was played by Betty Phillips in the 1998-99 television series &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;. Like the original series, Grandmama is good friends with Granny Frump (portrayed by Meredith Bain Woodward).
* Bette Midler voiced the character in the 2019 animated film. She is shown to be Gomez&#x27;s and Fester&#x27;s mother. When she arrives at the Addams Family house before the Saber Mazurka following her robbery in Spain, she treats Pugsley to the candy that is on her feet. At one point, Grandmama called Lurch by the name of &quot;Fabio&quot;. Grandmama is also revealed to have a dwarfish sister named Sloom (voiced by Jenifer Lewis) who oversees Pugsley&#x27;s Saber Mazurka and had an argument with her which Grandmama claimed that she won.
** Granny Frump is also in the film voiced by Catherine O&#x27;Hara. She and her husband Grandpa Frump (voiced by Martin Short) are long dead and Morticia holds a séance in the family cemetery to speak to them. It is also shown at the beginning of the film that Morticia possesses urns containing their ashes. When Morticia brings up Wednesday&#x27;s friendship with Parker Needler, Granny and Grandpa Frump offer their advice to her and also bring up the time when Morticia ran away to join the girl scouts and learned that they roasted marshmallows and not girl scouts. At one point, Grandpa Frump forgot when he died to which Granny Frump stated that he died 20 years ago.
* Grandmama Addams appears in &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot; voiced again by Bette Midler. While most of the Addams Family went on a cross-country road trip, Grandmama kept an eye on the house and threw a house party. When it got out of control, Grandmama called Cousin Itt to help get it back under control. By the time the Addams Family returned to their house, Grandmama and Cousin Itt had restored the house back to what it was before the party.

===In other media===
* In the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Fester&#x27;s Quest&quot;, the instruction booklet says Grandmama&#x27;s psychic powers foretold the alien invasion that would come and abduct all the people in the city, so she invokes a curse on the family mansion. As a result, when extraterrestrial scouts scan the Addams residence for life forms they find none, thanks to Grandmama&#x27;s curse.
* Grandmama was played by Jackie Hoffman in the 2010 Broadway musical, in which her relation to the family in the storyline is ambiguous. In Act Two, Morticia tells Gomez that &quot;[his] mother came to our home and now she&#x27;s here forever&quot; to which he replies &quot;wait, I thought she was your mother&quot;, referencing Grandmama&#x27;s ever changing relation to the family in the franchise. Morticia later says that Grandmama &quot;may not even be part of this family&quot;.

<doc id="966626" wikidata="Q5150813" url="?curid=966626" title="Combination printing">
<text>Combination printing is a photographic technique of using the negatives of two or more images in conjunction with one another to create a single image.

Similar to dual-negative landscape photography, combination printing was technically much more complex. The concept of combination printing stemmed from the desire to create more of a fine art within photography and often more idealized images.

Combination printing was popular in the mid-19th century due to the limitations of the negative&#x27;s light sensitivity and camera technology. For example, the long exposures required at the time to create an image would properly expose the main subject, such as a building, but would completely overexpose the sky. The sky would then lack detail, usually appearing as solid white. Hippolyte Bayard, a French photographer, was the first to suggest combining two separate negatives, one of the subject matter and one of a properly exposed negative of clouds, to create a balanced photograph.

The technique was also used to create new, original compositions and provided new ways for photographers to be more creative with their work.

Later on, the technique paved the way for yet another artistic process, photomontage.

== Process ==
Combination printing uses two or more negatives to make one print.

Combination printing required a lot of careful work to plan out the concept of what the final image was desired to look like. It was also a task of great skill and patience. When a photographer wished to create a combination print, issues of good exposures, scaling the subjects to match up, and consistent lighting were all essentials if they aimed to make it look as realistic as possible.

For instance, in the example of combining a foreground subject with adding clouds to a sky, it is important to make sure that the direction of the light falling on the clouds is the same as the light used on the main subject in the original foreground negative.

In actually exposing the negatives to combine them, the photographer must control the exposure of the portion of the initial photo that they will be adding to or replacing. Therefore, for adding clouds into the sky, the photographer would have to hold back light from the sky area and expose the foreground area. Then, when printing the negative of the clouds, do the opposite and only expose the cloud and sky portion of the photo. After this, they would be able to combine the two negatives by blending them together.

==History==
Photographers such as William Frederick Lake Price and Oscar Rejlander are famous for using combination printing.

Starting as early as the mid-19th century, new methods such as the combination printing, began to change the way people looked at different photographic techniques.

Controversy broke out in the photographic community about the use of combination printing. Photographs originally had been regarded as truth and it was perceived that the camera never lied. However, with the newfound ability to manipulate the final product, the notion that photographs depicted &quot;truth&quot; was soon shattered.

Henry Peach Robinson, considered to be another one of the pioneers of combination printing, was not only an artist, but also an author, and wrote many journal articles on photography. He then published a book in 1869 entitled &quot;Pictorial Effect in Photography&quot;. His writings about technique became fairly well known and he was held in high esteem, despite having critics who accused him of misrepresenting the real world and the truth by using the combination printing method.

In his book, Robinson attempts to add some reasoning to appease the critics, by comparing the photograph editing to other art forms and writing that, &quot;As music is only sound under governance of certain laws, so is pictorial effect only the combination of certain forms and lights and shadows in like manner harmoniously brought together.&quot;
He agrees about the argument of staying true to nature in photographs, but alternatively writes that when a photographer obtains a foreground subject, they need the perfect background to create the &quot;harmony&quot; of a good photo, and &quot;if nature does not supply such object, the pictorial requirement may often, without violating material truth, be furnished by art.&quot;

In pointing this out, he is saying that it is often necessary to add artistic techniques to photographs.

Discussing the benefits of composition in the art of photography and using combination printing, Robinson wrote, in &quot;Pictorial Effect in Photography&quot;, that the method of combination served to &quot;produce an agreeable presentation of forms and tones, to tell the story which is to be elucidated, and to embody the spirit of what it is intended the picture shall represent or suggest.&quot;

His writings show his knowledge and his passion for creating new content in his photos with using this process.

During the Victorian Era, another proponent of the technique of combination printing was Queen Victoria herself. At the time, artists tried to represent ideal images from natural scenes to portraits. Photographers wished to do the same through creating perfected images after combining them. Queen Victoria was said to have belief in the power that photography could have to visually translate and promote ideals yet still be reality.

== Early examples==

One of the earliest and most famous combination prints is Oscar Rejlander&#x27;s &quot;Two Ways of Life&quot;. The print was created in 1857. It was first exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition and it is considered one of the most distinguished examples of the technique. It used a combination of 32 negatives to create the complete image of the final product. The process took about six weeks.

Other examples of the technique can be seen in Henry Peach Robinson&#x27;s works. In one of his pieces, entitled &quot;Autumn&quot; there is a darker foreground subject with some hazy distance created with trees visible in the far background. The piece includes several human subjects, some facing the camera with light hitting them, and one darker and facing away from view.

This was an albumen print photo that he put together in 1863. When explaining the print, Robinson discussed that he initially sketched out the scene that he hoped to produce, trying different various samples of what he could do with putting the scenery and figures together. Only after he was happy with his sketched out plan would he finally shoot the individual photos and then eventually combine the negatives in printing.

Sometimes called Robinson&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece,&quot; his photograph, &quot;Fading Away&quot;, was a combination print that he generated in 1858. It took him around five negatives to create the final image. The photo shows a death of a young girl and her grieving family surrounding her. The subject was made up by Robinson and the figures were only posing, but the scene with the girl being centered and bright and the figure turned away, behind in the darkness, created an emotional exhibit.

== Modern applications==
In more modern times of photography, there exists a theory, presented by Jerry Uelsmann in 1965 to The Society for Photographic Education, called Post-Visualization, that can be connected back to the creation of combination printing.

Post-Visualization was the idea that photographers can rethink what they are creating and manipulate images in the darkroom after photographing their subjects. This allows photographers additional ways to express themselves instead of just following the common belief that photography is a simply mechanical, straightforward process with no creative elements. Combination printing remained a great way of working with changing images to add that creativity.

<text>Francis Marion Crawford (August 2, 1854 – April 9, 1909) was an American writer noted for his many novels, especially those set in Italy, and for his classic weird and fantastical stories.

==Early life==
Crawford was born in Bagni di Lucca, in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, on August 2, 1854. He was the only son of the American sculptor Thomas Crawford and Louisa Cutler Ward. His sister was the writer Mary Crawford Fraser (&quot;aka&quot; Mrs. Hugh Fraser), and he was the nephew of Julia Ward Howe, the American poet. After his father&#x27;s death in 1857, his mother remarried to Luther Terry, with whom she had Crawford&#x27;s half-sister, Margaret Ward Terry, who later became the wife of Winthrop Astor Chanler.

He studied successively at St Paul&#x27;s School, Concord, New Hampshire; Cambridge University; University of Heidelberg; and the University of Rome.

In 1879, he went to India, where he studied Sanskrit and edited in Allahabad &quot;The Indian Herald&quot;. Returning to America in February 1881, he continued to study Sanskrit at Harvard University for a year and for two years contributed to various periodicals, mainly &quot;The Critic&quot;. Early in 1882, he established his lifelong close friendship with Isabella Stewart Gardner.

During this period he lived most of the time in Boston at his aunt Julia Ward Howe&#x27;s house and in the company of his uncle, Sam Ward. His family was concerned about his financial prospects. His mother had hoped he could train in Boston for a career as an operatic baritone based on his private renditions of Schubert lieder. In January 1882, George Henschel, conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, assessed his prospects and determined Crawford would &quot;never be able to sing in perfect tune&quot;. His uncle Sam Ward suggested he try writing about his years in India and helped him develop contacts with New York publishers.

==Career==

In December 1882, he produced his first novel, &quot;Mr Isaacs,&quot; a sketch of modern Anglo-Indian life mingled with a touch of Oriental mystery. It had an immediate success, and &quot;Dr Claudius&quot; (1883) followed promptly. In May 1883, he returned to Italy, where he made his permanent home. He lived at the historic Hotel Cocumella in Sorrento during 1885 and settled permanently in Sant&#x27;Agnello, where in the fall he bought the Villa Renzi that became Villa Crawford. More than half his novels are set in Italy. He wrote three long historical studies of Italy and was well advanced with a history of Rome in the Middle Ages when he died. This may explain why Marion Crawford&#x27;s books stand apart from any distinctively American current in literature.

Year by year Crawford published a number of successful novels. However his 1896 novel &quot;Adam Johnstone&#x27;s Son&quot; was thought by the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing to be &quot;rubbish&quot;. Late in the 1890s, Crawford began to write his historical works. These are: &quot;Ave Roma Immortalis&quot; (1898), &quot;Rulers of the South&quot; (1900) renamed &quot;Southern Italy and Sicily and The Rulers of the South&quot; in 1905 for the American market, and &quot;Gleanings from Venetian History&quot; (1905) with the American title &quot;Salvae Venetia&quot;, reissued in 1909 as &quot;Venice; the Place and the People&quot;. In these, his intimate knowledge of local Italian history combines with the romanticist&#x27;s imaginative faculty to excellent effect. His shorter book &quot;Constantinople&quot; (1895) belongs to this category.

After most of his fictional works had been published, most came to think he was a gifted narrator; and his books of fiction, full of historic vitality and dramatic characterization, became widely popular among readers to whom the realism of problems or the eccentricities of subjective analysis were repellent. In &quot;The Novel: What It Is&quot; (1893), he defended his literary approach, self-conceived as a combination of romanticism and realism, defining the art form in terms of its marketplace and audience. The novel, he wrote, is &quot;a marketable commodity&quot; and &quot;intellectual artistic luxury&quot; (8, 9) that &quot;must amuse, indeed, but should amuse reasonably, from an intellectual point of view. . . . Its intention is to amuse and please, and certainly not to teach and preach; but in order to amuse well it must be a finely-balanced creation. . . .&quot; (82).

The Saracinesca series is perhaps known to be his best work, with the third in the series, &quot;Don Orsino&quot; (1892) set against the background of a real estate bubble, told with effective concision. The second volume is &quot;Sant&#x27; Ilario&quot; [Hilary] (1889). A fourth book in the series, &quot;Corleone&quot; (1897), was the first major treatment of the Mafia in literature, and used the now-familiar but then-original device of a priest unable to testify to a crime because of the Seal of the Confessional; the novel is not one of his major works, having failed to live up to the standard set by the books earlier in the series. Crawford ended &quot;Rulers of the South&quot; (1900) with a chapter about the Sicilian Mafia.

Crawford himself was fondest of &quot;&quot; (1891), a story of a genie (&quot;genius&quot; is Crawford&#x27;s word) who becomes human, which was reprinted (1971) in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series of the early 1970s. &quot;A Cigarette-Maker&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1890) was dramatized, and had considerable popularity on the stage as well as in its novel form; and in 1902 an original play from his pen, &quot;Francesca da Rimini,&quot; was produced in Paris by his friend Sarah Bernhardt. Crawford&#x27;s best known dramatization was that of &quot;The White Sister&quot; (1909). Its main actress was Viola Allen, whose first film was the 1915 film of this novel; it was filmed again in 1923 and 1933. &quot;In the Palace of the King&quot; (1900) was filmed in 1915 and 1923; &quot;Mr. Isaacs&quot; (1882) was filmed in 1931 as &quot;Son of India&quot;.

Several of his short stories, such as &quot;The Upper Berth&quot; (1886; written in 1885), &quot;For the Blood Is the Life&quot; (1905, a vampiress tale), &quot;The Dead Smile&quot; (1899), and &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; (1908), are often-anthologized classics of the horror genre. An essay on Crawford&#x27;s weird tales can be found in S. T. Joshi&#x27;s &quot;The Evolution of the Weird Tale&quot; (2004); there are many other essays and introductions. The collected weird stories were posthumously published in 1911 as &quot;Wandering Ghosts&quot; in the U.S. and as &quot;Uncanny Tales&quot; in the UK, both without the long-forgotten &quot;The King&#x27;s Messenger&quot; (1907). The present definitive edition is that edited by Richard Dalby as &quot;Uncanny Tales&quot; and published by the Tartarus Press (1997; 2008). Crawford&#x27;s novella &quot;Man Overboard!&quot; (1903) is often overlooked, but belongs with his supernatural works.

In 1901, the American Macmillan firm began a deluxe uniform edition of his novels, as reprintings required. In 1904 the P. F. Collier Co. (N. Y.) was authorized to publish a 25-volume edition, later increased to 32 volumes. Around 1914 the subscription firm McKinlay, Stone, Mackenzie was authorized to publish an edition using the Macmillan binding decorations. In 1919 the American Macmillan firm published the &quot;Sorrento Edition&quot;. They also had issued some first American editions and reprints in a uniform binding from 1891 through 1899. The British Macmillan firm used two separate uniform bindings from 1889 until after 1910.

Crawford wrote numerous articles for major periodicals and a few contributions to books. See the section &quot;Bibliographical History&quot; in &quot;An F. Marion Crawford Companion&quot; (1981) by John C. Moran.

==Personal life==
In 1880, Crawford converted to Roman Catholicism. In October 1884 he married Elizabeth Berdan, the daughter of the American Civil War Union General Hiram Berdan. They had two sons and two daughters, Eleanor, Harold, Clara and Bertram.

Crawford died at Sorrento on Good Friday 1909 at Villa Crawford of a heart attack. It was the result of a severe lung injury ten years previous, caused by inhalation of toxic gases at a glass-smelting works in Colorado, which happened during his American lecture tour in the winter of 1897–1898. He was gathering technical information for his historical novel &quot;Marietta&quot; (1901), that describes glass-making in late medieval Venice. After his death, his widow sued for breach of contract related to the production of Crawford&#x27;s novels into a film.

===Legacy and influence===
In his 1929 article &quot;Some Remarks on Ghost Stories&quot; M. R. James praised Crawford&#x27;s supernatural fiction. James stated that &quot;Marion Crawford and his horrid story of &#x27;The Upper Berth&#x27;, which (with &#x27;The Screaming Skull&#x27; some distance behind) is the best in his collection of &quot;Uncanny Tales&quot;, and stands high among ghost stories in general.&quot; H. Russell Wakefield, in an essay on ghost stories, called Crawford&#x27;s &quot;The Upper Berth&quot; &quot;the very best one&quot; of such stories. Norman Douglas credits Crawford&#x27;s financial success as instrumental in encouraging himself to write (though he remained critical of Crawford&#x27;s habit of inserting first-person editorial comments into his fiction).

The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society was founded in 1975 and published the literary review &quot;The Romantist&quot; from 1977 until 1997.
In 1997 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford was founded at Sant&#x27;Agnello di Sorrento. It is formally associated with the FMC Memorial Society and continues &quot;The Romantist&quot; in its annual review &quot;Genius Loci&quot; (1997–).

In early May 1988 at Sant&#x27;Agnello, a Conference was held to commemorate Crawford. It was organized by the Comune di Sant&#x27; Agnello di Sorrento and the Istituto Universitario Orientale (Naples). Its &quot;Acta&quot; were published in English and Italian as &quot;Il Magnifico Crawford. Scrittore per Mestiere&quot; / &quot;The Magnificent Crawford. Writer by Trade&quot; (1990), edited by Gordon Poole. In mid-May 2009 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford and the Comune di Sant&#x27; Agnello organized another Conference – &quot;Francis Marion Crawford; 100 Anni Dopo&quot; – to remember Crawford on the centenary of his death. Its &quot;Acta&quot; were published in Italian and English as &quot;Nuova Luce Su Francis Marion Crawford. Cento Anni Dopo 2009-1909&quot; / &quot;A Hundred Years Later: New Light on Francis Marion Crawford&quot; early in 2011, edited by Gordon Poole. The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society collaborated in the organization of both Conferences.

There is a major street in the Italian town of Sant&#x27;Agnello di Sorrento (the town where he died) named after him, the &quot;Corso Marion Crawford&quot;. There is a historical marker on the house where Crawford was born, in Bagni di Lucca. Villa Crawford was donated many years ago by Crawford&#x27;s daughters Lady Eleanor Rocca-Crawford and Mother Clare Marion-Crawford to the Salesian Sisters, who operate it today as a high school for girls.

In San Nicola Arcella, in the province of Cosenza, the Saracen tower where Francis Marion Crawford stayed in the summer is remembered as Torre Crawford. In 2020, the writer Andrea Carlo Cappi with Matteo Fazzolari and Cosimo Gentile, created the literary prize for short story &quot;Torre Crawford&quot;, whose annual theme is taken from a short story by Francis Marion Crawford (the theme of the first edition was &quot;For the blood is the life &quot;).

<doc id="966629" wikidata="Q978649" url="?curid=966629" title="Greg Berlanti">
<text>Gregory Berlanti (born May 24, 1972) is an American screenwriter, producer and director. He is known for his work on the television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Everwood&quot;, &quot;Political Animals&quot;, &quot;Riverdale&quot;, &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; and &quot;You&quot;, in addition to his contributions to DC Comics on film and television productions, including The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse, as well as &quot;Titans&quot; and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;. In 2000, Berlanti founded the production company Berlanti Productions.

In the 2017–2018 television season, Berlanti tied Jerry Bruckheimer&#x27;s 2005–2006 record in having 10 different live-action scripted television series airing on various networks and digital platforms and took sole possession of the record, with 14 airing in the 2018–19 television season, having signed the most expensive producer deal at that time (June 2018) with Warner Bros. In the 2019–20 television season, with one cancellation and two new series, Berlanti increased the record to 18. Berlanti also directed the 2018 film &quot;Love, Simon&quot;, a gay romantic comedy-drama which grossed $66million worldwide.

Berlanti was named on &quot;Time&quot;″s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2020.

==Career==
In 1998, at the age of 26, Berlanti landed his first writing job on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, where he quickly rose through the producing ranks from staff writer to executive producer. In 2000, when creator and then-showrunner Kevin Williamson decided to step away from the show, 28-year-old Berlanti was promoted to showrunner.

Berlanti has spoken in many interviews about the importance of introducing a gay character into a primetime television show and featuring the first same-sex kiss between two men on U.S. network television on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Speaking with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, he stated, &quot;In the beginning, there was resistance. When we did the Jack kiss on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, everyone was tentative. But I took over the show and that was an important thing to me. If we were going to bring the character out, it seemed silly to me that he couldn&#x27;t kiss.&quot; When asked what he would have done if the network had said no to the kiss, Berlanti added, &quot;I was prepared to quit. I really was.&quot;

Berlanti subsequently created two drama series for Warner Bros: &quot;Everwood&quot; and &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;. He and his business partner Mickey Liddell struck a deal with Warner Bros. in March 2003 via Berlanti/Liddell Productions. By the age of 32, he had also already directed his first feature film, &quot; The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy&quot;, which starred Timothy Olyphant, Zach Braff, Justin Theroux, and Dean Cain. After three years at Warner Bros., he moved to Touchstone Television in 2006 and set up Berlanti Television as his new production company.

In 2006, Berlanti produced and wrote &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; for ABC, which aired for five seasons and featured the first same-sex legal marriage on network television. He replaced Marti Noxon, who departed the show because of creative differences.

In 2007, Berlanti executive-produced &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; for ABC, which aired for two seasons and featured the first recurring transgender character on primetime television.

In 2008, Berlanti created and produced the ABC legal drama &quot;Eli Stone&quot; and, in 2012, the USA miniseries &quot;Political Animals&quot;. At ABC, he produced and worked alongside Jon Harmon Feldman, former &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; showrunner, to create &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot;. In 2011, he shifted from ABC Studios back to its original home at Warner Bros. Television. For NBC, he produced &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot;, an American adaptation of the Spanish television series, which premiered on September 17, 2014, and &quot;Blindspot&quot;, which premiered on September 21, 2015.

Berlanti directed the 2010 film &quot;Life as We Know It&quot;, starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. He produced the film &quot;Pan&quot; for Warner Bros. under his Berlanti Productions banner; the film was released October 9, 2015.

In January 2016, The CW ordered the Berlanti-produced television pilot &quot;Riverdale&quot;, based on the characters from Archie Comics. The pilot was picked up to series in May 2016. &quot;Riverdale&quot; premiered on January 26, 2017, and was renewed for a second season on March 7, 2017. In September 2017, it was reported that a live-action television series based on the comic book &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; was in development for The CW by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions. In December 2017, the project had moved to Netflix, and the first season of &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; was released on October 26, 2018. On December 18, 2018, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.

In February 2015, it was announced that Berlanti and Sera Gamble would develop a series for Showtime based on Caroline Kepnes&#x27;s thriller novel &quot;You&quot;. Two years later, it was announced that the series was purchased by Lifetime and put on fast-track development. &quot;You&quot; premiered on September 9, 2018. On July 26, 2018, ahead of the series premiere, Lifetime announced that the series had been renewed for a second season. On December 3, 2018, it was confirmed that Lifetime had passed on the series and that Netflix picked up the series ahead of the release of the second season. The second season was released on December 26, 2019. On January 14, 2020, Netflix renewed &quot;You&quot; for a third season, which was released on October 15, 2021. In October 2021, ahead of the third season premiere, the series was renewed for a fourth season.

In April 2019, Amazon Studios officially won the film rights to &quot;Red, White &amp; Royal Blue&quot;, to be produced by Berlanti Productions. The project, based on the 2019 novel of the same name by Casey McQuiston, had its world premiere at the BFI IMAX in London on July 22, 2023 and was released on Amazon Prime Video on August 11, 2023.

In May 2021, The CW pilot &quot;All American: Homecoming&quot; was picked up to series to be executive produced by Berlanti in association with creator Nkechi Okoro Carroll, Sarah Schechter, David Madden, and Robbie Rogers. &quot;All American: Homecoming&quot; premiered on The CW in February 2022. The series was renewed for a second season in May 2022, which premiered in October 2022. As of June 2023, the series has been renewed for a third season.

In February 2022, Max put in a series order for &quot;The Girls on the Bus&quot;, previously worked on by Netflix and The CW, to be produced by Berlanti, Amy Chozick, Julie Plec, Rina Mimoun, and Sarah Schechter. It was announced that filming had wrapped on the pilot and production began in October 2022.

In March 2022, Apple TV+ acquired the distribution rights to &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, a film covering the 1960s Space Race. In June 2022, the project&#x27;s original director, Jason Bateman, left the project, and the role was later filled by Berlanti. Filming began later in the year in October, and it was released in July 2024.

More recently, his Berlanti/Schechter Films company had a first-look deal with Netflix.

===DC Comics===
====Film====
Berlanti co-wrote and co-produced the DC Comics film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular character. As the film was neither critically nor financially successful, further planned releases were cancelled.

In May 2016, Berlanti discussed his involvement, as producer and possibly as director, in a &quot;Booster Gold&quot; feature film that was in development. Zack Stentz was signed to the project as screenwriter. It is still in movie limbo.

====Arrowverse====
In January 2012, it was announced that, along with Andrew Kreisberg and Marc Guggenheim, Berlanti would create, write, and produce a series called &quot;Arrow&quot;, based on Green Arrow, for The CW. The series premiered on October 10, 2012, and was picked up to full series in the same month. On July 30, 2013, it was announced at the summer TCA tour that Berlanti, Kreisberg, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns would be introducing Barry Allen in the second season of &quot;Arrow&quot;, with the possibility of the character being spun off to his own series. Actor Grant Gustin was cast and made his debut in episode 8, &quot;The Scientist.&quot; In November 2013, The CW officially ordered a pilot for &quot;The Flash&quot;, and in May 2014, the network picked the project up to series, with a premiere scheduled for autumn of that year.

On February 26, 2015, it was announced that Berlanti, along with Guggenheim and Kreisberg, would write and executive produce a spin-off series featuring The Atom (Brandon Routh), Captain Cold (Wentworth Miller), Martin Stein (Victor Garber), and The White Canary (Caity Lotz), for a potential 2016 premiere. The series was ultimately titled &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, and it followed a ragtag team of heroes and villains as they traveled through time and space on a mission to stop the devious immortal Vandal Savage. The series premiered on January 21, 2016, and was renewed for a second season on March 11, 2016.

====&quot;Supergirl&quot;====
On September 4, 2014, it was reported that Berlanti would executive-produce a re-imagining of the origin of Supergirl, to be written by &quot;The New Normal&quot; and &quot;Chuck&quot; alum Ali Adler. &quot;The Flash&quot; co-creator Johns was also involved with development. On September 19, 2014, it was reported that CBS had made a series commitment to &quot;Supergirl&quot;. It was also announced that Berlanti would co-write the first episode.

After its first season, the show moved from CBS to The CW, bringing all live-action Arrowverse shows together on one network. The show made history in 2018 for featuring the first live-action transgender superhero when Nicole Maines was cast in a main role.

====Other DC shows====
Berlanti worked with Mara Brock Akil and her husband Salim Akil to develop &quot;Black Lightning&quot; which also aired on The CW.

Berlanti also produced &quot;Titans&quot;, starring Brenton Thwaites, with Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, and Sarah Schechter; &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, starring Matt Bomer and Brendan Fraser, with Jeremy Carver, Geoff Johns, and Sarah Schechter; and &quot;Stargirl&quot; starring Brec Bassinger, with Greg Beeman, Melissa Carter, Geoff Johns, Sarah Schechter, and Glen Winter.

In 2017, Berlanti wrote and executive-produced &quot;Freedom Fighters: The Ray&quot; for The CW&#x27;s streaming platform. The show was praised for its depiction of the first openly gay superhero to headline a series.

In 2019, it was announced that Berlanti would be producing shows based on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; for HBO Max. It was also revealed that Berlanti would also serve as a writer on the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; series. Both shows were scrapped in 2023.

Berlanti&#x27;s latest endowment to Northwestern marks the Berlanti Family Foundation&#x27;s largest charitable contribution for a single organization to date.

<text>Shrewsbury Castle is a red sandstone castle in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. It stands on a hill in the neck of the meander of the River Severn on which the town originally developed. The castle, directly above Shrewsbury railway station, is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
A castle was ordered on the site by William I c. 1067 but it was greatly extended under Roger de Montgomery circa 1070 as a base for operations into Wales, an administrative centre and as a defensive fortification for the town, which was otherwise protected by the loop of the river. Town walls, of which little now remains, were later added to the defences, as a response to Welsh raids and radiated out from the castle and surrounded the town; the area known as Town Walls still has a small section of them and a single tower, known as Town Walls Tower, which is in the care of the National Trust. At the start of the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda the castle was held by William Fitz Alan, lord of Oswestry and Clun, on behalf of Matilda. After a short siege in 1138, King Stephen took the castle and had the surviving garrison hung from the battlements.

The castle was briefly held by Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales, in 1215. Parts of the original medieval structure remain largely incorporating the inner bailey of the castle; the outer bailey, which extended into the town, has long ago vanished under the encroachment of later shops and other buildings. Having fallen into decay after c. 1300 (at the end of the Welsh wars) the castle became a domestic residence during the reign of Elizabeth I and passed to the ownership of the town council c.1600. The castle was extensively repaired in 1643 during the Civil War and was briefly besieged by Parliamentary forces from Wem before its surrender. It was acquired by Sir Francis Newport in 1663. Further repairs were carried out by Thomas Telford on behalf of Sir William Pulteney, MP for Shrewsbury, after 1780 to the designs of the architect Robert Adam.

The Shropshire Horticultural Society purchased the castle from a private owner, then Lord Barnard, and gave it to the town in 1924 and it became the location of Shrewsbury&#x27;s Borough Council chambers for over 50 years. The castle was internally restructured to become the home of the Shropshire Regimental Museum when it moved from Copthorne Barracks and other local sites in 1985. The museum was attacked by the IRA on 25 August 1992 and extensive damage to the collection and to some of the Castle resulted. The museum was officially re-opened by Princess Alexandra on 2 May 1995. In 2019 it was rebranded as the Soldiers of Shropshire Museum.

In 2019 and 2020 an archaeology project by Shropshire Council and the University of Chester undertook excavations in the castle. Work in 2019 found the remains of the original ditch surrounding the motte of c.1067, along with a range of medieval pottery and two arrow heads or crossbow-bolt heads. Excavations in 2020 failed to locate St Michael&#x27;s chapel, but did recover evidence of &#x27;high-status feasting&#x27;, including the bones of a pike and possibly a swan.

==Collection==
The museum combines the collections of the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry and the Shropshire Yeomanry. holding items such as a lock of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s hair, the Grand Admiral&#x27;s Baton belonging to Karl Dönitz, and the Victoria Crosses of Captain Alfred Kirke Ffrench, Private Charles Irwin and Sergeant Major Harold Whitfield.

Laura&#x27;s Tower overlooks the surrounding townscape and countryside and is sometimes used as a backdrop for functions and weddings.

<doc id="966636" wikidata="Q7611822" url="?curid=966636" title="Steve Ashton">
<text>Steven John Ashton (born February 29, 1956) is a British-born Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a long-serving member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, and was a long-time cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments led by premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger. He resigned from cabinet on December 22, 2014 to challenge Selinger for the leadership of the party. Ashton was eliminated from the race, after finishing last on the first ballot at the 2015 NDP leadership convention. Selinger was re-elected party leader on the second ballot. In 2017, Ashton ran for Manitoba NDP leader, losing to Wab Kinew, who became premier in 2023.

==Early life==
Ashton was born in Surrey, England, the son of John Stewart Ashton and Nedra May Childs. His father was born in Wales. He moved with his family, including his brothers Martin and Alan, to Thompson, in northern Manitoba, at age eleven. He was educated at R. D. Parker Collegiate in that community, the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He was President of the University of Manitoba Students&#x27; Union in 1978–79 and has lectured in Economics for the former Inter Universities North in Thompson and Cross Lake.

==Political career==
Ashton was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Ken MacMaster by 72 votes in the constituency of Thompson. At the time of his first election, Ashton was involved in an INCO strike in the Thompson area as a member of the United Steelworkers of America; he was also the second youngest person ever elected to the Manitoba legislature at the time. He was re-elected in the 1986 election by a greater margin. Ashton did not serve in the cabinet of Howard Pawley.

The NDP were defeated in the provincial election of 1988, although Ashton won his own riding by a comfortable margin. He would later serve as House Leader for the NDP in opposition, and was easily re-elected in the provincial elections of 1990, 1995 and 1999. In 1995, he supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

===Cabinet===
When NDP leader Gary Doer became Premier of Manitoba in October 1999, Ashton was appointed Minister of Highways and Government Services. On July 4, 2000, he was charged with administration of the Gaming Control Act; his ministry was renamed as Transportation and Government Services on January 17, 2001. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 25, 2002, Ashton became Minister of Conservation (in which capacity he argued for national approval of the Kyoto Accord on climate change). On June 25, 2003, he was also made Minister of Labour and Immigration with responsibility for Multiculturalism and administration of the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Act.

In 2003, Ashton supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal NDP.

Ashton was re-elected in the 2003 election with over 82% of the vote in his constituency. On November 4, 2003, he was named as the minister in charge of Manitoba Water Stewardship, a department created after highly publicized water contamination tragedies in Walkerton, Ontario and North Battleford, Saskatchewan.

Ashton was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election and in September 2007 he was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister responsible for the Emergency Measures Organization.

On September 4, 2009, Ashton announced his candidacy to succeed Gary Doer as leader of the Manitoba NDP in the 2009 leadership election and ran on a platform advocating the party&#x27;s return to its social justice and labour roots. Ashton placed second behind Greg Selinger with 34.2% of the vote.

Upon Greg Selinger&#x27;s election as premier, Ashton was made Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation, with the added responsibilities of Emergency Measures and the administration of the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act. He also became the lead minister for Canada-Manitoba Infrastructure programs.

Ashton resigned from cabinet on December 22, 2014 to challenge Selinger in the 2015 Manitoba NDP leadership election, at which he was unsuccessful.

He returned to cabinet in April 2015 as Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation and Minister responsible for emergency measures.

After thirty-four and a half years as an MLA, Ashton lost his seat to Progressive Conservative candidate Kelly Bindle in the April 19, 2016, provincial election.

In 2017, Ashton ran for Manitoba NDP leader, losing to Wab Kinew.

==Personal life==
In 1979, Ashton married Hariklia &quot;Hari&quot; Dimitrakopoulou, and the couple have two children. His daughter, Niki, is also a politician and is the federal NDP Member of Parliament for the riding of Churchill—Keewatinook Aski, while his son Alexander was elected chairman of the board of trustees for the School District of Mystery Lake.
Ashton is also Secretary of the Canadian Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles, seeking the return of the treasured sculptures from Britain to Greece. He speaks Greek, and has written on the political culture of that nation.

<text>Harry James Sharper Jr. (born November 23, 1974) is an American football coach and former player. Sharper played professionally as a linebacker for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL), and played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft. Sharper spent five seasons in Baltimore, where he was part of the team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXV. In 2002, he was selected by the Houston Texans in their expansion draft and played three seasons with the team. During his final season in 2005, Sharper was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. He is the older brother of former safety Darren Sharper.

==Career==
Sharper attended Hermitage High School in Henrico County, Virginia. He played for the school&#x27;s American football team as a linebacker. His younger brother, Darren, played for the football team as a quarterback. After high school, Sharper enrolled at the University of Virginia, and played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers.
The Baltimore Ravens selected Sharper with the 34th overall pick in the 1997 NFL draft. He made an impact right away, recording 68 tackles, three sacks and one interception in his rookie year. He became an important part in the record-setting 2000 Ravens defense, making a crucial interception which sent Baltimore to the Super Bowl, and he started in Super Bowl XXXV. His career totals with the Ravens included 328 tackles, 14 sacks, 2 interceptions and one touchdown. After the 2001 season he was chosen in the expansion draft by the Houston Texans. From 2003-2004, while a member of the Texans, he led the NFL in tackles in that period with 301. After the 2004 season he signed with the Seattle Seahawks for one season, helping the team reach their first Super Bowl. Sharper then retired after one season with Seattle due to a knee injury. During his 9-year career Sharper only missed 8 games, and did not miss a game until his final season, playing in 136 straight games.

===Post-playing career===
Jamie Sharper joined the coaching staff at St. Augustine High School in New Orleans and served as Linebackers coach from 2016 to 2018. He joined the Georgetown University football program in August 2018 as the assistant linebackers coach and held that position until 2021. From 2021 to 2022, he served as the Defensive Line coach.

Sharper was hired by the DC Defenders on September 13, 2022. He did not return in 2024.

<doc id="966653" wikidata="Q739743" url="?curid=966653" title="Salting out">
<text>Salting out (also known as salt-induced precipitation, salt fractionation, anti-solvent crystallization, precipitation crystallization, or drowning out) is a purification technique that utilizes the reduced solubility of certain molecules in a solution of very high ionic strength. Salting out is typically used to precipitate large biomolecules, such as proteins or DNA. Because the salt concentration needed for a given protein to precipitate out of the solution differs from protein to protein, a specific salt concentration can be used to precipitate a target protein. This process is also used to concentrate dilute solutions of proteins. Dialysis can be used to remove the salt if needed.

==Principle==

Salt compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions. This property is exploited in the process of salting out. When the salt concentration is increased, some of the water molecules are attracted by the salt ions, which decreases the number of water molecules available to interact with the charged part of the protein.

There are hydrophobic amino acids and hydrophilic amino acids in protein molecules.
After protein folding in aqueous solution, hydrophobic amino acids usually form protected hydrophobic areas while hydrophilic amino acids interact with the molecules of solvation and allow proteins to form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules. If enough of the protein surface is hydrophilic, the protein can be dissolved in water.

When salt is added to the solution, there is more frequent interaction between solvent molecules and salt ions. As a result, the protein and salt ions compete to interact with the solvent molecules with the result that there are fewer solvent molecules available for interaction with the protein molecules than before. The protein–protein interactions thus become stronger than the solvent–solute interactions and the protein molecules associate by forming hydrophobic interactions with each other. After dissociation in a given solvent, the negatively charged atoms from a chosen salt begin to compete for interactions with positively charged molecules present in the solution. Similarly, the positively charged cations compete for interactions with the negatively charged molecules of the solvent. This process is known as salting out.

Soaps are easily precipitated by concentrated salt solution, the metal ion in the salt reacts with the fatty acids forming back the soap and glycerin (glycerol). To separate glycerin from the soap, the pasty boiling mass is treated with brine (NaCl solution). Contents of the kettle salt out (separate) into an upper layer that is a curdy mass of impure soap and a lower layer that consists of an aqueous salt solution with the glycerin dissolved in it. The slightly alkaline salt solution, termed spent lye, is extracted from the bottom of the pan or kettle and may be subsequently treated for glycerin recovery.

==Application==
As different proteins have different compositions of amino acids, different protein molecules precipitate at different concentrations of salt solution.

Unwanted proteins can be removed from a protein solution mixture by salting out as long as the solubility of the protein in various concentrations of salt solution is known.
After removing the precipitate by filtration or centrifugation, the desired protein can be precipitated by altering the salt concentration to the level at which the desired protein becomes insoluble.

One demerit of salting out in purification of proteins is that, in addition to precipitating a specific protein of interest, contaminants are also precipitated as well. Thus to obtain a purer protein of interest, additional purification methods such as ion exchange chromatography may be required.

<doc id="966654" wikidata="Q2252764" url="?curid=966654" title="DNA-binding protein">
<text>DNA-binding proteins are proteins that have DNA-binding domains and thus have a specific or general affinity for single- or double-stranded DNA. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes more functional groups that identify a base pair.

==Examples==
DNA-binding proteins include transcription factors which modulate the process of transcription, various polymerases, nucleases which cleave DNA molecules, and histones which are involved in chromosome packaging and transcription in the cell nucleus. DNA-binding proteins can incorporate such domains as the zinc finger, the helix-turn-helix, and the leucine zipper (among many others) that facilitate binding to nucleic acid. There are also more unusual examples such as transcription activator like effectors.

==Non-specific DNA-protein interactions==
Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones. In prokaryotes, multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation. These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group (HMG) proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. Biophysical studies show that these architectural HMG proteins bind, bend and loop DNA to perform its biological functions. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that form chromosomes. Recently FK506 binding protein 25 (FBP25) was also shown to non-specifically bind to DNA which helps in DNA repair. 

==Proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA==

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.

==Binding to specific DNA sequences==

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to specific DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one specific set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences near their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This alters the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.

These DNA targets can occur throughout an organism&#x27;s genome. Thus, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Thus, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors&#x27; interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to &quot;read&quot; the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible. Mathematical descriptions of protein-DNA binding taking into account sequence-specificity, and competitive and cooperative binding of proteins of different types are usually performed with the help of the lattice models. Computational methods to identify the DNA binding sequence specificity have been proposed to make a good use of the abundant sequence data in the post-genomic era. In addition, progress has happened on structure-based prediction of binding specificity across protein families using deep learning. 

== Protein–DNA interactions ==
Protein–DNA interactions occur when a protein binds a molecule of DNA, often to regulate the biological function of DNA, usually the expression of a gene. Among the proteins that bind to DNA are transcription factors that activate or repress gene expression by binding to DNA motifs and histones that form part of the structure of DNA and bind to it less specifically. Also proteins that repair DNA such as uracil-DNA glycosylase interact closely with it.

In general, proteins bind to DNA in the major groove; however, there are exceptions. Protein–DNA interaction are of mainly two types, either specific interaction, or non-specific interaction. Recent single-molecule experiments showed that DNA binding proteins undergo of rapid rebinding in order to bind in correct orientation for recognizing the target site.

=== Design ===
Designing DNA-binding proteins that have a specified DNA-binding site has been an important goal for biotechnology. Zinc finger proteins have been designed to bind to specific DNA sequences and this is the basis of zinc finger nucleases. Recently transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been created which are based on natural proteins secreted by &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species.

=== Detection methods ===
There are many &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; techniques which are useful in detecting DNA-Protein Interactions. The following lists some methods currently in use: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is a widespread qualitative technique to study protein–DNA interactions of known DNA binding proteins. DNA-Protein-Interaction - Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay (DPI-ELISA) allows the qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA-binding preferences of known proteins &quot;in vitro&quot;. This technique allows the analysis of protein complexes that bind to DNA (DPI-Recruitment-ELISA) or is suited for automated screening of several nucleotide probes due to its standard ELISA plate formate. DNase footprinting assay can be used to identify the specific sites of binding of a protein to DNA at basepair resolution. Chromatin immunoprecipitation is used to identify the &quot;in vivo&quot; DNA target regions of a known transcription factor. This technique when combined with high throughput sequencing is known as ChIP-Seq and when combined with microarrays it is known as ChIP-chip. Yeast one-hybrid System (Y1H) is used to identify which protein binds to a particular DNA fragment. Bacterial one-hybrid system (B1H) is used to identify which protein binds to a particular DNA fragment. Structure determination using X-ray crystallography has been used to give a highly detailed atomic view of protein–DNA interactions.
Besides these methods, other techniques such as SELEX, PBM (protein binding microarrays), DNA microarray screens, DamID, FAIRE or more recently DAP-seq are used in the laboratory to investigate DNA-protein interaction &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;.

=== Manipulating the interactions ===
The protein–DNA interactions can be modulated using stimuli like ionic strength of the buffer, macromolecular crowding, temperature, pH and electric field. This can lead to reversible dissociation/association of the protein–DNA complex.

<text>Paul Johnson (born 13 October 1958) is a British comic book artist.

==Biography==
Paul Johnson orbited the peripheries of the British comic book industry in the early 1980s, self-publishing and appearing in short-lived publications such as &quot;Pssst!&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot;. His first major comics work was the graphic novel &quot;London&#x27;s Dark&quot; but he came to international attention when he painted the art on &quot;The Road to Nowhere&quot;, the fourth and final chapter of &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; mini-series, written by Neil Gaiman and released by DC/Vertigo in 1993.

Johnson worked abroad for Marvel Comics (&quot;Interface&quot;, &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, &quot;Children of the Voyager&quot;), DC Comics (&quot;Mercy&quot;, &quot;Invisibles&quot;, &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;) and Dark Horse Comics (&quot;Aliens&quot;) before working in Britain&#x27;s home-grown industry for &quot;Crisis&quot;, &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and the Eaglemoss publication &quot;Spinechillers&quot;.

In 2000 Johnson was awarded a grant by the Arts Council of Great Britain to run a series of comic book workshops with Ed Hillyer (also known as Ilya) at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in the publication of &quot;Hospitales&quot;, which was distributed free of charge in hospitals across the UK.

In addition to his interest in comics, Johnson wrote regularly for the IPC music magazine &quot;Uncut&quot; from 1999 to 2004.

Influenced by the work of European comics artists such as Moebius (Jean Giraud), Hugo Pratt, Alberto Breccia and Lorenzo Mattotti, Johnson struggled to find work that interested him as most commercial publishers failed to make the jump from producing superhero comics to the more esoteric genres of their continental counterparts.

Disillusioned with the opportunities available to him, Johnson retrained as an acupuncturist and herbalist. He is now in private practice and lectures regularly at LCTA, England&#x27;s largest college dedicated to teaching Traditional Chinese Medicine. He is the chief presenter on &quot;How To Locate Acupuncture Points - The Definitive DVD&quot;, released in 2008.

<text>Koodli, also spelled Kudli or Kudali, is a small historic village in Shimoga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is at the &quot;sangam&quot; (confluence) of two rivers, the Tunga River and Bhadra River at nearly . They meet here to give rise to the Tungabhadra River, a tributary of the Krishna river. Their valleys host many architectural sites. The village was a much larger town and pilgrimage center before the 14th-century, one destroyed during the Islamic conquests of the south. Important temples and their ruins here include the Jagadguru Sri Shankaracharya Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Sangamesvara temple (8th-century, oldest), Ramesvara temple, Sri Chintamani Narasimha temple, Sringeri Vediki temple (with monastery), Vishwakarma temple, Sharadamba temple (with monastery), Amma Devasthana, Brahmeswara temple and the Shree Madhvacharya Kudli Arya Akshobhya Tirtha Matha. Other scattered ruins of unknown temples are also found here.

This site should not be confused with the other historic temples site called &quot;Kudalasangama&quot;, which is about north where rivers Malaprabha and Krishna meet.

== Location ==

Koodli is 18 km from Shivamogga, a place where rivers Tunga and Bhadra flow together, hence the name Koodli. It has a Smarta Vedanta monastery stated to have been founded by Adi Shankara. Within the premises of the matha, there are shrines of Sharadamba and Shankaracharya. Outside, there are two temples of Hoysala times dedicated to Rameshwara and Narasimha. Koodali is also known as Varanasi of the south. It is home to Rushyashrama, Brahmeshwara, Narasimha and Rameshwara temples. The ancient mutt of Adi Shankaracharya was relocated back here some 600 years ago and still stands with inscriptions of Hoysala and Okkeri kings.

== History ==
 

The place has a historic value, with temples of near Hoysala time. There are shasanas carved near the temples that indicate the era when they were built. The exact dates are disputed, but the sculptures date back to age old Indian culture and look exotic. 
There are various temples - small and large ones built by the rulers who ruled this place in the age old era.

== Religion ==
The 12th century Rameshwara Temple is located in the area. There is also a Sri Chintamani Narasimha Swamy Temple beside the Sangameshwara temple. It is believed to be installed and worshipped by Sri Prahlada. The rivers are worshipped and considered to be sacred. A small temple with Nandi denotes the exact point where the two rivers meet, and is considered to be sacred.

There are two mutts (schools) in Koodli. One is Shankara mutt (Advaita Philosophy) &amp; the other being Akshobhya Thirtha Mutt (Dvaita Philosophy).

===Shankara Mutt ===

There is very old Indian style school of learning for Shankara philosophy, called the Koodli mutt. This has a long history:
Once upon a time in the 15th or 16th century, the chief Swami of Shringeri had been on a teerthayaatre, probably to Kashi. He did not return for a long time, which caused the local chiefs to ask the deputy chief to take up the chief&#x27;s position. But the chief was alive and so the latter refused. He went away to the old mutt at Kudali. When the chief returned after a long time, he met his disciple at Kudali and heard of the events. He stayed at Kudali itself and the guru parampara continued from Kudali from then. Now in the beginning of the 1900s, the swami who took the position of the chief Swami was formerly the teacher of his highness Krishnaraja Wodeyar the 4th, Maharaja of Mysore. This brought good times to this mutt again. At present the 71st Swami and 72nd Swami in the lineage are peethadhipatis at Kudali.

=== Koodli Arya Akshobhya Thirtha Mutt ===
The Mutt was established by Sri Akshobhya Tirtha (a direct disciple of Sri Madhvacharya) around the 13th or 14th century. This matha was bifurcated when Akshobhya theertha fell ill and his disciple Sri Jayatirtha was on pilgrimage. Knowing that the time had come for him to enter vrindavana, he ordered one of his disciples to be the pontiff of the Uttaradi Math until Sri Jayatirtha returned. Akshobhya tirtha named him as Sri Trailokyabhushana tirtha, and went into the vrindavan. He had ordered Sri Trailokyabhushana theertha to return all the belongings and deity&#x27;s of Sri Uttaradi Matha to Sri Jayatirtha once he came back from pilgrimage, in a ceremonious way, and ordered that Sri Jayatirtha would become the next pontiff of Sri Uttaradi Math. So when Sri Jayatirtha returned, Sri Trailokyabhusana handed him all the belongings and deity&#x27;s of Sri Uttaradi Matha, in a ceremonious way. Seeing the respect of Sri Trailokyabhushana, Sri Jayatirtha handed him some idols and belongings of Sri Uttaradi Matha and advised him to create his own samsthana. So Sri Trailokyabhushana founded Sri Koodli Arya Akshobhya Tirtha Matha at Koodli. The mutt has a rich tradition and is famed for its knowledge of Sanskrit &amp; Madhvacharya&#x27;s philosophy. There have been three peetadhipathis till date. The current peetadhipathi is H.H. Sri Raghuvijaya Thirta.

In 18th century Satyadharma Tirtha 28th pontiff of Uttaradi Math Brindavan is in Holehonnur near koodli about 3km on the Shivamogga - Chitradurga road on the bank of the river Bhadra Bhadravathi taluk Shivamogga District.

== Geography ==
The place is situated about 16 km away from Shivamogga town and is accessible by road. The nearest village is Holehonnur which is around 3 km from here.

<doc id="966666" wikidata="Q497962" url="?curid=966666" title="Michael of Chernigov">
<text>Mikhail Vsevolodovich ( – 20 September 1246), known as Michael or Mikhail of Chernigov, was Grand Prince of Kiev (1236–1239; 1241–1243); he was also Prince of Pereyaslavl (1206), Novgorod-Seversk (1219–1226), Chernigov (1223–1235; 1242–1246), Novgorod (1225–1226; 1229–1230), and Galicia (1235–1236).

Archaeological evidence reveals that Chernigov towns enjoyed an unprecedented degree of prosperity during his period which suggests that promoting trade was a priority for him. Commercial interests, in part, also motivated him to seize control of Halych and Kiev because they were channels through which goods from the Rhine valley and Hungary passed to Chernigov. He also negotiated commercial treaties and political alliances with the Poles and the Hungarians. He alleviated the tax burden of the Novgorodians and granted their boyars greater political freedom from the prince. 

During the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; (1237–1242), Mikhail was defeated and had to flee; in 1246, he was executed by Batu Khan.

== Legacy ==
=== &quot;Vita&quot; of Michael of Chernigov ===
A hagiography &quot;vita&quot; of Michael of Chernigov was written some time after his death, describing his life in detail, and framing his execution as martyrdom. It is unclear when this account was written (at least after the Mongol census in Suzdalia and Novgorod in 1257–59), and how historically reliable it is. Mikhail&#x27;s death is briefly mentioned in the Older Recension of &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (compiled 1275), in the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; (compiled 1377), and in the &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; (compiled 1425), but the full text of the &quot;vita&quot; is not found in these manuscripts. It is not until the Younger Recension of the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (compiled 1450) that an extensive narrative of his demise appears, stating that the bodies of Mikhail and Fedor were thrown to the dogs; but as a sign of divine favor, their bodies remained unmolested and pillars of fire hovered over them. The &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot; (compiled 1550) added even more text to Mikhail&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot;, including claims that the Mongols already established a system of military governors and tax collectors in all cities of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1237–1240, which is historically very unlikely.

=== Carpine account ===
Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, an Italian papal legate who travelled through the lands of former Kievan Rus&#x27; in the late 1240s, wrote the following account of his death in the &quot;Ystoria Mongalorum&quot;:

== Genealogy ==
=== Marriage and children ===
Michael married once and had several children.

=== Descendants ===

The later Upper Oka Principalities of the 14th and 15th centuries were reigned by the &quot;upper princes&quot;, each of which descended from Mikhail Vsevolodovich of Chernigov.

In the second half of the 19th century, many family branches stemming from Mikhail flourished: the Baryatinsky, the Gorchakovy, the Dolgorukie, the Eletskie, the Zvenigorodskie, the Koltsovy-Mosalskie, the Obolenskie, the Odoevskie, and the Shcherbatovy.

<doc id="966667" wikidata="Q2503882" url="?curid=966667" title="Texas State Highway 121">
<text>State Highway 121 (SH 121) is a state highway angling from southwest to northeast through north central Texas. It runs from Cleburne, Texas at US 67 to SH 78 in Bonham, Texas, just north of a junction with US 82.

Between Fort Worth and Euless, SH 121 is known as Airport Freeway (east of Euless, this name applies to SH 183). East of Coppell, the highway functions as the frontage road for the Sam Rayburn Tollway, a toll road that runs northeast to McKinney. From McKinney to Melissa, the state highway is concurrent with US 75 and the North Central Expressway. Northeast of Melissa, SH 121 is a less-traveled roadway often referred to as the Sam Rayburn Highway.

== Route description ==

Sections between downtown Fort Worth and Grapevine are freeway, including a small segment near Hurst that coincides with Interstate 820. At Bedford, Texas it has an interchange with SH 183, the Irving freeway that leads toward Dallas; it has an interchange with SH 360, which leads toward Arlington, just to the west of the north entrance to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, to which State Highway 121 gives access. At Grapevine it has interchanges with SH 114 and Interstate 635 before becoming a limited-access tollway that passes between Lewisville and Frisco.

It is very heavily traveled south and west of McKinney and has become an urban highway due to the rapid growth of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Service roads extending southwest to northeast along the corridor from Lewisville to McKinney are free of charge; however the main lanes within the right-of-way are tolled as part of the Sam Rayburn Tollway operated by the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). The highway&#x27;s northeastern section between Melissa and Bonham carries less traffic and until recently was a two-lane rural highway. However, in recent years with an increase in traffic, the 19 mile section between the Collin–Fannin county line and its junction with SH 56 in Bonham has been upgraded to a &quot;Super Two&quot; highway system. This allows for alternating passing lanes. Beginning in 2016, the segment between Melissa and the Collin–Fannin county line is being upgraded to a four-lane divided highway system. In addition, a two-mile stretch between SH 56 and US 82 within Bonham city limits, was upgraded to a four-lane highway system with a continuous left-hand turn lane. Long term planning calls for upgrading the 19 mile stretch, from the Collin–Fannin county line to SH 56 in Bonham, into a four-lane divided highway system.
It meets Interstate 35E at Lewisville, SH 289 near Frisco, US 75 and US 380 in McKinney, US 69 at Trenton, and SH 78 just north of Bonham.

Construction began in 2009 on the extension of 121 south from Fort Worth to Cleburne, as a toll road called Chisholm Trail Parkway in Tarrant and Johnson Counties. This section is operated by the NTTA and the entire project, from I-30 to U.S. 67 opened to traffic in 2013.

In March 2009, work was completed on the eventual southbound lanes on a short stretch of 121 northeast of DFW Airport, which currently shares southbound and northbound traffic. This work upgraded two signalized at-grade intersections to a freeway, with overpasses at both intersections, improving traffic in that area. The northbound freeway lanes are currently under construction, which also include new, separate exits and entrances for Freeport Parkway and Grapevine Mills Boulevard/Sandy Lake Road.
== Sam Rayburn Tollway ==

From McKinney to Coppell, State Highway 121 acts as a frontage road to Sam Rayburn Tollway, contrary to the popular misconception that the Sam Rayburn Tollway was the new SH 121.

===Controversy===
In early 2007, the Spanish firm Cintra agreed to a $2.8 billion, 50-year deal where they would lease the highway from TxDOT, finish building and maintain it, and collect the tolls. However, critics of the deal questioned both its length—the contract allowed Cintra to collect tolls for 50 years—and the fact that the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) was prevented from bidding on the contract. In addition, general opposition to the toll plan organized, pointing out that the segment through Denton County had already been paid for by taxpayer money.

To answer some of these complaints, Texas legislators pressed the Texas Department of Transportation to allow the NTTA to bid. The Authority announced their proposed bid in early May 2007, which would provide approximately $3.3 billion in road funding, but is based on traffic counts that differ from those used by Cintra.

On June 28, 2007, the Texas Transportation Commission announced it would pursue the proposal from the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA).

==History==
SH 121 was originally numbered on March 17, 1927, as a direct routing between Fort Worth and SH 40 near the Dallas–Denton county line. On April 24, 1928, it was extended to McKinney. By 1933, the route had been completed from Ft. Worth northeast through Grapevine to its intersection with SH 40/U.S. Route 77 in far southern Denton County. On July 15, 1935, the east end was truncated to the Denton–Dallas county line. On January 6, 1939, the section from the Dallas–Denton county line to SH 40/US 77 was restored. A road was designated on February 21, 1938, from SH 114 to SH 121; either SH 114 Loop or SH 121 Loop. This was renumbered as Loop 10 on September 26, 1939.

On November 24, 1941, SH 121 was extended from old US 77 to new US 77. On December 16, 1943, the section of SH 121 from US 77 (former SH 40) to McKinney was restored, and the ambitious plan to extend SH 121 northeast beyond McKinney to Bonham was approved by TxDOT, a part of which absorbed Farm to Market Road 82 between Bonham and Trenton. The section from Bonham to Randolph was designated as SH 263 until March 21, 1939. It was not until 1954 that the next section of this highway was completed between U.S. 77 at Lewisville and U.S. Route 75 near McKinney. The final section between McKinney and Trenton was not completed until November 20, 1963, including an extension around the western side of Bonham. In 1965, the section from downtown Fort Worth to Interstate 820 was transferred to newly completed freeway sections. On November 31, 1969, SH 121 was rerouted over Spur 459, which was cancelled. The old route of SH 121 was given to the city of Grapevine.

TxDOT proposed extending SH 121 to FM 1187, via a route to be known as the Northside–Southwest Freeway, on October 4, 1973. This proposed extension was canceled on August 29, 1985.

On April 14, 1980, SH 121 was relocated in Bedford and Grapevine. On November 18, 1999, SH 121 was rerouted over Spur 553, which was cancelled. The old route of SH 121 became Business SH 121. On February 27, 2003, the SH 121 designation was extended to US 67 in Cleburne. This extension, known as the Chisholm Trail Parkway (CTP), was built in stages from 2008 to 2014 and opened to traffic on May 11, 2014. The CTP&#x27;s frontage roads in southwest Fort Worth are signed as SH 121.

<doc id="966688" wikidata="Q500477" url="?curid=966688" title="Gomez Addams">
<text>Gomez Addams is the patriarch of the fictional Addams Family, created by cartoonist Charles Addams for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in the 1940s and subsequently portrayed on television, in film, and on the stage.

==Cartoons==
In Charles Addams&#x27;s original cartoons, Gomez was the nameless patriarch of the family. He had a somewhat grotesque appearance, with a tubby body, a snub nose, a crooked tooth, and a receding chin. He was often depicted reading in the den or lounging on the windowsill.

==Origin of the name==
In the Charles Addams cartoons, Gomez—as with all of the members of the family—had no given name. When &quot;The Addams Family&quot; television series was being developed, Charles Addams suggested naming the character either Repelli or Gomez. Addams left the final choice up to portrayer John Astin, who chose Gomez.

Because &quot;Gómez&quot; is strictly a surname in the Hispanic world, the character&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Homero&quot; (&quot;Homer&quot;) in Hispanic American translations. In Spain, where the surname originated, he is called Gómez.

==Personality==
Like the other members of the family, Gomez&#x27;s personality became largely codified by the television series. He is depicted as being of Castilian extraction and Spanish ancestry, which was first brought up in &quot;Art and the Addams Family&quot; on December 18, 1964; in the episode, Gomez says his &quot;ancestral land&quot; is Spain and Morticia refers to him as a &quot;mad Castilian.&quot;

John Astin had long sessions with Addams and series producer David Levy, who gave him free rein in developing the character. Enlarging on Addams&#x27;s description of Gomez as a Latin lover type, Astin suggested the eye-rolling, pencil moustache, and ardent devotion to Morticia.

In the Addams cartoons and the television shows, Gomez wore a necktie to his chalk-stripe suit, though in the films, Gomez wears a bow tie and a wide variety of extravagant clothing. He spends $1000 per month on cigars, and he is an accomplished juggler and knife thrower. He loves crashing toy trains and diving for crabs on Halloween. When he wishes to know the time, he will pull a pocket watch from the breast pocket of his coat (the chain is attached to the lapel) while simultaneously checking a wristwatch.

Gomez is an athletic, acrobatic, and eccentric multibillionaire. Though an extremely successful businessman, having acquired much of his wealth through inheritance and investments, he has little regard for money and will casually spend thousands of dollars on any whimsical endeavor. Gomez&#x27;s investments are guided more by whimsy than strategy, yet luck rarely fails him. Gomez owns businesses around the world, including a swamp, bought for &quot;scenic value&quot;, a crocodile farm, a buzzard farm, a salt mine, a tombstone factory, a uranium mine, and many others. In Forbes 2007 &quot;Fictional 15&quot; list of the richest fictional characters, he was ranked number 12 with a net worth of $2.5 billion.

As a young man, Gomez was, per flashback in &quot;Morticia&#x27;s Romance&quot;, a perennially sickly youth, gaining perfect health only after meeting Morticia. He nevertheless studied law (voted &quot;Most Likely Never to Pass the Bar&quot;) and is quite proud his law class voted him &quot;Least Likely to Succeed&quot;; and although he rarely practices, he takes an absurd delight in losing cases, boasting of having put many criminals behind bars while acting as their defense attorney, claiming that he &quot;never sent an innocent man to jail;&quot; this is somewhat contradicted in the episode &quot;The Addams Family Goes to Court,&quot; which noted that while Gomez has never won a case, he has never lost one either. This backstory, while not mentioned directly, is recalled in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991), when Gomez announces he will serve as his own attorney, only to lose the case. In &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, Gomez had also studied medicine.

Gomez has offered contradictory views on work; in one episode, he claims that although his family was wealthy even in his childhood, he nonetheless performed odd jobs and &quot;scrimped and saved [his] kopeks,&quot; which he considered character building. When his son Pugsley decided to find a job, however, Gomez was horrified, claiming, &quot;No Addams has worked in 300 years!&quot; In the 1991 animated series, Gomez deliberately tried to fail at something, anything, only to realize in the end of the episode that he is only a failure in failure. This is additionally contradicted in &quot;New Neighbors Meet the Addams Family&quot; (season one, episode 9, 1964). He specifically states that Thing always beats him at bridge.

==Portrayals==

In the 1960s American television series, Gomez was portrayed by John Astin. Astin also voiced the character in an episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, which featured the family. In the first animated series by Hanna-Barbera, Gomez was voiced by Lennie Weinrib. In the second animated series, also by Hanna-Barbera, Gomez&#x27;s voice was again performed by John Astin.

Gomez was played by Raul Julia in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993). After Julia died in 1994, Tim Curry took up the role in the television film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; in 1998, and in 1999, Gomez was played by Glenn Taranto in the TV series &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, where he returned to the madcap attitude of his original 1960s incarnation with Astin guest-starring as Gomez&#x27;s grandfather. In the Broadway musical, Gomez was initially played by Nathan Lane and later by Roger Rees. In the UK tour of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; musical in 2017, Gomez was portrayed by Cameron Blakely, who was set to reprise his role in 2021. The films differ from the television series in several ways, most significantly that Fester is Gomez&#x27;s brother (in the television show, he was Morticia&#x27;s uncle). &quot;The Addams Family&quot; notes that Gomez&#x27;s parents were murdered by an angry mob, though in one scene in the sequel, when Gomez catches Fester with a pornographic magazine, they both look at the centerfold (unseen by the viewer) and fondly say &quot;Mom&quot;. In &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;, Gomez and Morticia have a third child named Pubert, a seemingly indestructible baby with a thin, black moustache like his father.

Oscar Isaac voiced Gomez in the 2019 animated adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and its 2021 sequel. In the latter film, it is revealed that Gomez wears a wig made of Sasquatch fur due to losing his original hair in a napalm accident.

Luis Guzmán portrays Gomez in Netflix series &quot;Wednesday&quot;. Both he and Morticia first met at Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for supernatural people (also known as &quot;Outcasts&quot;), it is revealed in flashbacks that he and Morticia were involved in the death of a local teenage boy named Garrett Gates, who tried to kill Gomez in a blind rage, due to Gates&#x27; own infatuation with Morticia. Sheriff Galpin still believes that Gomez committed the murder on purpose and holds a grudge against the Addams&#x27; bloodline. After Gomez is re-arrested for Gates&#x27; murder, Morticia and Wednesday exhume Gates&#x27; body and find evidence that Gates died of accidental nightshade poisoning, clearing Gomez.

<doc id="966691" wikidata="Q5691944" url="?curid=966691" title="JFK/UMass station">
<text>JFK/UMass station is a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) intermodal transfer station, located adjacent to the Columbia Point area of Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts. It is served by the rapid transit Red Line; the Greenbush Line, Kingston/Plymouth Line, and Middleborough/Lakeville Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system, and three MBTA bus routes. The station is named for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and the University of Massachusetts Boston, both located nearby on Columbia Point.

JFK/UMass station has four tracks and two island platforms for the Ashmont and Braintree branches of the Red Line, with one track and one side platform for Commuter Rail. A waiting room and fare lobby over the Red Line platforms is connected to Columbia Road, Sydney Street, and the busway on the east side of the station by footbridge. The station is fully accessible. North of the station, the complex Columbia Junction connects the two Red Line branches with the downtown tunnel and Cabot Yard lead tracks.

The Old Colony Railroad first opened through the area in 1845, with Crescent Avenue serving as a flag stop by 1848. A station building opened in 1868 and was rebuilt in 1883. The Boston Elevated Railway began construction of Columbia station on the Dorchester Extension of the Cambridge–Dorchester Tunnel in 1925. Crescent Avenue station closed in July 1927; Columbia station opened on November 5, with an additional footbridge added in 1929. Columbia station was modernized in 1970, though without a platform for South Shore (Braintree Branch) service, which started in 1971. UMass Boston moved to Columbia Point in 1974, while the Kennedy Library opened in 1979; the station was renamed JFK/UMass in 1982. A 1987–88 renovation added a platform for the Braintree Branch. Commuter Rail service on the former Old Colony, last operated in 1959, resumed in 1997. However, the platform at JFK/UMass did not open until 2001.

==Station layout==

JFK/UMass station is located south of Columbia Road near Kosciuszko Circle, with the Interstate 93 viaduct to the south and west and Morrissey Boulevard to the east. The Red Line has four tracks and two island platforms at the station; the west platform is served by the Ashmont branch, and the east platform by the Braintree branch. (This unusual configuration is the result of the decision to not originally have the Braintree Branch stop at the station.) East of the Red Line is a single track used by the three commuter rail lines, with a high-level side platform on its east side. A two-lane busway, drop-off lane, and plaza are located east of the tracks.

A waiting room and fare lobby is located over the middle of the Red Line platforms, with elevators and stairs to both platforms. Footbridges connect the lobby to the Columbia Road bridge to the north, Sydney Street to the west, and the east plaza via a ramp structure. Exit-only stairs also lead from the north ends of the Red Line platforms to Columbia Road, and from the south ends to Sydney Street at Crescent Avenue. Because northbound Red Line trains arrive on two different platforms, an automatic illuminated sign in the lobby indicates which platform the next northbound train will arrive at.

North of the station is a complex Red Line interlocking called Columbia Junction. The two track line from downtown Boston exits the tunnel under Dorchester Avenue about north of JFK/UMass station and splits into the four tracks with a flying junction. The junction also connects two yard leads from Cabot Yard, the main Red Line maintenance facility, which is located on the surface near . South of the station, the Braintree Branch tracks cross over the commuter rail tracks via a lengthy flyover. The flyover is dedicated to Milton DeVaughn, an MBTA track worker, who died in December 1993 when he fell under the wheels of an MBTA work train.
===Bus connections===
Columbia was not built as a transfer station; streetcar—and later, bus—routes mostly served Andrew and Fields Corner. Bus service to the station began in 1954 when the Columbia Point Development was constructed, and increased in 1974 when the UMass campus opened. The 1988 renovations added a dedicated two-lane busway on the east side of the station. The station is served by MBTA bus routes . During service disruptions – both planned track work and unplanned incidents – JFK/UMass is often used as the terminus of busing on either Red Line branch. A privately operated shuttle bus also connects the station with the UMass campus and the John F. Kennedy Library.

==History==
===Old Colony Railroad===

In 1845, the Old Colony Railroad opened between Boston and Plymouth, Massachusetts. Crescent Avenue was a flag stop for South Braintree and Dorchester and Milton Branch trains by 1848. A station building was opened at Crescent Avenue on November 2, 1868, and replaced in 1883.

In the early 1920s, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) began planning an extension of the Cambridge–Dorchester Tunnel over the Shawmut Branch to . The New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad, which had succeeded the Old Colony, sold the Shawmut Branch to the BERy, with service ending on September 6, 1926. The mainline stations at Crescent Avenue and were kept open during construction. Crescent Avenue station was closed on July 15, 1927, for final construction and demolished shortly thereafter.
===Boston Elevated Railway===

Crescent Avenue was replaced with Columbia station, which primarily served the residential areas to the west. The station had a single island platform, long and varying wide, covered with a full-length reinforced concrete canopy. It was designed to be extended southwards if future ridership required six-car trains. The entrance to the station was from the Columbia Road overpass; like other stations on the Dorchester Extension, it was a rectangular red brick structure with red sandstone and Concord granite trim. The roofs of the headhouse, the stairway to the platform, and the canopy were all flashed with copper. Fare control was in the headhouse, with a waiting room on the platform. The station was designed by William D. Austin.

Construction of the station began in 1925 with the reconstruction of the Columbia Road bridge. The station platform was built in mid-1926. Construction was completed in May 1927; the station was finished during the next several months under the possibility it would open before Savin Hill and . The three stations ultimately opened together on November 5, 1927.

In November 1928, the BERy began construction of a second station entrance from Sydney Street at Crescent Avenue. A footbridge was built over the southbound track at the south end of the station, with fare control located on a short extension of the platform. The new entrance opened on March 18, 1929; by May, it was used by 42% of passengers at the station. In late 1938, the footbridge was extended east over the other tracks to serve a parking area.
===MBTA era===

On January 13, 1961, the MTA began operating &quot;modified express service&quot; on the line during the morning rush hour, following the introduction of similar service on the Forest Hills–Everett line the month before. Every other train bypassed Columbia and three other stations. This was discontinued in September 1961 to reduce wait times at the skipped stations, most of which were outdoors.

The New Haven Railroad ended commuter service on the Old Colony lines in 1959, but subway service to Ashmont via Columbia continued. On July 28, 1965, the MBTA signed an agreement with the New Haven Railroad to purchase of the former Old Colony mainline from Fort Point Channel to South Braintree in order to construct a new rapid transit line along the corridor. The line was expected to be completed within two years. On August 26, 1965, the Cambridge–Dorchester line was renamed as the Red Line as part of a rebranding by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which had taken over the system in 1964.

In 1967, the MBTA began a station modernization program; modifications to Columbia took place in 1970. A southward extension made the platform long enough for six-car trains (which were not run until 1987). The original brick headhouse was replaced with a plain concrete headhouse, which opened on February 20, 1970, and the platform waiting room was removed. The footbridge was also replaced. The South Shore Branch (later the Braintree Branch) opened in 1971. Trains used two new tracks on the east side of Columbia; they did not stop in order to speed travel time between Quincy and Boston.

====1980s====
The Columbia Point Development opened to the southeast of the station in 1954; residents of the housing development secured the 1962 closure of the city dump, which opened the peninsula to development. Ridership at Columbia station grew quickly despite the MBTA&#x27;s refusal to have the South Shore Branch stop. Three major developments opening on Columbia Point in the 1970s—the UMass Boston campus in 1974, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 1979, and the Bayside Expo Center—increased the importance of the station. On December 2, 1982, the station was renamed as JFK/UMass after the campus and library. Columbia was re-added as a secondary name in 1985 as part of a series of station name changes. Repairs to the Columbia Road bridge closed the north entrance from early 1982 until January 10, 1983.
In January 1980, the MBTA indicated that a $1 million renovation of the station, including a second platform, would be completed in 1982. However, the project proved controversial; residents near Savin Hill station instead wanted a flyover there so that Braintree Branch trains would stop at both Savin Hill and JFK/UMass. State officials insisted that the flyover would be significantly more expensive than the second platform, and that five times as many South Shore riders were riding to JFK/UMass as to Savin Hill.

The MBTA awarded a $13.5 million construction contract on February 4, 1987, and work began that June. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 16. A large waiting room and fare control lobby was built over the center of the platforms, with footbridges to Sydney Street on the west and a new busway on the east. The 1970s Columbia Road entrance became exit-only; an adjacent footbridge to the lobby was added. The south footbridge was modified with a connection to the new platform, and became exit-only. The east part of the footbridge was removed and an employee building constructed in its place. The platform for the Braintree Branch opened on December 14, 1988, allowing all Red Line trains to stop at the renovated station. The renovation included elevators to both platforms, making the station accessible.

====2000s====
Commuter rail service on the Middleborough/Lakeville and Plymouth/Kingston lines was restored in September 1997. The MBTA initially did not plan to include a stop at JFK/UMass; not until November 1996 did the agency agree to build the platform. Construction began in 2000, and trains began stopping on April 30, 2001. This was the first time that mainline commuter trains stopped at the station since 1927. Several rush-hour Greenbush Line trains began to stop concurrent with that line&#x27;s restoration in 2007. Not all weekday commuter trains on the lines stop, however, because the station is in a single-tracked bottleneck section of the otherwise double-tracked route. All weekend trains, which operate on more limited schedules, stop at the station.

JFK/UMass station was a proposed stop on the MBTA&#x27;s planned Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a bus rapid transit (BRT) line designed to connect the current MBTA lines to reduce strain on the downtown stations. Under 2008 plans, the Urban Ring would access the station via Columbia Road, with a one-bay dedicated BRT platform in the existing busway. The project was cancelled in January 2010. In 2012 and 2013, the MBTA installed over 50 security cameras in the station—in addition to over ten already present—in response to an increase of crime in nearby areas. Improvements to the station were proposed in 2014 as part of the city&#x27;s bid for the 2024 Olympics, which was withdrawn in 2015.

On June 11, 2019, a Red Line train derailed just north of JFK/UMass station due to a broken axle, damaging three sheds of signal equipment that control the nearby Columbia Junction. The Red Line was limited to 10 trains per hour (instead of the usual 13–14) for three months while repairs were made. Full service resumed on September 25, 2019.

Structural deterioration affected the station entrances in the early 2020s. On January 29, 2020, the stairs between Columbia Road and the east side of the station were taken out of service for repairs. Boston University professor David K. Jones was killed when he fell through a missing section of the still-closed stairs (owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation) on September 11, 2021. The stairs from the east footbridge to the busway were closed from May to September 2022, and the southern stairs to Sydney Street were indefinitely closed in mid-2022. In November 2022, the MBTA closed the Columbia Road entrance, with repairs initially expected to take at least a month. Part of the Red Line was closed for a weekend in January 2023 to accommodate repairs. The Columbia Road entrance reopened that month.

The MBTA included $2.3 million in its draft fiscal year 2024–2028 capital plan for a planning study to redesign the station. Buses replaced service on the Ashmont Branch from October 14–29, 2023, to allow for track work. Repairs and repainting of the Red Line platforms at JFK/UMass station was also performed during the closure. In November 2024, the MBTA applied for a $99 million federal grant to fund half of a renovation of the station. In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation did not approve the MBTA&#x27;s petition but did award a $2 million grant for planning and design work at the station.

<text>The New Zealand kākā (Nestor meridionalis) is a large species of parrot of the family Strigopidae found in New Zealand&#x27;s native forests across the three main Islands of New Zealand. The species is often known by the abbreviated name kākā, although it shares this name with the recently extinct Norfolk kākā and Chatham kākā. Two subspecies of New Zealand kākā are recognised. It is endangered and has disappeared from much of its former range, though the re-introduction of North Island kākā at Zealandia in Wellington has led to an increasing population of the birds across the city.

== Taxonomy ==
The New Zealand kākā was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus meridionalis&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;meridionalis&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;southern&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Southern brown parrot&quot; from New Zealand that had been described in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a preserved specimen in the Leverian Museum in London. The New Zealand kākā is now placed in the genus &quot;Nestor&quot; that was introduced in 1830 by René Lesson.

There are two subspecies, the North Island kākā, &quot;Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis&quot;, and the South Island kākā, &quot;N. m. meridionalis,&quot; although more recent research has ruled out allopatric subspeciation. The Māori language name &quot;kākā&quot; means &quot;parrot&quot;, possibly related to &quot;kā&quot;, &#x27;to screech&#x27;.

The genus &quot;Nestor&quot; contains four species, two of which are extinct: the New Zealand kākā (&quot;Nestor meridionalis&quot;), the kea (&quot;N. notabilis&quot;), the extinct Norfolk kākā (&quot;N. productus&quot;), and the extinct Chatham kākā (&quot;N.&quot; &quot;chathamensis&quot;). All four are thought to stem from a &quot;proto-kākā&quot;, dwelling in the forests of New Zealand five million years ago. The closest living relative to the Nestor genus is the kākāpō (&quot;Strigops habroptilus&quot;). Together, they form the parrot superfamily Strigopoidea, an ancient group that split off from all other Psittaciformes before their radiation.

The kākā’s closest living relative is the kea; the kea and kākā became separate species 1.72 million years ago due to ecological divergence. This likely occurred due to changes in the climate during the Pleistocene that drove the kākā to specialise in more forested environments and the kea to specialise in alpine and other habitats. This is why kākā are found in more forested areas with complex canopies compared to the kea There is also more genetic diversity within the kākā compared to the kea and kākāpō.

== Description ==
The New Zealand kākā is a medium-sized parrot, measuring in length and weighing from , with an average of . It is closely related to the kea, but has darker plumage and is more arboreal. The forehead and crown are greyish-white and the nape is greyish brown. The neck and abdomen are more reddish, while the wings are more brownish. Both sub-species have a strongly patterned brown/green/grey plumage with orange and scarlet flashes under the wings; colour variants that show red to yellow colouration especially on the breast are sometimes found.

The calls include a harsh &quot;ka-aa&quot; and a whistling &quot;u-wiia&quot;.

Kākā beak morphology also differs slightly from its closest relatives, the kea and kākāpō. The rhinotheca (upper part of the beak) of the kākā is narrower than the kākāpo and slightly longer. However, it is not as long and sharp as the rhinotheca seen in kea. Therefore, the kākā&#x27;s bill is between the kea and kākāpō in length, sharpness, and width. 

There is some evidence of sexual dimorphism in the North Island kākā, with males tending to have larger bills than females. Male culmen lengths tended to be, on average, 13.6% and 12.4% larger than female culmen lengths. This is suggested to have evolved in male kākā due to the high proportion of provisioning the male kākā have to do for female kākā and hatchlings during the breeding season.Therefore, a larger culmen is needed to access food sources such as wood-boring larvae which only males tend to seek out.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The New Zealand kākā lives in lowland and mid-altitude native forest. They tend to inhabit mature native forests with a more complex canopy. The kākā was once widespread throughout most of New Zealand; however, due to habitat modification, predation and resource competition from introduced animals, its distribution has now significantly decreased. Its strongholds are currently the offshore reserves of Kapiti Island, Codfish Island / Whenua Hou and Little Barrier Island. As of  2021, less than 50% of the kākā population was found on the mainland. It is breeding rapidly in the mainland island sanctuary at Zealandia with over 800 birds banded since their reintroduction in 2002. From their reintroduction in 2002, North Island kākā continue to recolonise Wellington and a 2015 report showed a significant increase in their numbers over the preceding 12 years.

=== South Island kākā ===
New Zealand kākā are still considered common and easy to find in certain large forested areas of the South Island. Kākā can be found in Rotoiti Nature Recovery Project, along the Milford Track and in the Eglinton Valley in Fiordland National Park. The South Island kākā, &quot;N. m. meridionalis&quot;, can be distinguished from the North Island kākā by slight differences in its plumage. The South Island kākā has more white plumage on the top of its head compared to the North Island kākā and has brighter green plumage, with the North Island kākā having more olive-brown plumage. The South Island males also tend to weigh approximately 100g more than the North Island males. However, there is no evidence showing any significant genetic differences between the North Island and South Island subspecies.

New Zealand kākā can also be found around Stewart Island / Rakiura and the offshore Islands of Codfish Island / Whenua Hou and Ulva Island.

In 2015 Project Janszoon first released New Zealand kākā into Abel Tasman National Park with an additional release in 2019.

== Behaviour ==
New Zealand kākā are mainly arboreal and occupy mid-to-high canopy. They are often seen flying across valleys or calling from the top of emergent trees. They are very gregarious and move in large flocks that often include kea, where they are present. They are not obligate social animals and go between living in groups and being solitary, where they vocalise less. Their behaviour in group environments shows their high cognition by demonstrating their complex interactions through social play and communication. They are highly active at dawn and dusk and can sometimes be heard calling loudly. Kākā usually can be seen in groups of 3-5 and often forage alone but can form large groups around food sources like flowering or fruiting trees.

=== Breeding ===
The New Zealand kākā nests in cavities in hollow trees. These trees are often mataī, rimu, tōtara, miro, hīnau and sometimes dead trees. The entrance hole is often three to six metres above the ground, but can be as low as ground level on predator-free offshore islands. The nest floor is lined with small wood chips and powder. This is intentionally created by the mother stripping wood and chewing wood chips from the cavity walls. Large wood chips on the cavity floor can be further chewed and broken down to create a consistent base for the nestlings. They lay eggs any time between September (late winter) and March (summer). Occasionally, in a good fruiting year, a pair can double clutch, often utilising the same nest hole for the second clutch and extending breeding into winter. They typically lay four eggs, though it can be up to eight, with two chicks fledging. Kākā eggs are white, slightly oval and have a rough surface. Only the female incubates the eggs, for about 24 days, and cares for the nestlings, but she is regularly fed by the male throughout breeding. Males feed the incubating female 8-12 times a day. Kākā nestlings leave the nest when approximately 70 days old, with nestlings as old as 11-20 days being left unattended for 20-70% of the night and 50-85% of the day. Both parents feed the chicks after they have fledged.

=== Breeding behaviour ===
The kākā is a monogamous species that tends to breed in pairs; however, extra-pair copulations, while not common, do occur in kākā. Monogamous pairs often return to breed with each other year after year. Kākā courtship involves the male approaching a female, often on a branch in the canopy. Before mating, the male kākā gently pushes the female with his foot, forehead and beak, then moves away. If the female remains in the same position after this and lowers her head, the male will mount the female and mate. However, if the female leaves after the male&#x27;s courtship display, mating will likely not occur. Kākā tend to form groups for feeding and mating. In these groups, during the breeding season, males can be protective of their mates and have been observed driving away other species of birds and other kākā from their mates. However, outside of this, kākā are not highly territorial, with nests sometimes being as close as 30m apart during the breeding season.

=== Social play behaviour ===
Social play is a behaviour that has been observed in fledgling and juvenile kākā. Kākā social play can be defined as two individuals interacting and responding to each other and exchanging information. Social play in kākā often occurs when two individuals repeat behaviours demonstrated by one another until one is distracted by other stimuli. Play behaviour within parrots demonstrates complex cognition and an evolutionary history of living in social groups. Social play in kākā evolved early on in their evolutionary history. It likely evolved to help cognitive development and social bonding, with social play helping kākā develop problem-solving skills and learn social cues, which is important for kākā when in groups. Social play and other social interactions make up a significant portion of juvenile kākā&#x27;s activities. Common social play behaviours observed in kākā are play chasing, play invitations, play fighting, and sometimes social object play. Social object play is rare in kākā but still occasionally occurs, with kākā sometimes grasping tree fronds or branches with their bill while playing.

A play behaviour seen in juvenile kākā is play invitations. Play invitations are defined as the behaviour that initiates play between two kākā. This behaviour in kākā can be recognised as a distinctive hopping approach to a potential play partner as well as head cocking. A head cock occurs when a kākā turns its head to one side while approaching another kākā. These are both common signals juvenile kākā perform to initiate play with conspecifics. This behaviour is often followed by play chasing or play fighting. Play chasing often occurs when one kākā chases another on the ground or during flight; the roles often reverse between the individuals.

Playfighting often does not cause injury, and aggressiveness is limited. Kākā frequently engage in play fights, often resulting in one kākā rolling onto their back and the other jumping onto their stomach with non-aggressive bite attempts and foot pushes. With this behaviour, there is often no attempt to cause injury to the partner during the play fight. After this interaction, they reverse positions and repeat the play fight, ending similarly. Behaviours that show play fighting can be foot pushing when a kākā stands on or nudges another kākā with its feet. Other behaviours are bill locking which does not occur as often in kākā play and is more prevalent in kea social play.

=== Feeding ===

New Zealand kākā typically feed on varieties of fruits, berries, seeds, flowers, buds, nectar, sap, plants and invertebrates. They use their strong beak to shred cones of kauri trees to obtain the seeds. It has a brush tongue with which it uses to feeds on nectar, and it uses its strong beak to dig out the grubs of the huhu beetle and to remove bark to feed on sap. They consume nectar from plant species such as kōwhai, flax, rātā, and pōhutukawa. Kākā, while feeding, often stand on one foot and use the other foot to manipulate food, like stripping the husk off of a fruit. This is a behaviour demonstrated in many other parrot species. Kākā feeding behaviour often varies depending on the season, with kākā switching to different resources based on seasonal availability. Kākā tend to consume more seeds, berries, and fruit when nectar and honeydew are low in winter, with their diet varying throughout the year and shifting focus during different seasons.

==== Sap feeding ====
A common feeding behaviour frequently observed in kākā is sap feeding behaviour. Sap feeding behaviour occurs most in mid to late winter and spring when there is a scarcity of flowers and other food sources which are prevalent during the summer months. This behaviour is evident by the removal of bark from trees in areas populated by kākā. There are two types of bark removal strategies used by kākā. Firstly, there are transverse gouges made by the kākā&#x27;s beak and are intended to break through the bark layer in a deep gouge, allowing the kākā to access the tree sap by lapping at the cut in the tree. These often appear on trees as small, long linear gouges wrapping around the branch or trunk of the tree. The second strategy is the removal of bark patches by scraping away layers of bark rather than gouging at it to reach the sap. This is evident on trees with larger damage and flatter, more broad bark removal compared to the sharp linear cuts of transverse gouges. Kākā have also been observed pulling bark from invasive pine trees (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) and native tree species like kauri. Sap feeding behaviour appears to be an important resource for kākā in many regions across New Zealand and for all individuals in kākā populations. It is likely a supplementary food for females before breeding but is also an important supplement to male kākā and kākā of all ages. Tree sap is a high-energy food source that can help kākā meet their energy requirements. Feeding observations were recorded in six kākā in a study of North Island kākā in pine tree (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) plantations, where it was found that 24% of their diet was made up of tree sap. This is an example of a specific North Island population that relied more on tree sap than other kākā populations. However, with reintroduced populations of kākā in Wellington, tree damage from kākā accessing tree sap has become more commonplace throughout the city. The behaviour also shows the kākā&#x27;s high intelligence as often kākā, before sap feeding, test various points of a tree, looking for ideal locations like weak spots to begin removing bark.

==== Honeydew and nectar-feeding ====
Like tree sap, kākā feed on honeydew and nectar to access high-energy food sources to meet their energy requirements. Kākā have evolved a narrow and fimbriated tongue to lap up sap, honeydew and nectar. This specialised brush tongue seen in kākā helps kākā more efficiently consume sap, nectar and honeydew by allowing them to lap up these resources more easily. This adaptation of having a tongue covered in small hair like structures help kākā utilise sap, honeydew and nectar; it is most pronounced in kākā compared to kea and kākāpō. Flower nectar makes up a large proportion of kākā&#x27;s diet during the summer months when more flowers are in bloom. They use their bristle tongues to access the nectar within flowers and often use their foot to pull the flower closer or pull it off to access the nectar. Kākā also frequently utilise honeydew. This is another high-energy resource created by scale insects that kākā utilise in a similar way to sap and nectar using their bristle tongues to lap up the honeydew.

==== Insect larvae foraging ====
A proportion of the kākā diet is made up of invertebrates, particularly wood-boring beetles. A significant part of the behaviour and diet of some populations of kākā is boring into trees to dig insect larvae out like huhu beetle and kanuka longhorn beetle (&quot;Ochrocydus huttoni&quot;) larvae. North Island kākā tend to forage for the huhu beetle larvae, and the South Island kākā tend to feed on the kanuka longhorn beetle larvae as well as huhu beetle larvae. They have been observed for up to two hours in the same location, trying to remove one larva. Kākā often locate where larvae are in trees by seeing the damage on the side of the tree caused by the boring insect. However, it has been shown that often, kākā can expend more energy trying to access the invertebrate larvae in the tree cavity than what they gain from consuming the larvae. This behaviour is suggested as a substitute feeding method when other resources are less available, such as fruit, berries, and nectar. The behaviour also tends to occur more often in males, potentially due to their larger beak size compared to females.

== Conservation status ==
New Zealand kākā are considered vulnerable, having greatly declined across their traditional range as a result of habitat loss, predation by introduced predators such as cats, rats, possums and stoats, and competition from wasps and bees for the honeydew excreted by scale insects. A closely related species, &quot;Nestor productus&quot;, the Norfolk kākā, became extinct in 1851 for similar reasons. New Zealand kākā are absolutely protected under New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953. The species is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning international export/import (including parts and derivatives) is regulated. Under the New Zealand Threat Classification System (NZTCS), the North Island kaka is considered to be &quot;At Risk&quot;, but with an increasing population, while the South Island kaka is considered &quot;Threatened&quot; and &quot;Nationally Vulnerable&quot;.

=== Predation ===
As cavity nesters with a long incubation period that requires the mother to stay on the nest for at least 90 days, New Zealand kākā are particularly vulnerable to predation. Stoats were the main cause of death of nesting adult females, nestlings and fledglings, but possums were also important predators of adult females, eggs and nestlings. There is strong evidence that predation of chicks and females has led to a serious age and sex imbalance, even amongst ostensibly healthy populations.

In parts of the country, the Department of Conservation and local conservation groups have attempted to control predators of New Zealand kākā through the use of traps, ground baiting and the aerial deployment of sodium fluoroacetate (1080). Where pest control has been carried out, there has been a significant recovery of New Zealand kākā populations. For example, in Pureora Forest Park 20 kākā were radio-tracked in an area to be treated with aerial 1080 in 2001. In nearby Waimanoa Forest, which was not to be treated with 1080, nine kākā were radio-tracked. In the area where 1080 was used, all 20 birds survived that season. Of the nine birds tagged in the untreated area, five were killed by predators that same season.

=== Competition ===
Research has shown that honeydew is very important for breeding New Zealand kākā, especially for those breeding in southern beech forests. The difficult nature of controlling wasps makes the future of the New Zealand kākā very uncertain.

Competition has also been observed over gouges in trees created by kākā to access tree sap. This occurs when another kākā approaches a sap-feeding kākā and displaces it from the tree wound it was sap-feeding at. On occasion, tūī can compete with kākā over tree wounds, with kākā sometimes chasing tūī away from particular tree wounds where they are accessing tree sap. Kākā also sometimes show aggressive behaviour to other kākā, particularly during the breeding season. This includes threat displays such as raising the wings and facing the other bird while performing a loud call.

== Māori culture ==
The kākā is a taonga species recognised as a species of high cultural significance in New Zealand. The kākā plays a significant part in Māori mythology, with it often being seen as a symbol of power, authority, and prestige. The kākā also has a personified parent named Tū Mātāika with a Māori proverb about the kākā describing the great number of descendants of Tū Mātāika. This refers to the once great abundance of kākā across New Zealand. Kākā pōria, which are small rings made from bone, pounamu, and other stones, were used to keep kākā as mōkai (captive or pet). They were usually captured as nestlings and grew tame as they progressed into adulthood.

== Human interaction ==
Re-introduction of North Island kākā at Zealandia in Wellington, combined with conservation efforts, has led to a large increase in the population of the birds in the city. Many kākā visit residential gardens and reserves, and this in turn has led to more interactions with people. People have been feeding the birds unsuitable food such as nuts, various grains and cheese. Feeding kākā has resulted in metabolic bone disease in kākā chicks. In 2016 80% of the kākā chicks being monitored by the Wellington City Council died from this disease. There have also been instances of kākā nesting in the roofs of houses. This interaction in Wellington has reportedly caused $3000 worth of damage from minor damage to outdoor furniture, buildings and trees. Property damage also occurred in areas closer to kākā sanctuaries like Zealandia. This created some negative attitudes towards kākā in some communities and divided opinions on feeding wild kākā in residential areas, especially between neighbours who do and do not feed kākā. However, most people report positive attitudes to the reintroduction of kākā in Wellington.

<text>The Ecuadorian hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita compressus&quot;) also known as the Pacific hermit crab is a species of land hermit crab. It is one of the two land hermit crabs commonly sold in North America as pets, the other being the Caribbean hermit crab (&quot;C. clypeatus&quot;).

==Features and identification==

&quot;Coenobita compressus&quot; is a member of the phylum Arthropoda and the class Malacostraca. They can be up to in length and are thought to be one of the smallest species of land hermit crabs. They have four walking legs, a small pincer, a large pincer, and antennae. Their eyes are more oval-shaped when compared to the round eyes of Caribbean hermit crabs and are thicker. Their big claw has four or five small ridges on the upper part. The tips of the second pair of walking legs are darker than the rest of the leg. The abdomen of the Ecuadorian hermit crab is short and fat.

Ecuadorian hermit crabs vary greatly in colour, some are bright (yellow, dark grey, or orange), but more often they are a tan colour. Sometimes, they may have a blue or green tint to their bodies or the insides of their legs. They also have comma-shaped eyes, unlike the &quot;purple pincher&quot; (&quot;C. clypeatus&quot;), which has dot-shaped eyes.

When choosing a shell, they tend to give preference to shells with a wide and round aperture.

==Habitats==
Native to the Americas, these hermit crabs live on the Pacific seashore ranging from Mexico to Chile, and tend to gather around tidal pools and high-tide zone. Their bodies have adapted to this seashore existence, and in captivity, they require access to seawater, as they must metabolize the salt in it and bathe in it to maintain gill moisture. Failure to provide access to seawater (real or artificial) will result in death.

Like most hermit crabs, they are scavengers and consume seaweed, dead fish, and other detritus that washes up on the shore.

==Studies==
&quot;Coenobita compressus&quot; prefers the odors of foods that they have not recently eaten. Hermit crabs exposed to one food for at least 9 hours preferred foods having other odors for the next 6 hours. This short-term avoidance of food (like human beings who get bored with the same meals over and over again) compels the crabs to seek out a wider range of food. This might be advantageous to the crabs, possibly through the consumption of a more nutritionally balanced diet. Ecuadorian hermit crabs can make a chirping sound to communicate with each other.

==As pets==
Hermit crabs overall were once seen as a &quot;throwaway pet&quot; that would live only a few months, but species such as &quot;C. clypeatus&quot; have a 23-year lifespan if properly treated and some have lived longer than 32 years. Similarly, Ecuadorian hermit crabs have been known to live to over 30 years. In general, and despite their moniker, hermit crabs are social animals that do best in groups.

<text>MaryAnn Mihychuk (born February 27, 1955) is a Canadian politician from Manitoba. She was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 2015, representing the riding of Kildonan—St. Paul for the Liberal Party of Canada, and served as Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour in the federal Cabinet until the January 10, 2017, cabinet shuffle by Justin Trudeau. She lost her seat in the House of Commons in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

She was previously a cabinet minister in the government of Manitoba New Democratic Premier Gary Doer from 1999 to 2004. Mihychuk resigned to run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 2004, but was defeated by Sam Katz.

==Life and career==
Mihychuk was born in Vita, Manitoba, the daughter of Katherine Salamandyk and Métro Mihychuk. She received the degrees of Bachelor of Arts from the University of Winnipeg in 1979, and Master of Science from Brock University in 1984. She is certified as a Practicing Professional Geoscientist. Mihychuk worked as a geologist in Newfoundland and Labrador from 1984 to 1986 and in Manitoba from 1986 to 1992. In 1992, she married Kenneth Marshall. She has two daughters, Sarah Mihychuk and Hannah Mihychuk, and a son, John.

Mihychuk was first elected as a Winnipeg School Division Trustee first in 1989 and was re-elected in 1992.

===Provincial politics===
She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1995, defeating Liberal leader Paul Edwards by 3,109 votes to 2,853 in the Winnipeg constituency of St. James. The 1995 election was won by Gary Filmon&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives. Mihychuk and 22 other New Democrats formed the Official Opposition.

The NDP won the following general election in 1999. This time Mihychuk was elected in the constituency of Minto, defeating Progressive Conservative Harry Lehotsky by 4,534 votes to 2,035. Gary Doer was sworn in as Premier and named Mihychuk Minister of Industry, Trade and Mines.

Mihychuk was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 2003, winning almost 70% of the votes cast in her constituency. On November 4, 2003, she was named Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade, with responsibility for International Relations Coordination.

===Post-provincial politics===
Mihychuk resigned from cabinet and the legislature on May 21, 2004, to seek election as Mayor of Winnipeg. The 2004 election was held to determine the successor to former mayor Glen Murray. Murray had resigned to seek election to the House of Commons of Canada. Mihychuk&#x27;s campaign platform focussed on increasing Winnipeg&#x27;s population. Mihychuk lost this election, winning ten percent of the municipal electorate&#x27;s vote.

In 2005 Mihychuk relocated to Toronto, Ontario to work for the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) as Director of Regulatory Affairs.

Mihychuk supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s campaigns to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995 and 2003.

===Federal politics===
In 2014, Mihychuk was chosen as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Kildonan—St. Paul for the 2015 federal election, defeating the previous Liberal candidate, Victor Andres. Mihychuk said that her views on the economy and social views were closer to those of the federal Liberals. She was subsequently elected to the seat. She was the Minister of Employment, Workforce, and Labour from November 4, 2015, until a cabinet shuffle in January 2017.

She was accused of being abusive and causing confusion by the Canadian Red Cross after visiting a shelter for evacuees from forest fires affecting Garden Hill First Nation in 2018, a formal complaint was filed against her to the federal government. She was accused of adding to the chaos and suggesting to evacuees that they should go to Selkirk, Manitoba, and on her advice 40–50 evacuees waited in the cold with their belongings for transportation to Selkirk that never arrived. Indigenous people had requested her assistance because the Red Cross was ignoring them and placing families in large centre mixed in with a population that had people convicted of sexual offenses. Mihychuk pushed the Red Cross to treat the evacuees with respect and only after advocating were the large centres closed down and the evacuees placed into hotels. While Red Cross officials were upset, the evacuees expressed their satisfaction with the outcome to Indigenous MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette.

<text>The Quarry is the main recreational park in Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, England. The park was created in 1719 and encompasses 29 acres. It is listed Grade II in Historic England&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens. With a location within easy walking distance of Shrewsbury town centre, Shrewsbury Sixth Form College and Shrewsbury School, it is the most heavily used public park within the county.

==Sites of interest==
===The Dingle===
A centrepiece to the park is The Dingle, a former stone quarry, but now a landscaped sunken garden. Between 1324 and 1588 it was known as the Wet or Water Quarry because it was liable to flood. It was quarried for both stone and clay. The project to clear out the Dingle and then plant it was funded by the Shropshire Horticultural Society, with the ornamental gardens opened in 1879, featuring many flower beds and borders, with ponds and fountains. Although there are still formal planted beds, in recent years the planting scheme has become more naturalistic in style, reflecting modern tastes.

==== Shoemakers&#x27; Arbour ====
This important structure is associated with the town&#x27;s unusual history for drama and pageantry and he dedication of Kingsland to that purpose in Tudor and Medieval times, and originally sited in Kingsland, it was moved to the Dingle in 1879. It dates from 1679 and includes statues of Crispin and Crispinian, the patron saints of shoemakers. The gateway is built of stone, and bears the date of 1679 and the initials, H. P. and E. A.; the wardens of the Shoemakers&#x27; guild at that time. The Shoemakers&#x27; Arbour plays a large part in the song &quot;Thomas Anderson&quot; by David Harley that describes the execution in 1752 of a participant in the Jacobite rising of 1745.

==== Statue of Sabrina ====

A statue of the goddess Sabrina was presented by the Earl of Bradford in 1879. The inscription on the statue is based on a poem by John Milton (1608–1674). In myth, Sabrina (Welsh: Hafren) was a nymph who drowned in the Severn.

==== War memorial ====

Shropshire county&#x27;s main war memorial, the focus for Remembrance Sunday, is situated within the Quarry. near St Chad&#x27;s Terrace. It consists of a bronze winged and armoured statue of St. Michael under a canopy designed like a classical Greek temple in the form of six Ionic columns supporting a circular dome. It is inscribed: &#x27;Remember the gallant men and women of Shropshire who gave their lives for God, King and country 1914-18 and 1939–45&#x27;.

This War Memorial was built in 1922-3. It was designed by George Hubbard and Son and built in Portland stone. The richly embellished floor shows the County, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) Regimental arms and French Croix de Guerre on a gold mosaic background. The seals or arms of the six boroughs of the County are embossed on the inside frieze. The bronze figure of Saint Michael beneath the canopy is by Allan G Wyon and was cast at the foundry of A.B. Burton of Thames Ditton.

St. Michael the Archangel is viewed as the field commander of the Army of God. In late medieval Christianity, Michael, together with Saint George, became the patron saint of chivalry. Michael is also considered in many Christian circles as the patron saint of the warrior.

===== Bandstand =====

This bandstand, which stands below the entrance to the Quarry in Shrewsbury, was built in 1879 and donated to the park by the Shropshire Horticultural Society. The bandstand is used by military bands during Shrewsbury Flower Show. Other uses include as a dry place for people practising fire arts, and other activities which require shelter from the rain. Between 2006 and 2008 the bandstand had a DJ playing music on most Saturdays during the day.

===== Harley’s Stone =====

This small boulder is said to be the anchor stone of the last surviving grazing allotment in the Quarry. This belonged to the Harley family, livestock were tied to the stone by a leash of no more than 16 yards in length. These &#x27;circular&#x27; allotments once made use of the entire herbage ensuring that the grass was kept short through the entire year. This stone marked the boundary made by the Harley family of Rossall near Bicton who refused to sell their piece of land to the corporation when the rest of the Quarry was being acquired in the 18th century.

==== Hercules Statue ====
There is a statue of Hercules, which stands at the foot of the Quarry Walk, where it connects with Victoria Avenue, besides the River Severn. It originally stood in the courtyard of Condover Hall until it was removed in 1804 and relocated in Shrewsbury. The original statue was lead but because of its value the statue in situ is a replica.

==== Victoria Avenue ====

The broad traffic-free avenue that runs along the River Severn is called Victoria Avenue and the largest avenue that runs downhill from the town centre to Victoria Avenue is Gloucester Avenue. The latter was known as Central Avenue, but in 1974 Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester came to the Shrewsbury Flower Show and the avenue was dedicated to her.

A special feature of Victoria Avenue are the rows of lime trees on each side. These are actually the second generation of trees to be planted. Thomas Wright first planted avenues of hybrid limes in the Quarry in 1719. They had reached heights of over 40 metres by the early 1950s when they were felled on the orders of Percy Thrower. A falling branch had killed a young girl and so the trees were considered unsafe. It was felt that the trees had originally been planted too close together. The felled trees were found to contain bee and wasp nests, large amounts of mistletoe and much dead wood. They were replaced with hybrid limes at much wider spacing which are now reaching maturity. The clone that was planted produces a large number of epicomic sprouts which have to be pruned off annually.Opposite the School Boathouse is the remains of a wooden post used by a ferry crossing the river.In 1900, there were two ferry boats working on the River Severn in the Quarry, with the other operating across the river where Porthill Suspension Bridge has been sited since 1922.

==== Other features and culture ====

There are numerous memorial benches and plaques within the Dingle. 

Of special interest is a bust of the gardening broadcaster Percy Thrower, who for many years was also the Parks Superintendent for Shrewsbury.

According to local legend, the Dingle is haunted by the ghost of Mrs Foxall, a local woman who was burnt at the stake nearby in the sixteenth century as punishment for witchcraft and murder.

==Events==
===Shrewsbury Flower Show===
The Shrewsbury Flower Show is an annual event held in mid-August over two days (in recent times Friday and Saturday) within The Quarry. The show is organised by the Shropshire Horticultural Society and is one of the largest events of its type in the United Kingdom. It is also one of the longest-running shows in the country and featured in the 2005 Guinness Book of Records as the &#x27;longest-running flower show&quot; in the world.&#x27;

===Live music===
Recently The Quarry has been used as a live music venue, with performances in 2005 from Jools Holland and Will Young. The Sugababes appeared in July 2006. Such events are not without controversy within the town, with complaints that the public park is closed to all but paid ticket-holders during these events, preventing its use for informal recreation. A controversial live-music event by Jessie J in July 2012 was heavily criticised for leaving the Quarry like a mud bath and for excessive litter, with fears that future events may have been put in jeopardy.

===Other events===
The river is a focus for the Shrewsbury Regatta and Dragon Boat Races in May and June. As The Quarry is open space close to the town centre, it is often used in civic festivals, such as the annual Darwin Festival. Shrewsbury Carnival and Show is held here every June.

==The Quarry in flood==
Although the Quarry is sloping, low-lying parts are part of the natural overflow area for the River Severn in times of high flows. As a relatively low intensity land use, the Quarry is allowed to flood preferentially to other more built-up areas of the town.

The boat launching jetty by Porthill Bridge is under water many times during a typical winter, with Victoria Avenue and the children&#x27;s playground flooded perhaps once a year. Every few years, river flows are such that flood water almost reaches the Bandstand. A causeway of higher ground has been constructed to allow people to walk from Porthill Bridge towards St Chad&#x27;s Church during most flood events.

<doc id="966711" wikidata="Q183178" url="?curid=966711" title="Clive Owen">
<text>Clive Owen (born 3 October 1964) is an English actor. He first gained recognition in the United Kingdom for playing the lead role in the ITV series &quot;Chancer&quot; from 1990 to 1991. He received critical acclaim for his work in the film &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; (1991) before earning international attention for his performance as a struggling writer in &quot;Croupier&quot; (1998). In 2005, he won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in the drama &quot;Closer&quot; (2004).

Owen has played leading roles in films such as &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), &quot;Derailed&quot; (2005), &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), and &quot;The International&quot; (2009). In 2012, he earned his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his role in &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot;. He played Dr. John W. Thackery on the Cinemax medical drama series &quot;The Knick&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama nomination. In 2021, Owen starred in the psychological romance horror miniseries &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story&quot; and also portrayed President Bill Clinton in the third season of &quot;American Crime Story&quot;. He then had further television roles in &quot;A Murder at the End of the World&quot; (2023) and &quot;Monsieur Spade&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Owen was born in Keresley, Coventry (then in Warwickshire), the fourth of five sons born to Pamela ( Cotton) and Jess Owen. His father, a country and western singer, left the family when Owen was three years old, and despite a brief reconciliation when Owen was 19, they have remained estranged. He has described his childhood as &quot;rough&quot;. 

While initially opposed to drama school, he changed his mind in 1984, after a long and fruitless period of searching for work. After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he worked at the Young Vic, performing in several Shakespearean plays.

==Career==

===Early career===
Initially, Owen&#x27;s career was in television. In 1988, he starred as Gideon Sarn in a BBC production of &quot;Precious Bane&quot; and the Channel 4 film &quot;Vroom&quot; before the 1990s saw him become a regular on stage and television in the UK, notably his lead role in the ITV series &quot;Chancer&quot;, followed by an appearance in the Thames Television production of &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;.

He won critical acclaim for his performances in the Stephen Poliakoff film &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; (1991) about a brother and sister who embark on an incestuous love affair. He subsequently appeared in &quot;The Magician&quot;, &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot;, &quot;Century&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;An Evening with Gary Lineker&quot;, &quot;Doomsday Gun&quot;, &quot;Return of the Native&quot; and a Carlton production called &quot;Sharman&quot;, about a private detective. In 1996, he appeared in his first major Hollywood film &quot;The Rich Man&#x27;s Wife&quot; alongside Halle Berry before finding international acclaim in a Channel 4 film directed by Mike Hodges called &quot;Croupier&quot; (1998). In &quot;Croupier&quot;, he played the title role of a struggling writer who takes a job in a London casino as inspiration for his work, only to get caught up in a robbery scheme. In 1999, he appeared as an accident-prone driver in &quot;Split Second&quot;, his first BBC production in about a decade.

Owen starred in &quot;The Echo&quot;, a BBC1 drama, before starring in the film &quot;Greenfingers&quot;, about a criminal who goes to work in a garden. He appeared in the BBC1 mystery series &quot;Second Sight&quot;. In 2001, he provided the voice-over for &quot;Walk On By&quot;, a BBC2 documentary about popular music, as well as starring in a highly acclaimed theatre revival of Peter Nichols&#x27; play &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, about a couple with a severely handicapped daughter.

===Subsequent work===
Owen became known to North American audiences in the summer of 2001 after starring as &quot;The Driver&quot; in &quot;The Hire&quot;, a series of short films sponsored by BMW and made by prominent directors. He appeared in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Gosford Park&quot;. He appeared in the 2002 film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. In 2003, he reteamed with director Mike Hodges in &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot;. He starred in &quot;Beyond Borders&quot; as well as King Arthur in &quot;King Arthur&quot;, for which he learned to ride a horse.

He appeared in the Royal National Theatre debut of the hit play &quot;Closer&quot;, by Patrick Marber, which was produced as a film in 2004. He played Dan in the play, and played Larry in the film version. His portrayal of Larry in the film received very favourable reviews, as well as the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He noted that the expectations of him since the Oscar nomination have not changed the way he approaches film-making, stating &quot;I try, every film I do, to be as good as I can and that&#x27;s all I can do.&quot;
After &quot;Closer&quot;, he appeared in &quot;Derailed&quot; alongside Jennifer Aniston, the comic book thriller &quot;Sin City&quot; as the noir antihero Dwight McCarthy and as a mysterious bank robber in &quot;Inside Man&quot;. Despite public denials, Owen had been rumoured to be a possible successor to Pierce Brosnan in the role of James Bond. A public opinion poll in the United Kingdom in October 2005 by SkyNews found that he was the public&#x27;s number one choice to star in the next instalment of the series. In that same month, however, it was announced that fellow British actor Daniel Craig would become the next James Bond. In an interview in the September 2007 issue of &quot;Details&quot;, he claimed that he was not offered or approached concerning the role. 

In 2006, Owen spoofed the Bond connection by making an appearance in the remake of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; in which he plays a character named &quot;Nigel Boswell, Agent 006&quot; (when he introduces himself to Inspector Clouseau, he quips that Owen&#x27;s character is &quot;one short of the big time&quot;).

In 2006, Owen starred in &quot;Children of Men&quot;. The film was nominated for various awards, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; Owen worked on the screenplay, although he was uncredited. The next year he starred alongside Paul Giamatti in the film &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot; and appeared as Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett&#x27;s Elizabeth I of England in the film &quot;&quot;. He appeared in the Christmas special of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant show &quot;Extras&quot;. 

Owen starred in &quot;The International&quot; (2009), a film which he described as a &quot;paranoid political thriller&quot;. He played the lead in &quot;The Boys Are Back&quot;, an Australian adaptation of the book &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; by Simon Carr.

In June 2010, it was announced that Owen and Nicole Kidman would star in an HBO film about Ernest Hemingway and his relationship with Martha Gellhorn entitled &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot;. James Gandolfini served as executive producer to the film, written by Barbara Turner and Jerry Stahl. The film was directed by Philip Kaufman and released in 2012. Owen played the lead in &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot;, a joint UK/Ireland production about a young mother who is involved with Irish republicanism. It co-starred Andrea Riseborough, Gillian Anderson, and Aidan Gillen, and was directed by James Marsh. In April 2010, he was cast as the lead in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo&#x27;s horror-thriller &quot;Intruders&quot;.

Owen starred in the film &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, directed by Guillaume Canet, alongside French actress Marion Cotillard. It was released in June 2013 at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, Owen made his Broadway debut in a revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times&quot; at the American Airlines Theatre. He was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2016 Berlin Film Festival.

In October 2017, Owen returned to Broadway as Rene Gallimard in a revival of David Henry Hwang&#x27;s &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; at the Cort Theatre in New York City.

In 2019, Owen played the role of the defrocked Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon in the West End theatre production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre. Also in 2019, he played Dovidl Rapaport in &quot;The Song of Names.&quot; He played Bill Clinton in the miniseries &quot;Impeachment: American Crime Story&quot;.

==Personal life==
Owen met his wife, Sarah-Jane Fenton, in 1988, when they were in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet &quot; at the Young Vic Theatre in London. They began dating shortly after and married in March 1995. 

Owen became a patron of the Electric Palace Cinema in Harwich, Essex, and launched an appeal for funds to repair deteriorating elements of the historic building.

Owen is a supporter of Liverpool FC and narrated the fly on the wall documentary series &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Kennebecasis River ( ) is a tributary of the Saint John River in southern New Brunswick, Canada. The name Kennebecasis is thought to be derived from the Mi&#x27;kmaq &quot;Kenepekachiachk&quot;, meaning &quot;little long bay place.&quot; It runs for approximately 95 kilometres, draining an area in the Caledonia Highlands, an extension of the Appalachian Mountains, inland from the Bay of Fundy.

==Description==
The river&#x27;s source is in the foothills of Albert County, near the rural community of Goshen. It runs southwest through the community of Penobsquis; several tributaries join the river in the town of Sussex several kilometres further west.

Between Sussex and the river&#x27;s junction with the Saint John River at Millidgeville (part of Saint John), the Kennebecasis River runs through a well-defined river valley which has become one of the primary land transportation routes in the southern part of the province, hosting the Route 1 expressway and the Canadian National Railway line to the Port of Saint John.

The upper two thirds of the Kennebecasis River passes through pastoral rural countryside consisting of Acadian mixed forest and various agricultural areas, notably dairy farms around Sussex. Southwest of Sussex, the river becomes increasingly larger as it passes the communities of Valley Waters and Hampton, before it empties into a delta-like area informally called the Hampton Marsh. West of Hampton, the Kennebecasis flows in a broad fjord-like glacial valley which defines the southern side of the Kingston Peninsula. At its junction with the Saint John River, the Kennebecasis River helps to form Grand Bay.

Several large islands can be found in the river, such as Kennebecasis Island just off-shore from Summerville on the Kingston Peninsula, and uninhabited (with the exception of a few summer cottages &amp; an Off The Grid Community on the southern part of the island) Long Island, located near Rothesay.

===Hampton Marsh===
==Lower Kennebecasis River valley==

The communities of Nauwigewauk, Quispamsis and Rothesay become increasingly urban as the river approaches its junction with the Saint John River. The lower Kennebecasis River valley is largely a suburban/exurban region for Saint John. The area is outside the summer &#x27;fog belt&#x27; for the Bay of Fundy and enjoys more sunshine year-round than Saint John. It is also substantially colder in winter than the Bay of Fundy-climate-controlled city proper.

&quot;The Valley&quot; or &quot;KV&quot;, as the lower Kennebecasis River valley is called by locals, has experienced dramatic population growth over the past several decades, largely owing to the development of Route 1 through the area in the 1960s. Once a minor dormitory suburb of the Saint John area, the towns of Rothesay and Quispamsis constitute a moderately-sized population centre with some commercial development. Saint John, by contrast, has suffered from an erosion of its tax and commercial bases as population and businesses have migrated away from the urban core.

The Kennebecasis effectively isolates the Kingston Peninsula from suburban sprawl. It is crossed by two ferry services, the Gondola Point Ferry that connects Gondola Point to Reeds Point, and the Summerville to Millidgeville Ferry that connects Millidgeville to Summerville. A third ferry service, the Kennebecasis Island Ferry connects Summerville to Kennebecasis Island. Several controversial proposals have been made in recent decades to build a highway bridge over the Kennebecasis River to the Kingston Peninsula however this has been rejected by numerous provincial governments citing financial pressures as well as the likelihood of suburban sprawl occurring in this farming area as a result.

The Kennebecasis River valley communities have rich histories; many were settled by Loyalists in the 1780s and 1790s who traveled upriver from Saint John to land grants offered by the British government. They became more prominent during the late 1800s following construction of the European and North American Railway through the area, which allowed for easier travel between Saint John and Moncton. Over the ensuing decades, the lower Kennebecasis River valley became a summer vacation destination for wealthy Maritimers, Americans and central Canadians. It is also a popular cruising destination for recreational boating as a result of its connection with the navigable portions of the Saint John River.

<text>Attingham Park is an English country house and estate in Shropshire. Located near the village of Atcham, on the B4380 Shrewsbury to Wellington road. It is owned by the National Trust and is a Grade I listed building.

Attingham Park was built in 1785 for Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick, replacing a house on the site called Tern Hall. With money he inherited, along with his title, he commissioned the architect George Steuart to design a new and grander house to be built around the original hall. The new country house encapsulated the old property entirely, and once completed it was given the new name &#x27;Attingham Hall&#x27;.

The Estate comprises roughly , and the extensive of parkland and gardens of Attingham have a Grade II* Listed status. Over 560,000 people visited in 2022/23, placing it as the most popular National Trust property.

Across the parkland there are five Grade II* listed buildings, including the stable block, the Tern Lodge toll house which can be seen on the B4380, and two bridges that span the River Tern. There are also 12 Grade II listed structures including the retaining walls of the estate, the bee house, the ice house, the walled garden, the ha-ha, which can be seen in the front of the mansion, and the Home Farm.

==History==
===Pre-history, Roman and Early Medieval===
The archaeology of Attingham Park is diverse covering many different periods of history and human habitation. People have lived around the area of the estate for around 4,000 years since the Bronze Age, utilising the rich alluvial soils for agriculture. There are seven scheduled ancient monuments across the wider estate including an Iron Age settlement, Roman forts and a significant portion of the fourth largest civitas in Roman Britain, Viroconium, on the site of the nearby village of Wroxeter. A recent large scale magnetometer survey has revealed the existence of two Roman villas and a cemetery along with evidence of some Iron Age or Romano-British farms. There are also traces of several Roman roads to the west of Wroxeter.

There are also the archeological remains of Saxon palaces.,

By the mediaeval period, a village, Berwick Maviston, is recorded. This has not survived, but today the remains of a moat and fish ponds from the old manor can still be seen. The manor and the village dated back to the Norman invasion, being mentioned in the 1086 Domesday book. This original manor fell into disrepair in mediaeval times. It was replaced with another house known as &#x27;Grant&#x27;s Mansion&#x27; was recorded on the site in 1790. The village was occupied until the 1780s when the newly created Baron Berwick built Attingham and removed the village from his land. The title of Baron Berwick comes from the name of this village.

===The arrival of the Hill family===

The associations of the Hill family with the area of the Park can be traced to a civic benefaction of the Tudor statesman Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, convenor of the Geneva Bible translation, who built the first stone bridge over the river here: this was part of his wider civic projects across London and Shropshire and a portrait of him is still displayed in the mansion. 
Prior to the construction of the current mansion, a building called Tern Hall existed on the site which had been built to his own designs by a relative of Richard Hill of Hawkstone, a relative of &#x27;Old Sir Rowland&#x27;.

===The Hills, Barons of Berwick===
Attingham, including Cronkhill, was the seat of the Barons Berwick from the 1780s until that title became extinct in 1953. On the death of Thomas Henry Noel-Hill, 8th Baron Berwick (1877–1947), who died childless, the Attingham Estate, comprising the mansion and some , was gifted to the National Trust.
Attingham Park was designed by George Steuart, a follower of James Wyatt and encapsulated Tern Hall. It is the only remaining example of a country house by Steuart; he later designed St Chad&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury. It was built from 1782 to 1785 for Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick. Lord Berwick, a former MP for Shropshire, received his title in 1784 during the premiership of William Pitt the Younger, during which he had been instrumental in the reorganisation of the East India Company. The proportions have been criticised: for Simon Jenkins &quot;The façade is uncomfortably tall, almost barracks-like, the portico columns painfully thin&quot;. There is a large entrance court, with an imposing gatehouse, and two single storey wings stretch out to either side of the main block. The main reception rooms were divided into a male and female set on either side of the house.

In 1789, the 1st Lord Berwick died, and his son, Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick, succeeded him. Thomas was a collector and patron of the arts, who commissioned improvements to the house and extensions of the estate. This included commissioning John Nash in 1805 to add the picture gallery, a project that was flawed from the beginning as it suffered from leaks. Constructed using cast iron and curved glass to give the effect of coving, it throws light into the gallery below. In 2013 work began on building a new protective roof above the delicate Nash roof, replacing one installed in the 1970s with a new one which will stop leakage and reduce natural weather wear. The new roof has temperature control, blinds, and UV resistant glass.
The 2nd Lord Berwick reached financial ruin, and all the contents of the house were auctioned in 1827 and in 1829; some were purchased by his two brothers. He died in Italy in 1832, and his brother, William Noel-Hill, 3rd Baron Berwick inherited the estate. William was a diplomat, who was posted in Italy for 28 years; described by Lord Byron as &#x27;the only one of the diplomatists whom I ever knew who really is Excellent’, his collection of Italian art and furniture became part of Attingham&#x27;s collection upon his inheritance. This included the tableware by silversmith Paul Storr. William died in 1842, and his younger brother, Richard Noel-Hill, 4th Baron Berwick inherited; as the youngest son and a clergyman, he had not expected to inherit. His son, Richard Noel Noel-Hill, 5th Baron Berwick, inherited in 1848, and was a careful steward, introducing agricultural modernisations and clearing many of the estate&#x27;s debts that had been accrued by his father and uncles. He lived at Cronkhill on the estate and whilst there invented to eponymous Cronkhill rifle.

Richard was succeeded by his brother, William Noel-Hill, 6th Baron Berwick, in 1861, who was a colonel in the army, and chose to not live at Attingham. William died in 1882 and his nephew Richard Henry Noel-Hill, 7th Baron Berwick, inherited the estate. The 7th Baron had financial problems and sold family heirlooms to pay off debts. He died in 1897.

===20th century===
Thomas Henry Noel-Hill, 8th Baron Berwick (nephew of the 7th baron) inherited the estate. A diplomat, who worked in France, he added French decorative arts to the Attingham collection. He also had electricity installed in the house, and made improvements to the estate.
During the First World War, Attingham was owned by the 8th Lord Berwick who let the property to the Dutch-American Van Bergen family who encouraged the establishment of a hospital for wounded soldiers at Attingham. The hospital opened in October 1914 and by 1918 had 60 beds and an operating theatre. During the War, the 8th Lord Berwick served with the Shropshire Yeomanry and as a diplomat in Paris. Throughout the war years he corresponded with Teresa Hulton, daughter of the artist William Stokes Hulton, whom he married in June 1919. During the war, Teresa Hulton had worked with Belgian refugees in London and as a Red Cross nurse in Italy. The couple dedicated themselves to the renovation of the house, with Hulton taking on responsibility for the conservation of historic textiles. During the Second World War, Edgbaston Church of England Girls&#x27; School was evacuated and lived in part of the house; it later hosted the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force.

===Transfer to the National Trust===
In 1937, negotiations started with the National Trust, and it was donated to them in 1947 as a bequest in the will of the 8th Lord Berwick. His wishes stated that the house and estate should be curated as &quot;a good example of Eighteenth Century Architecture with such contents in the principal rooms as a nobleman of that period would have had&quot;.

==Management under the National Trust==

===Attingham Trust and country house studies===
Between 1948 and 1976, the Shropshire Adult Education College occupied the hall, run by Sir George Trevelyan.

In 1952 the Attingham Trust was set up by George Trevelyan and Helen Lowenthal, the purpose of the Attingham Trust being to offer American curators the opportunity to learn about British country houses. A summer school has been run by the Attingham Trust every year since 1952 and now takes in a diverse array of country houses around the United Kingdom including some National Trust properties. The Attingham name has since been used worldwide with the American Friends of the Attingham Trust being founded in 1962 in New York City, and the Attingham Society being founded in 1985. The Attingham Society covers the whole world and alongside the American Friends its purpose is to keep its members in touch and the continued education and interest of British country houses.

===Restoration and conservation===
Until the 1990s, most of Attingham was closed to the public and visitors could only enter a small number of rooms. From 2000 to 2016, the National Trust ran a research and conservation programme entitled &quot;Attingham Re-discovered&quot;, where conservators worked in view of the public and rooms were re-displayed. Major projects as part of the restoration included replacement of the Picture Gallery&#x27;s carpet, and the replacement of a secondary roof in 2012. In 2014 visitors were invited to participate in identifying outstanding conservation needs in the house.

Attingham is a National Trust regional hub for Herefordshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire.

==Estate buildings==
The estate has a walled garden and an orchard, which grows fresh produce which is used on the estate in the tearooms, and sold to visitors. The walled garden is a rare Georgian survival; a restoration programme began in the 1990s, which led to a return to cultivation of 25% of the garden by 2008. The orchard contains 37 varieties of fruit trees.

Attingham is also the location of one of the two surviving Regency bee houses in the country. The Attingham bee house dates to 1805, has a slate roof to keep the hives dry, and lattice work to enable bees to freely fly in and out.

Attingham&#x27;s Stables were purpose-built at the same time as the house for the first Lord Berwick. Designed by Steuart, they have pyramidal ornamentation and were purposefully sited on the approach to the house, as a demonstration of taste and wealth.

==Parkland==
The Estate comprises roughly , but during the early 1800s extended to twice that amount at . The extensive of parkland and gardens at Attingham have a Grade II* Listed status.

The park was landscaped by Humphry Repton and includes woodlands and a deer park. As of 2018, around 180 fallow deer lived in the park, with number maintained through an annual cull.

The River Tern, which flows through the centre of the estate, joins the larger River Severn at the confluence just south of the Tern Bridge. The rivers were also used by the estate, with ironworks on the Tern that enhanced family fortune in the 1700s. Fish from the rivers were an important resource, both for food and for recreation.

The park is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to it being home to many rare species of invertebrates. There are seven units of SSSI around the park totalling to , nearly three-quarters of the entire estate. The amount of deadwood left by fallen trees around the parkland makes it the perfect habitat for a variety of different species, primarily beetles. Several of these beetle species are adapted to the ecology of ancient trees, including the flat bark beetle, &quot;Notolaemus unifasciatus,&quot; and the silken fungus beetle, &quot;Atomaria barani.&quot; In 2005 a survey of the flora of the park was undertaken by Shropshire Botanical Society, which identified 68 species in the park, that had not been recorded on the last survey undertaken 1969–72. Drainage of the site had an impact on several species, with the loss of &quot;Alopecurus aequalis&quot;, &quot;Rumex maritimus&quot; and &quot;Veronica scutellata,&quot; as well as the additions of dry heathland species such as &quot;Veronica officinalis&quot; and &quot;Ulex europaeus.&quot;

==Cronkhill==

The nearby Italianate villa of Cronkhill on the estate is an important pioneer of this style in England and was designed by the architect, John Nash. It was designed for the 2nd Lord Berwick, around the same time as the Picture Gallery, and the first person to live in it was his land agent, Francis Walford. Cronkhill is located on the wider estate, on a hillside overlooking the River Severn valley and the Wrekin hill. The villa is owned by the National Trust and is privately tenanted. It is open to visitors a few days of the year.

<text>The Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or the FCAT/FCAT 2.0, was the standardized test used in the primary and secondary public schools of Florida. First administered statewide in 1998, it replaced the State Student Assessment Test (SSAT) and the High School Competency Test (HSCT). As of the 2014-2015 school year FCAT was replaced in the state of Florida. The Florida Department of Education later implemented the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) for English Language Arts, Reading, Mathematics and a Writing or typing test. A Comprehensive science test is still used for grades 5 and 8.

== Administration and use ==
The FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) was administered annually, in late February and early to mid-March as well as April, to all public school students in grades three through eleven. Students in grades three through ten are required to take the reading and math portion every year. Private and parochial school students are not required to take the FCAT; most of these schools administer another standardized test instead, such as the Stanford Achievement Test, which is exactly the same as the FCAT NRT, formerly taken by public school students. FCAT Science is administered annually to public school students in the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades. In the fourth, eighth, and tenth grades, public school students take the FCAT Writes exam (formerly called &quot;Florida Writes!&quot; and &quot;FCAT Writing+&quot;); unlike the other tests, the FCAT Writes exam is administered in early February to allow adequate time for scoring before the end of the school year.

Students&#x27; results from the FCAT are compiled to generate a grade for each public school. Under this plan, public schools receive a grade from A to F, based on what percentage of students pass the exams and what percentage of both the entire student body and the bottom 25% of the school demonstrate adequate growth on the exam over their previous year&#x27;s performance. If a school improves a letter grade (including schools that improve from an F to a D), or maintains an A, the state direct-deposits &quot;reward money&quot; to the school in the amount of $75 per student enrolled (this amount used to be $100 before the 2008 recession). This money is not collectively bargained or funneled through the recipient school&#x27;s district. Schools can use the money for staff bonuses, educational equipment, materials related to boosting student performance, or to hire temporary personnel to assist in improving student performance. Most of the money typically goes toward teacher bonuses, however.

As of the 2010-2011 school year it has been called the &quot;FCAT 2.0&quot;
On actual test material it is labeled &quot;FCAT 2.0 Next Generation Sunshine State Standards.&quot;

As of the 2014-2015 school year, many grades do not take the FCAT, and it has now been formally replaced with the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA).

== Promotion and graduation ==
When originally introduced, students in fourth grade were required to pass the reading portion of the test in order to be promoted to the fifth grade. After passage of the No Child Left Behind Act by the United States Congress in 2001, the mandatory passage was moved from fourth grade down to third grade, so as to align Florida with federal statutory requirements. In addition to the third grade requirement, public school students in Florida must also pass the tenth grade FCAT, not only in reading, but also in mathematics, in order to be eligible to receive a high school diploma. Grade 3 and graduation are the only two instances in which federal or state statute require passage of the FCAT; it is given at the other grades for the intention of providing diagnostic information, both on students and schools. However, many counties in the state have adopted other promotional requirements tied to the FCAT, but these are at the discretion of each individual county school board.

Exceptional education (ESE) students were able to waive the FCAT requirement to get a Standard High School Diploma. Those ESE students wishing to obtain a regular high school diploma must score a passing grade on the FCAT or receive a waiver for the FCAT. In order to get the waiver, ESE students must prove that they have taken several steps to try to pass the FCAT and must also show that they have improved every time they have taken the test.

== Options after failing the FCAT ==
A student failing the tenth grade test—that is, the test required for graduation—is allowed approximately five additional opportunities to pass it prior to graduation. Originally, students were given four more chances to pass the test after failing it in 10th grade—in October and March of both their junior and senior years in high school. However, starting in 2006, students were provided an additional test administration during the summer between school years. Students, however, may not retake the Grade 10 FCAT during the summer between their sophomore and junior year because additional time is needed for remediation. If students do not pass the FCAT prior to their scheduled graduation, they may continue to retake it until they pass it to earn a standard high school diploma.

Students completing the minimum number of credits for high school graduation, but not passing the FCAT, may still be allowed to graduate with a certificate of completion. Students may substitute the appropriate subject-area score from either the ACT or SAT. A score of 19 on either the Reading or Mathematics sections of the ACT or a 280 on the Reading and a 370 on the Mathematics sections of the SAT can be used to waive the FCAT requirement after the student has failed the 10th grade test at least three times. Students may earn the concordant passing score prior to taking the FCAT Retake Reading or Mathematics examination three times, but they cannot substitute it in lieu of the passing FCAT score until they have taken the FCAT Retake Reading or Mathematics examination three times. In any case, students will receive a Certificate of Completion that allows for admittance in any state community college for which they have met all graduation requirements apart from passing the FCAT.

Students may also transfer their credits to a private or out-of-state school. Several high schools in North Carolina and South Carolina regularly market in Florida on radio stations annually during the spring and early summer, advertising their &#x27;service&#x27; that is available to &#x27;graduating&#x27; Florida high school students who for whatever reason failed to pass the FCAT and were unable to receive a high school diploma, despite having excellent grade point averages and having completed all course requirements for a high school diploma.

== Scoring ==
The FCAT is either machine-scored or hand-scored, depending on the section. Multiple-choice and gridded-response questions are machine-scored. Performance tasks, such as short-response, extended-response, and essay items, are hand-scored. Like several other standardized tests, the raw score does not directly reflect the final score; some questions are considered to be of a higher difficulty level than others and, therefore, carry more scoring weight. This type of scoring is called Item Response Theory (IRT).

== Criticism ==
Though the system was designed to reward public schools for excellence in teaching, many educators and community members have criticized the program, claiming that the program takes funding from schools which need it most. It has also been criticized by many students and teachers because the schools put too much emphasis on the FCAT and not enough on preparing students for the real world.

The FCAT tests have also come under fire from education groups and parents for encouraging teachers to teach students how to pass a test, rather than to teach students the fundamental material in the core subjects such as English. Another point of criticism on the FCAT is that all students of the same grade take the same test, despite the fact that different students are enrolled in different courses. To compensate for this, in many schools, teachers are directed to cover FCAT skills, regardless of what subject they are supposed to be covering. 

Retired teacher and Lakeland political activist Carol Castagnero has been a harsh critic of the FCAT and ran for several offices to highlight her opposition to the exam. Castagnero called the test &quot;unconstitutional&quot; during her 2006 campaign for governor and stated during her 2008 congressional campaign that &quot;children are being terrorized with a test called FCAT.&quot; 
Writers such as Diane Ravitch claim that high-stakes testing is driven by corporate interests rather than student and teacher interests.

== End-of-Course Assessments (EOC) ==

As of the 2010–11 school year, high school students in Florida in grades (9–12) will be required to pass End-of-Course exams for eligibility to obtain credit in the course in which the EOC exam was administered.

The End-of-Course Assessments are being used to replace the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).The Algebra I EOC exam was the first end-of-course exam to be administered for Florida back in
Spring 2011. As of now, the following EOC exams are being administered for Florida: Algebra I, Geometry, Biology, U.S. History. For the 2010–11 school year, the Algebra I EOC exam was worth 30% of the student&#x27;s final grade. As for the 2011–12 school year, the Algebra I EOC exam was pass or fail. The students must achieve a 70% score (Level 3) or higher to be considered passing the Algebra I EOC exam. For 2012–13 school year, incoming ninth graders must pass not only the Algebra I EOC Exam, but also the Biology EOC to earn a high school diploma. The End-of-Course exams are used to ensure that the student has learned all the content in the course. End-of-Course exams are not required for students with specific learning disabilities.

All EOCs are administered school-wide throughout a week, ensuring no issues occur while students are signing into the program. The exams are taken on a computer, generally on a standard model for all students to guarantee fairness. If the test has not been completed within the 160-minute session, test-takers may continue working for the remainder of the school day.

==FCAT Explorer==
FCAT Explorer was an internet-based tool designed to help Florida students in grades 3–11 pass the FCAT by focusing on mastery of the Sunshine State Standards through several interactive programs. Each student received a unique username and password to access these programs, and schools in Florida often set aside time during the day to work specifically on FCAT Explorer. The domain is now for sale.

<doc id="966728" wikidata="Q7852580" url="?curid=966728" title="Tumbleweeds (comic strip)">
<text>Tumbleweeds is an American comic strip that offered a skewed perspective on life on the American frontier. Writer-artist Tom K. Ryan (June 6, 1926 – March 12, 2019) (who signed the strip &quot;T.K. Ryan&quot;) was very familiar with conventions of the Western genre he satirized. Launched September 6, 1965, the strip was distributed for decades initially by the Register and Tribune Syndicate and later by the King Features Syndicate after its acquisition. After a 42-year run, Ryan retired and, rather than let it become a &quot;zombie strip&quot;, brought &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; to a conclusion on December 30, 2007.

Jim Davis, who created &quot;Garfield&quot;, was Ryan&#x27;s assistant (from 1969 to 1978) while developing another strip, &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot;. and Jon (renamed Garfield)

==Characters and story==
Tumbleweeds is set in and around the town of Grimy Gulch, whose population was stated as 49 (later it was crossed out and incremented to 50, and sometimes is revised down when the villain Snake-Eye leaves town), in an unspecified Western territory. Other locations include the nearby village of the Poohawk tribe of Native Americans, and the United States Army outpost Fort Ridiculous, manned by the 6 7/8 Cavalry.

===Grimy Gulch===
* Tumbleweeds, the main character, is a laconic cowpoke who would rather be anywhere else, but has no real ambition to do anything. Like his namesake, he is content to tumble wherever human foibles may carry him. His worst nightmare is to be caught by – and married to – Hildegard Hamhocker.
* Blossom, Tumbleweeds&#x27; first horse; usually found asleep.
* Epic, Tumbleweeds&#x27; toothless, alcoholic, plug-chewing, sway-backed second horse; once a U.S. Cavalry horse, but drummed out of the service.
* Ace DeSilk, a professional gambler, Tumbleweeds&#x27; best pal and a very smooth operator.
* Judge Horatio Curmudgeon Frump is the magistrate/mayor of Grimy Gulch, a pompous windbag who became Justice of the Peace and boasts that he cannot be bought, but is open to &quot;rental fees&quot;!
* The Sheriff, a man with a ridiculous handlebar moustache, is the short-handed &quot;long arm of the law&quot;.
* Deputy Knuckles, comic relief who does not carry a gun, but has a yo-yo instead.
* Quiet Burp is a diminutive lawman from Texas. His name, a play on Wyatt Earp, is a character name also used in the comic strip &quot;Rick O&#x27;Shay.&quot;
* Hildegard Hamhocker, the town&#x27;s only known woman, is drawn as a stereotypical homely old maid, trying to snag Tumbleweeds as a husband.
* Echo is an orphan girl. Cute and precocious, she knows how to use those qualities when necessary. She is Hildegard&#x27;s adopted niece.
* Pajamas is Echo&#x27;s lazy pet dog — so lazy that when it dreams, it dreams of sleeping.
* Claude Clay is Grimy Gulch&#x27;s undertaker, whose motto is, &quot;You plug &#x27;em ... I plant &#x27;em.&quot;
* Wart Wimble is a gravedigger who works for Clay.
* Blackie is Grimy Gulch&#x27;s saloon keeper.
* Soppy Sopwell is the town drunk.
* Grover Galley is the dotty editor of the &quot;Desert Denouncer&quot; newspaper.
* Percy is a sardonic newsboy and copyboy for the &quot;Denouncer&quot;.
* Dusty Dewlap is a local cattle rancher. He only hires Tumbleweeds when he is desperate.
* Snake-Eye McFoul is an outlaw. He visits Grimy Gulch from time to time to rob the bank.
* Snookie is Snake-Eye&#x27;s little brother, who suffers from an overactive pituitary gland. Though only 12, he appears to be in his thirties. He dresses in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; outfits. Attends the John Wesley Hardin Memorial Elementary School.
* Ham and Beans are muleskinners. Beans, who is short and loud-mouthed, screams at the big, gentle Ham for pampering the mules to the point of carrying them around like infants.
* Slats is a cowboy who is always leaning on the fence.
* Hogarth Hemp is an itinerant hangman who visits the town periodically.
* Clodwell Gunkley who apparently wandered into the wrong strip, according to whoever he encounters, is a semi-effeminate bulk of a man whose speech patterns are somewhat similar to those of Ed Wynn. Ace was pleased to learn that Gunkley had wandered into the strip, because &quot;If there&#x27;s a way in, there&#x27;s a way &quot;out&quot;!&quot;

===The Cavalry===
* Colonel G. Armageddon Fluster, commander of the Cavalry and Fort Ridiculous, is a parody of George Armstrong Custer. The Poohawk Chief refers to him as &quot;Goldilocks&quot; and &quot;Poopsie.&quot;
* The Cavalry consists of a major and troopers under Fluster&#x27;s command.
* The General is Fluster&#x27;s superior.
* Mole Eye, a scout from Fort Ridiculous, is usually shown coming in from the desert with a couple of arrows sticking out of his back. He wears buckskin and has the word &quot;Scout&quot; on his hat.

===The Poohawks===
* The Poohawk Chief is always lamenting his tribe&#x27;s pathetic standing.
* Little Pigeon is the Poohawk Chief&#x27;s daughter, and &quot;a flower among the weeds&quot;.
* Limpid Lizard is a klutzy Poohawk (Indiandom&#x27;s answer to Daffy Duck) and a suitor to Little Pigeon. His word balloons consist of misspelled words and homonyms.
* Puce Moose is the straight man of the Poohawks and one of the more competent braves – especially when compared to his frequent companion, Limpid Lizard.
* Green Gills is a Poohawk who was an early suitor to Little Pigeon.
* Lotsa Luck is a very rich Poohawk, depicted for years as mute and communicating by writing notes. He eventually started using a very posh voice when he had vocal cords cloned from William F. Buckley Jr. surgically implanted. He was a suitor for Little Pigeon.
* Drudgeworth is a chauffeur employed by &quot;Lotsa Luck&quot; to &quot;drive&quot; his horse.
* The Poohawk medicine man.
* Screaming Flea is the smallest Poohawk, formally speaking in ornate word balloons. He is very sensitive about the size of his nose, which is enormous.
* Bucolic Buffalo is the biggest and strongest of Poohawks, but he is not very smart. A running gag is that when anyone [such as &quot;Lotsa Luck&quot;) makes him angry, he sends them &quot;South&quot; (into the ground.) He is another suitor for Little Pigeon.
* Rain Drop is a boy, the only apparent child in the Poohawk Tribe, and at least as smart as some of the adults.
* Hulking Hawk is a fearsome tribe-member and a more suitable suitor to Little Pigeon than Limpid Lizard, according to the Poohawk Chief.
* Purple Polecat operates the trading post.

==Appearances in other media==
&quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; was to be one of the strips animated in Filmation&#x27;s 1978 series &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot; (along with &quot;Broom-Hilda&quot;, &quot;Nancy&quot;, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; and others) and was included in the series&#x27; premiere episode with Alan Oppenheimer doing the voice of the title character. However, after the first episode aired, it was learned that Filmation lacked the rights to use the property, and the segment was removed from future episodes.

&quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; made another animated appearance in &quot;The Fantastic Funnies&quot;, a 1980 television special that showcased numerous comic strips. One of the strips was animated, courtesy of Bill Melendez Productions.

Tumbleweeds Gulch became an MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park attraction, and the strip also was the basis for a Las Vegas stage show. In 1983, &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; was adapted into a musical comedy for high school productions by the same company that adapted the strip &quot;Luann&quot;.

<text>Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad (for short, SSSS) is a television series produced by Tsuburaya Productions, Ultracom Inc. and DIC Productions, L.P., with distribution by All American Television. It ran for a duration of 53 episodes from September 12, 1994 to April 11, 1995 in syndication, as well as on ABC. It was an adaptation of the Japanese tokusatsu series &quot;Gridman the Hyper Agent&quot;.

==Plot==

High school student Sam Collins, the head of a band known as Team Samurai, is zapped during a recording session by a power surge and disappears, only to return seconds later with a strange device attached to his wrist which, at the time, is unremovable. Later after his friends, Amp, Sydney, and Tanker, leave, one of his video game programs, dubbed &quot;Servo&quot;, is subject to a power surge and zaps Sam again just after he has remarked &quot;Cool battle armor!&quot; - this time he is pulled into the digital world and transformed into his creation. As Servo, he roams the digital world and fights monsters dubbed &quot;Mega-Viruses&quot; which are capable of attacking any device on the electrical grid (including the grid itself), Internet or telephone network, usually having real-life consequences far beyond what any standard computer virus would be capable of achieving.

Meanwhile, Malcolm Frink, another student from Sam&#x27;s school, is designing monsters on his home computer when Kilokahn, an escaped military artificial-intelligence program that was presumed destroyed in the power surge, visits him via his computer screen and strikes a Faustian deal with him, transforming his digital monster into a Mega-Virus.

Sam, now as Servo, must enter the digital world and stop Malcolm&#x27;s and Kilokahn&#x27;s Mega-Viruses. Sometimes, when Servo is unable to handle a virus by himself, he would enlist the help of his friends using his Arsenal Programs which could fight the viruses solo, transform, with the help of other Programs, and attach to Servo as armor. Since Team Samurai consists of only three people at any one time following Sam&#x27;s disappearance, only three vehicles are available for use at any one time. When Servo combines with these Programs as armor, he changes his name to either &quot;Phormo&quot; once combined with Drago or &quot;Synchro&quot; once combined with Zenon.

==Characters==
===Team Samurai===

* Michael Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Collins / Servo (portrayed by Matthew Lawrence) - the frontman and guitarist of his band, Team Samurai. He is always willing to help anyone in need or be their friend and often vies for the attention of cheerleader Jennifer Doyle, having been in and out of relationships with her, sometimes even competing with Malcolm Frink for her affections. He even goes so far as to try to be friends with Malcolm, although Malcolm never returns the favor. He is clever and easygoing. He also loves his (unseen) little sister, Elizabeth, though often feels pestered by her shenanigans.
* Tanker (portrayed by Kevin Castro) - Sam&#x27;s best friend, the band&#x27;s drummer, and a somewhat stereotypical athlete. He is particularly adept at school sports, especially football. He has a crush on fellow Team Samurai member Sydney, especially admiring her for her intelligence. He always seems to have a large appetite, and as evidenced in the episode &quot;A Break in the Food Chain&quot;, he goes crazy if he eats nothing for a duration. He also holds a particularly strong dislike for Malcolm Frink. In Syberspace, Tanker&#x27;s uniform was a black biker suit with a black helmet and a see-through visor.
* Sydney &quot;Syd&quot; Forrester (portrayed by Robin Mary Florence) - the band&#x27;s keyboard player and the brains of the group. She is also a good singer, as shown in &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. She is one of North Valley High&#x27;s brightest students, and often displayed a caring personality. She is the object of Tanker&#x27;s affection, and the two enjoy being together. Sydney&#x27;s Syberspace uniform was a pink biker suit with a gold helmet and a see-through visor.
* Amp Ere (portrayed by Troy Slaten) - the team&#x27;s so-called &quot;space cadet&quot; and the band&#x27;s bass player. He becomes the band&#x27;s bass player after revealing to them that his brother (who was originally intended to join them instead of Amp) was going back to college. His intelligence is curious, as he either is clueless to his surroundings or displays some unusual intellect. He has an unorthodox way of performing tasks, such as writing in a notebook using his toes or studying by eating book pages with milk and sugar. To enter Syberspace, he always uses a different phrase to be humorous. Amp&#x27;s uniform consisted of a helicopter helmet and leather jacket. It is later revealed that Amp is really an alien and returns to his own planet with his parents off-screen.
* Lucky London (portrayed by Rembrandt Sabelis) - a surfer and Amp&#x27;s replacement in Team Samurai. His attitude was often laid-back, sometimes to the dismay of Principal Pratchert, and his level of intelligence seemed to be about the same as that of Amp. In Syberspace, Lucky&#x27;s uniform is a red and white jet ski helmet with a black visor and life jacket.

===Supporting characters===
* Jennifer &quot;Jen&quot; Doyle (portrayed by Jayme Betcher) - Sam&#x27;s on-again/off-again girlfriend and a cheerleader at North Valley High School. Malcolm tries to compete for her affections. In the alternate version, Jen is a genius who liked Malcolm befriended and helps Sam get back to his normal universe.
* Principal Pratchert (portrayed by John Wesley) - the school principal who is usually strict, particularly when dealing with antics caused by either Sam and/or Malcolm. When his daughter loses the student council presidency to Malcolm in &quot;The President&#x27;s a Frink&quot;, he initially refuses to recount the votes when Malcolm comments it would make the Education Board suspect he was playing favorites and could do so only when he agreed that Malcolm could use his parking space should he remain victor. Pratchert would reconsider recounting the votes when Mrs. Starkey wisely suggests he does so for not only the sake of his job but also his daughter Yolanda. He does and it is revealed Malcolm rigged the votes using Skorn so he can win, so Pratchert punishes him by making him move his car out of his parking space for an undisclosed time in detention. In &quot;Pratchert&#x27;s Radical Departure&quot;, it is revealed that Pratchert used to be a hippie when he was younger - Malcolm uses this to his advantage by creating a Mega-Virus monster that makes him think he was a hippie again, much to the delight of Lucky London (at least until the Mega-Virus&#x27; destruction by Servo).
* Mrs. Rimba &quot;Cha-Cha&quot; Starkey (portrayed by Diana Bellamy) - the cafeteria lunch lady who often cracks jokes relating to the poor quality of the food she serves, such as enjoying her hobby of riding her motorcycle and being married multiple times. She also seems to have an affinity for Dennis Quaid, as mentioned in a few episodes. She is the only faculty member in North Valley High School who doesn&#x27;t like Malcolm. When Pratchert was depressed over Yolanda refusing to talk to him, Starkey wisely suggests he does the right thing and recount the votes and admits her suspicion that the voting was rigged. After the recount and although Mrs. Starkey pretends to forget suggesting it, she is touched that Pratchert does value her opinion.
* Yolanda &quot;Yoli&quot; Pratchert (portrayed by Kelli Kirkland) - the principal&#x27;s daughter and Jennifer&#x27;s closest friend. She&#x27;s North Valley High School&#x27;s student council president, a position she temporarily loses in &quot;The President&#x27;s a Frink&quot; when Malcolm cheats his way into office (with the help of a virus) but she regains it when Principal Pratchert recounts the votes after Servo defeats the virus sent to change the results. In &quot;What Rad Universe!&quot;, an alternate dimension version of Yolanda finds companionship in Kilokahn making her that dimension&#x27;s version of Malcolm while the Malcolm of that dimension is a good person much like the real Yoli and Sam.
* Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Collins (voiced by Kath Soucie) - Sam&#x27;s &quot;unseen&quot; younger sister who communicates with her brother off-screen through a laundry chute connected from the upstairs. She always plays pranks on her older brother, usually dropping things on top of him through the chute. Liz has shown she does care for Sam and drops a ton of cookies to share with him.

===Villains===
* Kilokahn (voiced by Tim Curry) - short for &quot;Kilometric Knowledge-base Animate Human Nullity&quot;, Kilokahn is a military artificial intelligence program who unleashes computer viruses to attack major computer systems. He derisively refers to humans as &quot;meat-things&quot;. He considers himself the ruler of the digital world and also wishes to take over the real world (Earth) starting with its computer network.
* Malcolm Frink (played by Glen Beaudin) - a loner who dresses in black garb and also attends North Valley High School. He only finds companionship in Kilokahn. Using a special program, he designs the Mega-Viruses which are brought to life by Kilokahn and sent into a specific electronic object. Most of the Mega-Viruses are either designed on his computer or have their drawings image-scanned into his computer so that Kilokhan brings them to life. Sam sees that Malcolm is alone and tries to strike up a friendship with him, but Malcolm rejects his offers stating that he likes being alone. The only exceptions to that rule are in &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; when Malcolm was touched by Sydney&#x27;s apology and in &quot;Kilo is Coming to Town&quot; when he finally realizes that his selfish nature nearly cost Sam his life. Malcolm has a very strong dislike of Tanker and is intimidated by Mrs. Starkey. He derives enjoyment out of hurting others with his computer viruses which he creates and Kilokahn brings to life. In spite of Kilokahn&#x27;s regular betrayal of him and lacking any other &#x27;friends&#x27;, Malcolm always comes back to him. He even purposely restores Kilokahn to his sociopathic self after he is temporarily rendered harmless. In the alternate universe version, Malcolm is a generous and caring person who likes to help people, unlike the alternate Yoli who takes pleasure from harming others.

====Mega-Virus Monsters====
The Mega-Virus Monsters are Kaiju-style computer viruses produced by Malcolm and given sentience by Kilokhan. Malcolm creates the Mega-Viruses since Kilokhan lacks the ability. Only a few Mega-Viruses have the power of speech.

* Kathod - the very first virus that Servo ever fought after Malcolm first met Kilokhan. Kathod was a long-tailed turtle-style creature who mostly crawled on four legs (though once during the battle, he was up on two) and had two volcano holes built into its shell, from which he could erupt powerful fireballs. He could also breathe fireballs at will. Kathod was brought to life by Kilokhan in &quot;To Protect and Servo&quot; to tamper with phone communications on Malcolm&#x27;s request so that Sam would not call Jennifer. Around the same time, a freak accident with Sam&#x27;s computer turns him into Servo for the first time and is transported to where Kathod is causing havoc. After a fierce battle, Kathod was destroyed by Servo&#x27;s Grid Power Punch. In &quot;Just Brown and Servo&quot;, Kathod went into every car engine to tamper with it until it was destroyed by Servo.
* Blink is an armored cycloptic virus with skilled fighting techniques. He was sent into the police files in &quot;Samurize&quot; in order to create false arrests including one on Jennifer during her date with Sam as the police were looking for Sam. He wielded dual metal combat sticks with pointy ends. When he proved to be too much for Servo, Tanker boarded Drago and went into the system to aid Servo. By combining him with Drago, they became Servo&#x27;s upgrade known as Phormo. During this part of the battle, Blink took his two sticks and merged them into one long, double-edged combat stick. It would do him no good in the end though, because he ended up getting taken out of the picture by Phormo, who used a special Grid Power Fire Stream that erupted from the gem on Phormo&#x27;s chest.
* Trembulor - a large black spike-covered virus who, hence his name, could shake wildly, causing tremors in Syberspace. He was sent into the government&#x27;s defense satellites in &quot;Samurize, Guys!&quot; to create an electrical barrier around Sam&#x27;s house, trapping Sam and the rest of Team Samurai inside when they were to appear for a band performance at North Valley High School that night. As Servo, Sam went in to battle the virus. This monster demonstrated the ability to suck up Servo&#x27;s main power right through the gem on Servo&#x27;s chest. Servo lost 80% of his power after this move, so Sydney tried to program some help for him. She, Tanker and Amp were thrust into their vehicles (Borr, Tracto, and Vitor, respectively) for the very first time. They used their vehicles to aid Servo in battle, and soon merged with him to create the Synchro program. Synchro&#x27;s formation turned the battle back in Team Samurai&#x27;s favor, and he proceeded to destroy the virus by launching his Shoulder Drill Missiles directly at him. Servo faced him twice later on in the series, and both times he used the Synchro program to win the battles. In &quot;Foreign Languages&quot;, Trembulor is upgraded with armor where he is sent to make sure that nobody will understand Servo when he calls for help.
* Thorned Virus - a pinkish-colored plant/dinosauric monster with leaf veins patterned throughout its body. It shot white powder from its mouth. Servo and Tanker in Drago battled with it in &quot;Out of Sight, Out of Time&quot;. In &quot;My Virus Ate My Homework&quot;, it was formerly introduced where Kilokhan wanted to send it into the nuclear missiles. When Malcolm was against this plot, Kilokhan brought it to life before Malcolm could delete it. Servo entered the internet through Sydney&#x27;s laptop. As Tanker controlled Drago, he helped Servo fight the Thorned Virus. Servo was able to destroy the Thorned Virus and the missile was averted.
* Krono - a diamond-backed dinosauric Mega-Virus monster. Krono can shoot a blue beam from its mouth. In its first appearance in &quot;Out of Sight, Out of Time&quot;, Malcolm created Krono and had Kilokhan send it into an atomic clock in England to render time in the world meaningless. Upon learning this, Sam became Servo to fight Krono. Sydney joined the battle in Vitor and was hit by Krono&#x27;s attack. Tanker and Amp joined the battle and helped to form Synchro. He was destroyed by Synchro&#x27;s Grid Power Punch. In &quot;To Sleep Perchance To Scream&quot;, he was sent into the tracking satellite that the Navy sent up. Servo (as Synchro) destroyed him again, but it turned out that it was only the first in a series of nightmares Sam would have throughout the episode. In &quot;Syber-Dunk&quot;, Krono creates a barrier that prevents Team Samurai and basketball star Charles &quot;High Jump&quot; Johnson from leaving the school when the latter had a basketball game to play in that night. With the unlikely help of High Jump (who was forced to board Borr), Synchro destroyed Krono again with his Grid Power.
* Plexton is a dinosauric fire virus. He appeared several different times. He first appeared in &quot;Some Like it Scalding&quot; where Kilokhan sent him into the school&#x27;s thermostat to make the temperature scorching hot. Servo fought him in a hot battle until Sydney creates the Samurai Sword and a shield for Servo to use. After Servo beheads and betails Plexton, Malcolm prepared a backup disk so Kilokhan can withdraw Plexton from battle. He later appeared in &quot;The Cold Shoulder&quot; alongside his sister Gramm and battled Servo. Servo tricked the two monsters into attacking each other causing them to turn against each other and it seemed that Plexton had the upper hand in their sibling rivalry. They were taken down by Servo&#x27;s sword (which was powered up by his Grid Power) while the two monsters were distracted. In &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Virucide&quot;, Servo fought Plexton and Gramm again. Servo defeats them with the same tactic. He then appeared with an armor upgrade and went inside Sam&#x27;s blow dryer in the episode &quot;Hair I Stand, Hand to Hand&quot;. With the aid of Sydney and Tanker (who were in the vehicles Jamb and Torb), Servo was able to knock him out this time with his main Grid Power Punch. Servo met him once more in &quot;Hide and Servo&quot; when Kilokhan chose him among Malcolm&#x27;s drawings to see which Mega-Virus Monster will combat Servo after he is uncontrollably thrusted throughout cyberspace. After the battle, Plexton once again retreated (Plexton seemingly lost a portion of his tail while retreating).
* Chronic - a virus made from chromium alloy with a bladed left arm and a pincerlike right arm. On its chest was a red jewel that unleashed a barrier when attacked by beam weapons. First appearing in &quot;Money For Nothin&#x27; and Bits for Free&quot;, Chronic tapped into the city&#x27;s bank accounts making Malcolm rich. Servo then engages Chronic. After Tanker goes in and helps to get Servo unpinned from Chronic while destroying its red jewel, Servo destroyed it. In &quot;Romeo and Joule-Watt&quot;, Malcolm revamps Chronic and sends him into the school&#x27;s stage lights during the school&#x27;s play of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;, Chronic returned to disrupt Sam and Lucky London&#x27;s magic show.
* Skorn (voiced by Neil Ross) is a ninja-style virus, deemed as perhaps the smartest of viruses, second-in-command to Kilokahn, and one of the only few who could actually speak. His combat skills were similar in technique to both a samurai and a ninja and were up to par with Servo&#x27;s, and he wielded different weapons in battle, such as a sword, and a pair of nunchaku (which he also turned into a bo). Skorn also had the ability to create multiple clones of himself. Malcolm created him in &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; to send into the keyboard synthesizer to swap Sydney&#x27;s voice with Tanker&#x27;s voice. Sam transformed into Servo and fought Skorn. Tanker piloted Drago to help Servo. They formed Phormo and used its Lightning Grid Power to destroy Skorn. In &quot;An Unhelping Hand&quot;, Malcolm revived Skorn and has Kilokhan send him into Sydney&#x27;s wristwatch and controlled her hand. Skorn used this to hinder the attempts of Servo&#x27;s friends to help him. Eventually, with Tanker holding back Sydney&#x27;s hand and Amp typing in the computer for Sydney, they managed to send Servo his shield and sword programs to help him when Skorn clones himself. He was killed by Servo when Servo launched his sword/shield directly through Skorn. In &quot;The President&#x27;s a Frink&quot;, Malcolm uses him to fix the school presidential election. Here, he is destroyed again by Servo&#x27;s shield/sword combo. In &quot;Loose Lips Sink Microchips&quot;, Malcolm revives Skorn and sends him into Sam&#x27;s school radio show at school to reveal embarrassing secrets about people. Here, he is again destroyed by Phormo.
* Kord is a giant reptilian monster with a camera-style eye, blinding floodlights built into his back, two tails, and is covered in magnetic plates. Kord had the ability to shoot fireballs of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius (as measured by Sydney) and could also make his shell super-heated, making physical contact with him dangerous. He could also restrain his opponents, leaving them vulnerable to his fireball attacks. He was responsible for trapping Sam inside a video camera in &quot;Lights, Camera, Action&quot;. Servo had the initiative early on but then got burned when touching Kord&#x27;s high-temperature eye/camera. Kord proceeded to have Servo shackled where he was burned by Kord&#x27;s fireballs. Eventually, with the help of Xenon, who smashed the virus&#x27; camera eye, Servo was able to defeat Kord with his Grid Power slicer, which he launched at the virus, slicing him up before turning orange and disintegrating. In &quot;Little Ditch, Big Glitch&quot;, Kord was later given some upgrades by Malcolm. This time, he had new black armor, no camera-style eye, and also had the ability to suck out Servo&#x27;s main power. Servo was able to defeat him again with the Grid Power Punch after being aided in battle by Xenon. In &quot;Give &#x27;Til It Megahertz&quot;, Malcolm resurrects the Kord virus in its upgraded form and uses him to turn the people of Earth into a bunch of overly generous people including Team Samurai. In &quot;Lucky&#x27;s Unlucky Adventure&quot;, Kord is sent into Mrs. Starkey&#x27;s cash register to make sure that the money comes up short enough to frame Lucky for the missing money. With help from Xenon, Servo destroys Kord with his Grid Power slicer.
* Gramm is a dinosauric ice virus and the sister of Plexton. She was sent into Sam&#x27;s air conditioner in &quot;The Cold Shoulder&quot; causing Sydney, Tanker and Amp to turn cold and against one another. She was destroyed when Servo thrust his sword through the gem on her chest, just moments after Servo wiped out Plexton in the fight. She later teamed up once again with her brother against Servo, but was again tricked into attacking each other, causing the two of them to fight. Servo then took this opportunity to destroy them with his sword. In &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Virucide&quot;, Servo fought Plexton and Gramm again. Servo defeats them with the same tactic.
* Sucker Virus is a dinosauric virus with a large mouth (with coils built into it). In &quot;Amp Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!&quot;, the Sucker Virus was sent to suck in all the power from every nuclear power plant. In battle, he tried to suck Servo inside of him until Sydney rushed in with Borr and bailed him out. However, Sydney took some damage, but Tanker and Amp turned the tide by coming in on Tracto and Vitor, respectively. They all merged with Servo to create Synchro, who then proceeded to wipe out the virus with a Grid Power Punch.
* Skeleton Virus is a Ceratopsian-headed dinosauric Mega-Virus monster. It had an armor that made him resemble a skeleton and he had something of a loud howl. While this virus was introduced in &quot;Lights, Camera, Action&quot;, he had no formal introduction as the team fought him at the beginning of the episode. Plus, that battle was mirror-imaged. First appearing in &quot;Amp Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!&quot;, Kilokahn sent him to damage all the communication networks. The damage was shorting machinery circuits everywhere, jamming TV signals, and created an earthquake in the high school. Sam went into the digital realm as Servo to take this menace on. Servo had his way early on, but was sent reeling by fireballs that the virus shot from his mouth. Sydney sent Servo his Battle Shield to protect him from the fiery projectiles. The virus had another trick up his sleeve - he also had arrows built right into his armor, which he then proceeded to shoot right at Servo. Then, following another fireball attack, Servo&#x27;s damage levels overloaded to the point that he was sent out of SyberSpace and the next second, Sam was back in his basement again. This time, Sam and Sydney, as well as Tanker and Amp, all went in to confront the virus again, and using Tracto, Borr and Vitor, they quickly merged with Servo to make the Synchro program. Synchro gave the virus a good thrashing, and neither the virus&#x27; fireballs nor arrows could faze Synchro. Synchro then used his Shoulder Drill Missile attack on the virus, and afterwards (in a move similar to the finisher that Phormo executed on Blink) finished off this virus by using the Grid Power Fire Stream from the gem on his chest. Servo later encountered this virus in the episode &quot;Forget You!&quot; where he was the cause of widespread amnesia in the real world and again came out the victor by using his Synchro powers.
* Unnamed Virus #1 - this draconic virus was sent into the fortune-telling game in &quot;Que Sera Servo&quot; that would turn everyone into the opposite of what their future would be. While fighting a cowardly Servo (as a result of Sam becoming a coward because of the spell), he used a spell that turned Servo evil. When Xenon came in to attack the virus, he had the upper hand until Kilokahn intervened using his powers to throw Team Samurai back out of cyberspace. Amp (who had become a genius because of the effects of the virus) took one of Sydney&#x27;s chains and smashed the game, with the shock caused in Syberspace rocking Servo and turning him good once again, turning the tide of the battle back in his favor. He then used a powerful Grid Power kick on the virus, which caused him to actually go right through, and ultimately destroy, the virus.
* Hock - one of the deadliest viruses drawn by Malcolm and brought to life by Kilokhan. This green aardvark/dinosauric virus had tough armor and was armed with a pair of sword gauntlets on both arms. First appearing in &quot;A Break in the Food Chain&quot;, Malcolm and Kilokhan sent him into the food factories for the purpose of stopping shipments of food to the world that needs it. In battle, he was actually able to block Servo&#x27;s Grid Power punch, but as the battle was turned back in Servo&#x27;s favor (after Servo was able to strike him with his sword/Grid Power combination), the virus retreated. Servo took him on again in &quot;Sweet and Sour Kilokahn&quot; at the time when Sydney used a program that made Kilokahn good causing him to not bring Hock to life for Malcolm. When that was eliminated from Kilokhan, Servo fought Hock and the virus again retreated. He later reappeared in &quot;The Taunt Heard Round the World&quot; with some upgraded armor and was redubbed &quot;The Hockinator&quot;. He had a target system in one eye and threw powerful boomerangs at Servo that would knock out at least 12% of his power per hit. After Sydney sent him the Dragon Cannon, Servo used it to turn the tide of the battle back in his favor, and then soon afterwards, Hock was finally eliminated by Servo&#x27;s Grid Power. The normal Hock did appear again in the episode &quot;Truant False&quot;, inside the school&#x27;s computer, but was destroyed by an anti-virus system that appeared similar to Manfu. In the episode &quot;What Rad Universe!&quot;, Sam, who was in an alternate dimension, became Servo with the help of Malcolm (who in that dimension was a nice guy and a computer whiz) to fight against the Hockinator once again (who was brought to life by Yolanda Pratchert instead of Malcolm Frink), and defeated him again with the Grid Power.
* Sybo (voiced by Glen Beaudin in the first appearance) - when Kilokahn took over Malcolm&#x27;s body in &quot;Mal-Khan-Tent&quot;, he stuck Malcolm inside this orange dinosauric virus (who still had Malcolm&#x27;s voice) with six long spikelike appendages. He tried to break out of Syberspace but he was stopped by Servo and was destroyed by his Grid Power. After that Malcolm was back in his old body again. Some episodes later Servo fought and defeated this virus again (but obviously without Malcolm attached to him). In &quot;Just Brown &amp; Servo&quot;, this virus was re-designed by Malcolm with some upgraded armor and a mace ball on both his tail and left hand. He was destroyed by the Grid Power of Synchro this time. In &quot;Beep My, Beep My Baby&quot;, Sybo is sent into Jennifer&#x27;s pager to give off a hypnotic beep to maker her love Malcolm and not Sam. When Sybo assumes its upgraded form, Synchro defeats him in the same manner.
* Troid - a blue Pterodactylus-style virus who had the ability to fly and attack from the air. Troid also had the ability to turn invisible while attacking, initially leaving Servo helpless to fight back until he summoned his computer&#x27;s art program to help him, covering it in paint and leaving it visible. He first appeared inside Jennifer&#x27;s Pom-Poms in &quot;Ashes to Ashes, Disk to Disk&quot;, causing whoever held them to be trapped inside SyberSpace where they were stored on floppy disks. After a battle with Servo, he retreated. Servo fought him again at the beginning of &quot;My Virus Ate My Homework&quot;, and it was very much the same battle. Only this time, Servo destroyed him with his Grid Power Punch.
* Unnamed Virus #2 - a robotic dinosauric virus used by Malcolm to knock out the world&#x27;s electricity in &quot;Hello Darkness, My Old Friend&quot;. After an argument with Malcolm about who created the Internet, Kilokhan went behind Malcolm&#x27;s back and brought this virus to life in order to have the world&#x27;s electricity flow to him. Malcolm did not like this plan when he found out about it. Because of the power outage, Amp had to operate the exercise bike to provide power so that Sam can become Servo and fight this virus. With help from Tanker and Drago, Servo was able to defeat this virus with the Grid Power Punch and restore power to the world. In &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Virus&quot;, Malcolm recreates this virus to alter the high school schedules so that he would be put in the same class as Jennifer. Like before, Servo and Drago defeated this virus. In &quot;Pratchert&#x27;s Radical Departure&quot;, this virus is sent into Principal Pratchert&#x27;s bullhorn to regress him back to his hippie days.
* Sydney&#x27;s Virus - as Kilokahn decided he no longer wanted Malcolm creating viruses for him in &quot;Pride Goeth Before a Brawl&quot;, he decided to enlist the aid of another computer user with that person being Sydney. He was able to coerce her to make a virus, which looked like nothing more than a peach-colored, timid creature (with a head actually found on her abdomen) who was not exactly evil and had a voice similar to Sydney&#x27;s. Servo went in to face her, but the confused virus was not in a fighting mood and apologized for the rampage. Later, Kilokahn showed Malcolm what Sydney created, and Malcolm made the virus truly evil this time (giving her an upgrade in the form of a black, rhinocerotiform face), and Servo would struggle against her this time. Sydney, feeling responsible, offered to pilot Drago in Tanker&#x27;s place (to which Tanker agreed) and combined Drago with Servo to bring in Phormo. Towards the end of the battle the virus tried to apologize again, but to no avail. She was eliminated by Phormo&#x27;s Lightning Grid Power Punch.
* Nightmare Virus - this stag beetle/dinosauric virus had a large shell, a mouth with several jagged teeth, and two long, powerful tentacles for arms. It briefly fought Servo in &quot;An Un-helping Hand&quot;. Sydney and Tanker boarded Tracto and Borr to help Servo. In &quot;To Sleep, Perchance to Scream&quot;, the Nightmare Virus was sent into Sam&#x27;s digital clock to give him numerous nightmares. When the morning seemingly came, and Sam&#x27;s friends were able to find out where the virus is, it was destroyed by Servo with his Grid Power Punch with help from Jamb &amp; Torb. After that, Sam woke up and all seemed to be a dream.
* Rock n&#x27; Roll Virus (voiced by Jess Harnell) is a musical delinquent-themed dinosauric virus responsible for turning Mrs. Starkey into a heavy rock and roll maniac in &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Virucide&quot;.
* Smog Virus - this tall, black dinosauric virus had two tails from which he could emit deadly red smog. After a new floppy drive ate Malcolm&#x27;s disk and nearly ate his hand (causing him to only be able to type with one hand), he used this virus to get revenge on the people of Tokyo, where the floppy drive was presumably made in &quot;Born with a Jealous Mind&quot;. The smog from the virus caused the residents of Tokyo to collapse everywhere in the streets. Sam told Tanker of this danger as he tried to convince Tanker to not be so jealous of the fact that Sydney was on a date with superstar Chad Williams. Sam then became Servo and went in to confront the virus. He had the upper-hand early on, but once the Smog Virus became too powerful for him - especially when he started using his smog against Servo - Tanker boarded Drago and went in to help his buddy. After he had Drago breathe fire at the virus, Tanker used Drago to merge with Servo and create the Phormo program. Phormo manhandled the virus and soon put him out with the Lightning Grid Power Punch. The Smog Virus was later seen in the episode &quot;Do Not Reboot &#x27;Til Christmas&quot;, where he was used to make all battery-powered toys explode at midnight on Christmas Eve. With the help of Phormo (piloted by Tanker), Servo was able to destroy him again, a split second before midnight.
* Stupid Virus (voiced by Neil Ross) - a black dinosauric Mega-Virus similar to Skeleton who tampered with the national test scores at high school in &quot;Cheater, Cheater, Megabyte Eater&quot;. Its key power and weakness was its third eye, which was taken out by Servo after being pinned down by Xenon. Earlier in the battle, when Xenon fired its missile fists, the third eye was able to redirect the fists to hit Servo instead. In &quot;Over the River and Through the Grid&quot;, the Stupid Virus was sent to cut Mrs. Starkey&#x27;s utilities making her unable to attend the annual Thanksgiving motorcycle trip with her friends as it was instructed to immobilize any electronic device within a certain radius. Servo and Xenon defeated it with the same tactic.
* Manfu - a dark green hunchbacked Mega-Virus whose head is embedded in his abdomen, and on that head he had two horns from which he could emit blasts of electricity. This was one of Malcolm&#x27;s deadliest viruses. Servo encountered him three different times. He first was sent into the school&#x27;s water fountain in &quot;Stiff as a Motherboard&quot; and when Sam tried to drink from it, he became completely paralyzed, unable to move or speak. With the help of his friends, Sam was able to go into the computer and become Servo. In battle, Manfu trapped Servo (encasing him in computer chips from the waist down), and while Servo managed to hold back Manfu for some time with his shield and sword, it was not enough and it prompted the others to form Xenon to help Servo. However, Manfu proved to be too much for Xenon (first shooting off its arms and then finishing it off with a second blast, causing Sydney, Tanker and Amp to be thrust back out of Cyberspace and into the real world again). Servo then escaped by reflecting back the energy at him. He then broke off Manfu&#x27;s horns, and then tossed him high in the air. While he was still spinning in the air, Servo eliminated him with his Grid Power Punch. In &quot;Syberteria Combat&quot;, Manfu created a barrier around the school at night. The battle went similarly, though this time Manfu took out Xenon in one blast, but Servo emerged victorious again. In &quot;Truant False&quot;, the school computer sent an anti-virus after Hock, which Malcolm used to try to alter his attendance records so he could skip summer school. After the anti-virus destroyed Hock, Malcolm decided to corrupt the anti-virus, modifying its look to make it look exactly like Manfu, and Servo went to battle it. Sydney reminded Servo that he could not destroy it since it was actually an anti-virus, and destroying it would crash the computer system. The anti-virus very nearly destroyed Servo, but Sydney was able to reprogram it just in time, turning it back into the anti-virus and making it good again.
* Nexor is a Hercules Beetle/dinosauric Mega-Virus used by Malcolm in &quot;Water You Doing?&quot; to turn the city&#x27;s water supply into hydrochloric acid. He was brown in color, crawled on four legs, and had two pincerlike horns sticking out of his head. When Servo first encountered him, Nixtor made the ground below Servo melt, causing him to fall one level to where Nixtor was actually hiding. He then had Servo locked up in chains and caused deadly gas to spray at Servo. The gang prepared to aid Servo, but Tanker could not go in the end due to being sick in his stomach. Sydney and Amp boarded Borr and Vitor to aid Servo in battle. They freed him and helped turn the tide of the battle back in his favor. In the end Servo managed to win by wiping out the virus with his Grid Power Punch. This virus would be used again in &quot;Tanks For the Memories&quot; where he would be sent into Tanker&#x27;s Walkman, completely messing with Tanker&#x27;s personality by distracting him and making him say obscure quotes. The battle was the same as before, with Tanker&#x27;s impairment keeping him from joining the battle this time.
* Raedon is a Mega-Virus that resembles an armor upgraded version of Troid. Its wings can emit deadly lasers or be used to fly. In &quot;Starkey in Syberspace&quot;, Kilokahn and Malcolm realized that typically their monsters were stronger than Servo, but he managed to win because of the others providing back-up in their vehicles. Kilokahn created an Input/Output barrier so that the next time Servo went into Syberspace to battle Raedon, he would be cut off from the help of Team Samurai. However, Mrs. Starkey had accidentally transported herself into the digital world before the barrier was up when she mistook a picture of the Drago Jet on Sydney&#x27;s laptop for a video game. Per Kilokahn&#x27;s expectations, this virus proved to be super strong and almost had Servo beaten, but Mrs. Starkey (who was obviously unaware of Servo&#x27;s origins or identity) helped Servo out against the monster. After getting fired at a few times by the Starkey-piloted Drago Jet, Raedon was finally eliminated by Servo&#x27;s Grid Power Punch.
* Unnamed Virus #3 - this virus was not officially named on the show, but he very much resembled a non-armored version of Krono. This version of him had a light bulb-like structure on his head. Upon reluctantly agreeing to save Malcolm from Mrs. Starkey (who was under the love spell that came from the music box that the virus was placed into) in &quot;Love Me Don&#x27;t&quot;, Sam went in as Servo and made short work of the monster, tossing him about, breaking the light bulb on his head, and destroying him with his Grid Power. This was also the virus featured in &quot;Take a Hike&quot; where he was modified to knock out all the electricity in the world. As Sam was not present due to him being out of town, Tanker had to become Servo to take this virus on. He did and he manhandled the virus (Sydney remarked that Tanker fights viruses like he plays football) before destroying him with the Grid Power Punch.

==Arsenal programs==
===Zenon program===
* Zenon: A powerful humanoid robot created when the Vitor, Tracto, and Borr programs combine. Its fists can execute a ranged rocket punch, as in the battle against Kord, which it almost defeats on its own.
** Borr: An orange and black twin-drilled tank that can fly or burrow underground. Its driver is Sydney. Also, a famous basketball player - Charles &quot;High Jump&quot; Johnson - is dragged along to fight a Mega-Virus monster as a temporary driver for Borr when the band use the vehicles to escape the locked high school (in &quot;Syber-Dunk&quot;). Borr forms either Synchro&#x27;s gauntlets and shoulder armor or Zenon&#x27;s lower torso and upper legs.
** Tracto: A blue laser-equipped mini-tank. Its driver is Tanker. Tracto forms either Synchro&#x27;s boots or Zenon&#x27;s legs.
** Vitor: A red fighter jet armed with lasers, missiles, and a rig to restrain monsters. Its pilot is Amp and later Lucky. On one occasion it is piloted by Sydney, who has trouble flying it. Vitor forms either Synchro&#x27;s helmet and body armor or Zenon&#x27;s head, arms, and upper body.

In an odd occurrence, Zenon fights Servo in &quot;Que Sera Servo&quot; when a Mega-Virus places Servo under a spell which has him obey solely Kilokahn, until Amp is able to break the virus&#x27; hold by using Syd&#x27;s belt to reboot him.

When Borr, Tracto, and Vitor combine with Servo, they form Servo&#x27;s upgrade known as Synchro, which is armed with a pair of shoulder drill missiles.

===Drago program===
* Drago: A wingless dragon assembled when Jamb and Torb combine. It is piloted by almost always Tanker and occasionally Sydney. Later in the series, Jamb and Torb would just appear as one single jet fighter that is piloted by either Sydney or Tanker and eventually just transforms into Drago. Neither Amp or Lucky pilot Drago during the series&#x27; run. While Tanker and Syd are the default pilots for the &quot;Drago Jet&quot;, Mrs. Starkey did act as the pilot in &quot;Starkey in Syberspace&quot;.
** Jamb: A dragon-head-shaped mini-jet which also is the bazooka-like flamethrower Dragon Cannon that is used by Servo. Its main pilot is Sydney.
** Torb: A jet with various weaponry. Its main pilot is Tanker.

When Drago combines with Servo, they form Servo&#x27;s second upgrade known as Phormo, which is armed with a pair of laser gauntlets.

==Production==
&quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad&quot; was originally created by Tsuburaya Productions, Ultracom Inc. and DIC Productions, L.P. and was originally going to be named &quot;PowerBoy&quot;, but was renamed during production to avoid confusion with Saban Entertainment&#x27;s American tokusatsu series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. The series was made to capitalize on the upsurge in popularity of imported Japanese monster-robot shows which could be adapted with new, regionalized live-action footage. The series&#x27; development mirrored the creative construct established earlier with the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. The master toy licensee, Playmates Toys, funded the series, interpolated American development via toy licensing rights, and did a commercial buy-in on the Fox network, where Haim Saban had established a kids block, with programs such as &quot;Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers&quot; and the 1992 &quot;X-Men&quot; cartoon. Playmates called upon the development team at DIC—which, coincidentally, was working with Pangea Corporation, which assisted in the development of DIC&#x27;s &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot; and Playmates&#x27; earlier hit, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. DIC, Pangea, and Playmates&#x27; marketing group created an ensemble of character names, traits and profiles, which were spun into a series offering. Under a product placement deal, Compaq computers were prominently featured in the series and were used to generate the show&#x27;s computer-generated graphics.

Elements of this series are used in the anime series adaptation of &quot;Gridman the Hyper Agent&quot;, &quot;SSSS.Gridman&quot;. The &quot;SSSS&quot; abbreviation in the title references &quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad&quot;.

==Episodes==
==Home media release==
In 1995, Buena Vista Home Video (under the DIC Toon Time Video label) released the series on three two-episode VHS cassettes. In February 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment released the series&#x27; first DVD volume in Region 1 for the very first time. The three-disc set features the first 28 episodes of the series. On October 1 in that year, Mill Creek released the second DVD volume which features the remaining 25 episodes.

==Online distribution==
Five episodes (new episodes were added and old episodes were removed on Wednesdays) were available on Jaroo, which was an online video site then operated by Cookie Jar Entertainment with which DIC later merged. In or after 2013, Cookie Jar was taken over by DHX Media. The Jaroo site closed as a result, but DHX Media mentioned that it planned to re-locate the site, and its shows, for online distribution.

As of February 2016, the series could be streamed through the Pluto TV app on the &quot;After School Cartoons&quot; channel 370.

<text>Alexander Toth (; June 25, 1928 – May 27, 2006) was an American cartoonist active from the 1940s through the 1980s. Toth&#x27;s work began in the American comic book industry, but he is also known for his animation designs for Hanna-Barbera throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He came to Hanna Barbera in 1964 to do designs for &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; and his work included &quot;Super Friends&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, &quot;The Herculoids&quot; and &quot;Birdman&quot;. Toth&#x27;s work has been resurrected in the late-night, adult-themed spin-offs on Cartoon Network’s late night sister channel Adult Swim: &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.

He was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Alex Toth was born in 1928 to immigrants from Hungary. His father was Sandor Toth, a coal miner, and also musician of Calvinist religion who hailed from Bodroghalász, Hungary, and his mother was the Roman Catholic Mary Elizabeth Hufnagel, who hailed from Budapest. His parents Alexander Tóth and Mary Hufnagel married in Hamilton, Ontario on October 27, 1924, and after that they moved to Manhattan where Alex Toth was born. His paternal grandparents were Sámuel Tóth, a wine and grape farmer in Bodroghalász, and Erzsébet Menyhért; his maternal grandparents were József Hufnagel a farmer from Torontál County and Mária Kroppa.

Toth&#x27;s talent was noticed early, and a teacher from his poster class in junior high school urged him to devote himself to art. Enrolling in the School of Industrial Art, Toth studied illustration. He began his career when he sold his first freelance art at the age of 15, subsequently illustrating true stories for &quot;Heroic&quot; magazine through a comic book packager named Steve Douglas. Although he initially aimed to do newspaper strips (&quot;It was my dream to do what Caniff, Raymond, and Foster had done&quot;), he found the industry &quot;dying&quot; and instead moved into comic books.

After graduating from the School of Industrial Art in 1947, Toth was hired by Sheldon Mayer at National/DC Comics. &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #28 (Oct.–Nov. 1947) was one of the first comics he drew for the company. He drew four issues of &quot;All Star Comics&quot; including issues #38 and #41 in which the Black Canary first met the Justice Society of America and then joined the team. A canine sidekick for Green Lantern named Streak was introduced in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #30 (Feb.–March 1948) and the dog proved so popular that he became the featured character on several covers of the series starting with #34. He worked at DC for five years, drawing the Golden Age versions of the Flash, Doctor Mid-Nite, and the Atom. In addition to superheroes, Toth drew Western comics for DC including &quot;All-Star Western&quot;. He was assigned to the &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; feature in &quot;All-Star Western&quot; because editor Julius Schwartz considered him to be &quot;my best artist at the time.&quot; Toth and writer Robert Kanigher co-created Rex the Wonder Dog in 1952.

For a brief time in 1950, Toth was able to realize his dream of working on newspaper comic strips by ghost illustrating &quot;Casey Ruggles&quot; with Warren Tufts. In 1952 Toth ended his contract with DC Comics and moved to California. It is during that time that he worked on crime, war and romance comics for Standard Comics. In 1954, Toth was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan, he wrote and drew his own weekly adventure strip, &quot;Jon Fury&quot;, for the base paper, &quot;Depot Diary&quot;. He served in the Army until 1956.

===Animation and later career===

Returning to the United States in 1956, Toth settled in the Los Angeles area and worked primarily for Dell Comics until 1960. In that year, Toth became art director for the &quot;Space Angel&quot; animated science fiction show. This led to his being hired by Hanna-Barbera, where he created the character Space Ghost for the animated series of the same name. His other creations include &quot;The Herculoids&quot;, &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;, and &quot;Dino Boy in the Lost Valley&quot;. He worked as a storyboard and design artist until 1968 and then again in 1973 when he was assigned to Australia for five months to produce the TV series &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

He continued to work in comic books, contributing to Warren Publishing&#x27;s magazines &quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;The Rook&quot;. For DC Comics, he drew the first issue of &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; (February–March 1969) and introduced the series&#x27; three witches. Toth illustrated the comic book tie-in to the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; animated series based on the toy line. His collaboration with writer Bob Haney on the four page story &quot;Dirty Job&quot; in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #241 (Feb. 1972), has been described as a &quot;true masterpiece&quot;. Toth worked with writer/editor Archie Goodwin on the story &quot;Burma Sky&quot; in &quot;Our Fighting Forces&quot; #146 (Dec. 1973 – Jan. 1974) and Goodwin praised Toth&#x27;s art in a 1998 interview: &quot;To me, having Alex Toth do any kind of airplane story, it&#x27;s a joy for me. If I see a chance to do something like that, I will. He did a really fabulous job on it.&quot; The two men crafted a Batman story for &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #442 (Aug.–Sept. 1974) as well. Toth and E. Nelson Bridwell produced a framing sequence for the &quot;Super Friends&quot; feature in &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-41 (Dec. 1975 – Jan. 1976). Toth&#x27;s final work for DC was the cover for &quot;Batman Black and White&quot; #4 (Sept. 1996).

===Death===
Toth died at his drawing table on May 27, 2006, four weeks shy of his 78th birthday.

===Personal life===
Alex Toth was the father of four children, sons Eric and Damon and daughters Dana and Carrie. His marriage to Christina Schaber Hyde ended in divorce in 1968, and his second wife, Guyla Avery, died in 1985.

==Legacy==
Toth did much of his comics work outside superhero comics, concentrating instead on such subjects as hot rod racing, romance, horror, and action-adventure. His work on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; has been reprinted in trade paperback form several times. Also, there are two volumes of &quot;The Alex Toth Reader,&quot; published by Pure Imagination, which focuses on his work for Standard Comics and Western Publishing. Brian Bolland has cited Toth as one of his idols.

Journalist Tom Spurgeon wrote that Toth possessed &quot;an almost transcendent understanding of the power of art as a visual story component&quot;, and called him &quot;one of the handful of people who could seriously enter into Greatest Comic Book Artist of All-Time discussions&quot; and &quot;a giant of 20th-century cartoon design&quot;.

Toth was known for his exhaustive study of other artists and his outspoken analysis of comics art past and present. For example, in a 2001 interview he criticized the trend of fully painted comics, saying &quot;It &quot;could&quot; be comics if those who know how to paint also knew how to tell a story! Who knew what pacing was, and didn&#x27;t just jam a lot of pretty pictures together into a page, pages, and call it a story, continuity! It ain&#x27;t!&quot; Toth lamented what he saw as a lack of awareness on the part of younger artists of their predecessors, as well as a feeling that the innocent fun of comics&#x27; past was being lost in the pursuit of pointless nihilism and mature content.

In the 1990s and 2000s, he contributed to the magazines &quot;Comic Book Artist&quot; and &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, writing the columns &quot;Before I Forget&quot; and &quot;Who Cares? I Do!&quot;, respectively. In 2006, James Counts and Billy Ingram compiled personal anecdotes, hundreds of unseen sketches from famous Alex Toth comic and animated works combined with correspondence with friend and comics dealer John Hitchcock in the book &quot;Dear John: The Alex Toth Doodle Book&quot; (Octopus Press). Launched at ComicCon 2006, the first printing sold out within weeks of first publication.

Film director Michael Almereyda said Toth was a formative influence on his youth, and credits Toth&#x27;s long interest in Nikola Tesla as the catalyst for Almereyda&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Tesla&quot;:

<text>Regimental quartermaster sergeant (RQMS) is a military rank in some militaries, and an appointment in others.

==Irish Defence Forces==
Battalion quartermaster sergeant (BQMS, &quot;ceathrúsháirsint cathláin&quot; in Irish) is a rank in the Irish Army and Irish Air Corps equivalent to warrant officer class 2 (NATO OR-8) in the British Army. The equivalent in the Artillery Corps and Army Ranger Wing is regimental quartermaster sergeant (RQMS).

==Singapore==
Like the UK example, the regimental quartermaster sergeant is an appointment in a battalion-sized unit usually held by a second warrant officer. They are the senior assistant to the quartermaster, who may be a more senior warrant officer for non-combat units.

==United Kingdom==
Regimental quartermaster sergeant is an appointment held by a warrant officer class 2 in the British Army and Royal Marines. The RQMS is the senior assistant to the quartermaster of a regiment or battalion and also usually functions as the deputy regimental sergeant major. Some units have more than one. RQMS was a separate rank until 1915, when it became a warrant officer appointment with the creation of the rank of warrant officer class II.

In the Household Cavalry, the appointment is instead regimental quartermaster corporal.

==United States==
Regimental quartermaster sergeant as well as battalion quartermaster sergeant were ranks in the U.S. Army during World War I. They were re-designated regimental and battalion supply sergeants on 3 June 1916.

<doc id="966747" wikidata="Q862316" url="?curid=966747" title="Bill Melendez">
<text>José Cuauhtémoc &quot;Bill&quot; Melendez (November 15, 1916 – September 2, 2008) was an American animator, director, producer, and voice actor. Melendez is known for working on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated specials, as well as providing the voices of Snoopy and Woodstock. Before &quot;Peanuts&quot;, he previously worked as an animator for Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros. Cartoons, and UPA.

In a career spanning over 60 years, he won six Primetime Emmy Awards and was nominated for thirteen more. In addition, he was nominated for an Oscar and five Grammy Awards. The two &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?&quot;, which he directed, were each honored with a Peabody Award.

== Early life ==
A native of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, Melendez was educated in American public schools in Douglas, Arizona. He later attended the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles (which would later become California Institute of the Arts).

== Early animation work (1935–1961) ==
On completion of his studies, Melendez found his first job at a lumber mill. After watching &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, he gained employment at Disney in 1938, where he worked as an assistant animator to Hawley Pratt whom he befriended and worked together to developed a naval game with toy ships. He worked on what are now considered classics: &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, and &quot;Bambi&quot; and he worked once as an animator for a Donald Duck short, &quot;The Flying Jalopy&quot;. Following the 1941 Disney strike, Melendez was hired by Leon Schlesinger Productions, later known as Warner Bros. Cartoons, where he served as animator on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. He worked in Bob Clampett&#x27;s unit, first as an assistant animator for Rod Scribner, and then as a full animator starting with &quot;Wagon Heels&quot;. After Clampett&#x27;s departure in 1945, the unit was given to Arthur Davis. When the number of animation units at Warner Bros. was reduced from four to three in 1947, Melendez along with Emery Hawkins moved to Robert McKimson&#x27;s unit for a time.

After animating several shorts for McKimson, Melendez was fired by producer Edward Selzer. Afterwards, he moved over to United Productions of America (UPA), where he animated on cartoons such as &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; (1950). Melendez also produced and directed thousands of television commercials, first at UPA, then John Sutherland Productions and Playhouse Pictures. In 1963, Melendez founded his own studio in the basement of his Hollywood home. Bill Melendez Productions is still active and is currently run by his son Steven C. Melendez. In addition to animation, Melendez was once a faculty member at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Cinema Arts Department. 

Melendez would also be referenced in the 1961 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short &quot;The Pied Piper of Guadalupe&quot;, where his name was used for a music instructor for Sylvester to learn how to play the flute. At that point, Melendez has been away from Warner Bros. for 10 years.

== &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise (1959–2006) ==
In 1959, Melendez was hired to do some animated television commercials featuring characters from the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; for the Ford Motor Company. These animations were seen by documentary producer Lee Mendelson, and Mendelson hired Melendez to do some interstitial animations for a film he was producing about the comic strip entitled &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;.

Melendez was the only person &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz trusted to turn his popular comic creations into television specials. He and his studio worked on every single television special and direct-to-video film for the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang and Melendez directed the majority of them. He provided the vocal effects for Snoopy and Woodstock in every single production, voice acting the characters in the studio by uttering gibberish, and the voices were mechanically sped up at different speeds to represent the two different characters, although some later specials had Snoopy speaking in a clear voice, reflecting how he would be thinking to himself in the comics.

According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; published shortly after his death, Melendez did not intend to do voice acting for the two characters. &quot;Schulz would not countenance the idea of a beagle uttering English dialogue, Mr. Melendez recited gibberish into a tape recorder, sped it up and put the result on the soundtrack.&quot; He also directed, did the animation for, and provided voice acting in the first four Peanuts theatrical films, &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; (1969), &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972), &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot; (1977), and &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown&quot; (1980), as well as the video games &quot;Get Ready for School, Charlie Brown!&quot; (1995) and &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Campfire Stories&quot; (1996).

The last Peanuts-related production he worked on was &quot;He&#x27;s a Bully, Charlie Brown&quot; (2006). Melendez and Lee Mendelson, who also worked on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, films, and TV shows, formed their own production team and did other animated specials. They were responsible for the first two &quot;Garfield&quot; animated specials, &quot;Here Comes Garfield&quot; (1982) and &quot;Garfield on the Town&quot; (1983), as well as &quot;Frosty Returns&quot; (1992), the pseudo-sequel to Rankin/Bass&#x27; &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; (1969).

== National Student Film Institute ==
During the 1980s and 1990s Melendez served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.

== Death ==
On September 2, 2008, Bill Melendez died at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California at the age of 91. No cause of his death was made public, but he had been in declining health after a fall a year earlier. Melendez was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.

=== Posthumous return to &quot;Peanuts&quot; ===
Archive recordings of his work as Snoopy and Woodstock were used for the film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;. This makes him the only member of the film&#x27;s cast to have been involved in a previous &quot;Peanuts&quot; project, save for Kristin Chenoweth, who won a Tony Award for her performance as Sally Brown in &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; on Broadway. Melendez also has archival recordings on the film&#x27;s game, &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Grand Adventure.&quot;

<text>Donald Corey Patterson (born August 13, 1979) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. Currently, he is the manager of the Brookhaven Bucks in the Sunbelt Baseball League. He is the older brother of infielder Eric Patterson, and the son of former NFL defensive back Don Patterson.

==Amateur career==
Patterson attended Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia, and helped Harrison win the Georgia state championship as a senior in 1998. That year, he had a batting average of .528 with 81 runs scored, 22 home runs, 61 RBI and 38 stolen bases in 38 games. Patterson was named to the &quot;Baseball America&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; first-team All-America teams, and was selected by USA Baseball as its Amateur Player of the Year and as the Baseball Coaches Association&#x27;s co-national high school Player of the Year. Patterson was also named a &quot;Baseball America&quot; second-team selection after his junior season.

==Professional career==
===Chicago Cubs===
Patterson was selected by the Chicago Cubs as the third overall pick in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut in 1999 with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class-A Midwest League, and won the league&#x27;s Prospect of the Year Award after leading the circuit in slugging percentage (.592), extra base hits (72) and triples (17). He also batted .320 with 20 homers and 79 RBI, and was named to the league&#x27;s all-star team both at mid-season and postseason. &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Patterson the league&#x27;s top prospect. After the 1999 season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was that league&#x27;s youngest player. He batted .368 with 4 home runs, 24 RBI, and 8 stolen bases in 35 games, and was named to the league&#x27;s all-star team.

In 2000, Patterson was promoted to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League. He was named to the league&#x27;s mid-season and postseason all-star team, and was named the league&#x27;s top prospect by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. Patterson batted .268 with 22 home runs and 82 RBI, finishing second in the league in home runs.

After playing in the 2000 Southern League playoffs, Patterson was called up from the minors to play for the Cubs. He made his Major League debut on September 18, 2000, against the Milwaukee Brewers. The next day Patterson recorded his first Major League hit, a home run off Juan Acevedo. He finished the 2000 season with seven hits in 42 at bats, and two home runs.

Patterson did not start playing a full season until 2002, when he finished with a .253 batting average. In 2003, he batted .298 with 55 RBI in only 83 games before suffering a torn ACL while running to first on a base hit against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 6. The injury ended Patterson&#x27;s 2003 campaign.

Patterson played 157 games in 2004, with a .266 batting average, 24 home runs, and 72 RBI in 631 at-bats. His on-base plus slugging of .771, while only average, is his best of the six seasons in which he played more than 83 games. He had the lowest range factor (2.18) among all starting Major League center fielders in 2004.

In the 2005 season Patterson did not do well. On July 7, he was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. The demotion came after the Cubs had lost a season-high eight games in a row. Published reports indicated that center fielder Félix Pie, the Cubs&#x27; top prospect, was slated to be called up from Double-A West Tenn in July when Patterson was sent down.

Patterson was back up with the Major League team on August 9, after his one-month stint in Triple-A Iowa.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Patterson was traded by the Cubs to the Orioles on January 9, 2006, for Class-A Minor league players Nate Spears and Carlos Perez. On February 10, 2007, Patterson signed a 1-year deal worth $4.3 million to avoid arbitration. In his first of two years with the Orioles, he batted .276 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI. He also stole 45 bases, which ranked third in the American League. Patterson&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the 2007 season.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On March 3, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds signed Patterson to a minor league contract. At the end of Spring training, he was added to the 40-man roster. Dusty Baker, manager of the Reds and Patterson&#x27;s manager in Chicago, was instrumental in signing Patterson. Baker often voiced his opinion on Patterson saying he thought Patterson is still a developing player.

Patterson was invited to the Reds&#x27; spring training camp, and he started the 2008 season in center field for Cincinnati. Platooning with utility man Ryan Freel, Patterson began the season well. Gradually his average deteriorated, culminating in an 0–8 performance during Cincinnati&#x27;s 18-inning loss to San Diego on May 25. The following day top outfield prospect Jay Bruce was called up from the Triple-A Louisville Bats to start in center field, demoting Patterson to the Reds&#x27; bench. On May 28, Patterson accepted a reassignment to Triple-A Louisville. The demotion lasted only one week, however, when Patterson was recalled to replace Ryan Freel, who went to the disabled list with a strained right hamstring on June 4. Patterson ended the season with a .205 batting average and .238 OBP.

===Washington Nationals===
On December 18, 2008, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals.

Due to Josh Willingham being placed on the bereavement list, Patterson had his contract purchased from the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs on June 13, 2009. He hit .302, with six home runs and 23 RBIs in a 39 games with the Chiefs, but hit only .133 with 2 stolen bases in 5 games for the Nationals. He was reassigned to Triple-A on June 20, 2009. He was released by the Nationals on July 29, 2009.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on August 1, 2009. Patterson hit well with the AAA affiliate Nashville Sound, batting .331 with a .963 OPS over 29 games and 124 at-bats. However, he struggled with the parent club, where his BA, OBP, and SLG were all .071 over 11 games and 14 at-bats.

===Seattle Mariners===
Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 9, 2009. However, he opted out of his contract on March 31, 2010, after being informed he had not made the Major League team.

===Return to Baltimore===
On April 21, 2010, Corey agreed to re-join the Orioles on a 1-year minor league deal. He was promoted to the Orioles on May 12, 2010.

On July 9, 2010, Patterson hit his first career grand slam against the Texas Rangers. It was a remarkable feat as Patterson faced the season&#x27;s eventual saves leader and rookie of the year in the hard throwing Neftalí Feliz, with a 2–2 count and two outs in the top of the 9th inning representing the tying run. Patterson drilled his pitch over the right field fence to tie the game at 6. Jake Fox hit a solo homer in the top of the 10th for the game winner.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 21, 2010, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He began the season on the Major League roster, but on the disabled list because of a head injury.
Patterson made his regular season debut as a Blue Jay on April 11, 2011, against the Seattle Mariners, hitting a home run and finishing the night 2–4 with 2 RBI

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On July 27, 2011, Patterson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Edwin Jackson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet.

===Return to Milwaukee===
On January 30, 2012, Patterson signed a minor league contract to return to the Brewers organization. He played 117 games for Nashville Sounds, the AAA team of the Brewers, batting .251 with 39 RBI in 390 plate appearances. For the first season since his Major League debut, he did not play in the Major Leagues.

===New York Mets===
He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in February 2013. The Mets released Patterson in March 2013.

===Seattle Mariners===
He signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on April 30, 2013, but was released on June 6, after hitting only .175 in 19 games for the AAA Tacoma Rainiers.

===New York Yankees===
Patterson signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees on June 21, 2013. He elected free agency on November 4, 2013.

<doc id="966753" wikidata="Q2864310" url="?curid=966753" title="R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport">
<text>R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport was a judicial review case taken against the United Kingdom government by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached European Union law (then Community Law) by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgements on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.

The litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:
*&quot;Factortame I&quot;, where the High Court and then the House of Lords (which functioned as the final court of appeal prior to 2009) both made a reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the legality of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988&#x27;s (&quot;MSA&quot;) requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, &quot;Factortame&quot; saw the House of Lords confirm the primacy of EU law over national law in the areas where the EU has competence because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.
*&quot;Factortame II&quot;, where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law.
*&quot;Factortame III&quot;, where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law.
*&quot;Factortame IV&quot;, where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the &quot;Francovich v Italy&quot; principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of state liability).
*&quot;Factortame V&quot;, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in tort under the Limitation Act 1980.

==Facts==
The EU&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy, which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all member states and introducing structural funds to ensure modernisation of the sector. In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their exclusive economic zone, which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985, which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on fishing stocks led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of &quot;total allowable catches&quot; which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the British Fishing Boats Act 1983 (BFBA). In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.

From 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy fishing vessel registration requirements contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. 60) Although the 1894 act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as &quot;quota hopping&quot;.

In order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked preliminary questions to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG – see &quot;Agegate&quot; (C-3/87, ) and &quot;Jaderow&quot; (C-216/87, ). In 1988 the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had &quot;a genuine and substantial connection&quot; with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any charterer, manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A &quot;qualified person or company&quot; was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, &quot;qualified persons&quot;.

As from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame&#x27;s vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for judicial review was brought by its owners in a divisional court of the High Court in December 1988.

==&quot;Factortame I&quot;==
Factortame Ltd sought, first, a preliminary injunction declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to directly effective rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the Treaty of Rome), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43–48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the Secretary of State from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.

HMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries. In the event this assertion proved false.

===High Court===
On 10 March 1989 the divisional court (Neill LJ and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: European Union law). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of English law and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the &quot;status quo ante&quot;. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the Court of Appeal.

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson MR, Bingham LJ and Mann LJ) reversed the divisional court&#x27;s decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged &quot;to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right&quot;. Furthermore, it did not believe that the divisional court had &quot;acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established&quot;. The divisional court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.

===House of Lords===
The case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the House of Lords (Lord Bridge, Lord Brandon, Lord Oliver, Lord Goff and Lord Jauncey) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an Act of Parliament. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have &quot;conferred upon them rights directly contrary to Parliament&#x27;s sovereign will&quot;. Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.

Nevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts &quot;against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law&quot; to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the divisional court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.

===European Court of Justice===
The action was lodged at the ECJ on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only six months from its commencement before the divisional court to the House of Lords&#x27; judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.

Advocate-General Tesauro argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 (). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in Simmenthal (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ&#x27;s case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not &quot;be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect&quot; (case 61/79, Denkavit, ). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords&#x27; argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.

On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as &quot;full court&quot; of 11 justices) &quot;en banc&quot; gave its ruling, rephrasing the question posed as &quot;whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule&quot;. Following the Advocate-General&#x27;s opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where it is necessary to grant interim measures in order to safeguard such a right, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.

===Back to the House of Lords===
On 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ&#x27;s ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on parliamentary sovereignty. Lord Goff acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the Senior Courts Act 1981).

In deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ&#x27;s first ruling that Factortame&#x27;s arguments had &quot;considerable force&quot;. Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.

Addressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ&#x27;s decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, Lord Bridge remarked that such comments were &quot;based on a misconception&quot;, and that under the European Communities Act 1972, the law regulating the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU, it had &quot;always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law&quot;. In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU directives, the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.

These comments were perceived by Sir William Wade as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.

Such an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in &quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot; and &quot;Hunt v Hackney Borough Council&quot; to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and &quot;statutory&quot; or &quot;constitutional&quot; acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in &quot;Thoburn&quot;.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.

Furthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by Lord Diplock in the case of &quot;Garland v British Rail Engineering&quot;). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of &quot;Macarthys v Smith&quot;, Lord Denning suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.

==&quot;Factortame II&quot; compatibility==
On 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court, namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General Mischo&#x27;s opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that &quot;it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law&quot;. In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.

In the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual&#x27;s residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as &quot;the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]&quot;. In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.

The UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the Common Fisheries Policy allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a &quot;real economic link&quot; existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to &quot;concern only the relations between the vessel&#x27;s operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries&quot;. In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.

==&quot;Factortame III&quot; state liability==

Following the ECJ&#x27;s second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the German Federal Court had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of &quot;Brasserie du Pêcheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot; and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined.

At this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in &quot;Francovich&quot; (), which established the principle that &quot;a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law&quot;. The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to &quot;the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States&quot;.

In its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996, the court of nine justices &quot;en banc&quot; reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.

The court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:

# the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals;
# the breach must be sufficiently serious;
# there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.

In the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be &quot;sufficiently serious&quot; it must be &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;grave&quot;. National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.

==&quot;Factortame IV&quot; right to damages==
The matter came back to a divisional court (Hobhouse LJ, Collins J and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for exemplary damages. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Schiemann LJ and Walker LJ) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998. HMG appealed again to the House of Lords (Lord Slynn, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope).

The House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG&#x27;s reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act&#x27;s application. The case would now go back to a divisional court for the amount of damages to be determined.

In March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed £285 million, received £55 million including interest of some £26 million.

==&quot;Factortame V&quot; limitation issues==
On 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the Technology and Construction Court (a division of the High Court) held, under the Limitation Act 1980, Factortame&#x27;s claims against the UK government were &quot;actions founded on tort&quot;, and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords&#x27; decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.

The judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages caused by HMG&#x27;s breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the Race Relations Act 1976. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant&#x27;s self-esteem.

==Significance==

The &quot;Factortame&quot; case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by Dicey. Sir William Wade argues that the Factortame judgment alters the Rule of Recognition.

The issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice had ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which applied to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. Prior to Brexit (31 January 2020), the UK recognised the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in &quot;Macarthys Ltd v Smith&quot;, Lord Denning MR said, &quot;If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act—with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it—or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament.&quot;

This view of the UK&#x27;s ultimate sovereignty was supported by Lord Justice Laws in the &quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot; case, when he said that &quot;there is nothing in the European Communities Act which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament&#x27;s legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions.&quot;

That European law had primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot; (1964), the ECJ stated that &quot;the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields&quot;. In Case 26/62 &quot;Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen&quot; (1963) their ruling states that &quot;the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights&quot;.

The question of who has the ultimate &quot;kompetenz-kompetenz&quot; (i.e. the right to decide the limits of jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice) has now been settled.

<doc id="966760" wikidata="Q9056738" url="?curid=966760" title="Pastoralism">
<text>Pastoralism is a form of animal husbandry where domesticated animals (known as &quot;livestock&quot;) are released onto large vegetated outdoor lands (pastures) for grazing, historically by nomadic people who moved around with their herds. The animal species involved include cattle, camels, goats, yaks, llamas, reindeer, horses, and sheep.

Pastoralism occurs in many variations throughout the world, generally where environmentally effected characteristics such as aridity, poor soils, cold or hot temperatures, and lack of water make crop-growing difficult or impossible. Operating in more extreme environments with more marginal lands means that pastoral communities are very vulnerable to the effects of global warming.

Pastoralism remains a way of life in many geographic areas, including Africa, the Tibetan plateau, the Eurasian steppes, the Andes, Patagonia, the Pampas, Australia and many other places. , between 200 million and 500 million people globally practiced pastoralism, and 75% of all countries had pastoral communities.

Pastoral communities have different levels of mobility. The enclosure of common lands has led to [[Pastoralism|Sedentary pastoralism]] becoming more common as the hardening of political borders, land tenures, expansion of crop farming, and construction of fences and dedicated agricultural buildings all reduce the ability to move livestock around freely, leading to the rise of pastoral farming on established grazing-zones (sometimes called &quot;ranches&quot;). Sedentary pastoralists may also raise crops and livestock together in the form of mixed farming, for the purpose of diversifying productivity, obtaining manure for organic farming, and improving pasture conditions for their livestock. Mobile pastoralism includes moving herds locally across short distances in search of fresh forage and water (something that can occur daily or even within a few hours); as well as [[transhumance]], where herders routinely move animals between different seasonal pastures across regions; and [[Pastoralism|nomadism]], where nomadic pastoralists and their families move with the animals in search for any available grazing-grounds—without much long-term planning. Grazing in woodlands and forests may be referred to as [[Pastoralism|silvopastoralism]].
Those who practice pastoralism are called &quot;pastoralists&quot;. 

Pastoralist herds interact with their environment, and mediate human relations with the environment as a way of turning uncultivated plants (like wild grass) into food. In many places, grazing herds on savannas and in woodlands can help maintain the biodiversity of such landscapes and prevent them from evolving into dense shrublands or forests. Grazing and browsing at the appropriate levels often can increase biodiversity in Mediterranean climate regions. Pastoralists shape ecosystems in different ways: some communities use fire to make ecosystems more suitable for grazing and browsing animals.

==Origins==

One theory suggests that pastoralism developed from mixed farming. Bates and Lees proposed that the incorporation of irrigation into farming resulted in specialization. Advantages of mixed farming include reducing risk of failure, spreading labour, and re-utilizing resources. The importance of these advantages and disadvantages to different farmers or farming societies differs according to the sociocultural preferences of the farmers and the biophysical conditions as determined by rainfall, radiation, soil type, and disease. The increased productivity of irrigation agriculture led to an increase in population and an added impact on resources. Bordering areas of land remained in use for animal breeding. This meant that large distances had to be covered by herds to collect sufficient forage. Specialization occurred as a result of the increasing importance of both intensive agriculture and pastoralism. Both agriculture and pastoralism developed alongside each other, with continuous interactions.

A different theory suggests that pastoralism evolved from hunting and gathering. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility and the needs of animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by taming and domesticating them. Hunter-gatherers&#x27; strategies in the past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environmental conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping big game and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering wild-plant foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts.
These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism.

==Resources==
Pastoralism occurs in uncultivated areas. Wild animals eat the forage from the marginal lands and humans survive from milk, blood, and often meat of the herds and often trade by-products like wool and milk for money and food.

Pastoralists do not exist at basic subsistence. Pastoralists often compile wealth and participate in international trade. Pastoralists have trade relations with agriculturalists, horticulturalists, and other groups. Pastoralists are not extensively dependent on milk, blood, and meat of their herd. McCabe noted that when common property institutions are created, in long-lived communities, resource sustainability is much higher, which is evident in the East African grasslands of pastoralist populations. However, the property rights structure is only one of the many different parameters that affect the sustainability of resources, and common or private property per se, does not necessarily lead to sustainability.

Some pastoralists supplement herding with hunting and gathering, fishing and/or small-scale farming or pastoral farming.

== Mobility ==

Mobility allows pastoralists to adapt to the environment, which opens up the possibility for both fertile and infertile regions to support human existence. Important components of pastoralism include low population density, mobility, vitality, and intricate information systems. The system is transformed to fit the environment rather than adjusting the environment to support the &quot;food production system.&quot; Mobile pastoralists can often cover a radius of a hundred to five hundred kilometers.

Pastoralists and their livestock have impacted the environment. Lands long used for pastoralism have transformed under the forces of grazing livestock and anthropogenic fire. Fire was a method of revitalizing pastureland and preventing forest regrowth. The collective environmental weights of fire and livestock browsing have transformed landscapes in many parts of the world. Fire has permitted pastoralists to tend the land for their livestock. Political boundaries are based on environmental boundaries. The Maquis shrublands of the Mediterranean region are dominated by pyrophytic plants that thrive under conditions of anthropogenic fire and livestock grazing.

Nomadic pastoralists have a global food-producing strategy depending on the management of herd animals for meat, skin, wool, milk, blood, manure, and transport. Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and seasonal migration. Pastoralists are among the most flexible populations. Pastoralist societies have had field armed men protect their livestock and their people and then to return into a disorganized pattern of foraging. The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded. The boundaries between states impact the viability of subsistence and trade relations with cultivators.

Pastoralist strategies typify effective adaptation to the environment. Precipitation differences are evaluated by pastoralists. In East Africa, different animals are taken to specific regions throughout the year that corresponds to the seasonal patterns of precipitation. Transhumance is the migration of livestock and pastoralists between seasonal pastures.

In the Himalayas, pastoralists have often historically and traditionally depended on rangelands lying across international borders. The Himalayas contain several international borders, such as those between India and China, India and Nepal, Bhutan and China, India and Pakistan, and Pakistan and China. With the growth of nation states in Asia since the mid-twentieth century, mobility across the international borders in these countries have tended to be more and more restricted and regulated. As a consequence, the old, customary arrangements of trans-border pastoralism have generally tended to disintegrate, and trans-border pastoralism has declined. Within these countries, pastoralism is often at conflict these days with new modes of community forestry, such as Van Panchayats (Uttarakhand) and Community Forest User Groups (Nepal), which tend to benefit settled agricultural communities more. Frictions have also tended to arise between pastoralists and development projects such as dam-building and the creation of protected areas.

Some pastoralists are constantly moving, which may put them at odds with sedentary people of towns and cities. The resulting conflicts can result in war for disputed lands. These disputes are recorded in ancient times in the Middle East, as well as for East Asia. Other pastoralists are able to remain in the same location which results in longer-standing housing.

Different mobility patterns can be observed: Somali pastoralists keep their animals in one of the harshest environments but they have evolved over the centuries. Somalis have well-developed pastoral culture where complete system of life and governance has been refined. Somali poetry depicts humans interactions, pastoral animals, beasts on the prowl, and other natural things such the rain, celestial events and historic events of significance. Wise sage Guled Haji coined a proverb that encapsulates the centrality of water in pastoral life:
Mobility was an important strategy for the Ariaal; however with the loss of grazing land impacted by the growth in population, severe drought, the expansion of agriculture, and the expansion of commercial ranches and game parks, mobility was lost. The poorest families were driven out of pastoralism and into towns to take jobs. Few Ariaal families benefited from education, healthcare, and income earning.

The flexibility of pastoralists to respond to environmental change was reduced by colonization. For example, mobility was limited in the Sahel region of Africa with settlement being encouraged. The population tripled and sanitation and medical treatment were improved.

== Environment knowledge ==
Pastoralists have mental maps of the value of specific environments at different times of year. Pastoralists have an understanding of ecological processes and the environment. Information sharing is vital for creating knowledge through the networks of linked societies.

Pastoralists produce food in the world&#x27;s harshest environments, and pastoral production supports the livelihoods of rural populations on almost half of the world&#x27;s land. Several hundred million people are pastoralists, mostly in Africa and Asia. ReliefWeb reported that &quot;Several hundred million people practice pastoralism—the use of extensive grazing on rangelands for livestock production, in over 100 countries worldwide. The African Union estimated that Africa has about 268 million pastoralists—over a quarter of the total population—living on about 43 percent of the continent&#x27;s total land mass.&quot; Pastoralists manage rangelands covering about a third of the Earth&#x27;s terrestrial surface and are able to produce food where crop production is not possible.
Pastoralism has been shown, &quot;based on a review of many studies, to be between 2 and 10 times more productive per unit of land than the capital intensive alternatives that have been put forward&quot;. However, many of these benefits go unmeasured and are frequently squandered by policies and investments that seek to replace pastoralism with more capital intensive modes of production. They have traditionally suffered from poor understanding, marginalization and exclusion from dialogue. The Pastoralist Knowledge Hub, managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN serves as a knowledge repository on technical excellence on pastoralism as well as &quot;a neutral forum for exchange and alliance building among pastoralists and stakeholders working on pastoralist issues&quot;.

The Afar pastoralists in Ethiopia uses an indigenous communication method called &quot;dagu&quot; for information. This helps them in getting crucial information about climate and availability of pastures at various locations.

== Farm animal genetic resource ==

There is a variation in genetic makeup of the farm animals driven mainly by natural and human based selection. For example, pastoralists in large parts of Sub Saharan Africa are preferring livestock breeds which are adapted to their environment and able to tolerate drought and diseases. However, in other animal production systems these breeds are discouraged and more productive exotic ones are favored. This situation could not be left unaddressed due to the changes in market preferences and climate all over the world, which could lead to changes in livestock diseases occurrence and decline forage quality and availability. Hence pastoralists can maintain farm animal genetic resources by conserving local livestock breeds. Generally conserving farm animal genetic resources under pastoralism is advantageous in terms of reliability and associated cost.

== Tragedy of the commons ==
Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; (1968) described how common property resources, such as the land shared by pastoralists, eventually become overused and ruined. According to Hardin&#x27;s paper, the pastoralist land use strategy was unstable and a cause of environmental degradation.
 One of Hardin&#x27;s conditions for a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; is that people cannot communicate with each other or make agreements and contracts. Many scholars have pointed out that this is implausible, and yet it is applied in development projects around the globe, motivating the destruction of community and other governance systems that have managed sustainable pastoral systems for thousands of years. The outcomes have often been disastrous. In her book &quot;Governing the Commons&quot;, Elinor Ostrom showed that communities were not trapped and helpless amid diminishing commons. She argued that a common-pool resource, such as grazing lands used for pastoralism, can be managed more sustainably through community groups and cooperatives than through privatization or total governmental control. Ostrom was awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her work.

Pastoralists in the Sahel zone in Africa were held responsible for the depletion of resources. The depletion of resources was actually triggered by a prior interference and punitive climate conditions. Hardin&#x27;s paper suggested a solution to the problems, offering a coherent basis for privatization of land, which stimulates the transfer of land from tribal peoples to the state or to individuals. The privatized programs impact the livelihood of the pastoralist societies while weakening the environment. Settlement programs often serve the needs of the state in reducing the autonomy and livelihoods of pastoral people.

The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan, Ethiopia and other countries in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions have been exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and population growth.

It has also been shown that pastoralism supports human existence in harsh environments and often represents a sustainable approach to land use.

<text>Roger Nicholas Edwards, Baron Crickhowell, PC (25 February 1934 – 17 March 2018) was a British Conservative Party politician who served as an MP from 1970 until 1987 and as Secretary of State for Wales during the first two terms of the Thatcher government.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in 1934 in Highgate, London, to Ralph Edwards and Marjorie Ingham Brooke. He was educated at Westminster School and, after completing National Service in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in history in 1957. He was a director of William Brandt&#x27;s insurance brokers and became a member of Lloyd&#x27;s in 1965.

==Political career==
Edwards left insurance to take Desmond Donnelly&#x27;s old seat of Pembroke and served as Secretary of State for Wales in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first and second administrations.

He was adopted by the Pembrokeshire Conservative Party as parliamentary candidate for Pembroke in 1968.

At the 1970 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire, which he represented until his retirement at the 1987 general election. From 1975 to 1979, he was Opposition Spokesman for Welsh Affairs (in other words, the Shadow Secretary of State for Wales). When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, Edwards was appointed Secretary of State for Wales. He served in that position until 1987, when he was given a life peerage, being created on 15 October 1987 as Baron Crickhowell, of Pont Esgob in the Black Mountains and County of Powys.

==Later career==
Lord Crickhowell was the sole chairman of the National Rivers Authority (NRA) from its inception in 1989 until its merger into the newly created Environment Agency in 1996. Although his was a direct political appointment from the Conservative government, Lord Crickhowell showed commitment to the principles of the NRA and the legislation that it enforced. He spoke in favour of the natural environment and supporting strong enforcement action against major corporate polluters.

During the 1990s, Lord Crickhowell became a leading figure in the campaign for a permanent home for the Welsh National Opera in Cardiff. When the plans were rejected by the Government in 1995, he launched a public attack on his former Conservative colleagues.

Lord Crickhowell sat in the House of Lords as a life peer for over 30 years from 1987 until his death in 2018, making his last appearance in September 2017. He had been associated with many British institutions, including the University of Wales, Cardiff (now Cardiff University), where he was awarded an honorary fellowship in 1984 and served as president from 1988 to 1998. He received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Glamorgan in 2001.

==Personal life and death==
In 1963, Edwards married Ann Healing, and they had three children.

Edwards died from cancer in Battersea on 17 March 2018, at the age of 84. A memorial service was held at St Margaret&#x27;s Church Westminster on 23 October 2018.

<text>Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) was an aircraft leasing company set up in 1975 by Aer Lingus, the Guinness Peat Group (a London-based financial services company) and Tony Ryan, then an Aer Lingus executive.

== History ==
GPA was based in Shannon, Ireland. During the 1980s it became the world&#x27;s largest commercial aircraft lessor and expanded its shareholding to include Air Canada, General Electric, Short Term Credit Bank of Japan and companies in the Mitsubishi group. GPA also had financing joint ventures with key aircraft manufactures, including Airbus, Fokker and McDonnell Douglas. At its peak, the company was valued at $4 billion. Net income reached $265 million in the year to 31 March 1992.

Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, former British chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, Peter Sutherland and the former chairman of ICI, Sir John Harvey-Jones, were among GPA&#x27;s non-executive directors. Lawson joined the board of GPA in February 1990 but he also became chairman of GPA Financial, a subsidiary company.

In 1990, GPA placed a $20 billion order for new aircraft, at the time 10 per cent of the world&#x27;s aircraft production. It was then making an annual profit of $280 million.

A new company, GPA Helicopters Ltd., was set up in June 1990 as a joint venture with CHC Helicopter to acquire, own and lease helicopters worldwide.

=== Downfall ===
The decision to float the company on the stock market in 1992, during an aviation industry downturn following the 1991 Gulf War, proved disastrous, as international financial institutions refused to buy shares. Unable to raise the capital it needed to continue its ambitious operations, the company plunged into crisis, with some $10 billion in debts.

The story of GPA&#x27;s downfall is told by Christopher Brown, aviation lawyer and GPA Senior Vice-President, in his 2009 book &quot;Crash Landing – An Inside Account of the Fall of GPA&quot;. The book is a personal memoir of the history, background and run-in to the failed initial public offering (share flotation), GPA&#x27;s subsequent financial collapse and later restructuring and involvement of GE Capital (GECAS). It is based on a contemporaneous diary of events kept by the author from 1990 to 1996 while employed by GPA and subsequently GECAS.

=== Restructuring ===

In a subsequent restructuring completed in November 1993, GPA avoided default on its debts by selling some of its aircraft to GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), a subsidiary of General Electric, which also took over the operational management of GPA&#x27;s fleet and most of GPA&#x27;s technical and marketing staff. GE Capital also acquired an option to purchase 90% of GPA&#x27;s ordinary shares at a low price. GPA used the cash from this transaction to repay all its unsecured debt. Chairman and chief executive Tony Ryan transferred to GECAS. He was replaced by Patrick Blaney as chief executive and by Dennis Stevenson (later Lord Stevenson of Coddenham) as chairman.

GPA continued to own a substantial fleet and in March 1996 sold 229 aircraft for $4 B in what was at the time the second largest securitisation transaction ever. GPA used the cash from this sale to repay all of its secured debt and the company returned to profit in the year to 31 March 1996 with net income of $65 M. However, the servicer of the securitization was GECAS, meaning that those 229 aircraft were now marketed by GECAS in terms of leasing and re-leasing, effectively joining the GECAS fleet for many purposes, further confirming the rise of GECAS at the expense of GPA.

GPA further consolidated its position in the years to 31 March 1997, 1998 and 1999, reporting net income of $108 million, $64 million and $47 million. In November 1998, Texas Pacific Group acquired 62% of the company&#x27;s shares and GE Capital&#x27;s 1993 option was replaced by one to acquire an interest of 23%. As part of this transaction, the name of the company was changed to AerFi Group plc.

In December 1999, AerFi acquired Indigo Aviation, a Swedish aircraft lessor, and by 31 March 2000 was managing a fleet of 104 aircraft and reporting a profit of $68 million.

In November 2000, AerFi was acquired by debis AirFinance, an affiliate of DaimlerChrysler AG, for $750 million. AerFi&#x27;s fleet and staff were then merged into those of debis AirFinance.

In March 2005, debis AirFinance was acquired by Cerberus Capital and subsequently renamed AerCap.

== Legacy ==
Many of the directors and staff of GPA subsequently went on to found or work for other aircraft lessors, such as GECAS (now merged into AerCap), Genesis Lease, CIT, AerCap (a successor to Guinness Peat and previously debisAirFinance), ILFC (now merged into AerCap), Pembroke Capital, International Aircraft Management Group (subsequently RBS Aviation Capital and later SMBC Aviation Capital), Babcock &amp; Brown (now Fly Leasing) and Aircastle. The availability of this cadre of highly trained specialists in Ireland is one of the principal reasons (along with a favourable corporate tax environment associated with the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin) why the country has become one of the worldwide centres of the commercial aircraft financing and leasing industry, with over 40 companies, most located in the IFSC. GPA&#x27;s founder, Tony Ryan, set up his own airline, Ryanair, that was Europe&#x27;s biggest in 2014, carrying over 83.8 million passengers annually.

== Sponsorship ==
During the Ethiopian famine, GPA sponsored two airlifts of emergency supplies in October and November 1984. GPA supported the renovation of the Bolton Library in Cashel, County Tipperary. A number of other, mainly artistic endeavours benefited from sponsorship by GPA that included the following: In 1988 the first GPA Dublin International Piano Competition took place and was won by French pianist Philippe Cassard. In 1984 Robert Armstrong won the Guinness Peat Aviation Awards for Emerging Artists and in 1986 Eithne Jordan won during the show held in Dublin. One of the exhibitors was Vincent Killowry and in 1987 GPA bought most of the works at his first one-man show in Limerick. In 1989 John Banville received the Guinness Peat Aviation Book Award for his novel &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot;, also shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction. Also in 1989 the Foynes Flying boat Museum at its inception, was sponsored as the &quot;GPA Foynes Flying Boat Museum&quot;.

A statue of Daedalus, sculpted by John Behan, was presented to the people of Ennis to mark the town&#x27;s 750th anniversary in 1990.

<text>Wellington is a market town and a civil parish in the borough of Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire, England. It is situated northwest of Telford and east of Shrewsbury, near the western terminus of the M54 motorway. The summit of The Wrekin lies 3 miles to the southwest. Wellington’s population was 25,554 in the 2011 census.

==History==

A church has stood for almost 1,000years and a priest is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The original churchyard still remains. A new church, dedicated to All Saints, designed by George Steuart, was built in 1789.

Wellington&#x27;s first market charter was granted to Giles of Erdington, lord of the manor, in 1244 and a market still exists today. The market had an open-sided market hall by 1680, and possibly much earlier, but it was dismantled in about 1805. In 1841 a market company was formed to purchase the market rights from Lord Forester in 1856. In 1848 the company built a town hall with the butter market below, creating a permanent covered space for traders. 
The first Shropshire Olympian Games, organised by celebrated Olympic revivalist Dr William Penny Brookes, were held in Wellington in May 1861. In August 1868 the town hosted the third National Olympian Games, organised by the National Olympian Association co-founded by Brookes, when their intended venue at Manchester had become unavailable.

To the northeast of the town is the site of Apley Castle, originally a 14th-century fortified manor house, the remains of which were converted into a stable block with the building of a grand Georgian house, which was itself demolished in 1955. The surviving stable block has been converted into apartments and retains some medieval features.

===The creation of Telford===
Dawley New Town was designated by the government in 1963, and was expanded to encompass Wellington in 1968 under the new name of Telford, named for the great engineer and first county surveyor of Shropshire, Thomas Telford. The creation of Telford has divided opinion in Wellington ever since, with some celebrating the jobs and investment it brought to the area and others bemoaning the negative impact on Wellington&#x27;s own economy; as well as its status and sense of identity. The development of Telford Town Centre and local retail parks since the 1970s had an adverse effect on Wellington&#x27;s retail centre. The local football team&#x27;s name was changed from Wellington Town to Telford United in 1969.

For many years, local politics left Wellington in conflict with Wrekin District (now Telford and Wrekin Council), with claims and counterclaims of neglect. In the 21st century, however, the borough council has invested heavily in the town. These investments include the redeveloped Wellington Civic and Leisure Centre near the centre of the town, which has brought together the library, town council, swimming pool and gym, along with a modern register office. 200 borough council officers are also located at the new complex.

==Commerce==
The area&#x27;s largest employers are located in nearby areas of Telford with Wellington itself housing hundreds of small businesses in its shops, offices and small manufacturing units. A range of nationwide chains have branches in Wellington.

==Attractions==
The Wrekin, one of Shropshire&#x27;s most famous landmarks, is the most northern part of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Located just from the centre of Wellington, it attracts tens of thousands of walkers and cyclists to the town every year.

Located in the town&#x27;s Victorian market hall, Wellington Market operates four days a week and houses over 100 stalls. A Farmers&#x27; Market takes place on the fourth Saturday of the month, bringing together several Shropshire food producers and retailers in the market&#x27;s historic home of Market Square.

A short walk from the centre of the town is Sunnycroft, a Victorian villa and mini-estate now owned and run by the National Trust.

Wellington is home to the Belfrey Theatre, an amateur venue run by the Wellington Theatre Company which offers an annual season of plays and other shows.

==Sport==
The New Buck&#x27;s Head football stadium, home to AFC Telford United, is in Wellington. Other sporting clubs include the Wellington Cricket Club, currently in the Birmingham League Premier Division, and Wrekin Golf Club.

==Events==
The area&#x27;s music and theatre groups host performances throughout the year, and there are craft markets at both Belmont Hall and Christ Church.

In March, the town marks Charter Day, when the 1244 charter is delivered by a messenger on horseback. A jury then convenes in the Market Square to appoint the town crier, ale taster and market clerk for the year ahead.

During the summer, around 40 events take place in and around the town, including the historically inspired Midsummer Fayre, the town carnival and Lions Day at Bowring Park, and the Wellington Walking Festival. Sounds in The Square brings live music to the heart of the town across weekends in July and August, and various concerts and fetes complete the programme.

The Wellington Arts Festival runs every October, and offers a variety of events including plays, music, exhibitions, literature and poetry.

There is now a cinema in Market Square, Wellington, called The Wellington Orbit, which is operated by a team of volunteers. On their website it claims to be &quot;Telford&#x27;s only independent cinema.&quot;

==Education and health services==
Wellington is the main education centre for the borough. Telford College and the independent school Wrekin College are located around the outskirts of the town, along with several primary and secondary schools.

The Princess Royal Hospital, one of Shropshire&#x27;s two main hospitals, is located just outside the town at Apley, as is the Severn Hospice. Within the town, Wellington Health Centre is the main GP practice.

The former cottage hospital was endowed in 1910 by Ann Bowring, in memory of her late husband John, a successful fish merchant and railway entrpreneur. The hospital, which opened on the Haygate Road in 1913, was used as a military auxiliary hospital during World War I. Threatened with closure in 1919, it was saved by local fundraising and continued to serve as a local hospital and later a care home, under the regional Health Board.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Wrekin TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Capital North West and Wales. The town is served by local newspaper, Shropshire Star. 

==Transport==

Wellington has road links, centrally located railway and bus stations, and a position on routes 45 and 81 of the National Cycle Network.

=== Railway ===
Wellington railway station is served by three train operating companies:
* Avanti West Coast operates one return journey to each weekday
* Transport for Wales run hourly services between and West Wales; destinations alternate between &amp; , and 
* West Midlands Trains operate hourly services each way between and , via .

====History====
The station was built in 1849. In 1867, a branch line was opened to connect the town with Market Drayton. The Wellington and Market Drayton Railway operated for almost a hundred years before closure under the Beeching Axe in 1963. The line remained open for goods only services until 1967; the track was lifted in 1970.

There were also railway links to Much Wenlock (closed 1962) and Stafford, which closed in the late 1960s.

A goods only link to a rail head at Donnington, on part of the former Wellington to Stafford line, has been re-opened. There have been campaigns to re-open the whole of the line from Shrewsbury to Stafford through Wellington, Leegomery, Hadley, Trench, Donnington and Newport.

Between 2008 and 2011, the town had a through train service to London Marylebone operated by Wrexham &amp; Shropshire, the first for almost 40 years.

=== Buses ===
Current bus services operated by Arriva in Wellington are:
* 4: Madeley – Leegomery
* 7: Wellington – Telford Centre
* X7: Telford Centre – Shrewsbury 
* 8: Telford/Wellington – Bridgnorth
* X10A: Telford Centre – Shrewsbury 
* 99 – Telford circular

In late 2022, Telford and Wrekin Council introduced the &quot;Travel Telford&quot; services, operated by Chaserider and Select Bus Services; these are:
* 100: Wellington – Sutton Hill
* 101: Madeley – Princess Royal Hospital
* 102/3: Wellington – Newport

====History====
After World War I, BMMO expanded its depots out from Birmingham to other towns and cities in the Midlands, including Shrewsbury, which would later lead to them opening a depot on Charlton Street on 21 July 1932 after closing the Shrewsbury depot in the same month. BMMO was later renamed to Midland Red Omnibus Company in March 1974 and was split up in September 1981 to become Midland Red (North) Limited, with whom the depot was taken control of.

Midland Red North was later acquired by the Cowie Group on 1 August 1996, who would rename and become Arriva on 6 November 1997, making Midland Red North become what is now the current operator that serves Wellington and Telford, Arriva Midlands.

After 80 years of the Charlton Street depot being in operation, it would be closed by Arriva in April 2012 and demolished in summer of 2015. The fleet and staff from the Charlton Street depot were moved to a new premises on Stafford Park prior to its demolition.

==Community projects==
A number of community organisations are active in the town, including Wellington&#x27;s &#x27;Walkers are Welcome&#x27; Group which organises regular walks around the area in addition to the annual Walking Festival, and Wellington H2A promoting arts and heritage in the town through a range of events. Local history and heritage are promoted by Wellington History Group and Wellington Civic Society. A twinning group exists to maintain links with Wellington&#x27;s twin town of Chatenay-Malabry in France.

Amongst current community projects are the Peace Garden, started by local nonagenarian George Evans (died 2020), and the ambitious project to return a cinema to the town for the first time since the closure of the Clifton almost three decades ago. In June 2019, the Wellington Orbit was officially opened, bringing a cafe, bar and cinema to the centre of the town.

== Twin towns ==
Wellington is twinned with Châtenay-Malabry, France.

==Notable people==

The town&#x27;s literary claims to fame include it being the birthplace of 19th-century evangelical religious writer Hesba Stretton (1832–1911), and the first job of poet Philip Larkin (1922–1985) was as librarian of Wellington Library from 1943 to 1946. Larkin described Wellington as a &quot;hole full of toad&#x27;s turds&quot; and stated that his job as town librarian was to &quot;hand out tripey novels to morons&quot;. 
A walkway at the side of Wellington Library was named Larkin Way in honour of Philip Larkin, but this pathway was lost during re-development work on the library. Larkin Way, in a slightly modified form, still exists. The Wellington Civic and Leisure Centre is on Larkin Way.

Reverend Patrick Brontë lived in the town for a year while serving a curacy before moving to Yorkshire and meeting his future wife there, Maria Branwell. The abolitionist Dr William Withering was born in the town in 1741; he also investigated digitalis, used in the treatment of heart disease. Several members of the pop group T&#x27;Pau, including vocalist Carol Decker and keyboardist Michael Chetwood, grew up in Wellington – the latter returning to run a music shop in the town.

<text>Oakengates is a historic market town and civil parish in the borough of Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire, England. The town&#x27;s parish population was recorded as 8,517 in the 2001 census.

==Etymology==

The name is not derived from &quot;oak&quot; or &quot;gates&quot; but is derived from the Ancient Brythonic name for the valley which was Usc-con, meaning The Lake (&quot;Usc&quot; (water)) and the confluence (&quot;Cond&quot;) of two streams (see Cartlidge), and from the Old Norse &quot;gata&quot;, path; see gh- in Indo-European roots. meaning boundary or Road. So Usc-con gait is at the Road at the vale of Usc-con. &quot;The Vales and Gates of Usc-Con: A history of Oakengates&quot; was written by local historian Reverend J.E.G. Cartlidge whose name is commemorated in the name of the retirement home Cartlidge House.

==History==
==Transport==

In the late 18th century the Ketley Canal was constructed to carry coal and ironstone from Oakengates to Ketley works. The canal has long since fallen into disuse and little trace of it can be found today. The first boat lift in Britain was an experimental one built at Oakengates in 1794 by Robert Weldon of Lichfield. A full-scale version was to be built on the Somerset Coal Canal at Rowley Bottom near Combe Hay, but the lift jammed and failed while being demonstrated and the construction was abandoned.

The Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton railway line runs through the town and there is a station and a tunnel (Oakengates Tunnel).

Oakengates was also served by the Coalport Branch Line and had a second station called Oakengates Market Street railway station which closed in 1952. It is now Station Hill with only the goods shed still standing.

==Industry==

Shadrach Fox ran the Wombridge Iron Works in Oakengates and with Abraham Darby was involved in experiments on methods of producing pig iron in a blast furnace fuelled by coke rather than charcoal. In the field of ferrous metallurgy this was a major step forward in the production of iron as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution. In 1701 he placed his brother in charge of the blast furnace, at Wombridge to which Isaac Hawkins supplied a large quantity of coal and ironstone, which suggests that they already smelted iron with coke there - a major technological breakthrough which is now solely commemorated at nearby Coalbrookdale.

The town had a considerable manufacturing sector well into the 20th century and one of the products of this can still be seen at the Museum of Power in Langford, Essex. This has, still in working order, what is believed to be the last steam engine built and installed by the Lilleshall Company Ltd. It was commissioned on 13 January 1931.

==Church==
The present Church of England parish church of Holy Trinity was built in 1854, when a separate ecclesiastical parish had been created from parts of the older parishes of Wombridge and Shifnal.

==Amenities==

Oakengates has Telford Theatre, which was originally opened in 1968 as Oakengates&#x27; Town Hall by champion jockey Sir Gordon Richards, after whose Derby-winning horse is named one of its rooms, the Pinza Suite. Nearby are the town council&#x27;s headquarters and the United Reformed/Methodist church.

Oakengates&#x27; main public open space is Hartshill Park, originally created as the Oakengates Sports and Recreation Ground. by levelling a coal mine spoil heap. Opened in 1927, it remains a valuable facility including bowling green and tennis courts. In 1928 the present park gates were unveiled as a war memorial to local men who died serving in World War I whose names are listed on the gate piers, the World War II casualties being listed on outlying pillars.

Central Park business park is sited on part of the former Priorslee Furnace Works and Eagle Iron Works. The business park includes office space, retail outlets, a nursery and a cafe.

<doc id="966778" wikidata="Q5393654" url="?curid=966778" title="Ernest P. Worrell">
<text>Ernest P. Worrell is a fictional character that was portrayed by American actor Jim Varney in a series of television commercials and then later in a television series (&quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot;) and a series of feature films. 

Ernest—created by Varney with the Nashville advertising agency Carden &amp; Cherry—was used in various local television ad campaigns. The only national products the character promoted were The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s sodas, Chex cereals, and Taco John&#x27;s. The first Ernest commercial, filmed in 1980, advertised an appearance by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders at Beech Bend Park, an amusement park near Bowling Green, Kentucky. 

The format of the Ernest commercials seldom varied, most often scripted to be comedic and fast-paced. The rubber-faced, Southern-accented Ernest, almost always dressed in a denim vest and a baseball cap, appeared at the door or window of an unseen, unheard, and seemingly unwilling neighbor named Vernon, or &quot;Vern&quot; for short. The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be &quot;Vern&quot;, as Varney looked directly into the camera whenever Ernest addressed Vern. Ernest&#x27;s seemingly pointless conversations with Vern—which were actually a monologue due to Vern&#x27;s never responding—inevitably rambled around to a favorable description of the sponsor&#x27;s product, followed by Ernest&#x27;s signature close, &quot;KnowhutImean?&quot;

While Vern never has any spoken lines, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest as evidenced by Vern&#x27;s occasionally trying to slam his door or window in Ernest&#x27;s face. Vern also shakes his head &quot;No&quot; (quick, short camera pans) whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Ernest, despite having good intentions, is utterly oblivious to Vern&#x27;s apparent distress about Ernest and about Ernest&#x27;s regarding Vern as his closest buddy and confidant.

==History==
The Ernest ads were shot with a handheld film camera at the Nashville-area home of producer John Cherry III and Jerry Carden, beginning in 1980. As their number of clients increased, Varney sometimes did upwards of 25 different versions of a spot in a single day. Producer Coke Sams stated that Varney had a photographic memory and would read through the script one time then insert the various products&#x27; names on different takes. The commercials and the character had definite impact; children, especially, seemed to imitate Ernest and, &quot;Knowwhatimean?&quot;, became a catchphrase.

Carden &amp; Cherry had begun receiving requests from major national companies to use Ernest, but were largely unable to agree to most of them because of conflicts with the exclusive rights local companies received when they had requested Ernest commercials. Carden &amp; Cherry responded by transitioning the character to film and television. Ernest&#x27;s first feature-film appearance was as one of Varney&#x27;s numerous characters in the science fiction horror spoof &quot;Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam&quot;, which introduced several supporting actors who would reappear throughout the &quot;Ernest&quot; franchise, including Bill Byrge, Myke R. Mueller, and Jackie Welch.

A Saturday morning sketch comedy series, &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot;, followed shortly thereafter, which won Varney a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance. A series of five feature-length comedies starred Ernest between 1987 and 1993, followed by four more direct-to-video entries; all nine were directed by either John Cherry or Coke Sams. The movies were not critically well-received; however, they were produced on very low budgets and were quite profitable.

In the films, Ernest is apparently somewhat aware of his extreme resistance to harm, as in &quot;Ernest Rides Again&quot;, he seemed barely fazed by nails bending after being fired at his skull, remarking &quot;Good thing they hit the hard end&quot;, he also commented that he would be dead &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t this close to being an actual cartoon.&quot; To allow Varney to act out his numerous other characters, Ernest is portrayed as a master of disguise, able to pose as one of any number of relatives to get out of a predicament. He also is impervious to electrocution, though it did inflict various comical side effects as seen in &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot;. The film series portrays Ernest as a working-class bachelor holding various minimum-wage and blue-collar jobs, such as a gas station attendant, janitor, sanitation worker and construction worker.

In his Ernest role, Varney appeared in dozens of Cerritos Auto Square commercials for many years on Los Angeles area television stations; he also appeared in commercials for Audubon Chrysler Center in Henderson, Kentucky, John L. Sullivan auto dealerships in the Sacramento, California area, the Pontiac, Michigan-based electronics store ABC Warehouse, and the Oklahoma City-based Braum&#x27;s Ice Cream and Dairy Store. In the Southeast, the Ernest character was the spokesman for Purity milk. In New Mexico, he appeared in commercials for Blake&#x27;s Lotaburger. In northern Virginia Ernest appeared a series of commercials for Tyson&#x27;s Toyota. In South Dakota, he appeared in commercials for Lewis Drug.

In Houston, he did commercials promoting Channel 2 News KPRC-TV. In 2005, five years after Varney&#x27;s death, the Ernest P. Worrell character returned in new commercials as a CGI cartoon, created by an animation company called face2face and produced by Ernest originators Carden &amp; Cherry. Ernest was voiced by John C. Hudgens, an advertising and broadcast producer from Little Rock, Arkansas, who also played an Ernest type character in some regional live action commercials.

==Family==
Ernest has a large family made up of people with similar traits to him, all of whom were portrayed by Jim Varney. Varney, as Worrell, mentioned that his family was from Kentucky (Varney&#x27;s real-life birthplace) when he hosted &quot;Happy New Year, America&quot; on CBS on December 31, 1988. Most of Worrell&#x27;s family members had their appearance in either &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s My Family Album&quot;, &quot;Your World as I See It&quot;, or Varney&#x27;s stand-up routine.

; Edna Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s wife according to the television commercials and &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s My Family Album&quot;. According to Ernest, Edna makes a great deep dish pie. Her middle initial is also said to be P. in Ernest&#x27;s newsletter during the 1980s. In the film series, Ernest has become a confirmed bachelor, living alone with his dog.
; Ace Worrell
: A fighter pilot who served in the army. His relation to Ernest is unknown though he is believed to be a great uncle.
; Astor Clement
: Ernest&#x27;s uncle, a wealthy college professor who likes to brag about his rich status and unusual intelligence and was the main narrator of &quot;Your World As I See It&quot;. Astor was also one of Ernest&#x27;s disguises in &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot;.
; Bunny Jeannette Rogers
: The slow-witted and confused sister of Ernest who runs her own quirky hair salon called &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Beauty World&quot;. Her beautifying tactics often involve painful torture for her clients.
; Lloyd Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s great uncle, a mean-spirited, impoverished Appalachian mountain man. He was Ernest&#x27;s disguise as &quot;The Snake Guy&quot; in &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot;. &quot;Lloyd &quot;Rowe&quot; was one of Varney&#x27;s stand-up characters before the creation of Ernest; he was originally conceived as the Appalachian answer to a mountaintop guru with an obese wife named Ruth and an even more massive, indestructible eight-year-old son named Mistake. Name changed to Worrell in Ernest Family Album.
; Auntie Nelda
: Ernest&#x27;s elderly, sarcastic and dramatic great-aunt. She regularly complains about her son Izzy not visiting enough, noting that her other son Hymie had always treated her well but died. Her late husband Morris was cremated and she still harangues his ashes. She tries to get men to notice her by acting innocent all the time. One of Varney&#x27;s most frequent characters, Auntie Nelda was one of Ernest&#x27;s &quot;multiple personalities&quot; in &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot; and one of his disguises in &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot;, &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot;, &quot;Ernest Rides Again&quot;, and &quot;Ernest Goes to Africa&quot;. Auntie Nelda was also used as one of Dr. Otto&#x27;s disguises in &quot;Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam&quot; and was a regular segment on &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot;
; Coy Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s redneck brother who is stuck in a 1950s rockabilly mindset and runs a store that sells car parts. He is a Bears fan, has virtually no thoughts on any substantive issues (shrugging his shoulders and responding &quot;dunno&quot; whenever asked) is quite proud of the tattoo collection on his body. Coy has been married at least twice: first to Rayette Worrell and then to Anita Worrell.
; Billy &quot;Boogie&quot; Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s cousin, a carny who operates the Scrambler at an amusement park, speaks to his patrons in rhyming jive, and dances to a disco beat. While he frequently makes passes at attractive female patrons, he is in fact a married man with a teenage son and speaks with a normal voice outside of work.
; Davy Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s light-headed great, great uncle who was a war veteran in the late 19th century. He helped his army troop win a battle against a Native American tribe led by Chief Running Vern, even though his troop was not even present at the time. He is a spoof of frontiersman Davy Crockett.
; Rhetch Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s great, great-grandfather who was popular with women and had a girlfriend named Verna. He was a heavy gambler and incredibly stupid.
; Pa Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s elderly father, a World War II veteran who has a politically incorrect view of the world. His first name is never revealed. He is an avid fisherman and is friends with an African savage named Qui Qua.
; Ma Worrell
: Ernest&#x27;s elderly mother. She is known to be a good cook and according to Ernest she used to make a great chocolate milk.
; Reverend Phineas Worrell
: A distant English-born ancestor of Ernest in &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot;. He helped banish a troll named Trantor, who Ernest accidentally released several generations later. Phineas was unique among the known Worrell family in that he appeared to have a relatively serious disposition and appeared to be quite intelligent for the brief moment that he was shown. However, as Trantor was being banished, the troll placed a curse on the Worrell family that would make members of the family considerably less intelligent with each successive generation, ultimately culminating in a member of the family that would release Trantor.
; Dingus Worrell
: A potato, who Ernest says came over during the potato famine and went on to become a yam magnate.

==Pets==
Ernest also had several pets during the course of his career. They are listed below in order of appearance.

; Shorty
: Ernest&#x27;s first dog. She appeared in several commercials usually having given birth to a litter of puppies in the back of Vern&#x27;s new pick up truck while out driving with Ernest. Shorty&#x27;s exact breed is unknown as she was portrayed by a different breed in each of her appearances. In the &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest&quot; episode &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Magic&quot;, Shorty was a male and Vern&#x27;s dog. He was portrayed by a Border Collie on the show.
; Pokey
: A box turtle that Ernest had adopted from &quot;actual nature&quot; in &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;. Pokey and his family were used as &quot;turtle paratroopers&quot; during the battle with the miners toward the end of the movie.
; Ants
: In &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;, Ernest mentions that he once had an ant farm.
; Rover
: Ernest&#x27;s second dog. Ernest&#x27;s pursuit of Rover was the subject of a &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot; episode. Ernest spent the episode saving up to buy Rover but Vern ended up buying him first only to give him to Ernest at the end.
; Rimshot
: Ernest&#x27;s third dog, a male Jack Russell Terrier. Rimshot is Ernest&#x27;s best known pet. He is characterized as very smart. He was featured in two of the movies, &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot; and &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot;, in which he was also shown to be very brave and tough, as he would stand up to the main villains which would usually lead to his near demise.
; Jake
: Ernest&#x27;s Fantail (goldfish) in &quot;Ernest Goes to Africa&quot;. Jake died when Ernest accidentally broke his fish bowl and then dropped him into the kitchen garbage disposal and mistakenly hit the wrong switch.

===Scrapped films===
In 1990, seven Ernest films were reported to be in development. Coke Sams said in 2011 that &quot;Ernest Spaced Out&quot; may have gotten as far as a film treatment. Sams said about the film, &quot;I believe that was kind of a &quot;Lost in Space&quot; epic. It seems like there were astronauts and maybe a space capsule.&quot;

Soon after the release of &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;, several more films were being contemplated, including &quot;Ernest the Bellhop&quot; and &quot;Ernest in Paradise&quot;.

Sams said a script had been written for &quot;Ernest and the Voodoo Curse&quot;: &quot;We went back to the &quot;Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; kind of thing. It had a really bad guy and happened on an island like Hawaii. ... So we had Voodoo and a high priest. It was like the idiot version of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. We had lines of zombies, Voodoo potions, and Ernest pretending to be a zombie. &quot;Ernest and the Voodoo Curse&quot; actually was pretty funny. There was a woman in it, who had one blue eye and one brown eye. She was supposed to be the woman of Ernest&#x27;s dreams. Of course, she would have nothing to do with him.&quot;

Varney had been in consideration for a role in the 1999 film &quot;Pirates of the Plain&quot;.

==Parodies==
Ernest has been parodied in numerous television series, including &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Some of the &quot;fake&quot; Ernest films from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; include &quot;Ernest Needs a Kidney&quot;, &quot;Ernest vs. the Pope&quot;, &quot;Ernest Goes to Broadway&quot;, &quot;Ernest Goes Straight to Video&quot;, and &quot;Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap&quot; (footage from &quot;Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap&quot; was shown in the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, in which Ernest is seen in a public library with Vern and gets his head stuck in a toilet). In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot;, Peter remembers the time he went to Blockbuster two minutes before closing and was forced to choose between &quot;Ernest Goes to the Beach&quot; and &quot;Ernest Doesn&#x27;t Go to the Beach&quot;.

In the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; episode &quot;At the Movies&quot;, the boys are watching Ernest at the drive-in. Ernest is inside the Statue of Liberty and comes across a door with a sign that reads &quot;DO NOT ENTER&quot;. However, Ernest misreads it as &quot;donut entry&quot; and opens the door, falling through the statue&#x27;s nose. Other TV shows that have referenced the Ernest movies include &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, &quot;Paradise PD&quot;, and many more.

He has recently been spoofed by Arkansas-based spokesman John Lee in television commercials for &quot;Englert Leaf Guard&quot; gutters.

In at least one version of the &quot;Retro City Rampage&quot; game series, &quot;Ernest Gets Rabies&quot; can be seen on the theatre marquee as one of the movies being shown.

==Commercials on home video==
Most of Ernest&#x27;s commercials were released on VHS tapes, and are also available on DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment.

==Merchandise==
A comedic paperback book titled &quot;Hey, Vern! It&#x27;s the Ernest P. Worrell Book of Knowledge&quot; was published by Carden &amp; Cherry in 1985, which was re-released with the title &quot;It&#x27;s the Ernest P. Worrell Book of Knawledge&quot; in 1986. It was followed by the book &quot;Ask Ernest: What, When, Where, Why, Who Cares?&quot;, published by Rutledge Hill Press in 1993. Both books were designed as if Ernest had created his own homemade zine, featuring a varied collection of jokes, puns, musings, and art.

A Ernest talking doll based on the TV series &quot;Hey Vern, It&#x27;s Ernest!&quot; was produced by Kenner in 1989.

==Legacy==
In 2017, Tennessee resident and Varney fan Phil Baker, launched an annual &quot;Ernest Day&quot; at Montgomery Bell State Park in Middle Tennessee, one of the filming locations of &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;.

<text>Bonnie Mitchelson (born November 28, 1947) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba legislature from 1986 to 2014, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1999. She also served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 2000, following Filmon&#x27;s resignation.

==Early life and history==

Born Bonnie Bester, the daughter of Henry Bester and Millie Leslie, she was educated at the Health Sciences Centre School of Nursing and practiced as a Registered Nurse. In 1969, she married Don Mitchelson, who has been a politician, having served as a city councillor in Winnipeg.

==Political career==

She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1986, defeating incumbent New Democrat Phil Eyler in the northeast Winnipeg riding of River East. She was re-elected by a wider margin in 1988, as Filmon&#x27;s Tories won a minority government.

On May 9, 1988, Mitchelson was appointed Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation (later renamed Culture, Heritage and Citizenship), with responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act. On February 5, 1991, she was also named Minister responsible for Multiculturalism with responsibility for Status of Women. As Minister of Culture, Mitchelson made the controversial decision to establish a review commission for Manitoba&#x27;s arts policy that was made up entirely of non-artists.

After a cabinet shuffle on September 10, 1993, she was named Minister of Family Services, and retained the position until the Filmon government was defeated in 1999. Prior to the election of 1999, she proposed a series of workfare measures as part of a policy of welfare reform.

Mitchelson was re-elected by a comfortable margin in 1990, and again in 1995 and 1999. She was chosen as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party on May 29, 2000, and held the position until Stuart Murray was acclaimed as party leader in November. She was then named as the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader. She was the first woman chosen to lead the Manitoba Progressive Conservative party, and only the third female party leader in Manitoba&#x27;s history.

In the general election of 2003, Mitchelson defeated New Democrat Doug Longstaffe, 4,935 votes to 4,402. She was the only Progressive Conservative MLA to hold a seat in the north of Winnipeg.

She was a supporter of Hugh McFadyen&#x27;s campaign to succeed Stuart Murray as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, and was narrowly re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

==Retirement==
Bonnie Mitchelson announced her retirement from provincial politics in October 2014.

She served as board Chair of Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries from April 24, 2017 to December 6, 2023.

<text>The Special Operations Service Ribbon is a service award of the United States Coast Guard which was first created 1 July 1987 by order of Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul A. Yost Jr. The award is authorized for certain acts of non-combat meritorious service, for which no other service medal or ribbon is authorized.

The four main areas of eligibility, for the presentation of the Special Operations Service Ribbon, are listed as follows:

* Coast Guard operations of a special nature involving multiple agency involvement pertaining to national security or law enforcement. 
* Coast Guard operations of a special nature in support of special events drawing large media interest and public attention. 
* Coast Guard operations or involvement with foreign government in all areas of saving life and property at sea. 
* Coast Guard operations of assistance for friendly and/or developing nations.

Initially a one-time award precluded from the use of service stars, multiple awards of the Special Operations Service Ribbon are now denoted by service stars.

The Commandant of the Coast Guard has also periodically authorized award of the Special Operations Service Ribbon to certain warships, aviation squadrons and other selected units of the U.S. Navy, primarily for support of USCG-led counter-narcotics (CN) and drug interdiction operations and to U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force units assisting in search-and-rescue and/or natural disaster operations in partnership with the U.S. Coast Guard.

<text>Kenworthy James &quot;Ken&quot; Thompson (1895–1931) was a British-born Canadian professional ice hockey player. After playing several seasons of amateur hockey in Montreal, Thompson played two seasons of professional hockey for the Montreal Wanderers. He joined the Wanderers for the 1916–17 season, the final one of the National Hockey Association, and played one game for them in the new National Hockey League before retiring from hockey. He was born in Oakengates, Shropshire, United Kingdom, but grew up in Montreal, Quebec.

==Playing career==
Thompson played 14 games for the Wanderers in 1916–17 in the last year of the NHA. The following season Thompson and the Wanderers franchise would be playing in the start-up National Hockey League. He played one game in the NHL, on December 26, 1917, against the Ottawa Senators.

Before his professional career, he played in various amateur teams:

*Montreal HLP
*Université Laval
*All-Montreal

<doc id="966789" wikidata="Q5296705" url="?curid=966789" title="Donnington, Telford">
<text>Donnington is a village in the parish of Donnington and Muxton in the borough of Telford and Wrekin in Shropshire, England. The population of Donnington Ward was 6,883 at the 2011 census.

==History==
Before the Romans arrived in Britain the area around Donnington was a mixture of forest and open rough ground in some respects more suitable to sheep rather than humans. Further down Donnington&#x27;s low lying valley, north of Donnington, the ground was marshy wetland habitat; today this has been drained for farming. This wet moorland provided protection for pre-Roman Celts living between 300BC and 100AD near the hill fort at the now small settlement of Wall north of Donnington.

The original Donnington village was to the northeast of the current centre of Donnington. A map of Shropshire by John Speed from 1610 refers to Donnington as &quot;Dunnyton&quot;, the ending &quot;ington&quot; meaning in Anglo Saxon &quot;Dunny&#x27;s homestead or farm&quot;. This farm was most likely leased from the Saxon Minster of St Alkmund&#x27;s in Shrewsbury who, when the Normans arrived, held the land around Lilleshall (according to the Domesday Survey (1086)). Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 the land was eventually passed to Godbald, religious adviser to the Norman magnate Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury; Godbald&#x27;s descendants, the Belmeis family, endowed the land in 1145 to the Christian Augustinian foundation from North East France who built Lilleshall Abbey. Over 400 years later the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII ended centuries of church dominated society and the land was purchased in 1539 by James Leveson, a Wolverhampton wool merchant and was then passed down his family&#x27;s inheritance to eventually become part of the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s estate. Leveson&#x27;s descendants over the centuries invested heavily in draining the sodden moors to the north of Donnington so they could be farmed and in mining coal from the Donnington Wood coalfield. Locals, mostly men, would have found work in these enterprises and at the local farms.

By the early 20th century Donnington was a minor industrial centre where &quot;Walker&#x27;s works&quot; (C&amp;W Walker Ltd) iron works produced components of gasometers and ship&#x27;s engines. The Clock Tower restaurant commemorates the landmark Walker&#x27;s Clock which now sits on a road island near where &quot;Walker&#x27;s works&quot; once was. This roundabout is just a hundred metres north from the centre of the original village of Donnington. Walker&#x27;s Clock&#x27;s distinctive audible blast called the workers living in Donnington and nearby to work and was a time keeper for everyone else. At the same location there was, as shown on an Ordnance Survey map from 1833, Donnington railway station with freight and passenger connections to Wellington and Stafford; this was closed as part of Beeching cuts in 1964. Only further north, at The Humbers, iron-making is thought to have taken place since the late 16th century, with the name &#x27;Humbers&#x27; deriving from a set of water-driven ‘hammers’ which in 1580 were owned by the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s Leveson ancestors (whose Lilleshall Ironworks was one of the first blast furnaces in the West Midlands). The Hammers were located on or near the site of a mill on Lubstree Pool, which before the dissolution of the monasteries had belonged to the Canons of the nearby Lilleshall Abbey.

At the original Donnington village centre there was a coal wharf linked by rail to the Granville Colliery, Shropshire&#x27;s last deep coal mine. This mine tapped into the Donnington Wood coalfield (where most of the local coal and ironstone reserves are located and which once came to the surface where it was mined in the 18th century at Donnington Wood). In 1818 the Lilleshall Company began sinking a number of deep mines around Donnington Wood, extracting over 400,000 tons of coal a year from the area by 1871. This industrial heritage links the original Donnington village to the Industrial Revolution that Telford proudly asserts began with the first large scale smelting of iron using coke in the Coalbrookdale area of Telford.

The current centre of Donnington, near the Parade (as in the photo here), is actually the centre of a planned village initially called New Donnington, a housing development that began in the late 1930s when the War Office bought land to house the workers who would be employed at the Donnington Army Ordnance Depot, which became active in 1940 and remains in use as a logistics base. The new planned town of Telford that includes Donnington was a separate planned development begun in 1963.

==Today==
Donnington is a ward of Telford with a long parade of shops down the high street. In the 21st century this has grown with an Asda superstore and an Aldi supermarket added to the Co-op supermarket that already existed. Additionally, a Home Bargains supermarket has replaced the Netto then Netto replaced Morrison&#x27;s supermarket in the centre of Donnington on the site of the old pub &quot;The Champion Jockey&quot;.

The Telford International Railfreight Park (TIRF), opened in 2009 has been developed on a site formerly part of the MoD depot, given rail access by rebuilding of the former Shropshire Union Railway west towards Wellington. It is expected this development will attract more light industry to the industrial estates near Donnington.

Donnington is home to a small amateur dramatics company &quot;The Little Theatre&quot; and each year the Broadoaks playing fields play host to a Guy Fawkes fair and bonfire night.

==Notable people==
*Norman Jones (1932–2013), actor mainly on TV, born in Donnington.
*Barrington J. Bayley (1937–2008), science fiction writer, came to live in Donnington as a child during the Second World War.
===Sport===

<doc id="966794" wikidata="Q898861" url="?curid=966794" title="Isoelectric focusing">
<text>Isoelectric focusing (IEF), also known as electrofocusing, is a technique for separating different charged molecules by differences in their isoelectric point (pI). It is a type of zone electrophoresis usually performed on proteins in a gel that takes advantage of the fact that overall charge on the molecule of interest is a function of the pH of its surroundings.

==Procedure==
IEF involves adding an ampholyte solution into immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels. IPGs are the acrylamide gel matrix co-polymerized with the pH gradient, which result in completely stable gradients except the most alkaline (&gt;12) pH values. The immobilized pH gradient is obtained by the continuous change in the ratio of &quot;immobilines&quot;. An immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value.

A protein that is in a pH region below its isoelectric point (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate toward the cathode (negatively charged electrode). As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein&#x27;s overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction toward either electrode). As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.

Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by aliphatic ampholytes). An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a &quot;positive&quot; anode and &quot;negative&quot; cathode end. Negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the &quot;positive&quot; end while positively charged molecules move toward the &quot;negative&quot; end. As a particle moves toward the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecule&#x27;s isoelectric point is reached. At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as polyampholytes with varying pI values to electrophoresis.

The method is applied particularly often in the study of proteins, which separate based on their relative content of acidic and basic residues, whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an immobilized pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch, or agarose where a pH gradient has been established. Gels with large pores are usually used in this process to eliminate any &quot;sieving&quot; effects, or artifacts in the pI caused by differing migration rates for proteins of differing sizes. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in pI value by as little as 0.01. Isoelectric focusing is the first step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which proteins are first separated by their pI value and then further separated by molecular weight through SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric focusing, on the other hand, is the only step in preparative native PAGE at constant pH.

==Living cells==
According to some opinions, living eukaryotic cells perform isoelectric focusing of proteins in their interior to overcome a limitation of the rate of metabolic reaction by diffusion of enzymes and their reactants, and to regulate the rate of particular biochemical processes. By concentrating the enzymes of particular metabolic pathways into distinct and small regions of its interior, the cell can increase the rate of particular biochemical pathways by several orders of magnitude. By modification of the isoelectric point (pI) of molecules of an enzyme by, e.g., phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, the cell can transfer molecules of the enzyme between different parts of its interior, to switch on or switch off particular biochemical processes.

==Microfluidic chip based==
Microchip based electrophoresis is a promising alternative to capillary electrophoresis since it has the potential to provide rapid protein analysis, straightforward integration with other microfluidic unit operations, whole channel detection, nitrocellulose films, smaller sample sizes and lower fabrication costs.

==Multi-junction==
The increased demand for faster and easy-to-use protein separation tools has accelerated the evolution of IEF towards in-solution separations. In this context, a multi-junction IEF system was developed to perform fast and gel-free IEF separations. The multi-junction IEF system utilizes a series of vessels with a capillary passing through each vessel. Part of the capillary in each vessel is replaced by a semipermeable membrane. The vessels contain buffer solutions with different pH values, so that a pH gradient is effectively established inside the capillary. The buffer solution in each vessel has an electrical contact with a voltage divider connected to a high-voltage power supply, which establishes an electrical field along the capillary. When a sample (a mixture of peptides or proteins) is injected in the capillary, the presence of the electrical field and the pH gradient separates these molecules according to their isoelectric points. The multi-junction IEF system has been used to separate tryptic peptide mixtures for two-dimensional proteomics and blood plasma proteins from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease patients for biomarker discovery.

<text>California Citrus State Historic Park is an open-air museum in the city of Riverside, California, United States. As part of the state park system of California, it interprets the historic cultural landscape of the citrus industry. The park’s museum exhibits and interpretive features share the story of the citrus industry&#x27;s role in the history and development of Southern California, and is told through the experiences of the diverse migrant and immigrant groups who made it all possible. The park was established in 1993.

This California State Historic Park reveals the cultural, political, and environmental aspects of the time when &quot;Citrus was King&quot; in California, especially the Navel orange from Riverside, and recognizing the importance of the citrus industry in Southern California.

==Context==
In 1873, Riverside resident Eliza Tibbets planted two orange trees from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The success of these trees launched the orange industry in the area.

==Description ==

The design of the park is reminiscent of a 1900s city park, complete with an activity center, interpretive structure, amphitheater, picnic area, and demonstration groves of citrus tree orchards. The land contained within the park still continues to produce high-quality fruits. Free samples of the unique citrus fruits are available for visitors.

The park&#x27;s visitor center houses a museum about California&#x27;s citrus industry, and antique citrus grove farm equipment is on display around the park.

==In popular culture==
In 2002 Huell Howser Productions, in association with KCET/Los Angeles, featured the park in &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Parks&quot;.

<text>Staff sergeant major is an appointment in some Commonwealth armies and also a rank in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

==Canada==
Staff sergeant major is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) rank above staff sergeant but junior to sergeant major.

==Israel==
Staff Sergeant Major is an Israel Police and Israel Border Police (Magav) rank junior to Advanced Staff Sergeant Major.

==United Kingdom==
Staff sergeant major (SSM) is an appointment in the British Army held by warrant officers class 1 in the Royal Logistic Corps who are not conductors or regimental sergeant majors.

Staff sergeant majors existed in the Army Service Corps and Ordnance Store Branch in the 19th century. In 1896, however, staff sergeant majors in the new Army Ordnance Corps were renamed sub-conductors (becoming staff sergeant majors again in 1967). Staff sergeant majors remained in the Army Service Corps, later the Royal Army Service Corps, and continued when it became the Royal Corps of Transport in 1965. The appointment passed to the new Royal Logistic Corps in 1993.

In 1892, conductors of supplies in the Army Service Corps were renamed staff sergeant majors 1st class. Like the conductors, they wore their royal arms rank badge in a wreath. The appointment has now been abolished.

<doc id="966803" wikidata="Q3343204" url="?curid=966803" title="Bernal Heights, San Francisco">
<text>Bernal Heights ( ) is a residential neighborhood in southeastern San Francisco, California. The prominent Bernal Heights hill overlooks the San Francisco skyline and features a microwave transmission tower. The nearby Sutro Tower can be seen from the Bernal Heights neighborhood.

==Location==
Bernal Heights lies to the south of San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District. Its most prominent feature is the open parkland and radio tower on its large rocky hill, Bernal Heights Summit. Bernal is bounded by Cesar Chavez Street to the north, San Jose Avenue to the west, US 101 to the east, and I-280 to the south.

== History ==

Bernal Heights was part of the 1839 Rancho Rincon de las Salinas y Potrero Viejo, a Mexican land grant awarded to José Cornelio Bernal (1796–1842). By 1860, the land belonged to François Louis Alfred Pioche (1818–1872), a Frenchman and financier, who subdivided it into smaller lots. Its streets were laid out during the Civil War by Army engineers from the Presidio, which explains why so many Bernal streets are named for military men. It was first populated primarily by Irish immigrants who farmed the land and ran dairy ranches. According to legend, a mini gold rush was triggered in 1876 when con artists planted the hilltop with traces of gold.

Bernal Heights experienced a period of growth after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as displaced people from San Francisco moved to the neighborhood for temporary or permanent residence. Built atop bedrock consisting largely of seismic-dampening radiolarian chert, many of the hill&#x27;s structures had survived the tremor, and the sparseness of the development saved much of Bernal from the ravages of the firestorm that followed. The commercial corridor of Eugenia Avenue filled in with shops as the pastureland on the hilltop was developed for workers&#x27; homes during the rapid rebuilding of the city. Some of the tiny earthquake cottages, which the city built to house quake refugees, survive to this day, including three that were moved up to Bernal Heights. During World War II, the area saw another population surge. The new arrivals included many African-American families who worked at the nearby San Francisco Naval Shipyard at Hunters Point. During the Vietnam War, the neighborhood was known as &quot;Red Hill&quot; for the anti-war activists in shared households and collectives who moved in among the working-class families.

Since , the Wild Side West, a queer and lesbian bar, has occupied space on Cortland Avenue.

By the 1990s, Bernal&#x27;s pleasant microclimate, small houses (some with traditional Victorian or Edwardian architecture) and freeway access to the peninsula and Silicon Valley led to a third wave of migration. Bernal has not gentrified to the extent of its neighbor Noe Valley, but gentrification and property values are increasing as urban professionals replace working-class home owners and renters.

Notable residents and former residents include Tom Ammiano, Honey Lee Cottrell, Dan Nakamura, Carlos Santana, Annie Sprinkle, Charles Gatewood, Terry Zwigoff Matt Nathanson, David Pescovitz, and children&#x27;s author Jane Wattenberg (aka Mrs. Mustard).
==Attractions and characteristics==

The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a commercial strip along Cortland Avenue featuring restaurants, bakeries, a fish and butchery shop, multiple salons and other commercial businesses. The local branch of the San Francisco Public Library at 500 Cortland was built by Frederick H. Meyer with funding from the Works Progress Administration and dedicated in 1940. After closing for nearly two years for renovations and after much long-standing contention over the murals that adorn the library&#x27;s exterior, the library reopened in January 2010. There is also a collection of restaurants and cafés at the bottom of the northern slope, near the Cesar Chavez Avenue border. They center around the newly renovated rectangular Precita Park. Also notable in that area is Precita Eyes, a mural art center.

A strong tradition of neighborhood activism led to the establishment of the Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center in 1979. It works to promote community organizing, affordable housing services, senior services, and youth services. Additionally, the neighborhood center hosts &quot;Fiesta on the Hill&quot;, one of the last street fairs of the summer festival season. The fair is billed as a &quot;community-building event&quot;, and takes place on the third Sunday in October.

Bernal&#x27;s north slope has been referred to as one of San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;banana belts&quot;, with warmer temperatures from San Francisco Bay and less marine fog making its way inland.

The grassland on the hilltop is home to a remarkable urban ecosystem, including the majority of native north-coast wildflowers — most notable of which is the state flower: the California poppy — raccoons, opossums, skunks, raptors (including American kestrels, red-tailed hawks, Cooper&#x27;s hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and great horned owls), and at times, at least one coyote. The radio tower is a major connection point for the metropolitan San Francisco area. Bernal Hill Park is a designated &quot;off-leash&quot; park for dogs, and it is a destination for many dogs and their owners since it is one of the largest parks in San Francisco. Bernal Heights Boulevard, which circles the hilltop, has about a path of asphalt and hard packed sand for walking and running that is closed to motor traffic. It is also the site of the San Francisco Illegal Soapbox Society&#x27;s annual derby.

Precita Park, named after its eponymous creek, and Holly Park provide grassy open areas to the north and south of the hill, respectively.

The park is known for its unusually steep streets. Bradford above Tompkins, with an alleged 41% grade, is claimed to be the steepest in the world, but this has yet to be graded by Guinness World Records.

===Alemany Farmers&#x27; Market===
The southeast corner of Bernal Heights is home to the open-air Alemany Farmers&#x27; Market, one of the oldest extant farmers&#x27; markets in the US, operating every Saturday in this location since August 4, 1947. A flea market occupies the market area on Sundays.

The Market gets its name from the Alemany Farm located in the neighborhood. In turn, the farm is home to the Alemany Farm Springs.

==Geology==

Bernal Hill, along with the other hills in the San Francisco area, is a folded hill, created by the &quot;wrinkling up&quot; effect of the Pacific Plate subducting under the North American Plate, when the North American and Pacific plates were converging, around 150 million years ago. Near the summit you will find folded layers of very hard rock called radiolarian chert. It is a high in silica sedimentary rock which gets its silica content from the shells of microscopic creatures called radiolaria. The red color comes from iron oxide. In between the layers of chert are thinner layers of shale in many different colors from the same red as the surrounding rock to white, green and purple. Other types of rocks and minerals on the hill include serpentinite, jasper and clay. The alternating layers of rock type suggest a seasonal cycle of influx of sea water, carrying the radiolaria and outflow of the Sacramento River carrying silt and mud.

<text>Zhu Chen (, ; born March 13, 1976) is a Chinese-born Qatari chess Grandmaster. In 1999, she became China&#x27;s second women&#x27;s world chess champion after Xie Jun, and China&#x27;s 13th Grandmaster. In 2006, she obtained Qatari citizenship and since then has played for Qatar.

==Biography==
In 1988 Zhu became the first Chinese player to win an international chess competition when she won the World Girls Under-12 Championship in Romania.

She won the World Junior Girls Chess Championship in 1994 and 1996. When she became Grandmaster in 1999, she was the seventh woman to do so.

At the age of 25 she defeated Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia in a tournament for the 2001/2002 Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship, by 5–3, becoming the ninth champion.

Zhu gave up the chance to defend her world title in Georgia in May 2004 due to a jammed schedule and her pregnancy.

In June 2004, Zhu played two games against the chess computer &quot;Star of Unisplendour&quot;, which was an advanced AMD 64 bit 3400+ CPU and 2 GB RAM combined with the chess engine Fritz 8. She lost both games.

<text>Oleg Anatolyevich Salenko (, ; born 25 October 1969) is a Russian-Ukrainian former footballer who played as a forward. He scored a record five goals in a group-stage match in the 1994 World Cup, helping him earn the Golden Boot as joint-top tournament goalscorer.

==Club career==

Salenko was born to a Ukrainian father and a Russian mother in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He played for Zenit Leningrad, Dynamo Kyiv, Logroñés, Córdoba, Valencia, Rangers and İstanbulspor during his club career, that lasted from 1986 to 2000.

Eventually, he faded from the international football scene and finally had to end his career prematurely, at the age of 31, for injury reasons. Salenko returned to playing professional football in the 2000–01 season and signed for Pogoń Szczecin. He retired after playing a single game due to his physical conditioning.

==International career==
Salenko played for the Soviet Union under-20 team at the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, becoming the tournament top scorer with 5 goals. He played a total of only nine international matches, including the Ukraine 1–3 Hungary friendly, which was the first international game for the Ukraine national football team to be recognised by FIFA. He also had eight appearances for Russia and scored six goals, all of them at the World Cup in which he was joint top scorer. His last international appearance was 6–1 win against Cameroon when he scored five times.

As of 2024, he is the only player to win the Golden Boot at both the U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup.

===1994 FIFA World Cup===
Salenko set a World Cup record by scoring five goals in one game in Russia&#x27;s 6–1 win against Cameroon on 28 June 1994. He finished the 1994 World Cup with six goals, having scored from the penalty spot against Sweden in the previous match and shared the Golden Boot with Bulgarian Hristo Stoichkov after being knocked out in the first round and having played only three matches while Bulgaria played a total of seven matches and achieved a fourth-place finish. As of 2022, Salenko is the only player ever to win the Golden Boot award on a team eliminated from the World Cup finals at the group stage.

==Beach football==
In 2003, Salenko was appointed as manager of the Ukraine national beach soccer team. His team played three games, the only win being over USA 6–5, and losing the other two to Brazil and Spain. The tournament took place at the end of July in Portugal under the name &quot;Mundialito&quot;. After the tournament, he was dismissed. He was later taking part of FFU assisting staff, but later stopped being involved in football to focus on his business.

<doc id="966816" wikidata="Q1441652" url="?curid=966816" title="Francis Marion University">
<text>Francis Marion University is a public university near Florence, South Carolina. It is named in honor of American Revolutionary War Brigadier General Francis Marion.

==History==
The university dates back to 1957, when the University of South Carolina set up a freshman college in a basement room of the Florence County Library. A few years later, in 1961, USC-Florence was set up on land donated by the Wallace family six miles east of Florence, South Carolina. A group of Florence-area citizens continued to push for the establishment of a four-year university in Florence to allow better access to higher education for the people of that area. The existing USC-F was an obvious foundation for a new institution. After several years of lobbying, Governor Robert E. McNair signed into law an act creating Francis Marion College, effective July 1, 1970. The newly created Francis Marion College initially enrolled 907 students from 23 of South Carolina&#x27;s 46 counties.

In 1992, Francis Marion College achieved university status and subsequently changed its name to &quot;Francis Marion University&quot;. Today, Francis Marion has a student body of approximately 4,000. FMU draws students from across the country and around the world, but remains true to its original mission: to educate the people of the Pee Dee Region and the State of South Carolina. The student body&#x27;s average in-state enrollment is 95 percent. Just more than half of FMU&#x27;s students come from the Pee Dee Region.

Francis Marion is one of South Carolina&#x27;s 13 public universities. Its academic departments are segmented into three schools (School of Business, School of Education, School of Health Sciences) and the College of Liberal Arts.

<text>Alisa Mikhailovna Galliamova (, ; born 18 January 1972 in Kazan) is a Russian chess player who holds the FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and Woman Grandmaster (WGM). She is twice runner-up at the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship, in 1999 and 2006, and three-time Russian women&#x27;s champion (1997, 2009, 2010). She was known as &quot;Alisa Galliamova-Ivanchuk&quot; from 1993 to 2001.

She played for the gold medal-winning Russian team at the 2010 Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad and for the gold medal-winning Ukrainian team in the 1992 Women&#x27;s European Team Chess Championship.

==Career==
Galliamova won the World Under-16 Girls&#x27; Championship in 1987 and 1988. In 1988 she also won the World Junior Girls Championship.

She won the 1992 European Team Championship, got two silver medals at the 1990 and 1992 Chess Olympiads, as well as bronze in 1996. She also won multiple personal championships in Russia.

=== Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 1999 ===

In December 1997, she won the Candidates Tournament for the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship held in Groningen, Netherlands. She was scheduled to play a match with Xie Jun (who finished second in the 1997 Candidates Tournament) in August 1998, and the winner of that match was supposed to play a match in November 1998 with Zsuzsa Polgar for the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship.

However, after the match with Xie Jun had already been scheduled, Galliamova objected because the entire match was scheduled to be played in China, the home of her rival. The reason for this was because only China had bid for the match. Galliamova wanted half of the match to be played in Kazan, Russia. However, the Russians did not have the money required. Finally, when Galliamova failed to show up to play the match, the match was declared forfeited to Xie Jun.

FIDE then scheduled a match between Xie Jun and Zsuzsa Polgar for November 1998. However, Polgar said that she could not play at that time because she was pregnant. After Polgar had given birth to her first son, Tom, in March 1999, FIDE again tried to schedule a match. This time Polgar said that she could not play the match because she was nursing.

Finally, after repeated efforts to organize a match which was supposed to have taken place in 1998, FIDE declared that Polgar had forfeited her title and that the title was vacant. FIDE decided to let Galliamova back into the cycle and held a match between Xie Jun and Galliamova for the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 1999. This time, Galliamova was willing to play because her original demand had been met in that Russia had come up with the money to sponsor half of the match. The match was held in Kazan, Russia, and Shenyang, China, in August 1999, and Xie Jun won with a score of 8.5–6.5.

=== Further career ===

In March 2006, Galliamova again reached the finals of the FIDE Women&#x27;s World Championship, competing against Xu Yuhua.

In 2017, she was third in the European Women&#x27;s Championship in Riga.

==Personal life==
She was born to Russian father and Tatar mother (Galliamova is the last name of her mother).

Galliamova was married to Ukrainian Grandmaster Vasyl Ivanchuk, one of the top rated players in the world. The couple had a son, Michael. The marriage ended in a divorce in 1996.

Since 2005, the Children&#x27;s Chess Tournament - Alisa Galliamova Cup - has been held in Tatarstan. Galliamova founded the Children&#x27;s Chess School, which holds annual sports camps for the republic&#x27;s most talented children.

<doc id="966822" wikidata="Q846419" url="?curid=966822" title="Kenai River">
<text>The Kenai River called &quot;Kahtnu&quot; in the Dena&#x27;ina language, is the longest river in the Kenai Peninsula of southcentral Alaska. It runs westward from Kenai Lake in the Kenai Mountains, through the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and Skilak Lake to its outlet into the Cook Inlet of the Pacific Ocean near Kenai and Soldotna.

==Geography==

The Kenai River [Kee-nye] is a meltwater river that drains the central Kenai Peninsula region. Its source is the Kenai Lake. Near Cooper Landing, the lake narrows to form the river. About from the lake, the river passes through Kenai Canyon for about of fast-flowing whitewater rapids. The Russian River empties into the Kenai several miles west of Cooper Landing. from Kenai Lake, the river enters Skilak Lake. The Kenai Lake to Skilak section is commonly referred to as the &quot;Upper River&quot;. The portion from Skilak Lake downstream to the Sterling Highway bridge near Soldotna is known as &quot;Middle River&quot;. The final from the bridge to the mouth at Cook Inlet is known as the &quot;Lower River&quot;, where the flow is much gentler. The final are greatly influenced by changing tides.

==Fish==

The Kenai River is the most popular sport fishing destination in Alaska, particularly for king salmon (Chinook salmon). Each year there are two runs each of king salmon, coho salmon, sockeye salmon, plus a run of pink salmon every other year. The world record king salmon, which weighed about 44 kg (97 lb), was caught in the Kenai River in 1985. The Kenai is also the home of trophy size rainbow trout and Dolly Varden. Stretching to sizes over 76.2 cm (30 inches). Occasionally there will be reports of catching of &quot;Steelhead&quot;(Sea-run Trout).

The king salmon fishery is not as prolific as in other Alaskan rivers, but the Kenai is known for its large fish. A typical king in the second run, beginning in mid-July, weighs 40–85 pounds (18–23 kg), with considerably larger specimens not uncommon. The &quot;Lower Kenai&quot; is well known for its run and sizes of its king salmon. In recent years, the king salmon fishery has been closed or heavily restricted due to low returns of fish.

The coho salmon runs occur in early August and early October. The September run is favored by local anglers due to the larger size of the silver salmon.

The sockeye salmon runs are in late-June (bluebacks) and early-August. Sockeyes are considered the premier salmon for eating, canning, and smoking.

The pink salmon run occurs in even numbered years only. These fish are considered pests by many anglers because they interfere with catching other species and because, by the time they reach inland freshwater, their meat may be soft and oily compared to other species. On a heavy day, even a casual fisher might catch several dozen of the species.

==Other wildlife==

Along with Kenai&#x27;s fish, the Kenai River area is home to other wildlife, including moose, bears, and multiple species of birds.

==Management==
Over of the river and lakes are managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources as the Kenai River Special Management Area, from inland of the river mouth at Cook Inlet, to upstream. Adjacent to the management district are fifteen different parks.

<text>The Transportation 9-11 Medal is a special decoration of the U.S. Department of Transportation which was first created in 2002. The decoration recognizes those civilians and members of the military who performed heroic deeds and valorous accomplishments in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States of America. 

The Transportation 9-11 Medal is not a simple service decoration, but rather recognizes individual acts of bravery that resulted in the saving of life or great assistance to the rescue efforts from the September 11th attacks. A separate military decoration, the Transportation 9-11 Ribbon, is presented to members of the U.S. military for general aid and assistance to the victims of the September 11th attacks.

The 9-11 Medal is a one-time decoration and is authorized for wear by both civilians and members of the U.S military.

Author and anthropologist Pascal Hofmeier notes that in choosing to rap in Romansh, a language spoken by only a few thousand people, yet instantly identifiable as Swiss, Liricas Analas takes the concept of &quot;Lokalpatriotismus&quot; (local pride), which is so prevalent in the Swiss hip-hop scene, to an extreme level. Their 2006 CD, &quot;AnalFaBad&quot;, contained the chart-topping song &quot;Siemis&quot;.

<text>The California State Mining and Mineral Museum exhibits and interprets the state&#x27;s mineral resources and mining heritage. It is part of the California state park system, and is located near Mariposa, a town in central California, on the premises of the Mariposa County fairgrounds.

The museum houses a collection that was created in 1880, with the establishment of the California State Mining Bureau. Henry G. Hanks was the first California State Mineralogist and was tasked with managing the collection. The collection was housed in the &quot;Ferry Building&quot; in San Francisco until 1983. The collection was moved at the Mariposa County Fairgrounds in 1986. Responsibility for it was transferred from the California Department of Conservation to the California Department of Parks &amp; Recreation in 1999. It is the only California State Park without associated land. The international collection holds over 13,000 minerals, rocks, gems, fossils, and historic artifacts.

==Popular exhibits==

Exhibits include the crystalline gold Fricot Nugget, weighing 201 troy ounces (6.25 kg), the largest found during the California Gold Rush; a working scale model of a stamp mill over 100 years old, demonstrating the process of extracting gold from quartz rock; and a replica hard rock mine tunnel that allows visitors to better understand California&#x27;s hard rock mines.

The California State Mining and Mineral Museum has artifacts from the Mother Lode, along with international gems, stones, and other artifacts.

==Closure proposal==
The California Mining and Mineral Museum was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 during the Arnold Schwarzenegger Administration as part of a deficit reduction program.

<text>Pia Ann Rosa-Della Cramling (born 23 April 1963) is a Swedish chess grandmaster. 
Since the early 1980s, she has been one of the strongest female players in the world as well as having been the highest-rated woman in the FIDE World Rankings on three occasions. She was the clear number-one-rated woman in the January 1984 rating list, and joint number-one-rated woman in the January 1983 and July 1984 lists.
In 1992, she became the fifth woman to earn the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM).

==Career==
Cramling is, aside from Judit Polgar (who chose not to play in women&#x27;s events), the only woman to have earned the grandmaster title before 2000 who has never won the Women&#x27;s World Champion crown. According to Cramling, one explanation for this is that the World Championship is a team effort and more prominent chess nations are able to give their players better support in important events. Nevertheless, Cramling has been in reasonably close contention for the crown on four occasions (all in different decades). In the 1986 and 1996 Candidates cycle she came in fourth and third, respectively. Since the Women&#x27;s World Championship has been held with the knockout format, she reached the semifinals in 2008 and 2015. These latter results qualified her to play in the FIDE Women&#x27;s Grand Prix series in 2009–11 and 2015–16, respectively. She has had greater success in Europe, where she won the Women&#x27;s European Individual Chess Championship in 2003 and 2010. In 2006, she won the Accentus Ladies Tournament in Biel.

In team competitions, Cramling represented Sweden in the Chess Olympiad in both the open and women&#x27;s events, European Team Chess Championship in both open and women&#x27;s sections, Telechess Olympiad and Nordic Cup. In the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad, she has won the individual gold medal as the best player on board 1 (according to the rating performance) in 1984, 1988 and 2022. In the European Club Cup for Women, Cramling has won the team gold medal in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2016 playing for team Cercle d&#x27;Echecs Monte Carlo.

Cramling earned the International Master (IM) title in 1983 and the Grandmaster (GM) title in 1992. She defeated Raymond Keene in the tournament where she earned her first IM norm. She earned her three GM norms in Italy in 1989, in Las Palmas in 1990, and Bern in 1992.

==Personal life==
Cramling is married to the Spanish grandmaster Juan Manuel Bellón López. The two met in Zürich, in 1984, and married four years later; since Cramling&#x27;s promotion to grandmaster in 1992, they became the first chess couple who both hold the highest title in chess. Bellón and Cramling lived in Spain for a number of years, but later moved back to Sweden.

Their daughter, Anna Cramling Bellón, is a Woman FIDE Master and a chess YouTuber and Twitch streamer. At the 42nd and 44th Chess Olympiad, mother and daughter both played for Sweden, Pia being team captain on board 1 and Anna playing on board 5 and 3, respectively.

<text>This is a list of the 50 states, the 5 territories, and the District of Columbia of the United States of America by population density, population size, and land area. It also includes a sortable table of density by states, territories, divisions, and regions by population rank and land area, and a sortable table for density by states, divisions, regions, and territories in square miles and square kilometers.

The population density of the United States is lower than that of many other countries because of the United States&#x27; large land area. There are large, sparsely populated areas in parts of the US, like the east-to-west stretch extending from the outskirts of Seattle all the way to Minneapolis, or the north-to-south portion from northern Montana to southern New Mexico, excluding Denver and Albuquerque. For comparison, the population density of the U.S. is 1/15 that of South Korea and 1/12 that of India and the Netherlands. On the other hand, it is over 8 times higher than that of Canada and over 9 times higher than that of Australia.

== States and territories by population density ==
Population density is defined as the population divided by land area. Data are from the US Census unless otherwise specified. Population data are for the year 2023 and area data are for the year 2010. Some population estimates for territories are from the United Nations Commission on Population and Development.

<text>The Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots, also known as The 99s, is an international organization that provides networking, mentoring, and flight scholarship opportunities to recreational and professional female pilots. Founded in 1929, the
Ninety-Nines has 153 chapters and 27 regional &#x27;sections&#x27; across the globe as of 2022, including a &#x27;virtual&#x27; chapter, Ambassador 99s, which meets online for those who are too busy or mobile to be in one region for long.

Amelia Earhart was elected as their first president in 1931, and the organization has continued to make a significant impact supporting the advancement of women in aviation since its inception. In 1982, the Ninety-Nines received the National Aviation Hall of Fame Spirit of Flight Award, and were inducted into the Oklahoma Air Space Museum Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2002, the organization was selected as the recipient of the Frank G. Brewer Trophy by the National Aeronautic Association, and in 2014 became inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

==History==
In August 1929, a small group of female pilots met informally in Cleveland, Ohio following the United States Women&#x27;s Air Derby, and that group agreed that there was a need to form an organization to support women in the burgeoning field of aviation. Invitations to an initial meeting at a later date were sent out to all 117 female pilots licensed at the time. On November 2, 1929, the organization was founded at Curtiss Field near Valley Stream, New York by 26 licensed female pilots for the mutual support and advancement of &quot;Women Pilots.&quot; At the suggestion of Amelia Earhart, the organization&#x27;s name was taken from the number of charter members, settling on &quot;Ninety-Nines&quot; based on responses received by Christmas.

Charter member Margaret Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Warren believes she might have been the youngest charter member of the 99&#x27;s – being only 17 when she joined. She was not present at the first gathering of women aviators on Long Island in October 1929, but did go to New York with Frances Harrell for the second meeting on December 14 at the home of Opal Kunz, and was appointed to represent Texas.

The Ninety-Nines, Inc. is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization, and as of 2017 has 5,159 members in 30 countries. The mission of the Ninety-Nines is to promote world fellowship through flight, provide networking and scholarship opportunities for women in aviation, foster aviation education opportunities in the community, and preserve the unique history of women in aviation. The organization is divided into &quot;sections&quot; that are part of geographical areas covering multiple states in the continental U.S. and outlying territories, provinces in Canada, and regions of countries in continents across the globe. Chapters are the smallest grouping, often representing large cities or metropolitan areas under their geographical &quot;sections&quot;.

== Historical initiatives ==
Efforts of members which significantly contributed to the documentation, preservation and publication of The Ninety-Nines historical records and museum contributions include those of Virginia Thompson, who joined the organization in 1954. Thompson became the first Historian of the Mid-Atlantic Section (formerly the Middle-East Section), a founding member and Chairman of the Washington D.C. Chapter, and eventually the Mid-Atlantic Section Governor during a pivotal time in U.S. History leading up to the Kennedy Administration and boom of the United States Aerospace Industry.

On July 26, 1963, Thompson, along with five other female aviators (including charter member and former Ninety-Nines International President, Blanche Noyes ) accompanied President John F. Kennedy as he personally honored aviatrixes during the Amelia Earhart First Day Cover presentation at the White House. In addition to founding the Shenandoah Valley Chapter, Thompson served as International Historian of the Ninety-Nines for many years, and was Secretary of the International Women&#x27;s Air and Space Museum, and a Smithsonian archivist. For nearly 65 years, Virginia Thompson was an active member of The Ninety-Nines until her passing in 2019.

==Scholarship fund==
The Ninety-Nines &quot;Amelia Earhart Memorial Scholarship Fund&quot; (AEMSF) program assists in funding flight training, technical training or academics for both recreational and career track women pilots by awarding scholarships to qualified members. The AEMSF &quot;First Wings&quot; award is a progressive milestone scholarship of up to $6,000 to assist a student pilot Ninety-Nine in completing her Private Pilot training. In addition to the AEMSF program, many individual chapters of the Ninety-Nines give their own flight scholarships to benefit local woman aviators.

== For aspiring professional pilots ==
Aspiring professional or new commercial pilots can find career guidance and mentorship in the Ninety-Nines &quot;Professional Pilot Leadership Initiative&quot; program.

==Museums and activities==
===Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum===
The Ninety-Nines are owner-custodians of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison, Kansas. The birthplace and early childhood home of early aviator Amelia Earhart has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been returned to its turn-of-the-century condition by the &quot;99s&quot;; it features an abundance of personal and family memorabilia.

===99s Museum of Women Pilots===
Their international headquarters building on Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is home to the 99s Museum of Women Pilots. Museum artifacts include historical papers, personal items, video and oral histories, photos, memorabilia and other notable artifacts from famed woman aviators from around the globe. The museum collection and exhibits provide insight into the role women pilots played in the development of aviation and their historical footprint.

===Activities===
Ninety-Nines members support the goals of the organization by being active in numerous aviation activities, including: aviation education seminars in the community, air racing, from the Powder Puff Derby to the &quot;Palms to Pines&quot; and the Air Race Classic; and airmarking by volunteering their time to paint airport names, compass rose symbols and other identifications on airports and the National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA). Most regional and national NIFA competitions have &quot;99s&quot; on their panels of judges.

<text>Harry Schellenberg (May 25, 1939 – November 20, 2024) was a Canadian politician in the province of Manitoba. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1993 to 1995 and again from 1999 to 2007, representing the north-end Winnipeg riding of Rossmere for the New Democratic Party.

Born on a farm near Boissevain, Manitoba, Schellenberg attended the Mennonite Collegiate Institute and Manitoba Teachers&#x27; College. He worked as a teacher for more than thirty years before entering political life, including over twenty spent at the River East Collegiate teaching Canadian history and world issues. He was a founding member of Manitoba Parents for German Education, and has participated in such community organizations as Open Circle, a visitation program for inmates at Stony Mountain Penitentiary. During his time as a teacher, he completed a Master of Education degree from the University of Manitoba.

A longtime supporter of the NDP, Schellenberg was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a 1993 by-election, defeating Progressive Conservative Ed Martens in the north Winnipeg riding of Rossmere. Two years later, he was defeated by Progressive Conservative Vic Toews (later a federal MP in the Canadian Alliance and Conservative parties) by 117 votes.

Schellenberg was elected President of the Manitoba NDP in 1996, and officially served in the position from 1997 to 1999. He returned to the legislature following the 1999 general election, in which he defeated Toews by 5097 votes to 4803. In 2003, he was re-elected by a more comfortable margin. He served as Deputy Chairperson of the Committees of the Whole House between 1999 and 2007.

Schellenberg supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 2003.
Schellenberg did not seek re-election in 2007. He died on November 20, 2024 in Winnipeg, at the age of 85.

<text>Mayall II, also known as NGC-224-G1, SKHB 1, GSC 2788:2139, HBK 0-1, M31GC J003247+393440 or Andromeda&#x27;s Cluster, is a globular cluster orbiting M31, the Andromeda Galaxy.

It is located from the Andromeda Galaxy&#x27;s galactic core, and is the brightest (by absolute magnitude) globular cluster in the Local Group, with an absolute visual magnitude of −10.94 and the luminosity of 2 million Suns. It has an apparent magnitude of 13.81 in V band. Mayall II is considered to have twice the mass of Omega Centauri, and may contain a central, intermediate-mass (~ 2 M⊙) black hole.

It was first identified as a possible globular cluster by American astronomers Nicholas Mayall and Olin J. Eggen in 1953 using a Palomar Schmidt plate exposed in 1948.

Because of the widespread distribution of metallicity, indicating multiple star generations and a large stellar creation period, many contend that it is not a true globular cluster, but is actually the galactic core that remains of a dwarf galaxy consumed by Andromeda.

==Origin of names==
* Mayall II is named after Nicholas U. Mayall, who, with Olin J. Eggen, discovered it in 1953.
* SKHB 1 is named for Wallace L. W. Sargent, Charles T. Kowal, F. D. A. Hartwick and Sidney van den Bergh. They also named it G1 in 1977.
* HBK 0-1 is named for John Huchra, J. P. Brodie and S. M. Kent in 1991.

<doc id="966848" wikidata="Q668182" url="?curid=966848" title="House of Grimaldi">
<text>The House of Grimaldi is the reigning house of the Principality of Monaco. The house was founded in 1160 by Grimaldo Canella in Genoa and became the ruling house of Monaco when Francesco Grimaldi captured Monaco in 1297. 

Every Prince of Monaco has been a member of the House of Grimaldi. Since the 18th century, the princes have been agnatic descendants of other families that have inherited through the female line and adopted the Grimaldi name. In 1715, Jacques Goyon de Matignon married Louise Hippolyte, Princess of Monaco, the last Grimaldi agnatic heir. He and his male line descendants, adopting the Grimaldi name, ruled as princes of Monaco from 1731 to 1949. Since then, the princes have been male line descendants of the Polignac family. Rainier III, son of Pierre de Polignac, inherited the title through Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois in 1949 and adopted the Grimaldi name. During much of the Ancien Régime, the family resided in the French court, where from 1642 to 1715, they used the title of Duke of Valentinois.

The current head of the house is Albert II of Monaco, Sovereign Prince of Monaco, who is the son and successor of Prince Rainier III and the Princess consort Grace of Monaco, formerly known as Grace Kelly.

==Beginnings in Genoa==
The Grimaldis descend from Grimaldo, a Genoese consul who lived during the time of the early Crusades. He may have been a son of Otto Canella, an earlier consul of the Republic of Genoa. His numerous descendants led maritime expeditions throughout the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the North Sea. They quickly became one of the most powerful families of Genoa.

The Grimaldis feared that the head of a rival Genoese family could break the fragile balance of power in a &quot;coup&quot; and become lord of Genoa, as had happened in other Italian cities. They entered into a Guelphic alliance with the Fieschi family. In 1271, the Guelphs were banned from Genoa, and the Grimaldi took refuge in their castles in Liguria and Provence. They signed a treaty with Charles of Anjou, King of Sicily and Count of Provence to retake control of Genoa. In 1276, they accepted a peace under the auspices of the Pope, but the civil war continued. Not all the Grimaldis chose to return to Genoa and instead settled in their fiefdoms, where they could raise armies.

In 1299, the Grimaldis and their allies launched a few galleys to attack the port of Genoa before taking refuge on the Western Riviera. During the following years, the Grimaldis entered into different alliances that would allow them to return to power in Genoa. This time, it was the turn of their rivals, the Spinola family, to be exiled from the city. During this period, both the Guelphs and Ghibellines took and abandoned the castle of Monaco, which was ideally located to launch political and military operations against Genoa. Therefore, the tale of Francis Grimaldi and his faction – who took the castle of Monaco disguised as friars in 1297 – is largely anecdotal.

In the early 14th century, the Aragonese raided the shores of Provence and Liguria, challenging Genoa and King Robert of Provence. In 1353, the combined fleet of eighty Venetian and Aragonese galleys gathered in Sardinia to meet the fleet of sixty galleys under the command of Anthony Grimaldi. Only nineteen Genoese vessels survived the battle. Fearing an invasion, Genoa requested the protection of the Lord of Milan.

Several of the oldest feudal branches of the House of Grimaldi appeared during these conflicts, such as the branches of Antibes, Beuil, Nice, Puget, and Sicily. In 1395, the Grimaldis took advantage of the discords in Genoa to take possession of Monaco, which they then ruled as a condominium. This is the origin of today&#x27;s principality.

As was customary in Genoa, the Grimaldis organised their family ties within a corporation called . In the political reform of 1528, the Grimaldi became one of the 28 of the Republic of Genoa, which included the Doria and Pallavicini families, and to which other families were formally invited to join. The House of Grimaldi provided several doges, cardinals, cabinet ministers, and military officers of historical note.

==French influences==

Provence became a part of the Kingdom of France from 1486, and occasionally the Grimaldi relied upon French support to preserve their independence from the Republic of Genoa and the Duchy of Savoy. In the process they married into the French nobility in the 1600s, inherited French estates, and often lived in Paris, latterly at the Hôtel Matignon, until the French Revolution of 1789. Monaco and the neighbouring County of Nice were taken by the revolutionary army in 1792, and were French-controlled until 1815. Nice passed back to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815; then it was ceded to France by the Treaty of Turin (1860). Monaco was re-established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, with a brief Italian occupation in 1940–43.

==Modern succession==
By convention, membership of sovereign European houses is through the male line. By that definition, from 1731, the French noble House of Goyon-Matignon ruled as Princes of Monaco until 1949. However, one of the terms of James de Goyon de Matignon becoming Prince of Monaco &quot;jure uxoris&quot; was that he adopt the name and arms of Grimaldi so that the house would be preserved on the throne, and the right of succession was through his wife Louise-Hippolyte Grimaldi, who abdicated in her husband&#x27;s favor. Similarly, when Charlotte Louvet was legitimised in 1911 and made successor to Monaco, her husband, Count Pierre de Polignac, adopted, as a condition of the marriage, the name and arms of Grimaldi, but from this moment all his direct descendants Grimaldi would also have the title of Counts of Polignac. In this way the &quot;Grimaldi&quot; name and arms were continued.

Under the succession rules prior to 1911, Monaco&#x27;s throne would have passed to Prince Wilhelm of Urach. However, French president at the time Raymond Poincaré had threatened that if the throne was inherited by a German, France would annex the principality.

In 2018 a Grimaldi cousin, Count Louis de Causans, who hailed from a cadet branch of the family, sued France for €351m compensation, claiming that it had deceived his family during the succession crisis of 1911, and that his great-grandfather, Count Aynard de Chabrillan, should have inherited Monaco&#x27;s throne.

Until 2002, a treaty between Monaco and France stated that if the reigning Prince ever failed to leave dynastic offspring, then sovereignty over the Grimaldi realm would revert to France. The 2002 agreement modified this to expand the pool of potential heirs to dynastic collaterals of the reigning Prince (excluding adoptive heirs, hitherto allowed, e.g. Princess Charlotte and her descendants), guaranteeing Monegasque independence. Article I of Monaco&#x27;s house law requires that the reigning Prince or Princess bear the surname of Grimaldi.

The coat of arms of the House of Grimaldi is simply described as &quot;fusily argent and gules&quot;, i.e., a red and white diamond pattern, with no further modifiers.
