<text>HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; was one of three s built for the defence of the British Empire. Ordered by the Australian government in 1909, she was launched in 1911, and commissioned as flagship of the fledgling Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in 1913. &quot;Australia&quot; was the only capital ship to serve in the RAN.

At the start of World War I, &quot;Australia&quot; was tasked with finding and destroying the German East Asia Squadron, which was prompted to withdraw from the Pacific by the battlecruiser&#x27;s presence. Repeated diversions to support the capture of German colonies in New Guinea and Samoa, as well as an overcautious Admiralty, prevented the battlecruiser from engaging the German squadron before the latter&#x27;s destruction. &quot;Australia&quot; was then assigned to North Sea operations, which consisted primarily of patrols and exercises, until the end of the war. During this time, &quot;Australia&quot; was involved in early attempts at naval aviation, and 11 of her personnel participated in the Zeebrugge Raid. The battlecruiser was not at the Battle of Jutland, as she was undergoing repairs following a collision with sister ship . &quot;Australia&quot; only ever fired in anger twice: at a German merchant vessel in January 1915, and at a suspected submarine contact in December 1917.

On her return to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship mutinied after a request for an extra day&#x27;s leave in Fremantle was denied, although other issues played a part in the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, and the perception that Royal Navy personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw &quot;Australia&quot;″s role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of &quot;Australia&quot; as part of the British Empire&#x27;s commitment, and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924.

==Design==
The &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class of battlecruisers were based heavily on the preceding . The main difference was that the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s design was enlarged to give the ships&#x27; two-wing turrets a wider arc of fire. As a result, the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class was not a significant improvement on the &quot;Invincible&quot; design; the ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While &quot;Von der Tann&quot;″s characteristics were not known when the lead ship of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on &quot;Australia&quot; and her sister ship .
&quot;Australia&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draught of . The ship displaced at load and at deep load. She had a crew of 818 officers and ratings in 1913.

The ship was powered by two Parsons&#x27; sets of direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during trials in 1913, &quot;Australia&quot; turbines provided , allowing her to reach . &quot;Australia&quot; carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

&quot;Australia&quot; carried eight BL Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; the largest guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: &#x27;P&#x27; was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while &#x27;Q&#x27; was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, one on each side aft of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.

The &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered the end barbettes. Their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

&quot;Australia&quot;″s &#x27;A&#x27; turret was fitted with a rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament, in case normal fire control positions were knocked out or rendered inoperable.

===Modifications===
&quot;Australia&quot; received a single QF 20 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added in March 1915. This had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12–14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of . It was provided with 500 rounds. The 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, and two aft guns were removed at the same time. An additional 4-inch gun was fitted during 1917 as an AA gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60°. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only ; 100 rounds were carried for it.
&quot;Australia&quot; received a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship&#x27;s roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. &quot;Australia&quot; was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.

By 1918, &quot;Australia&quot; carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on platforms fitted to the top of &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets. The first flying off by a 1½ Strutter was from &quot;Australia&quot;″s &#x27;Q&#x27; turret on 4 April 1918. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather. At the end of World War I, &quot;Australia&quot; was described as &quot;the least obsolescent of her class&quot;.

After the war, both anti-aircraft guns were replaced by a pair of QF 4-inch Mark V guns on manually operated high-angle mounts in January 1920. Their elevation limits were −5° to 80°. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 10–15 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of .

==Acquisition and construction==

At the start of the 20th century, the British Admiralty maintained that naval defence of the British Empire, including the Dominions, should be unified under the Royal Navy. Attitudes on this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of &#x27;Fleet Units&#x27;: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. Although some were to be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East, the Dominions were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies: Australia and Canada were both encouraged to do so at earliest opportunity, New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station, and there were plans for South Africa to fund one at a future point. Each fleet unit was designed as a &quot;navy in miniature&quot;, and would operate under the control of the purchasing Dominion during peacetime. In the event of widespread conflict, the fleet units would come under Admiralty control, and would be merged to form larger fleets for regional defence. Australia was the only Dominion to purchase a full fleet unit, and while the New Zealand-funded battlecruiser was donated to the Royal Navy outright, no other nation purchased ships under the fleet unit plan.

On 9 December 1909, a cable was sent by Governor-General Lord Dudley to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl of Crewe, requesting that construction of three cruisers and an &quot;Indefatigable&quot;-class battlecruiser start at earliest opportunity. It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the German Imperial Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy&#x27;s practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain, or it might have reflected the preferences of the First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, preferences not widely shared.

The Australian Government decided on the name &quot;Australia&quot;, as this would avoid claims of favouritism or association with a particular state. The ship&#x27;s badge depicted the Federation Star overlaid by a naval crown, and her motto was &quot;Endeavour&quot;, reflecting both an idealisation of Australians&#x27; national spirit and attitude, and a connection to James Cook and HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot;. On 6 May 1910, George Reid, Australia&#x27;s high commissioner to the United Kingdom, sent a telegram cable to the Australian Government suggesting that the ship be named after the newly crowned King George V, but this was rebuffed.

Bids for construction were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown &amp; Company to construct the hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser&#x27;s armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2 million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.

&quot;Australia&quot;″s keel was laid at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was assigned the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, in a ceremony which received extensive media coverage. &quot;Australia&quot;″s design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had to be used in some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown &amp; Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.

During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill attempted to arrange for &quot;Australia&quot; to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australia Squadron.

&quot;Australia&quot; sailed for Devonport, Devon in mid-February 1913 to begin her acceptance trials. Testing of the guns, torpedoes, and machinery was successful, but it was discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser to dock for repairs. &quot;Australia&quot; was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth on 21 June 1913. Two days later, Rear Admiral George Patey, the first Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Fleet, raised his flag aboard &quot;Australia&quot;.

At launch, the standard ship&#x27;s company was 820, over half of which were Royal Navy personnel; the other half was made up of Australian-born RAN personnel, or Britons transferring from the Royal Navy to the RAN. Accommodation areas were crowded, with each man having only of space to sling his hammock when &quot;Australia&quot; was fully manned. Moreover, the ventilation system was designed for conditions in Europe, and was inadequate for the climate in and around Australia. On delivery, &quot;Australia&quot; was the largest warship in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Operational history==

===Voyage to Australia===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Australia&quot; hosted several official events. On 30 June, King George V and Edward, Prince of Wales, visited &quot;Australia&quot; to farewell the ship. During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship&#x27;s quarterdeck—the first time a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since Francis Drake. On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on &quot;Australia&quot; prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his role was to promote the ship as a symbol of the bond between Australia and the United Kingdom.
&quot;Australia&quot; was escorted by the light cruiser during the voyage to Australia. On 25 July, the two ships left England for South Africa: the visit was part of an agreement between the Prime Ministers of Australia and South Africa to promote the link between the two nations, along with the nations&#x27; links to the rest of the British Empire. The two ships were anchored in Table Bay from 18 to 26 August, during which the ships&#x27; companies participated in parades and receptions, while tens of thousands of people came to observe the ships. The two ships also visited Simon&#x27;s Town, while &quot;Australia&quot; additionally called into Durban. No other major ports were visited on the voyage, and the warships were instructed to avoid all major Australian ports.

&quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; reached Jervis Bay on 2 October, where they rendezvoused with the rest of the RAN fleet (the cruisers and , and the destroyers , , and ). The seven warships prepared for a formal fleet entry into Sydney Harbour. On 4 October, &quot;Australia&quot; led the fleet into Sydney Harbour, where responsibility for Australian naval defence was passed from the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australia Squadron, commanded by King-Hall aboard HMS &quot;Cambrian&quot;, to the RAN, commanded by Patey aboard &quot;Australia&quot;.

===Early service===
In her first year of service, &quot;Australia&quot; visited as many major Australian ports as possible, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film &quot;Sea Dogs of Australia&quot; was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.
During July 1914, &quot;Australia&quot; and other units of the RAN fleet were on a training cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learnt through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought that there would be imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution. Three days later, the Board learnt that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, &quot;Australia&quot; was recalled to Sydney to take on coal and stores.

On 3 August, the RAN was placed under Admiralty control. Orders for RAN warships were prepared over the next few days: &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the China Station, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (particularly those of the German East Asia Squadron) in the Australian Station before doing so. Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, was aware of &quot;Australia&quot;″s presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral&#x27;s plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of &quot;Australia&quot; and the China Squadron forced his fleet to relocate to other seas.

===World War I===

====Securing local waters====
The British Empire declared war on Germany on 5 August, and the RAN swung into action. &quot;Australia&quot; had departed Sydney the night before, and was heading north to rendezvous with other RAN vessels south of German New Guinea. The German colonial capital of Rabaul was considered a likely base of operations for von Spee, and Patey put together a plan to clear the harbour. &quot;Australia&quot;″s role was to hang back: if the armoured cruisers and were present, the other RAN vessels would lure them into range of the battlecruiser. The night-time operation was executed on 11 August, and no German ships were found in the harbour. Over the next two days, &quot;Australia&quot; and the other ships unsuccessfully searched the nearby bays and coastline for the German ships and any wireless stations, before returning to Port Moresby to refuel.

In late August, &quot;Australia&quot; and escorted a New Zealand occupation force to German Samoa. Patey believed that the German fleet was likely to be in the eastern Pacific, and Samoa would be a logical move. Providing protection for the New Zealand troopships was a beneficial coincidence, although the timing could have been better, as an Australian expedition to occupy German New Guinea departed from Sydney a few days after the New Zealand force left home waters—&quot;Australia&quot; was expected to support both, but Patey only learned of the expeditions after they had commenced their journeys. The battlecruiser left Port Moresby on 17 August and was met by &quot;Melbourne&quot; en route on 20 August. The next day, they reached Nouméa and the New Zealand occupation force, consisting of the troopships &quot;Moeraki&quot; and &quot;Monowai&quot;, the French cruiser , and three s. The grounding of &quot;Monowai&quot; delayed the expedition&#x27;s departure until 23 August; the ships reached Suva, Fiji on 26 August, and arrived off Apia early in the morning of 30 August. The city surrendered without a fight, freeing &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Melbourne&quot; to depart at noon on 31 August to meet the Australian force bound for Rabaul.
The Australian invasion force had mustered off the Louisiade Archipelago by 9 September; the assembled ships included &quot;Australia&quot;, the cruisers , and , the destroyers , , and , the submarines and , the auxiliary cruiser , the storeship , three colliers and an oiler. The force sailed north, and at 06:00 on 11 September, &quot;Australia&quot; deployed two picket boats to secure Karavia Bay for the expeditionary force&#x27;s transports and supply ships. Later that day, &quot;Australia&quot; captured the German steamer &quot;Sumatra&quot; off Cape Tawui. After this, the battlecruiser stood off, in case she was required to shell one of the two wireless stations the occupation force was attempting to capture. The German colony was captured, and on 15 September, &quot;Australia&quot; departed for Sydney.

====Pursuit of von Spee====
The presence of &quot;Australia&quot; around the former German colonies, combined with the likelihood of Japan declaring war on Germany, prompted von Spee to withdraw his ships from the region. On 13 August, the East Asia Squadron—except for , which was sent to prey on British shipping in the Indian Ocean—had begun to move eastwards. After appearing off Samoa on 14 September, then attacking Tahiti eight days later, von Spee led his force to South America, and from there planned to sail for the Atlantic. Patey was ordered on 17 September to head back north with &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; to protect the Australian expeditionary force. On 1 October, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Montcalm&quot;, and &quot;Encounter&quot; headed north from Rabaul to find the German ships, but turned around to return at midnight, after receiving an Admiralty message about the Tahiti attack. Although Patey suspected that the Germans were heading for South America and wanted to follow with &quot;Australia&quot;, the Admiralty was unsure that the intelligence was accurate, and tasked the battlecruiser with patrolling around Fiji in case they returned. &quot;Australia&quot; reached Suva on 12 October, and spent the next four weeks patrolling the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: despite Patey&#x27;s desires to range out further, Admiralty orders kept him chained to Suva until early November.

As Patey predicted, von Spee had continued east, and it was not until his force inflicted the first defeat on the Royal Navy in 100 years at the Battle of Coronel that &quot;Australia&quot; was allowed to pursue. Departing on 8 November, the battlecruiser replenished coal from a pre-positioned collier on 14 November, and reached Chamela Bay (near Manzanillo, Mexico) 12 days later. Patey was made commander of a multinational squadron tasked with preventing the German squadron from sailing north to Canadian waters, or following them if they attempted to enter the Atlantic via the Panama Canal or around Cape Horn. Patey&#x27;s ships included &quot;Australia&quot;, the British light cruiser and the Japanese cruisers , , and the ex-Russian battleship &quot;Hizen&quot;. The ships made for the Galapagos Islands, which were searched from 4 to 6 December. After finding no trace of von Spee&#x27;s force, the Admiralty ordered Patey to investigate the South American coast from Perlas Island down to the Gulf of Guayaquil. The German squadron had sailed for the Atlantic via Cape Horn, and was defeated by a British fleet after attempting to raid the Falkland Islands on 8 December. Patey&#x27;s squadron learned of this 10 December, while off the Gulf of Panama; &quot;Australia&quot;″s personnel were disappointed that they did not have the chance to take on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Nevertheless, the battlecruiser&#x27;s presence in the Pacific during 1914 had provided an important counter to the German armoured cruisers, and enabled the RAN to participate in the Admiralty&#x27;s global strategy. Moreover, it is unlikely that the attack on Rabaul would have gone ahead had &quot;Australia&quot; not been available to protect the landing force.

====North Sea operations====
As the threat of a German naval attack had been removed by the destruction of the East Asia Squadron, &quot;Australia&quot; was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. &quot;Australia&quot; was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—&quot;Australia&quot; is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship&#x27;s propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and &quot;Australia&quot; departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from &#x27;A&#x27; turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary &quot;Eleonora Woermann&quot;—to stop and be captured. As &quot;Australia&quot; could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and &quot;Eleonora Woermann&quot; was too slow to keep pace with the battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.
Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw the need for dedicated battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked &quot;Australia&quot; to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, &quot;Australia&quot; was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and &quot;Australia&quot; reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey and the leader of the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard &quot;Australia&quot;. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, &quot;Australia&quot;″s operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North Sea area in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.

Soon after its arrival in the United Kingdom there were 259 cases of respiratory illness as the crew were not used to the colder weather. A subsequent measles epidemic in June 1915 forced the Admiralty to conclude that the ship&#x27;s doctors lacked expertise in ship hygiene, which forced them to appoint a senior fleet surgeon to assist in improving conditions on the ship.

&quot;Australia&quot; joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and &quot;Australia&quot; returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused &quot;Australia&quot; and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.

====Collison with HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot;====
On the morning of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS left Rosyth at 04:00 (accompanied by the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron and destroyers) again bound for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany.

The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilizing for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, with the 1st and 3rd Battlecruiser Squadrons while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties.

At 15:30 on the afternoon of 22 April, the three squadrons of battlecruisers were patrolling together to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down, while the ships were steaming abreast at 19.5 knots, with &quot;Australia&quot; on the port flank. Concerned about possible submarine attack Beatty issued instructions at 15:35 for the fleet to commence zigzagging. It took some time for the instruction to be relayed by signal flag down the line and so it wasn&#x27;t until 15:40 that &quot;Australia&quot; with a cruiser to her port side commenced her first zigzag and swung to starboard. The crew were aware that &quot;New Zealand&quot; was on that side about five cables (926 metres) away but the poor visibility meant that as they made their turn they didn&#x27;t see her until it was too late and they hit at 15:43, despite &quot;Australia&quot; attempting to turn away to port. &quot;Australia&quot;″s side was torn open from frames 59 to 78 by the armour plate on the hull below her sister ships P-turret, while as &quot;New Zealand&quot; turned away her outer port propeller damaged &quot;Australia&quot;″s hull below her Q-turret.

&quot;Australia&quot; slowed to half-speed as the mist hid her sister ship, but the damage to &quot;New Zealand&quot;″s propeller caused a temporary loss of control and she swung back in front of &quot;Australia&quot; which despite turning to port, had her stem crushed at 15:46 as she scraped the side of &quot;New Zealand&quot;, just behind her P-turret. Procedural errors were found to be the cause of the collisions. Both ships to come to a complete stop about apart while their respective officers assessed the damage. The damage control teams on the &quot;Australia&quot; were soon busy shoring up bulkheads and sealing off the damaged portions to prevent any more water entering the ship. Meanwhile off watch Australian sailors took advantage of a convenient potato locker to hurl both its contents and insults at the crew of their nearby sister ship. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was soon underway, returning to Rosyth with the rest of the squadron.

The same fog caused the battleship &quot;Neptune&quot; to collide with a merchant ship and the destroyers &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Garland&quot; to collide with one another.
Once it was safe to proceed &quot;Australia&quot; with her speed restricted to 12, and then later to 16 knots lagging behind the rest of the squadron, arrived back at Rosyth at 16:00 hours on the 23 April to find both drydocks occupied, one by &quot;New Zealand&quot; and the other by HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; so she departed at 21:00 hours on that same day for Newcastle-on-Tyne, where as she approached its floating dock on the River Tyne, on the 24 April the tugs were unable to keep her straight during strong winds and she hit the edge of the floating dock severely bending her port rudder and breaking both of her port propellers. As &quot;New Zealand&quot; had commandeered &quot;Australia&quot;″s spare propeller (which was in store at Rosyth) to replaced her own damaged propeller, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s spare port inner propeller was installed on &quot;Australia&quot;″s port outer shaft and &quot;Invincible&quot;″s port inner spare propeller was installed on the port inner shaft. As this facility couldn&#x27;t handle these additional repairs &quot;Australia&quot; was ordered following replacement of the propellers and temporary repairs to her hull to proceed to Devonport, Devon.

&quot;Australia&quot; was not able to depart Newcastle-on-Tyne until 13:30 on 1 May, and unknowingly streamed through a minefield to anchor in the Humber near the Nore Lightship. They departed on 3 May, and while anchoring overnight in Deal the crew witnessed an air raid on Deal Pier prior to the battlecruiser docking in Devonport at 13:00 on 6 May. While docked the ship was visited by Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes, accompanied by the Australian High Commissioner to Britain Andrew Fisher and Senator Allan McDougall. Following completion of repairs the battlecruiser departed Devonport at 11:00 on 31 May, sailing west about round Ireland to arrive at Scapa Flow at 06:30 on 3 June and returned to Rosyth on 9 June, thus missing the Battle of Jutland.

====Post-Jutland operations====
On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40, which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off. Both the British and German fleets returned home, with two British cruisers sunk by submarines and a German dreadnought battleship damaged by a torpedo.

The year 1917 saw a continuation of the battlecruiser&#x27;s routine of exercises and patrols into the North Sea, with few incidents. During this year &quot;Australia&quot;″s activities were limited to training voyages between Rosyth and Scapa Flow and occasional patrols to the north-east of Britain in search of German raiders. In May, while preparing the warship for action stations, a 12-inch shell became jammed in the shell hoist when its fuze became hooked onto a projection. After the magazines were evacuated, Lieutenant-Commander F. C. Darley climbed down the hoist and successfully removed the fuze. On 26 June, King George V visited the ship. On 12 December, &quot;Australia&quot; was involved in a second collision, this time with the battlecruiser . Following this accident, she underwent three weeks of repairs from December 1917 until January 1918. During the repair period, &quot;Australia&quot; became the first RAN ship to launch an aircraft, when a Sopwith Pup took off from her quarterdeck on 18 December. On 30 December, &quot;Australia&quot; shelled a suspected submarine contact, the only time during her deployment with the 2nd BCS that she fired on the enemy.
In February 1918, the call went out for volunteers to participate in a special mission to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships. Although many aboard &quot;Australia&quot; volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel—10 sailors and an artificer engineer were selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The artificer engineer was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry . The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole. All of the volunteers survived—&quot;Australia&quot; was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid with one awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), three the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM), while another three were mentioned in dispatches. The five sailors were listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but did not receive the award.

During 1918, &quot;Australia&quot; and the Grand Fleet&#x27;s other capital ships on occasion escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets. &quot;Australia&quot;, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1½ Strutter scout plane on 14 May, &quot;Australia&quot; started carrying two aircraft—a Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter—and operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25–26 June and 29–30 July. During September and October, &quot;Australia&quot; and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.

====War&#x27;s end====
When the armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November 1918 to end World War I, one of the conditions was that the German High Seas Fleet was to be interred at Scapa Flow. The German fleet crossed the North Sea, and on 21 November, the British Grand Fleet sailed out to meet it; &quot;Australia&quot; led the port division of the fleet. &quot;Australia&quot; then escorted the battlecruiser to Scapa Flow, and was assigned as the German vessel&#x27;s guardship. &quot;Australia&quot; subsequently formed part of the force which guarded the High Seas Fleet during late 1918 and early 1919, and spent much of her time either at anchor at Scapa Flow, or conducting patrols in the North Sea. This monotonous duty contributed to low morale among some sections of the ship&#x27;s crew.
After being formally farewelled by the Prince of Wales and First Sea Lord Rosslyn Wemyss on 22 April 1919, &quot;Australia&quot; departed from Portsmouth for home the next day. She sailed in company with for the first part of the voyage, but the light cruiser later had to detach to tow the submarine . &quot;Australia&quot; arrived in Fremantle on 28 May 1919, the first time the ship had seen home waters in four and a half years. Despite returning home, the battlecruiser remained under Admiralty control until 1 August 1919.

&quot;Australia&quot; was not awarded any official battle honours, although personnel aboard the battlecruiser and her successor claimed the operations in the Pacific, the North Sea patrol duties, and the battlecruiser&#x27;s presence at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet as unofficial honours. Following a reorganisation of RAN battle honours in 2010, the honours &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot; and &quot;North Sea 1915–18&quot; were retroactively awarded on 1 March 2010.

===Mutiny===
&quot;Australia&quot;″s ship&#x27;s company had consistently suffered from low morale since the battlecruiser entered service, and the proportion of &quot;Australia&quot;″s sailors who were placed on disciplinary charges during World War I was among the highest in the RAN. Many of the Australian sailors were chafing under the severity of naval discipline and what they saw as excessive punishment for minor breaches; one example was of a sailor who was charged with desertion, imprisoned for three months, and lost all pay for staying out too late on Armistice Day. Factors which contributed to low morale and poor discipline included frustration at not participating in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of illness, limited opportunities for leave, delays or complete lack of deferred pay, and poor-quality food. The continuation of strict wartime routines and discipline after the armistice frustrated the ship&#x27;s crew. There was also the perception that &quot;Australia&quot;″s British personnel were being promoted faster than their Australian counterparts and were dominating leadership positions. The battlecruiser&#x27;s arrival in Fremantle on 28 May was met with extensive hospitality, which was reciprocated where possible by the sailors with invitations and tours of their vessel. There were opportunities for shore leave, but these were limited as &quot;Australia&quot; was only in port for three days, and had to sail early on 1 June for Melbourne.
Representatives of the ship&#x27;s company approached Captain Claude Cumberlege to ask for a one-day delay on departure; this would allow the sailors to have a full weekend of leave, give Perth-born personnel the chance to visit their families, and give personnel another chance to invite people aboard. Cumberlege replied that as &quot;Australia&quot; had a tight schedule of &quot;welcome home&quot; port visits, such delays could not even be considered. The next morning, at around 10:30, between 80 and 100 sailors gathered in front of &#x27;P&#x27; turret, some in working uniform, others who had just returned from shore leave still in libertyman rig. Cumberlege sent the executive officer to find out why the men had assembled, and on learning that they were repeating the previous day&#x27;s request for a delay in departure, went down to address them. In a strict, legalistic tone, he informed the sailors that delaying &quot;Australia&quot;″s departure was impossible, and ordered them to disperse. The group obeyed this order, although some were vocal in their displeasure. Shortly after, &quot;Australia&quot; was ready to depart, but when the order to release the mooring lines and get underway was given, Cumberlege was informed that the stokers had abandoned the boiler rooms. After the assembly on deck, some sailors had masked themselves with black handkerchiefs, and encouraged or intimidated the stokers on duty into leaving their posts, leaving the navy&#x27;s flagship stranded at the buoy, in full view of dignitaries and crowds lining the nearby wharf. The senior non-commissioned officers, along with sailors drafted from other departments, were sent to the boiler room to get &quot;Australia&quot; moving, and departure from Fremantle was only delayed by an hour.

Australian naval historians David Stevens and Tom Frame disagree on what happened next. Stevens states that Cumberledge assembled the ship&#x27;s company in the early afternoon, read the Articles of War, lectured them on the seriousness of refusing duty, then ordered the stokers to go to their stations, which they did meekly. Frame claims the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge cleared the lower deck and spoke to the sailors. After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship&#x27;s senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including one of the Victoria Cross nominees from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a mutiny and arrested pending a court-martial, which was held aboard on 20 June, after &quot;Australia&quot; arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had &quot;joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence&quot;, and they were sentenced to imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour. A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame disagree on details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty. Both authors agree that these men were tried by the captain while &quot;Australia&quot; was still at sea, and punished with 90 days each in cells.

Following the court-martial of the five ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within government over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured the government and the Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors&#x27; youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board&#x27;s authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.

===Post-war===
In May 1920, &quot;Australia&quot; participated in celebrations and naval activities associated with the visit of the Prince of Wales. From July to November 1920, an Avro 504 floatplane of the Australian Air Corps was embarked aboard &quot;Australia&quot; as part of a series of trials intended to cumulate in the creation of a naval aviation branch. The aircraft was stored on the quarterdeck next to &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, and was deployed and recovered by derrick. Inter-service rivalry and the ship&#x27;s reduction to non-seagoing status in September prevented further operations.

Following the demise of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and &quot;Australia&quot; did not have a clear role. As a result, post-war budget cuts prompted the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by &quot;Australia&quot; could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN&#x27;s 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship&#x27;s company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, &quot;Australia&quot; was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Australia&quot; returned to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, and there is no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace &quot;Australia&quot;″s main armament once the Navy&#x27;s stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN&#x27;s lack of interest in retaining the ship.

The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was a mutual naval arms limitation and disarmament treaty between the five major naval powers of the time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted as part of the Royal Navy for the purposes of the treaty, &quot;Australia&quot; was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty&#x27;s ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.
When &quot;Australia&quot; was decommissioned in 1921, some of her equipment was removed for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 Cabinet decision confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, £68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to tertiary education centres (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing &quot;Australia&quot;″s 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, and the cost of building suitable structures was excessive. It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels with the rest of the ship. There was also a proposal to remove &quot;Australia&quot;″s conning tower and install it on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of was erected as a monument at Bradleys Head. The ship&#x27;s outer port propeller is on display at the Australian War Memorial, while other artefacts are in the collections of the War Memorial, the Australian National Maritime Museum, and the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre.
The scuttling was originally scheduled for Anzac Day (25 April) 1924, but was brought forward to 12 April, so the visiting British Special Service Squadron could participate. On the day of the sinking, &quot;Australia&quot; was towed out to a point northeast of Sydney Heads. Under the terms of the Washington Treaty, the battlecruiser needed to be sunk in water that was deep enough to make it infeasible to refloat her at a future date. The former flagship was escorted by the Australian warships &quot;Melbourne&quot;, &quot;Brisbane&quot;, &quot;Adelaide&quot;, &quot;Anzac&quot;, and &quot;Stalwart&quot;, the ships of the Special Service Squadron, and several civilian ferries carrying passengers. Many personnel volunteered to be part of the scuttling party, but only those who had served aboard her were selected. At 14:30, the scuttling party set the charges, opened all seacocks, and cleared the ship. Explosive charges blew a hole in the hull a few minutes later, but it took 20 minutes for the intake of water to bring holes cut in the battlecruiser&#x27;s upper flanks to the waterline. The angle of list increased significantly, causing the three spare 12-inch barrels lashed to the deck to break free and roll overboard, before &quot;Australia&quot; inverted completely and began to sink stern-first. &quot;Australia&quot; submerged completely at 14:51; a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft dropped a wreath where the warship had sunk, while &quot;Brisbane&quot; fired a rolling 21-gun salute. The wreck was gazetted as being at , below. However, there were discrepancies with other sources, and the exact location of &quot;Australia&quot; was unknown.
There are two schools of thought surrounding the decision to scuttle the battlecruiser. The first is that sinking &quot;Australia&quot; was a major blow to the nation&#x27;s ability to defend herself. Following the battlecruiser&#x27;s scuttling, the most powerful warships in the RAN were four old light cruisers. The battlecruiser had served as a deterrent to German naval action against Australia during the war, and with growing tensions between Japan and the United States of America, that deterrence might have been required if the nations had become openly hostile towards each other or towards Australia. The opposing argument is that, while an emotive and symbolic loss, the ship was obsolete, and would have been a drain on resources. Operating and maintaining the warship was beyond the capabilities of the RAN&#x27;s post-war budgets, necessitating the ship&#x27;s reduction in status in 1920 and assignment to reserve in 1921. Ammunition and replacement barrels for the main guns were no longer manufactured. To remain effective, &quot;Australia&quot; required major modernisation (including new propulsion machinery, increased armour and armament, and new fire control systems) at a cost equivalent to a new .

In 1990, a large, unknown shipwreck was encountered by the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV &quot;Moana Wave 1&quot; while surveying the path of the PacRimWest communications cable. One of the survey ship&#x27;s crew theorised that the wreck, located at in of water, was &quot;Australia&quot;, but Fugro kept the information to themselves until 2002, when the company&#x27;s Australian branch mentioned the discovery during a conference. This piqued the interest of a member of the New South Wales Heritage Office, who requested copies of the company&#x27;s data. The size and location of the ship pointed towards it being &quot;Australia&quot;, but the depth meant verification through inspection could only be achieved with a remote operated vehicle (ROV). The RAN was approached in 2007 for assistance, but although they supported the project, the RAN did not have the equipment to assist. In March 2007, the United States Navy loaned the deep-sea ROV &quot;CURV-21&quot; to the Australian Government, to locate and recover a Black Hawk helicopter which crashed during the Australian response to the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état. While en route back to Australia, the ROV, carried aboard Defence Maritime Services vessel , was directed to Fugro&#x27;s coordinates at the request of the NSW Heritage Office to verify and inspect the wreck. Video footage captured by the ROV allowed the NSW Heritage Office to confirm that the wreck was &quot;Australia&quot; by matching features like the superstructure and masts to historical photographs. Although initially sinking stern-first, the battlecruiser levelled out as she sank, with the aft mast the first to strike the bottom. After hitting the seabed, &quot;Australia&quot; slid about to her final resting place. The wreck site is protected under the federal &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot;.

==Artifacts==
The outer port side propeller of &quot;Australia&quot; can be found on the grounds of the Australian War Memorial, between the main building and Anzac Hall. This is believed to be the spare from HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; that was fitted to &quot;Australia&quot; after her collision with HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot; in 1916.

Prior to her scuttling the ship&#x27;s bell was transferred to the Australian War Memorial. By 1927 the bell was being rung at the memorial mark the commencement and conclusion of the traditional two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day. It is still on display at the Australian War Memorial, but is no longer rung.

A 12 inch armour piercing shell from &quot;Australia&quot; is held by the Australian War Memorial.

However, Wielen&#x27;s sentence was later reduced to 15 years, and he was released 24 October 1952, after having served about 7.5 years in custody.

<text>HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; (I84/D84/C01) was a County-class heavy cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of two &quot;Kent&quot;-subclass ships ordered for the RAN in 1924, &quot;Australia&quot; was laid down in Scotland in 1925, and entered service in 1928. Apart from an exchange deployment to the Mediterranean from 1934 to 1936, during which she became involved in the planned British response to the Abyssinia Crisis, &quot;Australia&quot; operated in local and South-West Pacific waters until World War II began.

The cruiser remained near Australia until mid-1940, when she was deployed for duties in the eastern Atlantic, including hunts for German ships and participation in Operation Menace. During 1941, &quot;Australia&quot; operated in home and Indian Ocean waters, but was reassigned as flagship of the ANZAC Squadron in early 1942. As part of this force (which was later redesignated Task Force 44, then Task Force 74), &quot;Australia&quot; operated in support of United States naval and amphibious operations throughout South-East Asia until the start of 1945, including involvement in the battles at the Coral Sea and Savo Island, the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Leyte Gulf, and numerous actions during the New Guinea campaign. She was forced to withdraw following a series of kamikaze attacks during the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. The prioritisation of shipyard work in Australia for British Pacific Fleet vessels saw the Australian cruiser sail to England for repairs, where she was at the end of the war.

During the late 1940s, &quot;Australia&quot; served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, and participated in several port visits to other nations, before being retasked as a training ship in 1950. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1954, and sold for scrapping in 1955.

==Design==
&quot;Australia&quot; was one of seven warships built to the &quot;Kent&quot; design of County-class heavy cruiser, which were based on design work by Eustace Tennyson-D&#x27;Eyncourt. She was designed with a standard displacement of 10,000 tons, a length between perpendiculars of , a length overall of , a beam of , and a maximum draught of .

The propulsion machinery consisted of eight Yarrow superheated boilers feeding Curtis high-pressure and Parsons low-pressure geared turbines. This delivered up to 80,000 shaft horsepower to the cruiser&#x27;s four three-bladed propellers. The cruiser&#x27;s top speed was , with a range of , while her economical range and cruising speed was at .

The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 64 officers and 678 sailors in 1930; this dropped to 45 officers and 654 sailors from 1937 to 1941. While operating as flagship, &quot;Australia&quot;″s company was 710. During wartime, the ship&#x27;s company increased to 815.

===Armament and armour===
&quot;Australia&quot; was designed with eight guns in four twin turrets (&#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; forward, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; aft) as primary armament, with 150 shells per gun. Secondary armament consisted of four guns in four single mounts, with 200 shells per gun, and four 2-pounder pom-poms for anti-aircraft defence, with 1,000 rounds each. A mixture of .303-inch machine guns () were carried for close defence work: initially this consisted of four Vickers machine guns and twelve Lewis machine guns, although four Lewis guns were later removed. Two sets of quadruple torpedo tubes were fitted. Four 3-pounder quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. During her 1939 modernisation, the four single guns were replaced by four twin Mark XVI guns. The torpedo tubes were removed in 1942, and the &#x27;X&#x27; turret was taken off in 1945.

The close-range anti-aircraft armament of the ship fluctuated during her career. During the mid-1930s, two quadruple machine gun mounts were installed to supplement the weapons. These were replaced in late 1943 by seven single 20mm Oerlikons. By early 1944, all seven Oerlikons had been upgraded to double mountings. These were in turn replaced by eight single 40 mm Bofors guns in 1945.
&quot;Australia&quot; was designed to carry a single amphibious aircraft: a Supermarine Seagull III aircraft, which was replaced in 1936 by a Supermarine Walrus. Both aircraft were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s Fleet Co-operation Unit; initially by No. 101 Flight RAAF, which was expanded in 1936 to form No. 5 Squadron RAAF, then renumbered in 1939 to No. 9 Squadron RAAF. As the aircraft catapult was not installed until September 1935, the Seagull was initially lowered into the water by the ship&#x27;s recovery crane to launch under its own power. The catapult and Walrus were removed in October 1944.

Armour aboard &quot;Australia&quot; was initially limited to an armour deck over the machinery spaces and magazines, ranging from in thickness. Armour plate was also fitted to the turrets (up to thick) and the conning tower ( thick). Anti-torpedo bulges were also fitted. During 1938 and 1939, belt armour up to thick was fitted along the waterline to provide additional protection to the propulsion machinery.

==Acquisition and construction==
&quot;Australia&quot; was ordered in 1924 as part of a five-year plan to develop the RAN. She was laid down by John Brown and Company at their shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, on 26 August 1925. The cruiser was launched on 17 March 1927 by Dame Mary Cook, wife of Sir Joseph Cook, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and former Australian Prime Minister.

The cruiser was initially fitted with short exhaust funnels, but during sea trials of &quot;Australia&quot; and other &quot;Kent&quot;-class ships, it was found that smoke from the boilers was affecting the bridge and aft control position. The funnel design was subsequently lengthened by ; the taller funnels on the under-construction were later switched over to &quot;Australia&quot; as she neared completion.
When the ship&#x27;s badge came up for consideration on 26 December 1926, both Richard Lane-Poole, commander of the Australian Squadron, and William Napier, First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board disapproved of the design previously carried by the battlecruiser , and requested new designs. On 26 July 1927, it was decided to use the Coat of arms of Australia as the basis for the badge, with the shield bearing the symbols of the six states and the Federation Star crest depicted in the design. No motto was given to the ship, but when the badge design was updated prior to the planned 1983 acquisition of the British aircraft carrier (which was to be renamed HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;), the motto from the battlecruiser, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, was added.

The warship was commissioned into the RAN on 24 April 1928. Construction of &quot;Australia&quot; cost 1.9 million pounds, very close to the estimated cost. &quot;Australia&quot; and sister ship (also constructed by John Brown) were the only County-class vessels built in Scotland.

==Operational history==

===Early career===
&quot;Australia&quot; left Portsmouth for her namesake country on 3 August 1928 after completing sea trials. During the voyage, the cruiser visited Canada, the United States of America, several Pacific islands, and New Zealand before she reached Sydney on 23 October. Following the start of the Great Depression, the RAN fleet was downscaled in 1930 to three active ships (&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, and seaplane carrier ) while one of the S-class destroyers would remain active at a time, with a reduced ship&#x27;s company. In 1932, &quot;Australia&quot; cruised to the Pacific islands. In 1933, she visited New Zealand.

On 10 December 1934, &quot;Australia&quot; was sent to the United Kingdom on exchange duty, with the Duke of Gloucester, who had visited Victoria for the state&#x27;s centenary of foundation the month previous, aboard. The cruiser reached Portsmouth on 28 March 1935, and was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Australia&quot; returned to England from 21 June to 12 September to represent Australia at King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Naval Review at Spithead. Following the outbreak of the Abyssinian crisis, &quot;Australia&quot; began to train for a potential war. &quot;Australia&quot;″s initial role in any British assault on the Italian Navy was to cover the withdrawal of the aircraft carrier after an air attack on the base at Taranto. The crisis eased before the need for British involvement occurred. &quot;Australia&quot; remained in the Mediterranean until 14 July 1936, then visited Gallipoli in company with the new light cruiser , before the two ships sailed for Australia. They arrived in Sydney on 11 August. During the cruiser&#x27;s time on exchange, the British cruiser operated with the RAN.
After returning, &quot;Australia&quot; spent the remainder of 1936 in the vicinity of Sydney and Jervis Bay, excluding a visit to Melbourne in November. The warship sailed to New Zealand in April 1937, then in July departed on a three-month northern cruise, with visits to ports in Queensland, New Guinea, and New Britain. &quot;Australia&quot; repeated her November visit to Melbourne, and cruised to Hobart in February 1938, before being placed in reserve on 24 April 1938. She underwent a modernisation refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, during which her single 4-inch guns were replaced with twin mountings, belt armour measuring up to thick was fitted over the machinery spaces, and handling arrangements for the ship&#x27;s aircraft and boats were improved. Although the modernisation was scheduled for completion in March 1939, inconsistencies between &quot;Australia&quot;″s construction and the supplied drawings caused delays. The cruiser was recommissioned on 28 August, but did not leave the dockyard until 28 September.

===World War II===

====1939–1941====
Following the outbreak of World War II, &quot;Australia&quot; was initially assigned to Australian waters. From 28 November to 1 December, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, and &quot;Sydney&quot; hunted for the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; in the Indian Ocean. From 10 to 20 January 1940, &quot;Australia&quot; was part of the escort for Anzac convoy US 1 as it proceeded from Sydney to Fremantle, then sailed with it to the edge of the Australia Station en route to Colombo, before returning to Fremantle. On arrival, &quot;Australia&quot; relieved as the cruiser assigned to the western coast until 6 February, when she was in turn relieved by and returned to the east coast. On 12 May, &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; left Fremantle to escort Anzac convoy US 3 to Cape Town. After arriving on 31 May, the two ships were offered for service under the Royal Navy; &quot;Australia&quot; was accepted for service in European waters, although she spent most of June escorting ship around southern and western Africa.

On 3 July, &quot;Australia&quot; and the carrier were ordered to sail to Dakar, where the cruiser was shadowing the French battleship &quot;Richelieu&quot; and preparing to deny her use to the Vichy French if required. &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; reached the rendezvous in the early morning of 5 July. Attempts to disable the battleship were made by boat and air during 7 and 8 July; on the second day, &quot;Australia&quot; fired in anger for the first time when a French aircraft flew near the Allied ships and dropped bombs with no effect. The Australian cruiser left Dakar on 9 July, and caught up to an England-bound convoy two days later. They arrived at the River Clyde on 16 July, and &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s 1st Cruiser Squadron, based at Scapa Flow, four days later. During late July, the cruiser joined British ships off Norway in an unsuccessful search for the German battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. During August, &quot;Australia&quot; and searched around the Faroe Islands and Bear Island for German trawlers.

At the start of September, &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to Operation Menace (the Allied effort to install the Free French in Vichy-controlled Dakar) as a replacement for the torpedoed British cruiser . On the morning of 19 September, shortly after relieving on patrol off Dakar, &quot;Australia&quot; located three French cruisers, which she and &quot;Cumberland&quot; began to shadow until losing sight in the dark. One of the French ships, the cruiser &quot;Gloire&quot; suffered engine troubles and turned back to Konakri, encountering &quot;Australia&quot; shortly after. The Australian cruiser was ordered to escort &quot;Gloire&quot; to Casablanca, which the French cruiser agreed to. The two ships remained together until the morning of 21 September, when &quot;Gloire&quot;″s captain promised his opposite on &quot;Australia&quot; that the French ship would complete the voyage unescorted, and the Australian cruiser sailed to intercept the main body of the Allied fleet, which was met the next day. On the morning of 23 September, the cruiser was fired on by shore batteries at Dakar while intercepting and driving back two &quot;Fantasque&quot;-class destroyers, but did not receive damage. That afternoon, &quot;Australia&quot; and the British destroyers and engaged the French destroyer &quot;L&#x27;Audacieux&quot;, setting her on fire. On 24 September, despite poor visibility, &quot;Australia&quot; joined other Allied ships in shelling Dakar and the French warships in the harbour; during the withdrawal to the rest of the fleet, the Australian cruiser was unsuccessfully attacked by high-altitude bombers. On 25 September, &quot;Australia&quot; and shelled French ships anchored at Dakar. They damaged a destroyer and several cruisers before &quot;Australia&quot; was hit by two 6-inch shells and her Walrus was shot down with all aboard killed, after which the two ships withdrew. Operation Menace was abandoned as a failure on 26 September, and &quot;Australia&quot; was ordered to return to the United Kingdom two days later.

During early October, &quot;Australia&quot; escorted a group of troop transports returning from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom. On 29 October, &quot;Australia&quot; recovered nine of the thirteen crew from a Short Sunderland flying boat which crashed off Greenock, Scotland during a gale; the other four were carried away by the heavy seas during the rescue. The cruiser underwent a refit in Liverpool during November and December. During a German air raid on the night of 20 December, a torpedo was dropped on the dry-dock &quot;Australia&quot; was berthed in, but this landed alongside the ship and did not explode. The ship was damaged during an air raid the following night: the blast from a bomb landing near the port side cracked several scuttles and damaged the catapult.

&quot;Australia&quot; spent the first part of January 1941 escorting Convoy WS5B from the British Isles to the Middle East via South Africa. On 22 January, after handing the convoy over to off Mombasa, the cruiser joined the unsuccessful search for the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;. Following this and searches for the auxiliary cruisers &quot;Pinguin&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; in the Indian Ocean, &quot;Australia&quot; sailed for Sydney with two troopships, arriving on 24 March. The cruiser then escorted Convoy US10 for the first leg of the Australia to Suez run, after which she sailed to Singapore at the end of the month to collect Admiral Ragnar Colvin and his staff following the Singapore Conference.

During June, &quot;Australia&quot; escorted convoys across the Tasman Sea, then delivered Convoy US11A to Trincomalee in mid-July. The ship was then assigned to the South Atlantic Station. During November, the cruiser sailed to the Kerguelen Islands during searches for German commerce raiders, and after finding evidence of enemy activity, deployed magnetic sea mines in case they returned. As of 2008, the mines were still present. Prompted by the loss of and the deteriorating situation in South-east Asia, &quot;Australia&quot; was ordered on 3 December to hand Convoy WS12X to HMS &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, then make for home. On 29 December, the cruiser was designated Flagship of the Australian Squadron.

====1942====
On 31 January, &quot;Australia&quot; and sailed from Sydney to Wellington. In February 1942, the Australian cruiser became flagship of the newly formed ANZAC Squadron. In early March, &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to shell Gasmata in New Britain. However, on 7 March, the ships for the operation were recalled, and were used three days later to provide long-range protection for the American aircraft carriers and while they launched an air raid in retaliation to the Japanese capture of Lae and Salamaua. After the raid, &quot;Australia&quot; and the Anzac Squadron sailed for Nouméa.

On the evening of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship&#x27;s stokers was stabbed fourteen times, and died from peritonitis during the night. Before dying, the stoker informed the ship&#x27;s surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other stokers, which led to the attack. The two accused stokers were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Nouméa. The stokers were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser&#x27;s yardarm. However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb&#x27;s aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences be put off at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an appeal for clemency was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment. This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot;, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions&#x27; behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the &quot;National Security Act&quot;, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated to the start of the war. The sentences of the two stokers were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.
On 22 April, the Anzac Squadron was reclassified as Task Force 44; &quot;Australia&quot; remained flagship. &quot;Australia&quot; returned to Sydney in late April for a week of repairs and maintenance, primarily to the outer port propeller shaft. Around this time, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and on 1 May, &quot;Australia&quot; sailed with to rendezvous with American forces in the Coral Sea. At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace, who was embarked aboard &quot;Australia&quot; as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (&quot;Australia&quot;, the cruisers &quot;Hobart&quot; and , and the destroyers , and ) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands. The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired on a group of eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06. &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; were able to manoeuvre out of the torpedoes&#x27; paths, and at least five aircraft were destroyed. At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships. Although accurate (&quot;Australia&quot; was surrounded by the spread), none of the ships were hit directly, and the only casualties (aboard &quot;Chicago&quot;) were from shrapnel. A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle. &quot;Australia&quot; and the rest of the task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby.

On 13 June, Crace was replaced by Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley as commander of Task Force 44 and the flag officer embarked aboard &quot;Australia&quot;. A month later, on 14 July, &quot;Australia&quot; led Task Force 44 from Brisbane to rendezvous in Wellington with the amphibious assault force for the landings at Guadalcanal and the surrounding islands. The force left New Zealand for Fiji on 22 July, and conducted rehearsal landings at Koro Island from 28 to 31 July. They met the rest of the attack force (three carrier groups and more transports) south of Fiji on the evening of 1 August, then headed for the Solomon Islands. The various elements began to head for their positions on 6 August, with &quot;Australia&quot; leading Squadron X (with four other cruisers, nine destroyers, nine transports, and six store ships) towards the main landing site, on the north side of Guadalcanal. During the early morning of 7 August, Squadron X transited the channel between Guadalcanal and Savo Island, and reached the assault point off Lunga Point at 06:47. While moving into position, &quot;Australia&quot; and the other warships fired on shore targets sporadically, then commenced a coordinated bombardment before the first wave of landing craft hit the beach unopposed just after 08:00. Despite the efforts of the carrier air groups and interdiction attacks on Japanese air bases, the first of several retaliatory air attacks against Squadron X occurred at 13:23; each was driven off by the squadron&#x27;s massed anti-aircraft fire, with no damage to &quot;Australia&quot;. Anticipating a naval attack to occur during the night, Crutchley split his forces around Savo Island, with &quot;Australia&quot; leading &quot;Canberra&quot;, , and two destroyers on patrol of the southern waters, a second group of three heavy cruisers and two destroyers to patrol the northern passage, while the rest of the ships protected the transports or served as picket ships. Nothing occurred during the night of 7–8 August, and the same arrangement was assumed at 18:30 for the night of 8–9 August. At 20:45, Crutchley was recalled to meet urgently with US Admiral Richmond K. Turner, overall commander of the amphibious landings, aboard the transport to discuss the proposed withdrawal of the carrier groups, and &quot;Australia&quot; left the patrol group. The meeting concluded at 01:15 on 9 August, and instead of returning to the southern patrol, Crutchley ordered &quot;Australia&quot; to patrol around the transports. Just before 02:00, the southern patrol force was attacked by a six-ship Japanese task force, and &quot;Canberra&quot; was irreparably damaged. Three US cruisers were lost in the subsequent attack on the northern patrol force.
Once the transports completed unloading, the naval force withdrew over the course of 9 August; &quot;Australia&quot; reached Nouméa on 13 August. The ships of Task Force 44 were replenished at Nouméa, then sailed to rejoin the three carrier groups on 19 August, in response to intelligence that a large Japanese fleet was sailing to the Solomon Islands. After arrival on 21 August, Crutchley and &quot;Australia&quot; were placed in command of the carriers&#x27; combined surface defence group, including several cruisers and the battleship . Air attacks between the Allied and Japanese forces occurred during 24–25 August; the Japanese fleet was driven off without &quot;Australia&quot; or the other warships having to engage directly. On 31 August, Task Force 44 was detached from the carrier groups and sailed for Brisbane, arriving on 3 September. Four days later, &quot;Australia&quot; sailed with the task force for Milne Bay, where Allied ships and shore positions had been attacked several times by Japanese warships. Task Force 44 did not make contact with any enemy vessels. After this, the ships were assigned to patrol the Coral Sea.

====1943====
&quot;Australia&quot; and the rest of Task Force 44 were removed from patrol duties on 10 January 1943; no Japanese aircraft or ships were sighted during the three months on station. Task Force 44 was pulled back and split into smaller groups: two rapid response forces, and a third (made up of &quot;Australia&quot; and three American destroyers) sent to Moreton Bay for exercises. In early February, &quot;Australia&quot;″s group sailed to Sydney, where the cruiser was fitted with a new radar, then proceeded on 17 February to meet the convoy returning the 9th Division from the Middle East. The convoy arrived in Fremantle on 18 February, then sailed for the Great Australian Bight, where &quot;Australia&quot; and her escorts met them. The ships reached Sydney on 27 February without incident, and &quot;Australia&quot; and her destroyers returned to northern waters.

On 15 March 1943, a new numbering system for USN fleets saw Task Force 44 become Task Force 74 of the United States Seventh Fleet. On 11 April, &quot;Australia&quot; was sent to investigate rumours of Japanese landings along the south-eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but found no evidence of Japanese activity. The ships of the task force continued on with convoy escorting, refits, and patrols until 29 June, when &quot;Australia&quot; and five other ships were deployed to keep the sea lines of communication through the Coral and Arafura seas, and to assist any transports in these areas. After encountering no Japanese forces and receiving no calls for assistance, the ships withdrew to the Flinders Group on 4 July. Six days later, Task Force 74 was sent to Espiritu Santo to reinforce the United States Third Fleet, which had lost four cruisers to torpedoes (one sunk, three withdrawn for major repairs) while supporting the New Georgia Campaign. Arriving on 16 July, &quot;Australia&quot; and the other ships were assigned to Espiritu Santo&#x27;s western waters. At sunset on 20 July, Task Force 74 was returning to Espiritu Santo when was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine: Crutchley believed that the submarine had fired at &quot;Australia&quot; at long range, but the speed of the task force may have been underestimated, causing the torpedoes to miss the heavy cruiser, while one hit the following &quot;Hobart&quot;.

By October, &quot;Australia&quot; was back in Australian waters. At the start of the month, the cruiser was the only ship assigned to Task Force 74, but she was joined by the destroyer on 13 October, and the two ships arrived at Milne Bay two days later, in case of retaliatory sea attacks on the recently captured town of Finschhafen. The counterattack did not come, and the two ships sailed for Brisbane on 21 October, where the task force was built up to two cruisers and four destroyers. The ships then sailed for Milne Bay, where they remained until they were ordered to Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons, on 11 November to serve as support for the Third Fleet following the start of the Bougainville invasion. Although &quot;Australia&quot; and the task force arrived on 13 November, they were ordered to return to Milne Bay two days later, as a USN cruiser division had arrived. On 15 December 1943, &quot;Australia&quot; and Task Force 74 participated in the landings at Arawe, through escorting the landing force, then performing pre-landing bombardment. &quot;Australia&quot; also led the landing and escort force for the landing at Cape Gloucester, departing from Milne Bay on the evening of 25 December. At 06:00 on 26 December, &quot;Australia&quot; commenced a two-and-a-half-hour shelling of targets near the Gloucester airstrip prior to the landing, after which she sailed to Buna, where she remained for the rest of the year.

====1944====
In early January 1944, &quot;Australia&quot; returned to Milne Bay, before sailing to Sydney on 12 January for an eight-week refit. During the refit, Captain Farncomb was replaced by Captain Emile Dechaineux. On the morning of 7 February, Crutchley transferred his flag to ; the role of Flagship was returned to &quot;Australia&quot; on 21 March, three days after she rejoined Task Force 74 at Milne Bay. On the morning of 20 April, &quot;Australia&quot; and Task Force 74 rendezvoused with three other task forces of the Seventh Fleet off Manus Island: the combined force was to support the amphibious landings at Aitape, Humboldt Bay, and Tanahmerah Bay. The next evening, &quot;Australia&quot; split off with her task force and the attack force for Tanahmerah Bay. The flotilla arrived off the bay at 03:00 on 22 April, and at 06:00, &quot;Australia&quot; led a half-hour shore bombardment to cover the first wave of the amphibious landing. After the bombardment, which allowed the 24th Infantry Division to land with minimal opposition, the warships withdrew to protect the transports. Later in the day, &quot;Australia&quot; led two destroyers along the coastline, destroying any Japanese barges or supply dumps they encountered. Task Force 74 remained in the Hollandia area for the rest of the month to provide support to the landed forces, and arrived in Seeadler Harbour on 4 May.

&quot;Australia&quot; and Task Force 74 returned to Tanahmerah Bay on 16 May, to escort troopships to Wakde Island. The task force left the troopships (which were also being escorted by Task Force 75) at 04:30 on 17 May, and commenced an hour-long shore bombardment of the area around Sawar and Sarmi just after 06:00. The task forces provided fire support during the Battle of Wakde, then sailed to Humboldt Bay for replenishment. On 25 May, the task force was temporarily redesignated Task Group 77.2, and sailed at 22:00 to provide escort, then fire support, for the amphibious landing at Biak. At 06:30 on 27 May, &quot;Australia&quot; bombarded Biak Island. Over the next few days, &quot;Australia&quot; and the ships under her command provided cover patrols and fire support for Allied forces ashore. Predicting a heavy naval response from the Japanese, Crutchley was ordered on 1 June to return to Humboldt Bay with &quot;Australia&quot; and Task Force 74, then form a combined fleet with Task Force 75, which was to take up station northeast of Biak nightly from 4 June and intercept any Japanese forces encountered. On the evening of 4 June, while en route, the fleet was attacked by Japanese dive-bombers; &quot;Australia&quot; was not damaged in the attack. Crutchley&#x27;s force was withdrawn on 6 June to replenish at Humboldt Bay, then returned the next day. Aerial sightings of a Japanese force (three destroyers towing landing barges and three destroyers escorting, one of which was sunk by air attack) had been made during the day, and the Allied ships made radar contact at 23:19. At 23:31, just after the Japanese ships fired torpedoes, Crutchley ordered the destroyers under his command to close and attack, while he brought &quot;Australia&quot; and the other cruisers into range. The Japanese ships cast off their barges, turned, and fled, and Crutchley ordered the Allied destroyers to chase until 02:30 on 8 June, then retire; the cruisers broke off almost immediately as could not match the Japanese destroyers&#x27; speed. The Japanese escaped with minimal damage.

On 12 June, the combined task force returned to Seeadler Harbour, and Crutchley left &quot;Australia&quot;, having completed his two-year assignment as Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Squadron. A day later, Commodore John Augustine Collins raised his flag on &quot;Australia&quot; as commander of both the Australian Squadron and Task Force 74; the first graduate of the Royal Australian Naval College placed in overall command of the RAN&#x27;s ships. &quot;Australia&quot; spent most of June in harbour, and sailed on 24 June with Task Forces 74 and 75 to perform a pre-landing shore bombardment for the attack on Noemfoor Island. On the morning of 2 July, &quot;Australia&quot; bombarded Noemfoor Island, then was released before midday to sail for Hollandia, then on to Seeadler Harbour. on 12 July, &quot;Australia&quot; led Task Force 74 to Aitape, where the warships were to provide naval gunfire support for Allied forces ashore, help in the interdiction of Japanese troop movements by barge along the coast, and destroy gun emplacements covering the surrounding waterways. On 14 July, &quot;Australia&quot; bombarded the Yakamal area of Aitape, then shelled the Marubian area on 17 July, before attacking Yakamal again on 20 July. On 22 July, Collins transferred his flag to &quot;Shropshire&quot;, and &quot;Australia&quot; departed with for maintenance dockings in Sydney.
The cruiser departed Sydney on 26 August in the company of twelve other ships from Task Forces 74 and 75; the combined force reached Seeadler Harbour on 1 September. Collins reembarked on 3 September, and &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to the Morotai landings as lead ship of Task Group 75.2, part of the escort and bombardment force. The cruiser shelled the area around the landing site on Cape Gila from 06:50 to 07:40 on 15 September; this was cut short by ten minutes, as shell fragments from &quot;Australia&quot; were reported as falling close to the destroyer , which was positioned to cover the landings from the other side of the cape. The cruiser remained on station to provide fire support until the evening of 16 September, when &quot;Australia&quot; and the other ships normally assigned to Task Force 74 were permitted to withdraw to Mios Woendi. &quot;Australia&quot; remained there until 27 September, when Task Forces 74 and 75 sailed for Manus Island, where they were involved in exercising. During this time, the cruiser was visited by British Admiral of the Fleet Lord Roger Keyes.
Task Force 74 was absorbed on 11 October into Task Unit 77.3.2, assigned to provide close cover for the landing force in the operation to recapture Leyte, and departed that day for Hollandia. At 15:30 on 13 October, Task Group 77.3 (including &quot;Australia&quot; and her companions) began the seven-day voyage to Leyte. At 09:00 on 20 October, &quot;Australia&quot; commenced shelling targets prior to the amphibious landings, then was positioned to provide gunfire support and attack targets of opportunity throughout the day. At around 06:00 on 21 October, Japanese aircraft attacked attempted to bomb the Allied ships in Leyte Bay. An Aichi D3A dive-bomber dove for &quot;Shropshire&quot;, but broke away after heavy anti-aircraft fire was directed at it. The Aichi, damaged by Bofors fire, turned and flew at low level up the port side of the nearby &quot;Australia&quot;, before striking the cruiser&#x27;s foremast with its wingroot. Although the bulk of the aircraft fell overboard, the bridge and forward superstructure were showered with debris and burning fuel. Seven officers (including Captain Dechaineux) and twenty-three sailors were killed by the collision, while another nine officers (including Commodore Collins), fifty-two sailors, and an AIF gunner were wounded. Observers aboard &quot;Australia&quot; and nearby Allied ships differed in their opinions of the collision; some thought that it was an accident, while the majority considered it to be a deliberate ramming aimed at the bridge. Following the attack, commander Harley C. Wright assumed temporary control of the ship. Although historian George Hermon Gill claims in the official war history of the RAN that &quot;Australia&quot; was the first Allied ship hit by a kamikaze attack, other sources, such as Samuel Eliot Morison in &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot; disagree as it was not a preplanned suicide attack (the first attack where the pilots were ordered to ram their targets occurred four days later), but was most likely performed on the pilot&#x27;s own initiative, and similar attacks by damaged aircraft had occurred as early as 1942.

&quot;Australia&quot; sailed for Kossol Passage on the afternoon of the attack, in company with and the US Ships (also damaged during the Leyte invasion) and . On 24 October, the Australian ships proceeded to Manus, then sailed to Espiritu Santo for repairs. Work on &quot;Australia&quot; was completed by 28 November, and she rejoined the joint Australian-American task force (at that point operating under the designation 74.1) on 4 December. Five days later, Farncomb, now a commodore, rejoined &quot;Australia&quot; to replace Collins.

====1945====

At the start of 1945, &quot;Australia&quot; and the ships under her command were absorbed into Task Group 77.2, the escort and fire support force for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. &quot;Australia&quot; brought up the rear of the Task Group when it sailed from Leyte on the morning of 3 January, and was to be tasked with providing fire support for the landings at San Fabian. Numerous kamikaze attacks were attempted on the invasion force as it sailed to Lingayen Gulf; &quot;Australia&quot; was struck portside amidships at 17:35 on 5 January. 25 were killed and 30 were wounded (officer casualties numbered 3 and 1 respectively), mostly from the gun crews of the port-side secondary and anti-aircraft guns, but the physical damage was not considered severe enough to withdraw her from the operation. The ships reached the gulf early on 6 January, and by 11:00, &quot;Australia&quot; had commenced pre-landing bombardment. A second kamikaze rammed the cruiser at 17:34 between the starboard 4-inch guns, killing 14 and wounding 26. The casualties again consisted primarily of gun crews, and after this point, there were only enough trained personnel to man one 4-inch gun on each side of the cruiser. Another aircraft attempted to ram &quot;Australia&quot; at 18:28, but this was shot down by , itself damaged by kamikaze strikes during the day, before it could strike. &quot;Australia&quot;, assigned to a counter-battery role, saw little activity during 7 January. The next day, she was attacked twice by kamikazes in quick succession: at 07:20, a twin-engine bomber hit the water from the cruiser and skidded to connect with the ship&#x27;s port flank, then a second aircraft attacked at 07:39, again shot down just before it hit the port side at the waterline. A bomb carried by the second attacker opened a hole in the hull, causing a 5-degree list, but despite the explosion and a large quantity of debris and shrapnel, casualties were limited to a few cases of shock, and &quot;Australia&quot; was able to carry out the day&#x27;s assigned bombardments. The landing force arrived on 9 January, and at 08:30, the cruiser began shelling targets in preparation for the amphibious assault. At 13:11, the fifth suicide aircraft to hit &quot;Australia&quot; during the operation struck; although it intended to take out the cruiser&#x27;s bridge, the aircraft hit a mast strut and the forward exhaust funnel, and fell overboard. Although there were no casualties, the crash damaged the funnel, radar, and wireless systems, and the decision was made to withdraw the cruiser for repairs.

&quot;Australia&quot; joined several Allied ships damaged by kamikaze strikes in escorting the transport ships back to Leyte on the evening of 9 January. Temporary repairs were made to the cruiser, and after Farncomb transferred his flag to so he could return to the main force, &quot;Australia&quot; sailed to Sydney via Manus for permanent repairs and a refit, arriving home on 28 January. Two days later, she docked at Cockatoo Island for repair and the preliminary stages of the refit, including the removal of &#x27;X&#x27; turret and the aircraft catapult, and the shortening of the funnels by each. However, Australian shipyards had been instructed to prioritise repairs to British Pacific Fleet vessels, so &quot;Australia&quot; left the dock on 17 May and sailed on 24 May for England via the Panama Canal. The cruiser arrived at Plymouth on 2 July, and was docked for a major refit which ran from August to December.

The ship received eight battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Atlantic 1940–41&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1941–43&quot;, &quot;Coral Sea 1942&quot;, &quot;Savo Island 1942&quot;, &quot;Guadalcanal 1942&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf 1944&quot;, and &quot;Lingayen Gulf 1945&quot;. According to naval historian John Bastock, &quot;Australia&quot; &quot;probably fought more actions and steamed more miles than any other ship of the RAN&quot; during the war.

===Post-war===

The cruiser returned to Sydney on 16 February 1946, and she was placed into reserve for the rest of the year, during which the final components of the refit were completed. On 16 June 1947, &quot;Australia&quot; was recommissioned and designated flagship of the Australia Squadron. On 18 August, the cruiser sailed to Tokyo to serve with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. She remained in the region until the end of the year, and returned to Australia on 10 December. With the exceptions of visits to New Zealand in 1948 and New Guinea in 1949, &quot;Australia&quot; remained in home waters for the next three-and-a-half years. During 1949, the designation of Flagship was transferred to the light aircraft carrier . By the start of 1950, &quot;Australia&quot; had been reassigned to training duties.

&quot;Australia&quot; visited New Zealand from 24 February to 31 March 1950. The cruiser was deployed on a &#x27;mercy mission&#x27; to Heard Island in late July, to collect the island&#x27;s doctor, who had developed appendicitis, and transport him to the mainland for treatment. Given only 24 hours notice, the ship&#x27;s company loaded provisions and cold-weather gear, while removing all unnecessary equipment to improve fuel consumption, before sailing on 27 July. Better-than-expected weather on the outbound voyage was countered by poor conditions at Heard Island, with &quot;Australia&quot; forced to loiter for a day before a boat could be safely launched to collect the doctor. The cruiser reached Fremantle on 14 August. Because of structural damage to &quot;Australia&quot; caused by Southern Ocean conditions, the Australian government announced that RAN vessels would not be deployed for similar incidents in the future, although the RAN performed three medical evacuations at the nearby Macquarie Islands in later years.
During May 1951, &quot;Australia&quot; transported Sir John Northcott, the Governor of New South Wales, to Lord Howe Island for jubilee celebrations. In July, the cruiser visited New Caledonia. During 1952, the cruiser visited New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands, and undertook a training cruise to New Zealand from mid September to 6 October. &quot;Australia&quot; made a port visit to New Zealand in October 1953. During February and March 1954, the cruiser served as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht &quot;Gothic&quot;, during the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation world tour. Later, in May, &quot;Australia&quot; transported Governor-General Sir William Slim, along with his wife and staff, on a cruise of the Coral Sea, Great Barrier Reef, and Whitsunday Passage. During this voyage, a disabled Dutch landing ship was located and towed to Cairns.

==Decommissioning and fate==

On 31 August 1954, &quot;Australia&quot; was paid off and marked for disposal. She had been in service for 26 years, the longest career of a RAN warship to that date. The ship was sold on 25 January 1955 to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation for scrapping. On 26 March, the cruiser was towed from Sydney Harbour by the Dutch-flagged tugboat &quot;Rode Zee&quot;. The ships were later joined by two other tugs for the voyage to Barrow-in-Furness via the Suez Canal, where they arrived on 5 July. &quot;Australia&quot; was broken up at Thos. W. Ward&#x27;s Shipbreaking Yard at Barrow-in-Furness over the course of 1956.

One of the cruiser&#x27;s 8-inch gun barrels is on display outside the Australian War Memorial. A memorial to the ship&#x27;s company, particularly those killed during World War II, was unveiled at Henley Beach, South Australia on 1 May 2011.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105, part of the Spiral program, was a crewed test vehicle to explore low-speed handling and landing. It was a visible result of a Soviet project to create an orbital spaceplane. The MiG 105 was nicknamed &quot;Lapot&quot; (, or bast shoe; the word is also used as a slang for &quot;shoe&quot;), for the shape of its nose.

==Development==
The program was also known as the Experimental Passenger Orbital Aircraft (EPOS). Work on this project began in 1965, with the project being halted in 1969, only to be restarted in 1974 in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle Program. The test vehicle made its first subsonic free-flight test in 1976, taking off under its own power from an old airstrip near Moscow. Flight tests, totaling eight in all, continued sporadically until 1978. The actual space plane project was cancelled when the decision was made to instead proceed with the Buran project. The MiG test vehicle itself still exists and is currently on display at the Monino Air Force Museum in Russia.

==Spiral concept==
* Soviet engineers opted for a midair launch scheme for Spiral. Known as &quot;50 / 50&quot;, the idea was that the spaceplane and a liquid fuel booster stage would be launched at high altitude from the back of a custom-built hypersonic jet. The mothership was to have been built by the Tupolev Design Bureau (OKB-156) and utilize many of the same technologies developed for the Tu-144 supersonic transport and the Sukhoi T-4 Mach 3 bomber. It was never built.
* Spiral was a conventional delta wing that featured innovative variable-dihedral wings. During launch and reentry, these were folded upward at 60 degrees. After dropping to subsonic speeds post-reentry, the pilot lowered the wings into the horizontal position, giving the spaceplane better re-entry and flight characteristics.
* Spiral was built to allow for a powered landing and go-around maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. An air intake for a single Kolesov turbojet was mounted beneath the central vertical stabilizer. This was protected during launch and re-entry by a clamshell door which opened at subsonic speeds.
* Spiral was to have been protected by what Soviet engineers termed &quot;scale-plate armour&quot;: niobium alloy VN5AP and molybdenum disilicide plated steel plates mounted on articulated ceramic bearings to allow for thermal expansion during reentry. Several BOR (Russian acronym for Unpiloted Orbital Rocketplane) craft were flown to test this concept.
* In the event of a booster explosion or in-flight emergency, the crew compartment of Spiral was designed to separate from the rest of the vehicle and parachute to earth like a conventional ballistic capsule; this could be done at any point in the flight.
* Spiral was intended to carry only its pilot.
* Spiral was designed to land on skids, which deployed from a set of doors on the sides of the fuselage just above and ahead of the wings.

==BOR reentry test vehicles==
Another spacecraft to use the Spiral design was the БОР (, , &quot;Unpiloted Orbital Rocketplane&quot;) series, uncrewed sub-scale reentry test vehicles. American analogs were the X-23 PRIME and ASSET. Several of these craft have been preserved in aerospace museums around the world.

<text>Up All Night is the debut album by English indie rock band Razorlight, released on 28 June 2004. The album was mainly recorded at Sawmills Studio and mixed at Sphere Studios by John Cornfield.

The album garnered favourable reviews but critics questioned the band&#x27;s influence-filled musicianship throughout the tracks. &quot;Up All Night&quot; peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned six singles: &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Lies&quot;, &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, &quot;Stumble and Fall&quot;, &quot;Golden Touch&quot;, &quot;Vice&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Else&quot;.

On 4 June 2014, the band, with only lead singer Johnny Borrell remaining from the line-up which recorded the album, played at the Electric Ballroom in Camden to mark &quot;Up All Night&quot;″s 10th anniversary.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Up All Night&quot; received positive reviews but music critics were divided by the overall musicianship resembling that of bands both classic and contemporary. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65 based on 16 reviews.

Tim Jonze of &quot;NME&quot; gave the album high praise for Johnny Borrell&#x27;s sharp street poetry and the band&#x27;s instrumentation for giving Borrell the right amount of strength and control to sing them, saying &quot;For all its flaws, &quot;Up All Night&quot; bristles with passion, energy and, most importantly, amazing songs.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Borrell for backing up his bravado with tracks that exude tight lyrics and optimism, saying that &quot;&quot;Up All Night&quot; is a brilliant mod explosion of scruffy pub punk, in the mode of his old friends the Libertines.&quot; Dorian Lynskey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the album&#x27;s various influence-filled tracks get by on Borrell being able to deliver them with gusto and conviction, concluding that &quot;Originality may not be Razorlight&#x27;s strong point, but Borrell&#x27;s raw charisma carries the day.&quot; Richard Banks of BBC praised the band&#x27;s commitment to delivering upbeat three-chord punk tracks while still being to able to make it wholly original, concluding that &quot;With a debut this good, Razorlight are a band that deserve to do very, very well.&quot;

Mark Edwards of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; was mixed about the record, saying the band utilise the basic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll formula to craft catchy tracks but then sputter out in terms of inspiration to create nondescript material. He concluded with, &quot;This is a good debut album—no more, no less. The second album could very well be as good as they think this one is. But they&#x27;re going to have to wait a while before they get what they so desire.&quot; Alex Reicherter of &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that a majority of the album&#x27;s tracks utilising the hedonistic party tale formula work and any diversions from it fall flat, saying &quot;though they lack the rapid-fire consistency of their predecessors, they&#x27;ve put together a likable, if completely unoriginal rock record that&#x27;s sure to get even the dullest of parties onto the police blotter.&quot; Nick Sylvester of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; found the album&#x27;s instrumentation and lyrics derivative of The Strokes and Television, and criticised Borrell&#x27;s vocal delivery for impersonating said bands&#x27; frontmen with no passion, concluding that &quot;Razorlight refuse to meet their influences with anything more than half hugs and limp handshakes, butchering the bits they brazenly borrow, and taking rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll apathy to formerly unbelievable lengths.&quot;

<text>Akosua Gyamama Busia (born 30 December 1966) is a Ghanaian actress, writer and songwriter. She is known to film audiences for playing Nettie Harris in the 1985 film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. She is the daughter of Ghanaian Prime Minister Kofi Abrefa Busia.

==Family and early life==
Busia was born in Accra in 1966. She is the daughter of Kofi Abrefa Busia, who was prime minister of the Republic of Ghana (from 1969 to 1972) and a prince of the royal family of Wenchi, a subgroup of the Ashanti, making Akosua a princess too. Her sister, Abena Busia, is a poet and academic, who was a professor in English at Rutgers University, and since 2017 has been the Ghanaian ambassador to Brazil.

Busia grew up in Ghana, and began her acting career at the age of 16, attending London&#x27;s Central School of Speech and Drama on scholarship. Her first acting role was as Juliet in an otherwise white cast, performing Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at Oxford University, where her siblings were studying.

==Career==
Busia made her film debut in the 1979 adventure film &quot;Ashanti&quot;, with Michael Caine and Peter Ustinov. After moving to Los Angeles in the early 1980s, she was cast to play a supporting role in the slasher film &quot;The Final Terror&quot;, directed by Andrew Davis (&quot;The Fugitive&quot;). The film was not released until 1983, after several of its actors (including Daryl Hannah and Rachel Ward) had achieved public prominence.

Busia&#x27;s film roles include a notable performance as Bessie in a 1986 film adaptation of Richard Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Native Son&quot; (with Geraldine Page and Matt Dillon). She also starred in &quot;Hard Lessons&quot; alongside Denzel Washington and Lynn Whitfield in 1986. Busia played Nettie, the younger sister of Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s character Celie Harris, in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1985 &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, adapted from Alice Walker&#x27;s novel of the same title, as Ruth in &quot;Badge of the Assassin&quot; (1985), as Jewel in John Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Rosewood&quot; (1997), and as Patience in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; (2003). She has also appeared on television in the series &quot;ER&quot;.

Busia is the author of &quot;The Seasons of Beento Blackbird: A Novel&quot; (Washington Square Press, 1997, ). She was one of three co-writers for the screenplay adaptation of Toni Morrison&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Beloved&quot; for the 1998 film version of the same name directed by Jonathan Demme. In 2008, Busia directed a film about her father: &quot;The Prof. A Man Remembered. Life, Vision &amp; Legacy of K.A. Busia&quot;.
Busia also co-wrote the song &quot;Moon Blue&quot; with Stevie Wonder for his album &quot;A Time 2 Love&quot;, released in 2005. Her poem &quot;Mama&quot; is included in the 2019 anthology &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby.

After 18-year hiatus to raise her daughter, in 2016 Busia returned to acting in the off-Broadway and Broadway production of Danai Gurira&#x27;s play &quot;Eclipsed&quot;, alongside Lupita Nyong&#x27;o. For her performance off-Broadway, she received an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance as Rita

In 2024 Busia released the drama film &quot;In Search of a Blessed Life: He Who Hath&quot;, which was inspired by the book &quot;He that Hath, to Him Shall Be Given&quot; by Dag Heward-Mills. Later that same year Busia&#x27;s documentary &quot;Stevie Wonder in Ghana: In Search of a Blessed Life&quot; was also released.

==Personal life==
On 12 October 1996, Akosua Busia married the American film director John Singleton, with whom she has a daughter — Hadar Busia-Singleton (born 3 April 1997); the couple divorced on 15 June 1997. Their daughter attended school in Ghana, before returning to the US.

She co-founded with her sister Abena Busia the Busia Foundation International, aiming &quot;to provide assistance to the disadvantaged&quot;.

<text>The underground courts (&quot;&quot;) were World War II secret courts in occupied Poland, organized by the Polish government-in-exile. The courts determined punishments for citizens of Poland who were subject to Polish law before the war.

==History==
After the Polish Defense War of 1939, the German authorities of the General Government mobilized all the pre-war Polish policemen to the German service. The so-called Navy-Blue Police (&quot;Policja granatowa&quot;, nicknamed after the color of their uniforms) were used as an auxiliary unit of the Gestapo and Kripo, yet they had no means of executing law and order in the occupied country. At the same time, the German police forces and courts were more interested in persecution of Jews and members of the Polish intelligentsia and underground rather than common criminals.

First underground, ad hoc courts were created alongside some of the first Polish resistance organizations as early as in 1939. At first, they were purely military, concerned only with the cases that would fall under military law (such as treason). On 16 April 1940, the Polish government-in-exile in London decided that the underground Polish courts be created for prosecution of criminals, traitors, informants and collaborators. The structure and law regulating those courts were mostly finalized around 1942.

The Underground Courts tried only the pre-war citizens of Poland who were legally subjects of the Polish law. No citizens of other states (including members of the occupying forces of Germany and the USSR) were ever sentenced by the Underground Courts. However, at times such claims were made by the Bureau of Information and Propaganda for propaganda reasons; nevertheless, executions of members of the SS and Gestapo were treated as elements of partisan warfare. The reason for such a policy was a belief that the Polish Underground State should act as if the occupation and dismemberment of Poland never happened.

Polish special Underground Courts reviewed about 10,000 to 17,000 cases of collaboration, and sentenced over 3,500 individuals to death (2,500 executions were carried out; many others were sentenced to punishments like beatings or fines, or with a recommendation for review of the case after the war).

Approximately 30% of the executions in Warsaw were of Poles found to blackmail or denounce the hiding Jews (szmalcowniks).

<text>Li Ting (; born 5 January 1980) is a Chinese tennis player. She won a gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in women&#x27;s doubles alongside Sun Tiantian.

==Education==
She graduated from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2002.

==Career==
As a doubles player, Li has enjoyed great success, winning 26 ITF titles and a further nine WTA Tour titles.

She competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics, defeating Spain to win a gold medal in the women&#x27;s tennis doubles along with her partner Sun Tiantian.

As a singles player, Li enjoyed limited success in ITF events until June 2000, when she qualified for a WTA tournament at Tashkent, then defeated Alina Jidkova of Russia in the first round of the main draw, before bowing out in Round Two. As a wildcard entrant to the WTA event at Shanghai that September, she lost in three sets to Tara Snyder in the first round. Without further success for the rest of the year, she ended world-ranked 325, beating her previous personal best of 347 at the end of 1998.

A year of indifferent results at lowly ITF level followed in 2001, but in September she came through qualifying with three straight wins to reach Shanghai again, beating countrywoman Liu Nannan in the final round, only to lose to Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy in the main draw. But this achievement was not enough to prevent her world ranking from dropping to 536 by the year&#x27;s end.

2002 was a poorer year still for Li Ting in singles, as she failed to qualify for Shanghai and won only one match in just four ITF tournaments entered, leading her year-end ranking to slump to 837.

In 2003, she audaciously attempted to buck this trend by boldly entering qualifying for several WTA Tour events while shunning the ITF circuit altogether, and managed to win her first round qualifying ties at Hyderabad, Bali and Shanghai, but failed to progress further until the Japan Open in late September, for which she qualified with wins over Ivana Abramović and Yan Zi, before being easily beaten by Shinobu Asagoe of Japan in the main draw first round. Frustrated with her lack of progress at WTA level, she retreated into ITF territory, and met with some success at the $50,000 Paducah tournament in October, where she gained main draw entry as a lucky loser in qualifying, then reached the quarter-final before losing to Zheng Jie in three sets. Following this result, she was awarded wild-cards into two further $50,000 tournaments, but won just one match at the second. Still, she had pulled her world ranking back up inside the top 500, to No. 436.

In 2004, as if from nowhere, Li Ting&#x27;s WTA career took off. She qualified for Doha with wins over Shikha Uberoi and future stars Mara Santangelo and Maret Ani, then defeated Els Callens in the main draw first round before losing in straight sets to Jennifer Capriati despite forcing a tie-break in the first set. In May, she proved this superb performance was no accident by qualifying for her second successive WTA tournament, this time defeating Martina Müller, Mervana Jugić-Salkić and Michaela Paštiková, all very capable top-150 players, in straight sets, then stunned Iveta Benešová 6–4, 6–1 in the main draw first round before being downed in three sets by Jelena Kostanić in Round 2. She competed little over the summer, but entered qualifying for Beijing in September, beating Martina Suchá in the first round before losing to her on-form countrywoman Li Na. At Guangzhou, she was awarded a wildcard to the main draw, and proved she deserved it by advancing to the semi-final with easy straight-sets victories over Anikó Kapros, Nicole Pratt and (most impressively of all) Peng Shuai, only to lose again to her former long-time doubles partner (and the eventual tournament champion) Li Na. In October, she entered the first $50k Shenzhen tournament, and again impressed in reaching the quarter-finals after a first-round win over Yan Zi, before losing two matches later to Sun Tiantian. Li Ting ended the year in the top 400 for the first time since 2000, and in the top 300 for the first time in her career, world-ranked 168, after a vastly improved season.

January 2005 saw Li Ting qualify for her first Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open, with notable wins over Laura Pous Tió and Sandra Kloesel; and she took a set from Marta Domachowska of Poland in the main draw first round but lost the match. In February, she won another three back-to-back matches to qualify for Hyderabad, but then lost to upcoming starlet Jarmila Gajdošová in the first round of the tournament proper. At Doha, she reached the final round of qualifying with wins over Zheng Jie and Anca Barna, then lost to Roberta Vinci. At Dubai, she took Maria Kirilenko to three sets, two of them tie-breaks, in an unfortunate first-round qualifying draw which she ultimately lost. But by the end of February she had improved her world-ranking to a career-best 136.

Unfortunately for Li Ting, her results at WTA events then took a downward turn for the next six months. Although she battled through to win a $50k event at Beijing in June, defeating Yan Zi surprisingly comfortably in the final, this career-best tournament victory was a blip on the radar of her disappointing summer results at WTA tournaments. In September, however, she came close to qualifying for Beijing, beating Martina Müller before losing to Emma Laine in three sets. Then at Guangzhou, she reached the quarterfinal with excellent wins over Vera Zvonareva and Alina Jidkova, then very nearly reached the semifinal for the second successive year, as she pushed eventual finalist Nuria Llagostera Vives all the way before finally losing their joust 6–3, 4–6, 6–7. But after this, she did not play again for the rest of the year, and ended it ranked 177th, down almost forty places on her peak.

2006 began promisingly enough for Li Ting, as she qualified for January&#x27;s Australian Open for the second successive year, only to lose this time to the inspired young Russian star Elena Vesnina. She also impressed in qualifying for Doha, Qatar in February, with wins over Yan Zi and Tatiana Poutchek; but Maria Kirilenko, now ranked in the world top 30, once again proved the more capable player as they met in the first round of the main draw, defeating Li Ting in straight sets. Her ranking had slipped to 209 by the end of the month; but she has proven that she is capable of competing with players of top 100 calibre, and provided that she herself has the will to persist, tennis supporters can confidently expect to see plenty more fireworks from this talented 26-year-old doubles specialist in singles events before she calls time on her career.

In 2007, Li stopped partnering with Sun Tiantian, to make room for a new Chinese doubles player. Sun Shengnan was paired with Sun Tiantian, according to the 2007 Australian Open website.

<doc id="965233" wikidata="Q953291" url="?curid=965233" title="Culture of Iran">
<text>The culture of Iran () or culture of Persia is one of the oldest and among the most influential in the world. Iran (Persia) is widely regarded as one of the cradles of civilization. Due to its dominant geopolitical position in the world, it has heavily influenced peoples and cultures situated in Southern Europe Eastern Europe to the west; Central Asia to the north; and South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia to the east. Iranian history has significantly influence on the world through art, architecture, poetry, science and technology, medicine, philosophy, and engineering.

An eclectic cultural elasticity has been said to be one of the key defining characteristics of the Iranian identity and a clue to its historical longevity. Furthermore, Iran&#x27;s culture has manifested itself in several facets throughout the history of the Iranian Plateau as well as of the South Caucasus, West Asia, and Central Asia.

==History==
The history of Iran&#x27;s culture is marked by the influence of ancient civilizations such as the Elamites and Persians, as well as the Achaemenid and Sassanian empires. 

The Arab conquest in the 7th century introduced Islamic traditions, which merged with pre-Islamic customs. This fusion resulted in a distinct cultural identity characterized by significant contributions to literature, art, and philosophy. Iran has historically served as a center of culture and learning, impacting the surrounding region.

==Art==
Iran has one of the oldest, richest, and most influential art heritages in the world, which encompasses many disciplines including literature, music, dance, architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking, embroidery, and Stonemasonry. 

Iranian art has gone through numerous phases, which is evident from the unique aesthetics of Iran. From the Elamite Chogha Zanbil to the Median and Achaemenid reliefs of Persepolis to the mosaics of Bishapur.

The Islamic Golden Age brought drastic changes to the styles and practice of the arts. However, each Iranian dynasty had its own particular foci, building upon the previous dynasty&#x27;s, all of which during their times were heavily influential in shaping the cultures of the world then and today.

===Language===

Several languages are spoken throughout Iran, including languages from the Iranian, Turkic, and Semitic language families. According to the CIA World Factbook, 78% of Iranians speak an Iranian language as their native tongue, 18% speak a Turkic language as their native tongue and 2% speak a Semitic language as their native tongue while the remaining 2% speak languages from various other groups. Although the Azerbaijanis speak a Turkic language, due to their culture, history, and genetics, they are often associated with the Iranian people.

The predominant language and national language of Iran is Persian, which is spoken fluently across the country. Azerbaijani is spoken primarily and widely in the northwest, Kurdish and Luri are spoken primarily in the west, Mazandarani and Gilaki are spoken in the regions along the Caspian Sea, Arabic primarily in the Persian Gulf coastal regions, Balochi primarily in the southeast, and Turkmen primarily in northern border regions. Smaller languages spread in other regions notably include Talysh, Georgian, Armenian, Assyrian, and Circassian, amongst others.

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; estimates that there are 86 Iranian languages, the largest among them being Persian, Pashto, and the Kurdish dialect continuum with an estimated 150–200 million native speakers of the Iranian languages worldwide. Dialects of Persian are sporadically spoken throughout the region from China to Syria to Russia, though mainly in the Iranian Plateau.

=== Literature ===


The literature of Iran is one of the world&#x27;s oldest and most celebrated literatures, spanning over 2500 years from the many Achaemenid inscriptions, such as the Behistun inscription, to the celebrated Iranian poets of the Islamic Golden Age and Modern Iran. Iranian literature has been described as one of the great literature of humanity and one of the four main pillars of world literature. Distinguished Professor L.P. Elwell-Sutton described the literature of the Persian language as &quot;one of the richest poetic literature of the world&quot;.

Very few literary works of Pre-Islamic Iran have survived, due partly to the destruction of the libraries of Persepolis by Alexander of Macedon during the era of the Achaemenids and the subsequent invasion of Iran by the Arabs in 641, who sought to eradicate all non-Quranic texts. This resulted in all Iranian libraries being destroyed and books either being burnt or thrown into rivers. The only way that Iranians could protect these books was to bury them, but many of the texts were forgotten over time. As soon as circumstances permitted, the Iranians wrote books and assembled libraries. 

Iranian literature encompasses a variety of literature in the languages used in Iran. Modern Iranian literature includes Persian literature, Azerbaijani literature, Kurdish literature, and the literature of the remaining minority languages. Persian is the predominant and official language of Iran and throughout Iran&#x27;s history, it has been the nation&#x27;s most influential literary language. The Persian language has been often dubbed as the most worthy language of the world to serve as a conduit for poetry. Azerbaijani literature has also had an effect on Iran&#x27;s literature with it being developed highly after Iran&#x27;s first reunification in 800 years under the Safavid Empire, whose rulers themselves wrote poetry. There remain a few literary works of the extinct Iranian language of Old Azeri that was used in Azerbaijan prior to the linguistic Turkification of the people of the region. Kurdish literature has also had an influence on the literature of Iran incorporating the various Kurdish dialects that are spoken throughout the Middle East. The earliest works of Kurdish literature are those of the 16th-century poet Malaye Jaziri.

Some notable greats of Iranian poetry who have had major global influence include the likes of Ferdowsi, Saadi, Hafiz, Attar, Nezami, Jami, Rumi, Omar Khayyam, Taleb Amoli, Ubayd Zakani, Shams Tabrizi, Rudaki and Vahshi Bafqi. These poets have inspired the likes of Goethe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and many others.

Contemporary Iranian literature has been influenced by classical Persian poetry, but also reflects the particularities of modern-day Iran, through writers such as Houshang Moradi-Kermani, the most translated modern Iranian author, and poet Ahmad Shamlou.

=== Music ===
Iranian music has directly influenced the cultures of West Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and South Asia. It has mainly influenced and built up much of the musical terminology of the neighboring Turkic and Arabic cultures and reached India through the 16th-century Persianate Mughal Empire, whose court promoted new musical forms by bringing Iranian musicians.

Iran is the place of origin of complex instruments, with the instruments dating back to the third millennium BC. Several trumpets made of silver, gold, and copper were found in eastern Iran that are attributed to the Oxus civilization and date back between 2200 and 1750 BC. The use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps have been documented at the archaeological sites of Madaktu (650 BC) and Kul-e Fara (900–600 BC), with the largest collection of Elamite instruments documented at Kul-e Fara. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.

The reign of Sassanian ruler Khosrow II is regarded as a &quot;golden age&quot; for Iranian music. Sassanid music is where many the many music cultures of the world trace their distant origins. The court of Khosrow II hosted several prominent musicians, including Azad, Bamshad, Barbad, Nagisa, Ramtin, and Sarkash. Among these attested names, Barbad is remembered in many documents and has been named as remarkably highly skilled. He was a poet-musician who developed modal music and may have invented the lute and the musical tradition that was to transform into the forms of dastgah and maqam. He has been credited to have organized a musical system consisting of seven &quot;royal modes&quot; (&quot;xosrovāni&quot;), 30 derived modes (&quot;navā&quot;), and 360 melodies (&quot;dāstān&quot;).

The academic classical music of Iran, in addition to preserving melody types that are often attributed to Sassanian musicians, is based on the theories of sonic aesthetics as expounded by the likes of Iranian musical theorists in the early centuries after the Muslim conquest of the Sasanian Empire, most notably Avicenna, Farabi, Qotb-ed-Din Shirazi, and Safi-ed-Din Urmawi.

=== Dance ===

Iran has a rich and ancient dance culture that extends to the sixth millennium BC. Dances from ancient artifacts, excavated at the archaeological pre-historic sites of Iran, portray a vibrant culture that mixes different forms of dances for all occasions. In conjunction with music, the artifacts depicted actors, dancers, and ordinary people dancing in plays, dramas, celebrations, mourning, and religious rituals with equipment such as costumes of animals or plants, masks, and surrounding objects. As time progressed, this culture of dance began to develop and flourish.

Iran is a multi-ethnic nation. Although the cultures of its ethnic groups are very similar and in most areas nearly identical, each has its own distinct and specific dance style. Iran possesses four categories of dance with these being: group dances, solo improvisational dances, war or combat dances, and spiritual dances.

Typically, the group dances are often unique and named after the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated. These dances can be chain dances involving a group or the more common group dances mainly performed at festive occasions like weddings and Noruz celebrations which focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in their special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.

Solo dances are usually reconstructions of the historical and court dances of the various Iranian dynasties throughout history, with the most common types being that of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties due to them being relatively newer. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles.

War or Combat dances, imitate combat or serve as training for warriors. For instance, the ritualized wrestling movements of the Zurkhaneh (&quot;House of Strength&quot;) are considered a form of dance called &quot;Raghs-e-Pa&quot; or &quot;Pay-Bazi.&quot; These movements also resemble martial arts and are part of the cultural heritage of warrior training.

Spiritual dances in Iran are known as &quot;sama&quot;. These dances serve spiritual purposes, such as removing ill omens or exorcising evil spirits. These dances involve trance, music, and complex movements. One example is the Balochi dance &quot;le&#x27;b gowati&quot;, performed to rid a possessed person of the offending spirit. In the Balochi language, the term &quot;gowati&quot; refers to psychologically ill patients who have recovered through music and dance.

The earliest researched dance from Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra, the Zoroastrian angelic divinity of covenant, light, and oath, which was used commonly by the Roman Cult of Mithra. One of the cult&#x27;s ceremonies involved the sacrifice of a bull followed by a dance that promoted vigor in life. The Cult of Mithra was active from the 1st century CE to the 4th century CE and worshiped a mystery religion inspired by the Iranian worship of Mithra. It was a rival of Christianity in the Roman Empire and was eventually suppressed in the 4th century CE by Roman authorities in favor of Christianity. This was done to counter the greater Iranian cultural influence that was expanding throughout the Roman Empire. The cult was highly adhered to and respected throughout the Roman Empire with its center in Rome, and was popular throughout the western half of the empire, as far south as Roman Africa and Numidia, as far north as Roman Britain, and to a lesser extent in Roman Syria in the east.

=== Architecture ===

The history of Iranian architecture dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the South Caucasus and Zanzibar. Currently, there are 19 UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites that were designed and constructed by Iranians, with 11 of them being located outside of Iran. Iranian architecture displays a great variety of both structure and aesthetics and despite the repeated trauma of destructive invasions and cultural shocks, the Iranian zeal and identity has always triumphed and flourished. In turn, it has greatly influenced the architecture of its invaders from the Greeks to the Arabs to the Turks.

The traditional theme of Iranian architecture is cosmic symbolism, which depicts the communication and participation of man with the powers of heaven. This theme has not only given continuity and longevity to the architecture of Iran but has been a primary source of the emotional character of the nation as well. Iranian architecture ranges from simple structures to &quot;some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen&quot;.

Iranian architectural style is the combination of intensity and simplicity to form immediacy, while ornament and, often, subtle proportions reward sustained observation. Iranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as the circle and square, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls. The paramount virtues of Iranian architecture are: &quot;a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in vault and dome construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture&quot;.

The traditional architecture of Iran throughout the ages is categorized into two families and six following classes or styles. The two categories are Zoroastrian and Islamic, which references the eras of pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Iran, and the six styles, in order of their era, are Parsian, Parthian Khorasani, Razi, Azari, Esfahani. The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 years of architectural development from the various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.

In addition to historic gates, palaces, bridges, buildings, and religious sites that highlight the highly developed supremacy of the Iranian art of architecture, Iranian gardens are also an example of Iran&#x27;s cosmic symbolism and unique style of combining intensity and simplicity for form immediacy. There are currently 14 Iranian gardens that are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, with 5 of them being located outside of Iran. The traditional style of Iranian gardens is to represent an earthly paradise or a heaven on Earth. From the time of the Achaemenid Empire, the idea of an earthly paradise spread through Iranian literature to other cultures, with the word for paradise in the Iranian languages of Avestan, Old Persian, and Median, spreading to languages across the world. The style and design of the Iranian garden greatly influenced the garden styles of countries from Spain to Italy and Greece to India, with some notable examples of such gardens being the gardens of the Alhambra in Spain, Humayun&#x27;s Tomb, and the Taj Mahal in India, the Hellenistic gardens of the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemies in Alexandria.

== Cuisine ==
Iranian cuisine refers to the culinary practices of Iran. Due to the historically common usage of the term &quot;Persia&quot; to refer to Iran in the Western world, it is alternatively known as Persian cuisine, despite Persians being only one of a multitude of Iranian ethnic groups who have contributed to Iran&#x27;s culinary traditions.

The cuisine of Iran has made extensive contact throughout its history with the cuisines of its neighbouring regions, including Cuisine from the Caucasus, Central Asian cuisine, Greek cuisine, Levantine cuisine, Mesopotamian cuisine, Russian cuisine and Turkish cuisine. Aspects of Iranian cuisine have also been significantly adopted by Indian cuisine and Pakistani cuisine through various historical Persianate sultanates that flourished during Muslim rule on the Indian subcontinent, with the most notable and influential of these polities being the Mughal Empire.

Typical Iranian main dishes are combinations of rice with meat, vegetables and nuts. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots and raisins. Characteristic Iranian spices and flavourings such as saffron, cardamom, and dried lime and other sources of sour flavoring, cinnamon, turmeric and parsley are mixed and used in various dishes.

Outside of Iran, a strong presence of Iranian cuisine can be found in cities with significant Iranian diaspora populations, namely the San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto, Houston and especially Los Angeles and its environs.

==Religion in Iran==
Zoroastrianism was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the Arab conquest. It has had an immense influence on Iranian philosophy, culture and art after the people of Iran converted to Islam. The Persian Samanid dynasty made great attempts to spread the Islamic faith in the 9th and 10th century while promoting a Persian cultural revival. Until the 16th century, Iran was majority Sunni ushering a golden age of the arts and sciences. In 1501 the Safavid dynasty took control of Iran and made Shia Islam the state religion, with this being one of the most important events in Islamic history.

Today of the 98% of Muslims living in Iran, around 89% are Shi&#x27;a and only around 9% are Sunni. This is quite the opposite trend of the percentage distribution of Shi&#x27;a to Sunni Islam followers in the rest of the Muslim population from state to state (primarily in the Middle East) and throughout the rest of the world.

Followers of the Baháʼí Faith form the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran. Baháʼís are scattered throughout small communities in Iran, although there seems to be a large population of Baháʼís in Tehran. The Iranian government actively pursues the persecution of Baháʼís.

Followers of the Christian faith consist of around 250,000 Armenians, around 32,000 Assyrians, and a small number of Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant Iranians that have been converted by missionaries in earlier centuries. Thus, Christians that live in Iran are primarily descendants of indigenous Christians that were converted during the 19th and 20th centuries. Judaism is an officially recognized faith in Iran, and in spite of the hostilities between Iran and Israel over the Palestinian issue, the millennia-old Jewish community in Iran enjoys the right to practise their religion freely as well as a dedicated seat in parliament to a representative member of their faith. In addition to Christianity and Judaism, Zoroastrianism is another officially recognized religion in Iran, although followers of this faith do not hold a large population in Iran. In addition, although there have been instances of prejudice against Zoroastrians, most followers of this faith have not faced widespread persecution.

==Holidays in Iran==
The Persian year begins in the vernal equinox: if the astronomical vernal equinox comes before noon, then the present day is the first day of the Persian year. If the equinox falls after noon, then the next day is the official first day of the Persian year. The Persian Calendar, which is the official calendar of Iran, is a solar calendar with a starting point that is the same as the Islamic calendar. According to the Iran Labor Code, Friday is the weekly day of rest. Government official working hours are from Saturday to Wednesday (from 8 am to 4 pm).

Although the date of certain holidays in Iran are not exact (due to the calendar system they use, most of these holidays are around the same time), some of the major public holidays in Iran include Oil Nationalization Day (20 March). Yalda (which is the longest night of the year) (21 December), Nowrooz—which is the Iranian equivalent of New Years (20 March), the Prophet&#x27;s Birthday and Imam Sadeq (4 June), and the Death of Imam Khomeini (5 June). Additional holidays include The Anniversary of the Uprising Against the Shah (30 January), Ashoura (11 February), Victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution (20 January), Sizdah-Bedar—Public Outing Day to end Nowrooz (1 April), and Islamic Republic Day (2 April).

==Wedding ceremonies==

There are two stages in a typical wedding ritual in Iran. Sometimes, both phases take place in one day. The first stage is known as &quot;Aghd&quot;, which is basically the legal component of marriage in Iran. In this process, the bride and groom, as well as their respective guardians, sign a marriage contract. This phase usually takes place in the bride&#x27;s home. After this legal process is over, the second phase, &quot;Jashn-e Aroosi&quot; takes place. In this step, which is basically the wedding reception, where actual feasts and celebrations are held, typically lasts from about 3–7 days. The ceremony takes place in a decorated room with flowers and a beautifully decorated spread on the floor. This spread is typically passed down from mother to daughter and is composed of very nice fabric such as &quot;Termeh&quot; (cashmere), &quot;Atlas&quot; (gold embroidered satin), or &quot;Abrisham&quot; (silk).

Items are placed on this spread: a mirror (of fate), two candelabras (representing the bride and groom and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy seeds, wild rice, angelica, salt, nigella seeds, black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play specific roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)—which helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) are placed on the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom&#x27;s head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones—which are ground above the bride and groom&#x27;s head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a cup of honey (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom&#x27;s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple&#x27;s Holy Book (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God&#x27;s blessing for the couple.
An early age in marriage—especially for brides—is a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.

==Persian rugs==

In Iran, Persian rugs have always been a vital part of the Persian culture.

Iranians were some of the first people in history to weave carpets. First deriving from the notion of basic need, the Persian rug started out as a simple/pure weave of fabric that helped nomadic people living in ancient Iran stay warm from the cold, damp ground. As time progressed, the complexity and beauty of rugs increased to a point where rugs are now bought as decorative pieces.
Because of the long history of fine silk and wool rug weaving in Iran, Persian rugs are world-renowned as some of the most beautiful, intricately designed rugs available. Around various places in Iran, rugs seem to be some of the most prized possessions of the local people. Iran currently produces more rugs and carpets than all other countries in the world put together.

==Modern culture==

===Cinema===
With 300 international awards in the past 10 years, Iranian films continue to be celebrated worldwide. The best known Persian directors are Abbas Kiarostami, Majid Majidi, Jafar Panahi and Asghar Farhadi.

===Contemporary art===

There is a resurgence of interest in Iranian contemporary artists and in artists from the larger Iranian diaspora. Key notables include Shirin Aliabadi, Mohammed Ehsai, Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, Golnaz Fathi, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, Parastou Forouhar, Pouran Jinchi, Farhad Moshiri, Shirin Neshat, Parviz Tanavoli, Y. Z. Kami, and Charles Hossein Zenderoudi.

===Cuisine===
Cuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: nan and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called &quot;tenurs&quot;). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. One of the most popular of which includes yoghurt (&quot;mast&quot;)—which has a specific fermentation process that is widely put to use amongst most Iranians. In addition, mast is used to make soup and is vital in the production of oil. In addition to these dairy products, Iranian cuisine involves a lot of dishes cooked from rice. Some popular rice dishes include boiled rice with a variety of ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and seasonings (&quot;plov&quot;) including dishes like chelo-horesh, shish kebab with rice, chelo-kebab, rice with lamb, meatballs with rice, and kofte (plain boiled rice). In addition, Iranian cuisine is famous for its sweets. One of the most famous of which includes &quot;baklava&quot; with almonds, cardamom, and egg yolks. Iranian sweets typically involve the use of honey, cinnamon, lime juice, and sprouted wheat grain. One very popular dessert drink in Iran, &quot;sherbet sharbat-portagal&quot;, is made from a mixture of orange peel and orange juice boiled in thin sugar syrup and diluted with rose water. Just like the people of many Middle Eastern countries the most preferred drink of the people of Iran is tea (without milk) or &quot;kakhve-khana&quot;.

==Sports==

* The game of polo originated with Iranian tribes in ancient times and was regularly seen throughout the country until the revolution of 1979 when it became associated with the monarchy. It continues to be played, but only in rural areas and discreetly. Recently, as of 2005, it has been gaining more attention. In March 2006, there was a highly publicized tournament and all significant matches are now televised.
* The Iranian Zoor Khaneh

==Women in Persian culture==
Since the 1979 Revolution, Iranian women have lost almost all their rights that was gained in 1962 under the rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Many restrictive and legal measures are imposed since 1979, including mandatory Hijab. By law, women&#x27;s testimony in court is worth half of that of men under the rule of the Islamic Regime, the age of marriage is 9, and marital rape is legal. Women cannot leave the country without the formal permission of their guardians (father or husband). They cannot run for presidency or become a judge. This is a striking change from the full and equal rights that women enjoyed during the Pahlavi era. The Iranian women who had gained confidence and higher education during the Pahlavi era participated in demonstrations against the Shah to topple the monarchy. The culture of education for women was very strongly established by the time of revolution so that even after the revolution, large numbers of women entered civil service and higher education. Even though Islamic Republic pushed back hard on women&#x27;s rights, Iranian women have been at the forefront of progress, education and battle for freedom. In 1996 fourteen women were elected to the Islamic Consultative Assembly. In 2003, Iran&#x27;s first female judge during the Pahlavi era, Shirin Ebadi, won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in promoting human rights.

According to a UNESCO world survey, at the primary level of enrolment Iran has the highest female to male ratio in the world among sovereign nations, with a female to male ratio of 1.22 : 1.00. By 1999, Iran had 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of books and magazines published by women. As of 2005, 65% of Iran&#x27;s university students and 43% of its salaried workers were women. and as of early 2007 nearly 70% of Iran&#x27;s science and engineering students are women. This has led to many female school and university graduates being under-utilized. This is beginning to have an effect on Iranian society and was a contributing factor to protests by Iranian youth in various times over the past few decades.

During recent decades, Iranian women have had significant presence in Iran&#x27;s scientific movement, art movement, literary new wave and contemporary Iranian cinema. Women account for 60% of all students in the natural sciences, including one in five PhD students.

==Traditional holidays/celebrations==
Iranians celebrate the following days based on a solar calendar, in addition to important religious days of Islamic and Shia calendars, which are based on a lunar calendar.
* Nowruz (Iranian New Year) – Starts from 21 March
* Sizdah be dar (Nature Day)
* Jashn-e-Tirgan (Water Festival)
* Jashn-e-Sadeh (Fire Festival)
* Jashn-e-Mehregan (Autumn Festival)
* Shab-e-Yalda (Winter Feast)
* Charshanbeh Suri

==Traditional cultural inheritors of the old Persia==


Like the Persian carpet that exhibits numerous colors and forms in a dazzling display of warmth and creativity, Persian culture is the glue that bonds the peoples of western and central Asia. The South Caucasus and Central Asia &quot;occupy an important place in the historical geography of Persian civilization.&quot; Much of the region was included in the pre-Islamic Persian empires, and many of its ancient peoples either belonged to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European peoples (e.g. Medes and Soghdians), or were in close cultural contact with them (e.g. the Armenians). In the words of Iranologist Richard Nelson Frye:
The Culture of Persia has thus developed over several thousand years. But historically, the peoples of what are now Iran, Kurdistan Region, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Eastern Georgia, and Afghanistan are related to one another as part of the larger group of peoples of the Greater Iranian cultural and historical sphere. The Northern Caucasus is well within the sphere of influence of Persian culture as well, as can be seen from the many remaining relics, ruins, and works of literature from that region.

==Contributions to humanity in ancient history==

<text>Hydrophilidae, also known colloquially as water scavenger beetles, is a family of beetles. Aquatic hydrophilids are notable for their long maxillary palps, which are longer than their antennae. Several of the former subfamilies of Hydrophilidae have recently been removed and elevated to family rank; Epimetopidae, Georissidae (= Georyssidae), Helophoridae, Hydrochidae, and Spercheidae. While the majority of hydrophilids are aquatic, around a third of described species are terrestrial, mostly belonging to the subfamily Sphaeridiinae.

With rare exceptions, the larvae are predatory while the adults may be herbivores or predators in addition to scavenging. Many species are able to produce sounds.

Species of &quot;Hydrophilus&quot; are reported as pests in fish hatcheries. Other species are voracious consumers of mosquito larvae, and have potential as biological control agents.

This beetle family contains 2,835 species in 169 genera.

== Geography ==
Hydrophilid beetles are found worldwide. In the Americas, they are usually found in areas of high humidity such as the tropics of Central and South America. They can also be found in rain pools and ponds in the forests of Guatemala and Argentina. They also tend to exist in North America in areas with seasonal wetlands or lakes depending on the state. &quot;Hydrophilus triangularis&quot; is found widely throughout the United States and is the biggest water beetle in the country. The family Hydrophilidae has been reported in every state in the United States.

The oldest known fossils definitively assignable to the family are from the Late Jurassic Solnhofen of Germany and Talbragar Fish Bed in Australia.

== Habitat ==
A majority of the beetles in the family Hydrophilidae live in aquatic environments in both their larval and adult life stages. Some hydrophilid beetles will lay their eggs in ephemeral ponds and puddles where the larvae will live as they develop. Other beetles such as &quot;Derralus angustus&quot; and &quot;Tropisternus setiger&quot; live in permanent ponds. Some beetles such as &quot;Tropisternus lateralis&quot; will only live in aquatic environments that lack fish because fish prey on their eggs, while others like &quot;D. angustus&quot; prefer aquatic habitats with a specific species of floating fern. Generally, hydrophilids live in marshy, shallow, and heavily weeded aquatic environments. There are some hydrophilid beetles that make their homes in fresh animal waste, decaying vegetation, or humus-rich soil. They survive in a very wide variety of locations and because of that some types are more adapted to specific environments than others and will often only move to habitats of the same type.

== Physiology ==
Reproduction in hydrophilids takes place in bodies of water such as ponds. In the larval stage the beetle resides in a shallow area of the pond because they are dependent on the oxygen only available in the shallower areas. After the beetle exits the pupa stage they often take flight and move to a new area before they reproduce. Wing growth depends on the environment that the beetle resides in. Beetles in lentic habitats have better wing development compared to lotic habitats because lentic habitats are less reliable and require the beetles to disperse quicker in order to survive. Some beetles such as &quot;Berosus&quot; larvae can inhabit areas deeper in the water due to their thoracic gills while others like &quot;Berosus ingeminatus&quot; use cutaneous respiration allowing them to hold air for longer periods of time. The ability to consume oxygen at deeper water levels helps them avoid being preyed upon from surface predators. Larvae use two main types of feeding mechanism, chewing and piercing-sucking, with the latter evolving at least three times independently in Hydrophilidae and once in Epimetopidae and allowing underwater extra-oral digestion, decreasing dependence on aerial environments.
Adult hydrophilid beetles can survive in deeper areas of water and stay under for longer due to their special abilities in acquiring oxygen. They can hold air bubbles under their elytra that connect to their spiracles for them to use the trapped oxygen. They also have many fine hairs along their bodies that can trap oxygen. They can pull oxygen from the water into these areas on their body so that they can avoid returning to the surface for long periods of time. They only return to the surface when they need to replace the air they have acquired.

== Reproduction ==
Some species of hydrophilid beetles in the genus &quot;Tropisternus&quot; have complex methods of signaling and communication including chirps, clicks, buzzing, and various body postures. These behaviors can assist in courtship. Courtship behaviors have been observed in &quot;Tropisternus ellipticus&quot; in which the females produced audible buzzing and shaking to rebuff potential suitors. In response to the rejection maneuvers of the female, male &quot;T. ellipticus&quot; will mimic the buzzing and shaking, often learning from repeated encounters of this kind to avoid females that produce these behaviors. Males may remember these encounters for up to 39 minutes when properly reinforced, which suggests that they have some capability for recording short-term memory. Typical courtship in these beetles consists of the following steps:

1. The male approaches the female, buzzing and swimming around her.

2. If the female is receptive, she will either chirp in response and move toward the male or remain still and silent. No rejection behavior occurs at this time.

3. The male approaches further and mounts the female.

4. The male will touch his maxillary palps to that of the female while producing a buzzing sound.

5. If the female does not rebuff his advances, the male with move to the back and probe the abdomen of the female with his aedeagus.

6. If she is receptive, the female must lower her abdomen for the male to penetrate.

Males mount other beetles indiscriminately, and homosexual copulation has been known to occur.

&quot;Anacaena lutescens&quot;, a species of hydrophilid beetle, has been observed as reproducing via parthenogenesis. Reproduction by parthenogenesis is relatively uncommon in other types of insects.

== Life stages ==
In &quot;Enochrus quadripunctatus&quot;, a species of hydrophilid beetle, it takes an average of 43 days for a newly hatched larva to reach its adult form. Juvenile mortality is high in this species, decreasing with each successive instar.

Females will bury their silken egg case in the damp soil near a stream. Typically, the female will only create and lay one egg case per day, though they may create up to 20 egg cases in the weeks following a mating event and each case may produce from 1–32 individual larva. Females who have not mated will still create egg cases, but they will typically be empty or will not hatch at all. Not all egg cases laid by a mated female will hatch and produce viable offspring, but 42–70% will. Larval forms are carnivorous and may exhibit cannibalism among the individuals in a single egg case before hatching. The eggs begin to hatch an average of eight days after being laid. The egg hatches by way of the larvae eating their way out of the casing, usually by way of the lid. This process can take several days in some instances. Once the egg hatches, the first instar larvae will disperse, but will continue to feed on one another if the opportunity presents itself. They will remain in the first instar form for an average of 9.5 days before progressing to the second instar. Second instar individuals are much more robust, and voraciously feed on what meat they can find. They are strong swimmers at this stage and can be found at or beneath the surface of the stream. After an average of 11 days, they will transition to their third instar form. The third instar will last an average of 8.4 days, during which the larvae will continue feeding and become progressively slower as they reach their pupation stage. When they are ready to pupate, the larva will burrow into the sand where they will remain for 14 days before emerging as an adult. After vacating their burrow, the new adult will stand on the sand for up to 24 hours to allow its carapace to harden. Once fully hardened, the new fully grown adult beetle will travel to the water to hunt, where it will remain for the rest of its life.

Although individuals of each species of hydrophilid (even those within the same genus) may vary in the duration of each of these life stages, mortality rates at each stage, and the number of offspring produced, few studies have been done to this effect on other species of hydrophilid.

== Diet ==
Larval hydrophilids are predatory by nature and different species have different food consumption habits. The larvae usually ingest small invertebrates and snails but have been known to also eat small fish and tadpoles. &quot;Berosus ingeminatus&quot; prey mostly on &quot;Cricotopus sylvestris&quot; and other types of midges while &quot;Tropisternus setiger&quot; are tactile hunters and will eat whatever prey comes their way; they may even abandon a meal for a new one if the opportunity arises. The predatory habits of this species are often left behind in the larval stage. Generally adult hydrophilids feed on various vegetation, alive or decaying, and will occasionally eat dead animal tissue.

== Predators ==
Hydrophilids have many predators from a range of different species. Fish, birds, predaceous insects, and turtles are the main predators in their aquatic environments. Humans have also been known to eat hydrophilid beetles.

== Behavior ==

=== Acoustic behavior ===
Member of the genus &quot;Tropisternus&quot; have been shown to perform acoustic sounds in their communicative behavior. Specific calls include stress calls, a male courtship call, a male copulating sound, and a female rejection buzz. The sound production comes from the friction created by the beetle rubbing its spectrum (a well- defined ridge or lip) to its finely ridged surface called a pars stridens on the beetle&#x27;s underside.

=== Predatory behavior ===
Larval hydrophilids hunt a wide variety of prey such as copepods, mosquito larvae, snails, and conspecifics. The larvae have a unique way of hunting by lifting their prey out of the water to consume it. The reason for this is not well known, but there is a suggestion that lifting the prey makes it more difficult for the prey to escape. In addition to lifting their prey out of the water, hydrophilid larvae choose specific vegetation to wait in so that they may ambush their prey. In addition, the larvae often change ambush sites according to prey density. The frequency is directly correlated to the amount of prey in the ambush areas and specific attack sites.

== Subfamilies ==
The classification to subfamilies and tribes was revised by Short and Fikáček in 2013:
* Acidocerinae (revised by Girón and Short )
*Chaetarthriinae
*Cylominae (as Rygmodinae in; see )
*Enochrinae
*Hydrophilinae
* Sphaeridiinae

<doc id="965241" wikidata="Q6763513" url="?curid=965241" title="Marilyn Churley">
<text>Marilyn Churley (born May 7, 1948) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2005 who represented the downtown Toronto ridings of Riverdale and Toronto—Danforth. She served as a cabinet minister in the Bob Rae government. In opposition she served as her party&#x27;s critic for the Environment, Women&#x27;s Issues and Democratic Renewal. She resigned from the legislature to run for the federal New Democratic Party. Churley was her party&#x27;s candidate for the riding of Beaches—East York in 2006 and 2008, but was defeated both times.

==Background==
Churley was born in Old Perlican, Newfoundland in 1948. Her parents were Eddie Churley and Myrtis Emberley. Shortly after being born the family moved to Happy Valley, Labrador where her father worked as a cook at Goose Bay Air Force Base. She moved to the Downtown Toronto neighbourhood of Riverdale in 1978. She has served as a director of the Co-op Housing Federation of Toronto, and was a co-founder of the Bain Avenue Day Care Centre. Among other community commitments, Churley was also a director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Toronto.

In 1968, she gave birth to a son, Billy (Bill Boertjes), whom she placed for adoption. She later reconnected with him in 1997, as described in her 2015 book &quot;Shameless&quot;. She also has a daughter, Astra Crosby, born in 1974. Churley&#x27;s experience with adoption and the search for her son led her to advocate for adoption disclosure reform. Through the 1990s, she introduced several Private Member&#x27;s Bills to facilitate the process of locating children placed for adoption. None of these passed. Subsequently, she was a strong supporter of a similar bill introduced by Sandra Pupatello. This bill later became the Adoption Information Disclosure Act.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
Churley was elected to the Toronto City Council in 1988. She defeated longtime alderman Fred Beavis in the downtown riding of Riverdale. She was involved in a number of Toronto council initiatives, including the energy efficiency office, the &quot;Clean Up the Don&quot; movement (with fellow city councillors Jack Layton and Barbara Hall) and police patrols on bicycle.

===In government===
Churley was elected as a New Democrat in the riding of Riverdale in the provincial election of 1990. The NDP won a majority government in this election and she briefly serving as a Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of the Environment. On 18 March 1991, Churley was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations after the previous minister, Peter Kormos was fired by Bob Rae for a series of political blunders. Churley remained in this position throughout the Rae government&#x27;s mandate. In cabinet, Churley opposed attempts to reduce social assistance to single mothers, and only accepted the introduction of casino gambling with reluctance.

Toronto singer/songwriter Kurt Swinghammer wrote a song called &quot;The Signature of Marilyn Churley&quot;, inspired by Churley&#x27;s signature on an elevator license dating from her term in the Rae cabinet.

===Cabinet positions===

===In opposition===
Rae&#x27;s government lost the provincial election of 1995, and Churley was one of seventeen NDP members to retain a seat in the legislature. In opposition, she worked to force the government of Mike Harris to keep the Riverdale Hospital open, stopped the closure of 11 schools, and forced the government to cap tax increases for small business. She also served as Deputy Speaker of the legislature from October 1997 to October 1998.

In the provincial election of 1999, she was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Broadview—Greenwood. Churley became deputy leader of the NDP in 2001, following the retirement of Frances Lankin from the legislature. In the by-election to replace Lankin, the Liberals nominated Greenpeace co-founder and popular television personality Bob Hunter to run for them against former East York mayor Michael Prue for the NDP. During the race, Churley denounced Hunter for having written a novel with first-person accounts of encounters with child prostitutes in Bangkok. The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; quoted Ms. Churley as saying: &quot;It says something about Bob Hunter&#x27;s character he could write such nasty, disgusting stuff about young girls in Thailand.&quot; Hunter claimed that the story was written as satire, and sued both Churley and Prue for slander. The suit was withdrawn after the by-election, which Prue won.

Churley was easily re-elected for a fourth term in 2003. After the election, when the NDP lost official party status in the Legislature, Churley threatened to legally change her surname to &quot;Churley-NDP&quot; so that the Speaker would be forced to say NDP when recognizing her in the House. A compromise was later reached which made this change unnecessary, and the party regained official status when Andrea Horwath won a 2004 by-election.

==Federal politics==
Churley was a prominent supporter of Jack Layton in his bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 2002. This position put her at odds with party leader Howard Hampton, who supported Bill Blaikie.

In May 2005, Churley announced that once a federal election was called she would resign her Toronto—Danforth seat at the provincial legislature and run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Since Toronto-Danforth is Layton&#x27;s seat in the federal parliament, Churley sought to represent the neighbouring riding of Beaches—East York. However, Churley could not overcome accusations of being a parachute candidate, despite living only a few miles away from the Beaches—East York riding, and was defeated in the January 23, 2006 election by incumbent Liberal Maria Minna in a hard fought contest.

On February 9, 2007, at a fundraiser in Toronto, Churley clarified that she would be seeking the nomination in Beaches—East York for a potential federal election in 2007. Two months later, Churley was renominated as the NDP candidate in that riding. She was again defeated by Maria Minna in the 2008 election.

== Electoral record ==

==Later life==
Churley was a regular guest on &quot;The Michael Coren Show&quot;, a current events television program on CTS. She was appointed a justice of the peace on October 14, 2009.

In 2015, she published her memoirs, entitled &quot;Shameless: The Fight for Adoption Disclosure and the Search for My Son&quot; which highlights the birth of her son, putting him up for adoption, and her subsequent fight to become reunited with him.

<text>The Spanish dancer, scientific name Hexabranchus sanguineus (literally meaning &quot;blood-colored six-gills&quot;), is a dorid nudibranch, a very large and colorful sea slug, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Hexabranchidae.The taxonomy of the genus &quot;Hexabranchus&quot; has been controversial but a thorough molecular and morphological study published in 2023 showed that the name &quot;H. sanguineus&quot; was being used for at least 5 distinct species.

==Description==
&quot;Hexabranchus sanguineus&quot; is a large dorid nudibranch which commonly grows up to a maximum length of 25 cm, with some reports to 40 cm in the Red Sea.
All &quot;Hexabranchus&quot; species have soft, flattened bodies, the anterior dorsal portion has a pair of retractable rhinophores and the posterior part has six contractile gills inserted independently in the body. The pair of oral tentacles are constituted by a fine flexible membrane provided with large digital lobes.

In a normal situation when the animal is crawling, the edges of its mantle are curled upwards creating a peripheral blister. If the animal is disturbed, it unfolds its edges and can swim through contractions and undulations of the body to move away from the disturbing element. Its common name, Spanish dancer, comes from this particular defense.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is reported from the Red Sea, the Western Indian Ocean, French Polynesia and the Western Pacific, with different colour morphs in each region which are not differentiated by morphology or DNA barcodes.

It likes rocky and coral reefs with many sponges and shelters from 1 to 50 meters deep.

==Biology==
During daytime, the Spanish dancer hides away from the light in the crevices of its natural habitat to only come out late at night.
It feeds on various species of sponge.
Like all nudibranchs, it is hermaphrodite and its bright red to pink egg ribbon has a spiral shape related to the size of the animal so relatively large. The Spanish Dancer consumes sponges from the family Halichondriidae. Once consumed, the Spanish Dancer derives a potent chemical that it can use as defense. &quot;Hexabranchus sanguineus&quot; then passes the defensive compounds obtained into its egg ribbons via macrolides, giving the physically defenseless egg ribbons a toxin defense. The latter is coveted by some other species of nudibranch as &quot; Favorinus tsuruganus &quot; or &quot; Favorinus japonicus&quot;.
The emperor shrimp, &quot;Periclimenes imperator&quot;, is a commensal shrimp that is commonly found living on &quot;Hexabranchus sanguineus&quot;.

<doc id="965249" wikidata="Q495838" url="?curid=965249" title="Farewell Spit">
<text>Farewell Spit () is a narrow sand spit at the northern end of the Golden Bay, in the South Island of New Zealand. The spit includes around of stable land and another of mobile sand spit running eastwards from Cape Farewell, the northern-most point of the South Island. Farewell Spit is the longest sand spit in New Zealand, and is a legally protected Nature Reserve. The area is designated as a Ramsar wetland site and an East Asian–Australasian Flyway Shorebird Network site. Farewell Spit is administered by the Department of Conservation as a seabird and wildlife reserve. Apart from a small area at the base of the spit, it is closed to the public except through organised tours. Conservation initiatives are in progress towards eliminating mammalian predators from Farewell Spit, including a proposal for a predator-proof fence.

The spit has been the site of many shipwrecks and vessel strandings, particularly in the era of merchant sailing vessels. A lighthouse with a tower constructed from timber was established on the end of the spit in 1870 to warn mariners of the dangers of the shoals and currents near the spit. The timbers of the original lighthouse did not last, and the entire lighthouse was replaced in 1897 using a steel lattice tower.

The spit is also known for herd strandings of long-finned pilot whales, and has been described as a ‘whale trap’ because of its protruding coastlines and long, gently sloping beaches.

==Toponymy==
The Māori name for the spit is &quot;Onetahua&quot;, translated as &quot;heaped up sand&quot;.

Abel Tasman in 1642 was the first European to see the spit, calling it &quot;Sand Duining Hoeck&quot;. Captain James Cook was the next European visitor in 1770, showing Farewell Spit as a broad peninsula on his maps. He named close-by Cape Farewell, and the name stuck, with early European settlers originally calling the sandbanks &#x27;Cape Farewell Spit&#x27; before it was shortened to its present name. It was the last land Cook sighted after leaving New Zealand for Australia at the end of his first voyage.

==Geography==

Farewell Spit forms the northern side of Golden Bay and is the longest sandspit in New Zealand, including around of stable land and another of mobile sand spit. The spit runs from west to east, and is formed from fine golden-coloured quartz sands, derived from the erosion of granites and other rocks in the Southern Alps, and transported northwards along the West Coast by longshore drift with the Westland current.

The area of the spit is about . Approximately is above mean high water, with an intertidal zone of about . The spit is located about north of Tākaka and from Collingwood. The small settlement of Pūponga is situated close to the western (landward) end of the spit.

The sand structures of Farewell Spit consist of two interacting systems. On the southern side of the spit there are older and relatively stable sand masses, separated by shallow lakes and swamps. On the northern side are more recent sand masses that undergo active erosion and accumulation as a result of winds and the deposition from the longshore current. Sand dunes known as barchans are formed on the spit because of the influence of winds predominantly from the west, and these dunes move in an easterly direction. The downwind face is steep and has a crescent shape.

The northern side of the dunes are steeper and unstable being constantly exposed to the prevailing winds that average over . The southern side that faces Golden Bay is more stable and largely covered with vegetation. The tide here can recede as much as exposing some of mud flats; a rich feeding ground for the many seabirds in the area but also a trap for whales that leads to herd strandings.

==Climate==

==Protected area==
Farewell Spit is a legally protected area of Crown property, and is classified as a nature reserve under s20 of the Reserves Act 1977. The spit was originally established as a Flora and Fauna Reserve in 1938. In 1980, the status was altered to nature reserve, and the adjacent inter-tidal zone designated as a wildlife sanctuary. Access into the nature reserve is by permit only, but walkers are allowed on the first of the spit.

Farewell Spit was designated as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention in 1976, when the convention came into effect in New Zealand. In 2000, to recognise the importance of the site to migratory birds, Farewell Spit was designated an East Asian–Australasian Flyway Shorebird Network Site. New Zealand became a partner in the East Asian – Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) in September 2011.

==Birds==
Farewell Spit provides a wide variety of habitat for birds, including ocean sand beaches, bare and vegetated sand dunes, salt marshes, and lakes both freshwater and brackish. These habitats support internationally important numbers of bar-tailed godwit, red knot, ruddy turnstone and banded dotterel, as well as the endemic variable and South Island pied oystercatchers. The dunes at the end of the spit support the only sea-level colony of Australasian gannets in the world. The eelgrass (Zostera) beds on the tidal flats are used by the largest moulting population of black swans in New Zealand. In 2014, an area of at Farewell Spit was recognised as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

===Shorebirds===
A study of shorebirds in the top of the South Island, commissioned by the Nelson City and Tasman District councils, was published in 2013. This study reported that from 2006 to 2009, the population of coastal shorebirds found in the estuaries in the top of the South Island represented between 14 and 22% of the total New Zealand shorebird population. Over the period of one year, between 45% and 66% of shorebirds in the study region were found at Farewell Spit. During summer, there is an average of about 29,000 shorebirds at Farewell Spit, representing 10.2% of the national population. During winter (June), there is an average of 8,500 birds, representing 6.5% of the national population, and in spring (November) there is an average of 20,000, representing 13.2% of the national population. Farewell Spit typically has more than 20,000 shorebirds present during summer and spring, and this meets the criteria for recognition under Ramsar Convention Criterion 5 as a wetland site of international importance.

During spring and summer, migratory waders make up a large proportion of the shorebirds at Farewell Spit (up to 93% during spring). Farewell Spit is a site of international importance for migratory bar-tailed godwits. Surveys have found an average of 11,872 godwits are present in the summer period, representing 9.1% of the total estimated numbers of this species in the flyway. 

Farewell Spit is also of international importance for shorebirds such as the South Island pied oyster-catcher. Surveys have found an average of 6,980 of these birds during summer, representing 7% of the estimated national population. The spit is also an important wintering area and a site of international importance for the banded dotterel.

===Australasian gannets===
A breeding colony of Australasian gannets was identified at Farewell Spit in 1983. The size of the colony increased from 75 nests in 1983 to 3,060 nests in 2001, and a 2006 survey recorded 3,300 pairs. The breeding area comprises several discrete sub-colonies at the end of the spit, around 30 minutes walk past the lighthouse. The breeding colonies are only a few metres above sea level, and this is unusual because gannet colonies are usually well above sea level on high, stable rock formations. In January 1997, three of the sub-colonies were completely washed away during Cyclone Drena. In most years, some of the colonies are washed over during very high tides or major storms. In 2022, there were 10,000 birds in the colony.

===Other seabirds===
Other seabirds that nest on shellbanks on Farewell Spit include Caspian terns and white-fronted terns.

===Waterfowl===
Farewell Spit has been identified as the largest moulting site for black swans in the country, with up to 15% of the total population present between November and March. Significant numbers of Australasian shoveler have also been reported.

==Conservation initiatives==

Farewell Spit was leased for grazing from around the 1850s, and extensive damage to vegetation was caused by grazing and fires. In 1938, the area was given protection and designated as a sanctuary. However, wild cattle remained in the area, and 258 were removed in the 1970s.

The adjoining Puponga Farm was originally purchased by the Crown to serve primarily as a buffer zone to protect the Farewell Spit Nature Reserve. Later purchases of Whararaki and Cape Farewell Farms helped to create a viable farm management unit, conserve biological and landscape values, and provide opportunities for public recreation. Puponga Farm Park serves as a visitor management and servicing area for the Farewell Spit Nature Reserve.

As at 2021, there are still feral pigs on Farewell Spit, and these animals are a significant threat to nesting birds. The Onetahua Restoration project has been launched with the aim of eradicating pests from Whanganui Inlet on the West Coast, all the way to Farewell Spit, covering an area of more than . The project is a joint initiative between Farewell Wharariki HealthPost Nature Trust, Tasman Environmental Trust and Manawhenua ki Mohua. In 2022, a proposal was developed for a predator-proof fence along the base of the spit.

==Lighthouse==

The Farewell Spit Lighthouse at the end of the spit was first lit on 17 June 1870 in response to many ships having been wrecked upon the spit. The original timber tower did not stand up well to the frequent blasting by the sand and salt-laden winds experienced at the end of the spit. The hardwood used started to decay rapidly and the original tower was replaced in 1897 by the present structure, the only steel latticework lighthouse in New Zealand.

The foundations of the lighthouse are only just above sea level, so the lighthouse tower has to be taller than usual for other lighthouses around New Zealand&#x27;s coast. The light of the tower can be seen for . The light was fully automated and the last lighthouse keeper was withdrawn in 1984. The lighthouse keeper&#x27;s house and two accommodation buildings are still being maintained for use by the Department of Conservation, Maritime New Zealand, and tour groups.

==Tourism==
Four-wheel drive bus tours from Collingwood or Pūponga are operated by concession-holders. These tours provide an opportunity to view the large sand dunes, visit the lighthouse area and the gannet colony.

==Shipwrecks==

Farewell Spit has been the site of many shipwrecks and vessel strandings, particularly in the era of merchant sailing vessels. Most of these incidents occurred when a vessel became grounded on sand in shallow water near the Spit either through navigational errors or being driven ashore in adverse weather. Particularly notable losses include the that ran aground off Farewell Spit in 1877 and the that was sunk by a mine 17 km off the spit in 1917.

==Whale stranding==

Farewell Spit has been the location of many herd strandings of long-finned pilot whales, and has been described as a ‘whale trap’, because of its protruding coastlines and long, gently sloping beaches.

<text>Li Ting (; born April 1, 1987) is a Chinese diver. She competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics, earning a gold medal in the women&#x27;s 10 meter synchronized platform diving along with her team partner Lao Lishi.

==Early life==
Li was born on 1 April 1987 along with her twin sister Li Rao (李嬈) in Lingui County in Guilin to a family of Dong ethnic minority. Both the sisters fell in love with diving after witnessing their elder sister train in diving in Lingui.

==Sports career==
In 1993, Li Ting and Li Rao, who were five years old, began to receive diving training at Chengguan No. 2 Primary School in Lingui County. In 1994, after their athletic prowess in diving was recognized, they were sent for formal training to the Guangxi Diving School in Guilin and became members of the provincial squad a year later. They were selected for the Chinese national squad in 1999.

In the 2000 National Diving Championships, she and Li Rao won the women&#x27;s 10-meter platform championship. In 2001, the sisters teamed up to represent Guangxi in the 9th National Games in Guangzhou and won bronze medal in the women&#x27;s synchronized 10-meter platform event. On the same year, the sisters won gold medals in the women&#x27;s synchronized 10-meter platform championships in Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. In 2002, at the 14th Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, she won the gold medal with Duan Qing in the 10-metre synchro event.

In 2003, Li Ting and Lao Lishi won the women&#x27;s synchronized 10-meter platform championship at the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain. A year later, the two teamed up again to win a gold medal for China in the synchronized 10 metre platform event at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In the same year, they also won the women&#x27;s synchronized 10-meter platform championship at the 14th Diving World Cup in Athens.

In 2005, after the 2004 Summer Olympics, Li switched to the 3-meter springboard event and replaced Wu Minxia, forming a partnership with Guo Jingjing. At the 10th National Games in Nanjing, China, she finished second in the double 3-meter springboard event, finishing behind Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia. At the 2005 Summer Universiade held in İzmir, Turkey, Li won gold medals in the 10 m platform event, and platform and springboard synchro events. On the same year, Li and Guo won the women&#x27;s synchronized 3-meter springboard championships at the FINA Diving Grand Prix in Canada and the United States but finished second in the German FINA Diving Grand Prix. In 2006, Li and Guo won gold medal in the synchronized 3-meter springboard event at the 15th Asian Games in Doha, Qatar and on the same year, she won the 3-metre synchro springboard championship at the 15th Diving World Cup in Changshu, China. In terms of individual events, Li Ting ranked second behind Guo Jingjing three times in the international FINA Grand Prix events. It was only in the absence of Guo Jingjing in the 2005 FINA Grand Prix in the United States that she defeated Wu Minxia and won her first international championship in the individual event. However, in the FINA Diving Grand Prix finals held at the end of 2006, Li and Guo unexpectedly failed and only finished third. At the same time, Wu Minxia defeated Guo Jingjing four times in individual events. Such excellent results helped Wu regain her position as a partner with Guo Jingjing and the duo continued to win in all subsequent competitions. Li Ting had no choice but to switch to individual events, which were not her strong point, and partnered with newcomer He Zi.

In 2007, Li Ting defeated He Zi in 3-metre springboard final at the FINA Diving Grand Prix in Zhuhai, China and at the 2007 Summer Universiade in Bangkok, Thailand, Li won gold medal in the 3 m springboard event and silver medal in the springboard synchro event. In the same year, she and He Zi won the gold medal in the 3-meter springboard synchro at the FINA Diving Grand Prix in Spain. However, this pair, who had the potential to challenge the Olympic champion duo Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia, made a rare mistake at the 2008 Summer Olympics diving trials in Foshan, China. During the trials, He Zi jumped 401B instead of 201B and was given zero points. As a result of this mistake, this put both Li and He in a very disadvantageous position in the trials and in the end, they were not selected for the national squad in the 16th Diving World Cup and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Due to her not being selected for the Olympics, she faded into obscurity.

Between 2008 and 2009, Li Ting was troubled by a back injury and spent most of her time recovering in Beijing. Due to stress fracture on her leg, she had to undergo surgery but the healing was slow. As a result, she retired from professional diving. She made a brief comeback at the 2011 National Diving Championships held in Tianjin, China, where she attained sixth position in the 1-meter springboard before fading into obscurity again.

==Later life==
In 2006, during her diving career, she enrolled at Renmin University of China and graduated in 2012 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Business Management. That same year, she also began studying graduate degree in Sports Management at Beijing Sport University. Additionally, she joined the Chinese Communist Party and was elected as a delegate of Guangxi to attend the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012. After completion of her graduate degree, Li Ting attended University of Minnesota as a visiting scholar for nine months from 2014 to 2015. In 2019, she was enshrined into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, United States. In 2022, she was elected again as the delegate of Guangxi to attend the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and on the same year, she became a member of the 11th Standing Committee of the Guangxi Youth Federation and served as the director of the Sports Committee, and was invited to attend the China-Vietnam Youth Friendship Meeting and China-Vietnam Youth Development Forum where spoke as a representative of the Chinese youth. In 2023, she was appointed as one of the ambassadors for the in Nanning, Guangxi.

Li served as the deputy director of the Guangxi Aquatic Sports Development Center, focusing on rebuilding and enhancing diving from both managerial and technical perspectives. Since 2022, she has been serving as the deputy director of the Guangxi Competitive Sports Department.

<doc id="965259" wikidata="Q1024878" url="?curid=965259" title="Cable modem termination system">
<text>A cable modem termination system (CMTS, also called a CMTS Edge Router) is a piece of equipment, typically located in a cable company&#x27;s headend or hubsite, which is used to provide data services, such as cable Internet or Voice over IP, to cable subscribers. 

A CMTS provides similar functions to a DSLAM in a digital subscriber line or an optical line termination in a passive optical network.

==Connections==
In order to provide high speed data services, a cable company will connect its headend to the Internet via very high capacity data links to a network service provider. On the subscriber side of the headend, the CMTS enables communication with subscribers&#x27; cable modems. Different CMTSs are capable of serving different cable modem population sizes—ranging from 4,000 cable modems to 150,000 or more, depending in part on traffic and thus number of channels allocated to each service group and the size of the service groups, although it is recommended for an I-CMTS to service, for example, 30,000 subscribers (cable modems). A given headend may have between 1–12 CMTSs to service the cable modem population served by that headend or HFC hub.

One way to think of a CMTS is to imagine a router with Ethernet interfaces (connections) on one side and coaxial cable RF interfaces on the other side. The Ethernet side is known as the Network Side Interface or NSI.

A service group is a group of customers that share communication RF channels and thus bandwidth. A CMTS has separate RF interfaces and connectors for downlink and uplink signals. The RF/coax interfaces carry RF signals to and from coaxial &quot;trunks&quot; connected to subscribers&#x27; cable modems, using one pair of connectors per trunk, one for downlink and the other for uplink. In other words, there can be a pair of RF connectors for every service group, although it is possible to configure a network with different numbers of connectors that service a set of service groups, based on the number of downstream and upstream channels the cable modems in every service group use. Every connector has a finite number of channels it can carry, such as 16 channels per downstream connector, and 4 channels per upstream connector, depending on the CMTS. For example, if the cable modems on every service group use 24 channels for downstream, and 2 channels for upstream, then 3 downstream connectors can service the cable modems on two service groups, and be serviced by 1 upstream connector. A service group may serve up to 500 households. A service group has channels, whose bandwidth is shared among all members of the service group. The channels are later regrouped at the cable headend or distribution hub and serviced by CMTSs and other equipment such as Edge QAMs.

The RF signals from a CMTS, are connected via coaxial cable to headend RF management modules for RF splitting and combining, with other equipment such as other CMTSs so that several CMTS can service one service group, and then to an &quot;optics platform&quot; or headend platform, which has transmitter and receiver modules that turn the RF signals into light pulses for delivery over fiber optics through an HFC network. Examples of optics platforms are the Arris CH3000 and Cisco Prisma II. At the other end of the network, an optical node converts the light pulses into RF signals again and sends them through a coaxial cable &quot;trunk&quot;. The trunk has one or more amplifiers along its length, and on the trunk there are distribution &quot;taps&quot; to which customers&#x27; modems are connected via coaxial cable.

In fact, most CMTSs have both Ethernet interfaces (or other more traditional high-speed data interfaces like SONET) as well as RF interfaces. In this way, traffic that is coming from the Internet can be routed (or bridged) through the Ethernet interface, through the CMTS and then onto the RF interfaces that are connected to the cable company&#x27;s hybrid fiber coax (HFC). The traffic winds its way through the HFC to end up at the cable modem in the subscriber&#x27;s home. Traffic from a subscriber&#x27;s home system goes through the cable modem and out to the Internet in the opposite direction.

CMTSs typically carry only IP traffic. Traffic destined for the cable modem from the Internet, known as downstream traffic, is carried in IP packets encapsulated according to DOCSIS standard. These packets are carried on data streams that are typically modulated onto a TV channel using either 64-QAM or 256-QAM versions of quadrature amplitude modulation.

Upstream data (data from cable modems to the headend or Internet) is carried in Ethernet frames encapsulated inside DOCSIS frames modulated with QPSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM or 128-QAM using TDMA, ATDMA or S-CDMA frequency sharing mechanisms. This is usually done at the &quot;subband&quot; or &quot;return&quot; portion of the cable TV spectrum (also known as the &quot;T&quot; channels), a much lower part of the frequency spectrum than the downstream signal, usually 5–42 MHz in DOCSIS 2.0 or 5–65 MHz in EuroDOCSIS.

A typical CMTS allows a subscriber&#x27;s computer to obtain an IP address by forwarding DHCP requests to the relevant servers. This DHCP server returns, for the most part, what looks like a typical response including an assigned IP address for the computer, gateway/router addresses to use, DNS servers, etc.

The CMTS may also implement some basic filtering to protect against unauthorized users and various attacks. Traffic shaping is sometimes performed to prioritize application traffic, perhaps based upon subscribed plan or download usage and also to provide guaranteed Quality of service (QoS) for the cable operator&#x27;s own PacketCable-based VOIP service. However, the function of traffic shaping is more likely done by a Cable Modem or policy traffic switch. A CMTS may also act as a bridge or router.

A customer&#x27;s cable modem cannot communicate directly with other modems on the line. In general, cable modem traffic is routed to other cable modems or to the Internet through a series of CMTSs and traditional routers. However, a route could conceivably pass through a single CMTS.

A CCAP (Converged Cable Access Platform) combines CMTS and Edge QAM functionality in a single device so that it can provide both data (internet) with CMTS functionality, and video (TV channels) with Edge QAM functionality. Edge QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulator/Modulation) converts video sent via IP (internet protocol) or otherwise, into a QAM signal for delivery over a cable network. Edge QAMs are normally standalone devices placed at the &quot;edge&quot; of a network. They can also be connected to a CMTS core, to make up an M-CMTS system which is more scalable. A CMTS core is normally a conventional or I-CMTS that supports operation as a CMTS core in an M-CMTS system.

==Architectures==
A CMTS can be broken down into several different architectures, Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS), Modular (M-CMTS), Virtual CMTS (vCMTS) and remote CMTS. An I-CMTS incorporates into a single unit all components necessary for its operation. There are both pros and cons to each type of architecture.

===Modular CMTS (M-CMTS)===
In a M-CMTS solution the architecture of an I-CMTS is broken up into two components. The first part is the Physical Downstream component (PHY) which is known as the Edge QAM (EQAM). The second part is the IP networking and DOCSIS MAC Component which is referred to as the M-CMTS Core. There are also several new protocols and components introduced with this type of architecture. One is the DOCSIS Timing Interface, which provides a reference frequency between the EQAM and M-CMTS Core via a DTI Server. The second is the Downstream External PHY Interface (DEPI). The DEPI protocol controls the delivery of DOCSIS
frames from the M-CMTS Core to the EQAM devices Some of the challenges that entail an M-CMTS platform are increased complexity in RF combining and an increase in the number of failure points. One of the benefits of an M-CMTS architecture is that it is extremely scalable to larger numbers of downstream channels.

===Virtual CMTS===
Virtual CCAPs (vCCAPs) or virtual CMTSs (vCMTSs) are implemented on commercial off the shelf x86-based servers with specialized software, and can be used to increase service capacity without purchasing new CMTS/CCAP chassis, or add features to the CMTS/CCAP more quickly.

===Remote CMTS===
Remote CMTS/Remote CCAP moves all CMTS/CCAP functionality to the outside plant, in stark contrast to conventional CMTSs or CCAPs which are installed at a service provider location.

<text>Lucky Seven is a fast game of competitive solitaire, played with coasters using luck and points . It may be played by any number of players, and is usually played solitaire.

The game was designed by Martin H. Samuel when in Zurich, Switzerland. The simple central game mechanic is a mathematical formula known as a strange loop.

Great American Puzzle Factory, Inc. of South Norwalk, Connecticut, United States, published the game in 2003. Family Games, Inc. of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, published an edition of the game in 2015.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Lucky Seven&quot; is played with seven numbered coasters (per player) on a flat surface. The goal of the game is to turn all seven coasters number side up, to accrue the most points.

With more than one player, the coasters are shuffled, players each choose a coaster and the player with the highest number starts.

The coasters are shuffled and laid in a row number-side down. The player turns over any coaster and leaves it in place number-side up. The exposed number on the coaster determines the position of the next coaster to be turned over, and so on. The player keeps going to see if all coasters can be turned over. If the player turns over a coaster with a number denoting the position of one already turned, he or she is &quot;bust&quot; and the coasters are then shuffled and passed to the next player.

Alternatively, each player may have a set of &quot;Lucky Seven&quot; coasters and all play a solitaire game simultaneously.

Players keep their own score throughout the game, which may be played for each hand, a certain number of hands or to an agreed points total. When the game is over, the player with the most points is the winner.

<text>Gilles C. Bisson (born May 14, 1957) is a Franco-Ontarian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 until his defeat in the 2022 Ontario general election. From 1999 to 2022 he represented the northern riding of Timmins.

==Background==
Bisson is Franco-Ontarian. He was a labour union organizer, who worked for the Ontario Federation of Labour (of which he was the Northeast Director for a time).

A licensed private pilot, Bisson owns a small aircraft which he uses to fly between communities in his far-flung riding, the legislative seat in Toronto and elsewhere. Bisson was a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets with #10 Timmins Kiwanis Squadron where he attained the rank of Flight Sergeant. He also served in both the Canadian Armed Forces &quot;reg force&quot; in 1974/1975 and as a reservist with the Algonquin Regiment B Company.

Bisson is married, is a father of two daughters, and is a grandfather of four.

==Politics==
Bisson was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating Liberal Frank Krznaric by about 2,000 votes in the old riding of Cochrane South. He served as parliamentary assistant to the Ministers of Northern Development and Mines and Francophone Affairs in Bob Rae&#x27;s government, and also served as a member of the cabinet committee on the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.

Although the NDP were defeated in the provincial election of 1995, Bisson significantly increased the margin of his victory in Cochrane South. He was, in fact, the only NDP candidate elected with more than 50% riding support in that cycle. He was easily re-elected in the 1999 election, and fought off a closer challenge from Liberal Michael Doody, a former mayor of Timmins and broadcaster, in the election of 2003. He was re-elected in 2007, 2011, and 2014.

Bisson&#x27;s popularity has helped make Timmins—James Bay one of the top ridings in Ontario for the federal NDP as well, helping Charlie Angus pick up the seat in the 2004 election.

On August 29, 2008, Bisson announced he would run to succeed Howard Hampton in the 2009 Ontario New Democratic Party leadership election. Bisson was defeated, finishing in third place behind first runner-up Peter Tabuns and the victor, Andrea Horwath.

From 2014 until 2022 he was the party&#x27;s House Leader and was the NDP&#x27;s critic for Natural Resources and Forestry issues.

Bisson lost his seat to Progressive Conservative candidate George Pirie in the 2022 Ontario general election.

<doc id="965283" wikidata="Q6833630" url="?curid=965283" title="Michael Prue">
<text>Michael David Prue (born July 14, 1948) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. Prue was mayor of East York, Ontario to 1997 and subsequently represented the riding of Beaches—East York in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2001 to 2014 as member of the New Democratic Party (NDP)&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Park caucus. He was a candidate in the 2009 Ontario NDP leadership election, finishing in fourth place. In 2018, he was elected to the town council of Amherstburg, Ontario, and in 2022 he was elected its mayor.

==Background==
Prue grew up in Toronto&#x27;s Regent Park neighbourhood. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and anthropology from the University of Toronto, and a Master of Arts degree in Canadian Studies from Carleton University. After graduation, he worked as counsel for the Minister of Employment and Immigration.

During his time as a federal government employee, Prue was an activist in the Canada Employment &amp; Immigration Union, a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada.

==Politics==
===Early political career===
In the 1980 federal election, Prue ran as a federal NDP candidate in Scarborough Centre and received 9237 votes for a third-place finish. He ran in the same riding in the 1984 election, again placing third.

===Municipal politics and mayoralty===
Prue became a councillor in East York in 1988. In 1993 he was appointed mayor of the borough. The previous mayor David Johnson resigned when he won a provincial by-election. Rather than pay for the expense of a mayoral campaign, the East York council decided to choose a candidate from amongst themselves. Prue won the position after five ballots. The next year, he was elected mayor in the 1994 municipal election and remained in the position until 1997, when East York and the other component municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged into the single municipality of the city of Toronto. During his tenure as mayor, Prue brought in five consecutive budgets without a tax increase, while cutting East York&#x27;s debt by $7.8 million.

Before the 1998 municipal election, Prue successfully lobbied the provincial government to allot a third council seat for East York to improve its representation on Toronto City Council. Following amalgamation, Prue was elected to represent Ward 32 on Toronto City Council.

===Provincial politics===
On September 20, 2001, Prue won a by-election to replace retiring NDP MPP Frances Lankin in the Ontario legislature. There was some controversy during the by-election. Liberal candidate Bob Hunter accused the NDP of smearing his reputation. He accused Prue of calling him a pedophile based on a book he wrote in 1988. Pages of the book, which portrayed sexual encounters with young prostitutes, were faxed to journalists during the campaign. Hunter launched a libel lawsuit against Prue and NDP leader Howard Hampton but dropped the suit after the election. Prue won the by-election with 50% of the vote while Hunter received 36%.

He was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2011, with large pluralities.

In 2002 Prue undertook a week-long &quot;welfare diet&quot;, trying to live on $12.05 for an entire week to draw attention to the condition of Ontario&#x27;s poorest residents under the Mike Harris government. In 2004 during a debate over expenses charged by school trustees, Prue said that city councillors could do much of the work of trustees. He appeared to support combining the two roles. In 2007 he supported a push for more accountability for executive compensation packages. In May, 2007, he tabled a private member&#x27;s bill called the &quot;Conrad Black Executive Compensation Abuse Act&quot; which sought to have pay packages put to binding shareholder votes.

He has also championed affordable housing in Toronto.

===2009 leadership convention===
On July 18, 2008, Prue announced his intention to seek the leadership of the Ontario NDP at its 2009 leadership convention. At a press conference to announce his bid to replace Howard Hampton as leader of the Ontario NDP party, Prue made remarks on public funding for Catholic schools in Ontario. &quot;The NDP policy is there, it says that we support the dual system,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time though, I think, that we take a look at that, but we need to leave that to [the] convention. It cannot be my position or an individual&#x27;s position... rather it must be a party position and we must have an open and frank debate to get to that point.&quot; He insisted he wasn&#x27;t trying to reopen the debate about religion and schools.

Prue received 11.5% of the votes (weighted) on the first ballot, finishing in fourth place. According to the rules of the contest, as the last place finisher he was dropped off the next ballot. Prue gave his personal endorsement to Gilles Bisson who finished in third place on the first ballot with 23.7% of the weighted vote. After Bisson was eliminated on the next ballot, Prue endorsed Andrea Horwath, who won the leadership on the third ballot with 60.4% over rival Peter Tabuns.

Prue reported raising $79,411.74 for his leadership bid, the lowest of the four contestants. His expenses were the second highest at $222,320.94. His reported deficit was $142,909.20, the highest of the four contestants.

===Subsequent career===

Prue was narrowly defeated by Liberal candidate Arthur Potts in the 2014 provincial election. He lost by 431 votes.

==After Queen&#x27;s Park==
Following his defeat in 2014, Prue and his wife decided to sell their house in Toronto in order to fund their retirement in a smaller town, moving to Amherstburg, outside of Windsor, Ontario. After sitting on the town&#x27;s committee of adjustment, Prue was elected to town council in 2018. He was elected as mayor of Amherstburg in the 2022 municipal election.

<doc id="965284" wikidata="Q5308072" url="?curid=965284" title="Driving Van Trailer">
<text>A Driving Van Trailer (DVT) is a British purpose-built control car railway vehicle that allows the driver to operate with a locomotive in push-pull formation from the opposite end of a train. A key benefit of operating trains with DVTs is the requirement for fewer locomotives; for example, a second locomotive would otherwise have to join at the other end of the train after arrival at terminal stations to lead the train&#x27;s onward journey.

The Mark 3 DVT was originally designed and produced by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Unlike many other control cars, such as the Mark 2 DBSO, the DVT visually resembles a locomotive, specifically Class 90 for the 82/1 Mark 3 series and Class 91 for the 82/2 Mark 4 series; thus when the train is operating in push mode, it does not appear to be travelling backwards. The vehicles do not have any passenger accommodation due to health and safety rules in place at the time of construction that prohibited passengers in the leading carriages of trains that run faster than . Historically, it was believed that a train would be unstable at high speeds unless pulled from the front; however, extensive testing and the experience of high speed trains with central power cars, such as the Advanced Passenger Train (APT) and the Eurostar, have since altered this view.

The later-built Mark 4 DVT was specifically developed to work with the new Mark 4 carriages of the InterCity 225 on the East Coast Mainline while the Mark 3 DVT was built to work with the Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages which then comprised the InterCity rolling stock on the West Coast Main Line. A planned Mark 5 DVT was never produced. Following the Privatisation of British Rail, various private sector train operators have opted to use DVTs in their services. In some cases, such as Wrexham &amp; Shropshire&#x27;s services between London Marylebone and Wrexham General using Mark 3s and Class 67 diesel locomotives, the DVTs required modification to work with new types of locomotives. Other operators have opted to have their DVTs outfitted with diesel generators or even traction apparatus, the latter case resulting in the experimental Class 19 locomotive.

==Development==
The DVT concept is similar to the Mark 2 DBSO but, unlike its predecessor which was rebuilt from existing stock, it was a new build vehicle manufactured specifically for this purpose. The first design of DVT was designed to match Mark 2 and Mark 3 coaches. The second design has a narrower profile, similar to Mark 4 coaches, which would enable it to be converted to tilting operation if required in the future. The nose of the vehicle was styled to closely resemble the Class 90 and 91 locomotives that they were paired with.

The original Mark 3 DVTs, which operated on the West Coast Main Line, used the RCH jumpers to carry the signals, therefore allowing the same cables to be used for lighting and the public address system, as well as driver-guard signalling. The and locomotives had to be retrofitted with RCH cables, replacing the older multiple working jumpers that some of them had been fitted with.

The InterCity 225 sets operate on the East Coast Main Line; the Mark 4 DVTs and locomotives operate in push-pull formation utilising a time-division multiplexer to send control signals along specially screened cables which run the length of the train. The locomotives usually face north, away from London, only being changed occasionally in rare circumstances; this is because the Class 91 depots (formerly Bounds Green and now Neville Hill) are situated at the north end of King&#x27;s Cross and Leeds stations respectively, allowing easy changeover.

When a train is operated by a DVT, the control signals are encoded and multiplexed onto the cables by the TDM equipment in the DVT. At the locomotive, these signals are demultiplexed by the TDM equipment and the signals are used to control the locomotive. The air braking system is operated directly from whichever cab the driver is driving from. If the TDM fails and cannot be reconfigured, the train may still operate; however, if the DVT is leading, it will be necessary to uncouple the locomotive and attach it to the front of the train.

In addition to the driver&#x27;s cab, some DVTs have luggage and cycle storage space and a guard&#x27;s office. One DVT was fitted with a traction gel applicator. A number of Mark 3 DVTs have been fitted with generators to provide power to on-train equipment. One has been fitted with traction equipment, becoming the experimental Class 19 locomotive.

==Mark 3 DVT==


===InterCity West Coast===
British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s Derby Litchurch Lane Works built 52 Mark 3 DVTs to operate with Mark 2 and Mark 3 sets in push-pull mode with Class 86, 87 and 90 locomotives on InterCity West Coast Main Line services from London Euston to Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow allowing the retirement of the Class 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85 locomotives. The standard practice was for the DVT to be marshalled at the southern end, adjacent to the first class carriages, to allow easy changeover of locomotives at Willesden depot which is situated at the north end of London Euston station. The first was delivered in March 1989.

They also operated between Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury, and between Crewe and Holyhead, hauled by Class 47 diesel locomotives. Due to a lack of push-pull equipment, these trains would always be headed by the Class 47 and the DVT at the back of the train.

As part of the privatisation of British Rail, all 52 DVTs were sold to the newly created rolling stock leasing company Porterbrook in 1994 and were operated by InterCity West Coast franchise holder Virgin Trains West Coast from 1997 until both the Mark 2 and Mark 3 sets were replaced by Class 390 tilting trains between 2003 and 2005. During 2002, Mark 3 DVTs operated beyond the West Coast Main Line on a summer Saturday service from Manchester to Paignton with a Class 47 hauled Mark 3 set that was hired to Virgin CrossCountry.

Following the loss of a Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; in the Grayrigg derailment, a Mark 3 set with a Driving Van Trailer was leased with a hired from English Welsh &amp; Scottish as required. During 2008, Virgin looked at leasing two sets, however, the company decided to retain the Mark 3 set instead. Nicknamed the &quot;Pretendolino&quot;, this received re-upholstered seating, power points, wi-fi and a full Virgin external repaint at Wabtec, Doncaster in 2009. Virgin used this set with a Class 90 locomotive, hired from Freightliner, on a Euston to Crewe (via Birmingham) service on Fridays only until December 2012. From 9 December 2013, it was utilised to operate a London Euston - Birmingham New Street train on Thursdays and Fridays only, until its withdrawal in October 2014.

===Greater Anglia===

Mark 3 DVTs were introduced along with Mark 3 coach sets and Class 90s to the Greater Anglia franchise by National Express East Anglia, operating on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich in 2004. They also were hauled by Class 47s from Norwich to Great Yarmouth on summer Saturday services. It was proposed that kitchens be fitted to the DVTs, but this did not proceed. During 2012, all DVTs were transferred, along with the franchise, to Greater Anglia.

In January 2020, the first Class 745s electric multiple units entered service. Accordingly, the locomotive-hauled sets were promptly withdrawn from service, with the last set running on 24 March 2020.

The standard practice was for the DVT to be marshalled at the northern end, adjacent to the standard class carriages, to facilitate easy changeover of locomotives at Norwich Crown Point depot.

===Silverlink===
Between September 2004 and July 2005, Silverlink operated two DVTs in conjunction with Mark 3 and EWS Class 90s on peak-time London Euston to Northampton services.

===DB Cargo UK===
EWS purchased DVT 82146 to operate as part of its DB Cargo Company Train that was launched in December 2004.

===Hull Trains===
In January 2008, DVT 82115 was hired to Hull Trains to operate services on the East Coast Main Line from London King&#x27;s Cross to Doncaster, with a set of Cargo-D Mark 3s while it was short of rolling stock.

===First ScotRail===
During 2005, the Edinburgh - North Berwick services were operated by English Welsh &amp; Scottish Class 90s with former Virgin Trains Mark 3 carriages and a Driving Van Trailer.

===Wrexham &amp; Shropshire===
Wrexham &amp; Shropshire started operating push-pull services with DVTs in October 2008 between London Marylebone and Wrexham General, with Mark 3s and Class 67 diesel locomotives. This followed the start of the service in April 2008, with Class 67s operating in top and tail formation. The DVTs required modification to work with the Class 67, involving adding a notched power controller as is used in the locomotive and a 27 wire jumper cable as used on the locomotives, which is known as the AAR multiple-working system. These were renumbered 82301 to 82305.

Following a reduction in service levels from December 2010, a Mark 3 set was hired to Chiltern Railways to operate a Birmingham Moor Street to London Marylebone peak-hour service. The standard practice was for the DVT to be marshalled at the southern end.

===Chiltern Railways===

After Wrexham &amp; Shropshire ceased in January 2011, its fleet of five DVTs were transferred to fellow DB Regio UK company Chiltern Railways and started operating on London Marylebone to Birmingham Snow Hill services with Mark 3s. They were modified to work with the power doors that were fitted to the Mark 3 coaches and to have a generator fitted to enable Electric Train Supply and compressed air to be provided to the coaches when the locomotive is not running, such as when in a terminus station and when stabled. Initially operated with Class 67s, they have been operated with Class 68s since December 2014. Some peak services were extended to Kidderminster. A sixth DVT (82309) was leased to operate with a Mark 3 set on a peak hour service from London Marylebone to Banbury. The standard practice is for the DVT to be marshalled at the southern end.

===Network Rail===
During early 2013, several DVTs, including 82111, 82124, 82129, and 82145, were acquired by Network Rail and modified to work with diesel locomotives for use on test trains. Part of the modification work includes the integration of a diesel generator to provide power for on-board systems.

===Wales &amp; Borders===
In March 2012, three DVTs (82306-82308) were introduced along with Mark 3s and Class 67s on Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; &quot;Premier Service&quot; from Holyhead to Cardiff. They also operate on services from Crewe and Manchester to Holyhead and Llandudno. All passed with the Wales &amp; Borders franchise to Transport for Wales in October 2018. All were withdrawn in July 2020. In July 2020, 82306 and 82308 were sold to Rail Operations Group.

==Mark 4 DVT==

As part of the electrification of the East Coast Main Line from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds, Edinburgh and Glasgow, 32 Mark 4 DVTs were built by Metro-Cammell at their Washwood Heath facility for inclusion in InterCity 225 sets. The bodyshells were manufactured under sub-contract by Breda in Italy. They operate with Class 91 locomotives using the TDM system via UIC screened cables through the nine Mark 4 coaches of the rake. They have also operated with Class 89 and Class 90 locomotives.

===InterCity East Coast===
All entered service with InterCity. As part of the privatisation of British Rail, all 32 were sold to Eversholt Rail Group in 1994 and were operated by successive InterCity East Coast franchise holders GNER, National Express East Coast, East Coast, Virgin Trains East Coast and LNER. In February 2001, 82221 was damaged in the Great Heck rail crash and subsequently scrapped. The standard practice is for the DVT to be marshalled at the southern end, adjacent to the first class carriages, to facilitate easy changeover of locomotives at Bounds Green and subsequently Neville Hill depots at the north end of King&#x27;s Cross and Leeds stations respectively.

With the delivery of Class 800 and Class 801, mass withdrawals commenced in May 2019. Originally it was proposed that all the InterCity 225 sets be withdrawn by the end of 2020, but LNER decided to retain 10 sets until at least December 2021 to allow it to increase services. A limited number of sets will continue to operate in the new May 2022 timetable.

===Grand Central===
Grand Central would have used Mk4 coaches and DVTs on London Euston to Blackpool North services with Class 90 locomotives hauling six-carriage sets; however, these services were permanently abandoned on 10 September 2020, due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on passenger numbers All five were sold to Transport for Wales during 2021.

===Transport for Wales===
Transport for Wales introduced three four-car Mark 4 sets with Mark 4 DVTs on the &quot;Premier Service&quot; from Holyhead to Cardiff in September 2021. In 2021, Transport for Wales Rail purchased these three sets along with five more that had been recently overhauled for Grand Central.

===Grand Union===
Grand Union has proposed using Class 91 locomotives with Mk4 coaches and DVTs on its services from London Paddington to Cardiff Central and from London Euston to Stirling. In February 2021, the Welsh application was rejected.

===Fleet list===


==Mark 5 DVT==
The Mark 5 DVT was to be part of British Rail&#x27;s ill-fated InterCity 250 project on the West Coast Main Line. This would have resembled the proposed Class 93 locomotive, but contain a driving cab, along with seating for standard class passengers and a small guard compartment. 

==Accidents and incidents==
Across three decades of operations, the DVT has been involved in two serious accidents. These include the Hatfield rail crash of October 2000, which involved DVT 82200, and the Great Heck rail crash of February 2001, which involving DVT 82221. In the latter incident, the DVT sustained major damage, which led it to being withdrawn from service and scrapped. Neither accident were caused by the DVT.

<text>&quot;Compensation&quot; is an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It appeared in his book &quot;Essays&quot;, first published in 1841. In 1844, &quot;Essays: Second Series&quot; was published, and subsequent editions of &quot;Essays&quot; were renamed &quot;Essays: First Series&quot;.

==Summary==
The essay addresses the topic of karma or cause and effect. Emerson contends that everywhere in nature there is dualism. Dualism is present within us because it balances life instead of having excess to destroy. Opposites like action/reaction, day/night, up/down, even/odd and spirit/matter are used to balance the universe. We must all use moderation in life, instead of excess which can cause defects in our lives. If there is excess it needs to be moderated for proper balance.

==Quotations==
&quot;To empty here, you must condense there.&quot; 

&quot;There is a crack in every thing God has made.&quot;

&quot;Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts. The entire system of things gets represented in every particle. There is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night, man and woman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in each individual of every animal tribe.&quot;
&quot;The same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man.&quot;

&quot;Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life.&quot;

<text>A Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO) is a type of railway carriage in the United Kingdom, converted to operate as a control car; this is not to be confused with DVTs, such as those in InterCity 225 sets. Fourteen such vehicles, numbered 9701 to 9714, were converted from Mark 2F Brake Standard Open (standard class coaches with brake van) carriages. Modifications included adding a driving cab and TDM equipment to allow a locomotive to be driven remotely. Using a system known as push–pull, the driver in the DBSO can drive the locomotive, even though it is at the opposite end of the train.

==Operations==
The vehicles were converted in two batches. Numbers 9701–9710 were converted in 1979 for use on the newly introduced Glasgow–Edinburgh InterCity ScotRail push–pull service with specially modified Class 47/7 locomotives. A further four, 9711–9714, were converted in 1985/86. The fourteenth was a replacement for no. 9706, which was derailed and damaged beyond repair in the Polmont rail crash after it hit a cow.

When first introduced, the DBSO fleet had half-cabs and retained their end gangways. They were later rebuilt to have full-width cabs, with the removal of the end gangways.

In the late 1980s, with the introduction of Class 158 diesel multiple units on the Glasgow–Edinburgh corridor, the DBSO fleet was transferred en-masse, and converted to use the TDM system used by the AC electric locomotives used on the London Liverpool Street to Norwich services on the newly electrified Great Eastern Main Line. The Mark 2E/2F coaching stock used on the route was based at Crown Point TMD and rakes were marshalled into semi-permanent formations (numbered AR01–AR13). Traction was provided by Class 86/2 electric locomotives.

As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the London–Norwich route became part of the Anglia Railways franchise. From 1997 onwards, a new livery of turquoise with a white stripe was introduced onto all Anglia stock. However, rake AR01, containing DBSO 9710 retained its old InterCity livery. On the Anglia services they were originally attached to the first class coaches but this was changed and they were attached to the standard class coaches as the seating in the DBSO was standard class. 

In April 2004, the Anglia franchise became part of the new One franchise. The thirteen surviving DBSOs were still in service, although they were gradually replaced by Driving Van Trailers (cascaded from Virgin Trains). One DBSO, no. 9710, had the new one Anglia livery applied by means of adhesive vinyls, whilst retaining the InterCity livery underneath.

However, many of the new Mark 3 sets being received by Anglia were not originally accompanied by DVTs. For this reason a small number of DBSOs were retained until enough DVTs had been received. The last DBSOs were withdrawn from mainline service in December 2006. DBSO 9713 was preserved for further use on the Mid-Norfolk Railway, although this was later sold to Direct Rail Services and scrapped following component recovery.
In February 2007, Network Rail took delivery of five DBSOs, nos. 9701, 9702, 9703, 9708 and 9714. These have been converted to allow test-trains to run in push–pull mode, therefore eliminating the need to operate two locomotives (one at each end of the train). Three of these (9701, 9708 and 9714) were subsequently fitted with a 60 kVA diesel generator to provide power for onboard systems while in operation.

Ex Anglia MK2 driving trailer 9712 was sold to Northern Ireland Railways for use on the ex Gatwick set to convert it to push–pull operation using 111 class locomotives. It is registered as 8918 on NIR. The vehicle was delivered to Belfast on 26 June 2009, almost 14 months late on its contracted delivery date. The ex-Gatwick coaches were stopped on 19 June (before it was delivered) and have now been withdrawn.

In 2015, three were purchased by Direct Rail Services from British American Railway Services. These were overhauled and in July 2015 entered service on Northern Rail Cumbrian Coast Line services.

In September 2017, DBSO 9711 was acquired by Crewe Diesel Preservation Group for preservation alongside Class 47/7 locomotive 47712 and moved to Crewe Heritage Centre.

In 2022, Direct Rail Services offered their five DBSO vehicles for sale. Locomotive Services Limited acquired 9704 and 9707, Eastern Rail Services acquired 9709, 9710 and 9705.

On 18 October 2022, Locomotive Services Group revealed that 9707 had been repainted back into its 1980s ScotRail livery; it is expected that it will operate its first charter train in early 2023, as part of a six-coach set, with 47712 &quot;Lady Diana Spencer&quot;.

<text>Matheus Kristof Shikongo (26 June 1950 – 13 May 2021) was a Namibian politician and businessman. A member of SWAPO, Shikongo was the mayor of Windhoek, Namibia&#x27;s capital, in 1993 and from 2000 to 2010. He helped establish the Namibian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NCCI) and served on the boards of several companies, among them NamPower, MetLife Namibia, and Bank Windhoek.

==Life and career==
Shikongo was born on 26 June 1950, in Ondangwa in Ovamboland (today Oshana Region). He completed school at Ongwediva High School and went first into trading, then banking, insurance and entertainment. He also owned a farm near Tsumeb.

Shikongo worked for Metropolitan Life from 1985 to 1991, and became branch manager. He later served as board member of the Namibian branch. Shikongo died from COVID-19 related causes on 13 May 2021.

==Mayor of Windhoek==
Shikongo became SWAPO councillor in Windhoek in the 1992 local election and was subsequently elected mayor of Windhoek for the year 1993, the first black person to serve in this role. He was reelected as councillor in 1998 and 2004. In 2000 he was elected mayor again and held this position until 2010, making him the longest-serving mayor of Windhoek.

On July 6, 2000, Shikongo signed a treaty with Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor of Berlin, signifying the Twin city partnership between the two. 

Shikongo was one of several Windhoek politicians &quot;withdrawn&quot; by SWAPO in February and March 2009 for suspected loyalty to the opposition Rally for Democracy and Progress. However, it remained unclear if he would be reinstated due to procedural problems regarding his removal. Also, Shikongo was believed to have significant political support among Ovambo people born outside of the cultural Ovamboland, known as Eembwiti. Many Eembwiti live in Katutura, a township of Windhoek.

In December 2010, Shikongo was replaced as mayor by fellow member of SWAPO and deputy mayor Elaine Trepper.

<doc id="965308" wikidata="Q3984165" url="?curid=965308" title="SARS conspiracy theory">
<text>The SARS conspiracy theory began to emerge during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China in the spring of 2003, when Sergei Kolesnikov, a Russian scientist and a member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, first publicized his claim that the SARS coronavirus is a synthesis of measles and mumps. According to Kolesnikov, this combination cannot be formed in the natural world and thus the SARS virus must have been produced under laboratory conditions. Another Russian scientist, Nikolai Filatov, head of Moscow&#x27;s epidemiological services, had earlier commented that the SARS virus was probably man-made.

However, independent labs concluded these claims to be premature since the SARS virus is a coronavirus, whereas measles and mumps are paramyxoviruses. The primary differences between a coronavirus and a paramyxovirus are in their structures and method of infection, thus making it implausible for a coronavirus to have been created from two paramyxoviruses.

The widespread reporting of claims by Kolesnokov and Filatov caused controversy in many Chinese internet discussion boards and chat rooms. Many Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.
The failure to find the source of the SARS virus further convinced these people and many more that SARS was artificially synthesised and spread by some individuals and even governments. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the SARS virus crossed over to humans from Asian palm civets (&quot;civet cats&quot;), a type of animal that is often killed and eaten in Guangdong, where SARS was first discovered.

Supporters of the conspiracy theory suggest that SARS caused the most serious harm in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, regions where most Chinese reside, while the United States, Europe and Japan were not affected as much. However, the highest mortality from SARS outside of China occurred in Canada where 43 died. Conspiracists further take as evidence the idea that, although SARS has an average mortality rate of around 10% around the world, no one died in the United States from SARS. However, there were only 8 confirmed cases out of 27 probable cases in the US (10% of 8 people is less than 1 person). Regarding reasons why SARS patients in the United States experienced a relatively mild illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has explained that anybody with fever and a respiratory symptom who had traveled to an affected area was included as a SARS patient in the U.S., even though many of these were found to have had other respiratory illnesses.

Tong Zeng, an activist with no medical background, authored the book &quot;The Last Defense Line: Concerns About the Loss of Chinese Genes&quot;, published in 2003. In the book, Zeng suggested researchers from the United States may have created SARS as an anti-Chinese bioweapon after taking blood samples in China for a longevity study in the 1990s. The book&#x27;s hypothesis was a front-page report in the Guangzhou newspaper &quot;Southern Metropolis Daily&quot;.

Coronaviruses similar to SARS have been found in bats in China, suggesting they may be their natural reservoir.

<doc id="965318" wikidata="Q799810" url="?curid=965318" title="Bag-in-box">
<text>A bag-in-box or BiB is a container for the storage and transportation of liquids. It consists of a strong (or plastic bag), usually made of several layers of metallised film or other plastics, seated inside a corrugated fiberboard box. The BiB is used because of its easy transportation and ability to dispense liquids. It is mainly used in the food industry for transporting condiments and drinks, for transporting liquid chemicals, and for dispensing fertilizer for various farming practices.

== Features ==
The bag is supplied to the company which will fill it as an empty pre-made bag. The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with wine, juice or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box.

The bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use, there are a number of options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from chilled product temperatures up to .

BiB packaging can be made using form seal fill (FSF) technology, where the bags are manufactured on-line from reels of film, then the FlexTap is inserted then filled on an integral rotary head filler. The BiB is currently used to package wine, soda fountain syrup products, milk, liquid chemicals, and water.

==History==
The first commercial BiB system was invented by American chemist William R. Scholle in 1955 for the safe transportation and dispensing of battery acid. Scholle&#x27;s invention inspired a &quot;packaging revolution.&quot; In 1991, Scholle was inducted into the packaging hall of fame for his invention.

==Uses==
BiB has many common commercial applications. Among the most common ones are to supply syrup to soft drink fountains and to dispense bulk supplied condiments such as ketchup or mustard in the foodservice industry (especially in fast food outlets). BiB technology is still used for its original application of dispensing sulfuric acid for filling lead-acid batteries in garages and dealerships. As explained further below, BiBs have also been implemented for consumer applications like boxed wine.

For commercial syrup applications, the customer opens one end of the box (sometimes via a pre-scored opening) and connects a compatible connector to a built-in port on the bag to pump out its contents. The port itself contains a one-way valve which opens only under pressure from the attached connector and which prevents contamination of the syrup in the bag. For consumer applications like boxed wine, there is a tap already present on the bag which protrudes through a pre-cut hole on the box, so all the consumer has to do is locate the tap on the outside of the box.

Producers like BiB packaging because it is inexpensive. BiB also offers environmental benefits by allowing contents of , so that less packaging or labeling is required. The material it is made from is lighter than the other plastic alternatives, providing it with a better carbon footprint.

One disadvantage of the plastic bags used in BiB technology is that plastic is allegedly less effective than more expensive packaging materials such as stainless steel in preserving the flavor of freshly-made soft drink syrup. McDonald&#x27;s procures syrup for its soda fountains from The Coca-Cola Company in stainless steel tanks rather than BiBs for this reason.

==Wine cask==

The &#x27;wine cask&#x27; was invented by Thomas Angove (1918–2010) of Angove&#x27;s, a winemaker from Renmark, South Australia, and patented by the company on April 20, 1965. Polyethylene bladders of 1imperial gallon (4.55litres) were put into corrugated boxes for sale to consumers. An original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder inside the box, pour out the desired quantity of wine and then reseal it with a special peg.

In 1967, Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight tap welded into an aluminised film bladder, making storage much more convenient for consumers. All modern wine casks now utilise some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box.

The main advantage of BiB packaging is that it prevents oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Rather than working as a conventional tap, the bladder uses gravity pressure to squeeze the liquid out of the bladder, whereas a conventional barrel tap works by allowing incoming air to displace the contents. After opening wine in a bottle, it is oxidized by air in the bottle which has displaced the wine poured; wine in a bag is not touched by air and thus not subject to oxidation until it is dispensed. Cask wine is not subject to cork taint or spoilage due to slow consumption after opening.

Although a promising technology, there have been production and design problems. The impermeable bladders tend to delaminate around the tap and where the two halves are joined. If tap components are deposited in the bladder during assembly, all the bladders must be destroyed to find the components as the bladders are opaque. It has also been difficult to manufacture taps that do not leak air into the bladder since tap parts usually do not join neatly, although there have been significant improvements. Most red wines require breathing before consumption which is not possible with casks, so the wine has air circulated through it before bottling (usually by running through a centrifuge), which reduces shelf life considerably. Most casks will have a best-before date stamped. As a result, it is not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the prescribed period.

==Aseptic packaging==

BiB is also used extensively in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using aseptic packaging equipment, products can be packed in aseptic packaging. Pasteurized or UHT treated products packed into this format can be &quot;shelf-stable&quot;, requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years, depending on the type of bag that is used.

The key to this unique system is that the product being filled is not exposed to the external environment at any stage during the process and as such, there is no possibility of a bacterial load being added to the product during the filling process. To ensure there is no contamination from the packaging, the bag is irradiated after the bag manufacturing process.

These packs are typically from 10 to 1200 liters and offer the advantage of cheap, disposable and transport efficient packaging.

<text>Hendrik Nicholas Poinar (born May 31, 1969 in D.C, United States) is an evolutionary biologist specializing in ancient DNA. Poinar first became known for extracting DNA sequences from ground sloth coprolites. He is currently director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

== Education and academic career ==
The son of noted entomologist George Poinar Jr. and Eva Hecht-Poinar, Poinar received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo in 1992 and 1999 respectively before earning a Ph.D. in 1999 from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, after which he was a postdoctoral researcher from 2000 to 2003 at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. In 2003 he was hired as an assistant professor in the anthropology department at McMaster University in Canada.

In a joint 2000 paper in &quot;Science&quot;, Poinar and Dr. Alan Cooper argued that much existing work in human ancient DNA has not been sufficiently rigorous to prevent DNA contamination from modern human sources, and that many reported results for ancient human DNA may therefore be suspect.

In 2003, Poinar and others from the Max Planck Institute published genetic sequences isolated from coprolites of the extinct Shasta giant ground sloth, with an estimated age of 10500 years using radiocarbon dates. These were the first genetic sequences retrieved from any extinct ground sloth.

In September 2008, Poinar&#x27;s laboratory published results showing that after a long period of separation in the mammoth populations of Siberia and North America, the Siberian mammoth population had been completely replaced by mammoths of North American origin.

In 2014, Poinar and colleagues published the first genomic data from victims of the Plague of Justinian in Bavaria, demonstrating that this plague was caused by a strain of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; now extinct.

<doc id="965321" wikidata="Q7299152" url="?curid=965321" title="Raymond Sokolov">
<text>Raymond Sokolov (born August 1, 1941) is an American journalist who has written extensively about food. He wrote the &quot;Eating Out&quot; column for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; weekend edition from 2006 until March 2010.

==Early life and education==
Sokolov grew up in Detroit, and, while still in elementary school, finished 26th then 2nd in consecutive years in the National Spelling Bee in 1952 and 1953. He attended secondary school at Cranbrook, in suburban Detroit (Bloomfield Hills), whence he graduated in 1959. After graduating from Harvard College in classics, and spending a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Wadham College, Oxford, Sokolov spent two years back at Harvard pursuing a doctorate in classics. In 1965, he passed his orals.

==Career==
In 1965, Sokolov began work as foreign correspondent for &quot;Newsweek Magazine&quot; in its Paris bureau. In summer 1967, he returned to the United States with &quot;Newsweek&quot; as an arts writer.

In 1971, he became restaurant critic and food editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, where his pieces covered the decor, lore, and politics of New York restaurants as well as the productions of their kitchens. His reviews first noted the arrival of Sichuanese and Hunanese food in North America. He was the first writer in English to notice nouvelle cuisine in France.

In 1975, he left the &quot;Times&quot; to pursue a career as a freelance writer from his home in Brooklyn Heights. In 1981, he became editor of Book Digest, then the founding editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; daily Leisure and Arts page, a post he held until 2002. He continues to write about food for national publications.

==Works==
Sokolov has written several cookbooks, including &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Canon: 101 Classic Recipes Everyone Should Know&quot;, which includes recipes from the world&#x27;s cuisines that Sokolov terms as being necessary to &quot;culinary literacy&quot;, as well as brief essays. Other works include &quot;The Saucier&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1976), a highly-regarded cookbook on the hierarchy of French sauces, &quot;Why We Eat What We Eat: How the Encounter between the New World and the Old Changed the Way Everyone on the Planet Eats&quot; (1991), and a biography of A. J. Liebling, &quot;Wayward Reporter&quot; (1980).

His long-running column &quot;A Matter of Taste&quot;, on the Americas&#x27; foodways for the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; injected some researched facts and logical deduction into the highly fanciful traditional histories of cooking and helped lead to the revival of interest in American regional specialties. Some of the columns have been collected as &quot;Fading Feast: A Compendium of Disappearing American Regional Foods&quot; (1981).

==Personal==
In 1980, he married Johanna Hecht, a member of the curatorial staff of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

He lives in New York City.

<doc id="965323" wikidata="Q68541106" url="?curid=965323" title="Antimicrobial">
<text>An antimicrobial is an agent that kills microorganisms (microbicide) or stops their growth ([[bacteriostatic agent]]). Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Antimicrobial medicines to treat infection are known as ⠀⠀antimicrobial chemotherapy, while antimicrobial drugs are used to prevent infection, which known as antimicrobial prophylaxis.

The main classes of antimicrobial agents are disinfectants (non-selective agents, such as bleach), which kill a wide range of microbes on non-living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, antiseptics (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and antibiotics (which destroy microorganisms within the body). The term &quot;antibiotic&quot; originally described only those formulations derived from living microorganisms but is now also applied to synthetic agents, such as sulfonamide&#x27;s or fluoroquinolone&#x27;s. Though the term used to be restricted to antibacterial, and is often used as a synonym for them by medical professionals and in medical literature, its context has broadened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further subdivided into bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents, which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go beyond simply inhibiting microbial growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been developed to kill microbes on contact. The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. It is estimated that bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths. 
==History==
Antimicrobial use has been common practice for at least 2000 years. Ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks used specific molds and plant extracts to treat infection.

In the 19th century, microbiologists such as Louis Pasteur and Jules Francois Joubert observed antagonism between some bacteria and discussed the merits of controlling these interactions in medicine. Louis Pasteur&#x27;s work in fermentation and spontaneous generation led to the distinction between anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The information garnered by Pasteur led Joseph Lister to incorporate antiseptic methods, such as sterilizing surgical tools and debriding wounds into surgical procedures. The implementation of these antiseptic techniques drastically reduced the number of infections and subsequent deaths associated with surgical procedures. Louis Pasteur&#x27;s work in microbiology also led to the development of many vaccines for life-threatening diseases such as anthrax and rabies. On September 3, 1928, Alexander Fleming returned from a vacation and discovered that a Petri dish filled with &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; was separated into colonies due to the antimicrobial fungus &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot;. Fleming and his associates struggled to isolate the antimicrobial but referenced its therapeutic potential in 1929 in the &quot;British Journal of Experimental Pathology&quot;. In 1942, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Edward Abraham used Fleming&#x27;s work to purify and extract penicillin for medicinal uses earning them the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

==Chemical==
===Antibacterials===
Antibacterials are used to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are classified generally as beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines or aminoglycosides. Their classification within these categories depends on their antimicrobial spectra, pharmacodynamics and chemical composition. Prolonged use of certain antibacterials can decrease the number of enteric bacteria, which may have a negative impact on health. Consumption of probiotics and healthy eating may help to replace destroyed gut flora. Stool transplants may be considered however for patients who are having difficulty recovering from prolonged antibiotic treatment, such as recurrent &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infections.

The discovery, development and use of antibacterials during the 20th century have reduced mortality from bacterial infections. The antibiotic era began with the therapeutic application of sulfonamide drugs in 1936, followed by a &quot;golden&quot; period of discovery from about 1945 to 1970, when a number of structurally diverse and highly effective agents were discovered and developed. Since 1980, the introduction of new antimicrobial agents for clinical use has declined, in part because of the enormous expense of developing and testing new drugs. In parallel, there has been an alarming increase in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria, fungi, parasites and some viruses to multiple existing agents.

Antibacterials are among the most commonly used and misused drugs by physicians, for example, in viral respiratory tract infections. As a consequence of widespread and injudicious use of antibacterials, there has been an accelerated emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, resulting in a serious threat to global public health. The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria resistant to current antibacterials. Possible strategies towards this objective include increased sampling from diverse environments and application of metagenomics to identify bioactive compounds produced by currently unknown and uncultured microorganisms as well as the development of small-molecule libraries customized for bacterial targets.

===Antifungals===
Antifungals are used to kill or prevent further growth of fungi. In medicine, they are used as a treatment for infections such as athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm and thrush and work by exploiting differences between mammalian and fungal cells. Unlike bacteria, both fungi and humans are eukaryotes. Thus, fungal and human cells are similar at the molecular level, making it more difficult to find a target for an antifungal drug to attack that does not also exist in the host organism. Consequently, there are often side effects to some of these drugs. Some of these side effects can be life-threatening if the drug is not used properly.

As well as their use in medicine, antifungals are frequently sought after to control indoor mold in damp or wet home materials. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) blasted on to surfaces acts as an antifungal. Another antifungal solution applied after or without blasting by soda is a mix of hydrogen peroxide and a thin surface coating that neutralizes mold and encapsulates the surface to prevent spore release. Some paints are also manufactured with an added antifungal agent for use in high humidity areas such as bathrooms or kitchens. Other antifungal surface treatments typically contain variants of metals known to suppress mold growth e.g. pigments or solutions containing copper, silver or zinc. These solutions are not usually available to the general public because of their toxicity.

===Antivirals===
Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infections. Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. They should be distinguished from viricides, which actively deactivate virus particles outside the body.

Many antiviral drugs are designed to treat infections by retroviruses, including HIV. Important antiretroviral drugs include the class of protease inhibitors. Herpes viruses, best known for causing cold sores and genital herpes, are usually treated with the nucleoside analogue acyclovir. Viral hepatitis is caused by five unrelated hepatotropic viruses (A-E) and may be treated with antiviral drugs depending on the type of infection. Some influenza A and B viruses have become resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, and the search for new substances continues.

===Antiparasitics===
Antiparasitics are a class of medications indicated for the treatment of infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis, malaria and Chagas disease, which are caused by parasites such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes and infectious protozoa. Antiparasitic medications include metronidazole, iodoquinol and albendazole. Like all therapeutic antimicrobials, they must kill the infecting organism without serious damage to the host.

=== Broad-spectrum therapeutics ===

Broad-spectrum therapeutics are active against multiple classes of pathogens. Such therapeutics have been suggested as potential emergency treatments for pandemics.

===Non-pharmaceutical===

A wide range of chemical and natural compounds are used as antimicrobials. Organic acids and their salts are used widely in food products, e.g. lactic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, either as ingredients or as disinfectants. For example, beef carcasses often are sprayed with acids, and then rinsed or steamed, to reduce the prevalence of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

Heavy metal cations such as Hg2+ and Pb2+ have antimicrobial activities, but can be toxic. In recent years, the antimicrobial activity of coordination compounds has been investigated.

Traditional herbalists used plants to treat infectious disease. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity, and some plant products have been shown to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that cross-resistance with agents already in use may be minimal.

====Copper====

Copper-alloy surfaces have natural intrinsic antimicrobial properties and can kill microorganisms such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approved the registration of antimicrobial copper alloy surfaces for use in addition to regular cleaning and disinfection to control infections. Antimicrobial copper alloys are being installed in some healthcare facilities and subway transit systems as a public hygienic measure. Copper nanoparticles are attracting interest for the intrinsic antimicrobial behaviours.

====Essential oils====
Many essential oils included in herbal pharmacopoeias are claimed to possess antimicrobial activity, with the oils of bay, cinnamon, clove and thyme reported to be the most potent in studies with foodborne bacterial pathogens. Coconut oil is also known for its antimicrobial properties. Active constituents include terpenoids and secondary metabolites. Despite their prevalent use in alternative medicine, essential oils have seen limited use in mainstream medicine. While 25 to 50% of pharmaceutical compounds are plant-derived, none are used as antimicrobials, though there has been increased research in this direction. Barriers to increased usage in mainstream medicine include poor regulatory oversight and quality control, mislabeled or misidentified products, and limited modes of delivery.

====Antimicrobial pesticides====
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and defined by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, antimicrobial pesticides are used to control growth of microbes through disinfection, sanitation, or reduction of development and to protect inanimate objects, industrial processes or systems, surfaces, water, or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, or slime. The EPA monitors products, such as disinfectants/sanitizers for use in hospitals or homes, to ascertain efficacy. Products that are meant for public health are therefore under this monitoring system, including products used for drinking water, swimming pools, food sanitation, and other environmental surfaces. These pesticide products are registered under the premise that, when used properly, they do not demonstrate unreasonable side effects to humans or the environment. Even once certain products are on the market, the EPA continues to monitor and evaluate them to make sure they maintain efficacy in protecting public health.

Public health products regulated by the EPA are divided into three categories:
* Disinfectants: Destroy or inactivate microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses,) but may not act as sporicides (as those are the most difficult form to destroy). According to efficacy data, the EPA will classify a disinfectant as limited, general/ broad spectrum, or as a hospital disinfectant.
* Sanitizers: Reduce the number of microorganisms, but may not kill or eliminate all of them.
* Sterilizers (Sporicides): Eliminate all bacteria, fungi, spores, and viruses.

=====Antimicrobial pesticide safety=====
Antimicrobial pesticides have the potential to be a major factor in drug resistance. Organizations such as the World Health Organization call for significant reduction in their use globally to combat this. According to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, health-care workers can take steps to improve their safety measures against antimicrobial pesticide exposure. Workers are advised to minimize exposure to these agents by wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves and safety glasses. Additionally, it is important to follow the handling instructions properly, as that is how the EPA has deemed them as safe to use. Employees should be educated about the health hazards and encouraged to seek medical care if exposure occurs.

===Ozone===
Ozone can kill microorganisms in air, water and process equipment and has been used in settings such as kitchen exhaust ventilation, garbage rooms, grease traps, biogas plants, wastewater treatment plants, textile production, breweries, dairies, food and hygiene production, pharmaceutical industries, bottling plants, zoos, municipal drinking-water systems, swimming pools and spas, and in the laundering of clothes and treatment of in–house mold and odors.

===Antimicrobial scrubs===
Antimicrobial scrubs can reduce the accumulation of odors and stains on scrubs, which in turn improves their longevity. These scrubs also come in a variety of colors and styles. As antimicrobial technology develops at a rapid pace, these scrubs are readily available, with more advanced versions hitting the market every year. These bacteria could then be spread to office desks, break rooms, computers, and other shared technology. This can lead to outbreaks and infections like methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, treatments for which cost the healthcare industry $20 billion a year.

=== Halogens ===
Elements such as chlorine, iodine, fluorine, and bromine are nonmetallic in nature and constitute the halogen family. Each of these halogens have a different antimicrobial effect that is influenced by various factors such as pH, temperature, contact time, and type of microorganism. Chlorine and iodine are the two most commonly used antimicrobials. Chlorine is extensively used as a disinfectant in the water treatment plants, drug, and food industries. In wastewater treatment plants, chlorine is widely used as a disinfectant. It oxidizes soluble contaminants and kills bacteria and viruses. It is also highly effective against bacterial spores. The mode of action is by breaking the bonds present in these microorganisms. When a bacterial enzyme comes in contact with a compound containing chlorine, the hydrogen atom in that molecule gets displaced and is replaced with chlorine. This in turn changes the enzyme function which ultimately leads to the death of the bacterium. Iodine is most commonly used for sterilization and wound cleaning. The three major antimicrobial compounds containing iodine are alcohol-iodine solution, an aqueous solution of iodine, and iodophors. Iodophors are more bactericidal and are used as antiseptics as they are less irritating when applied to the skin. Bacterial spores on the other hand cannot be killed by iodine, but they can be inhibited by iodophors. The growth of microorganisms is inhibited when iodine penetrates into the cells and oxidizes proteins, genetic material, and fatty acids. Bromine is also an effective antimicrobial that is used in water treatment plants. When mixed with chlorine it is highly effective against bacterial spores such as &quot;S. faecalis.&quot;

=== Alcohols ===
Alcohols are commonly used as disinfectants and antiseptics. Alcohols kill vegetative bacteria, most viruses and fungi. Ethyl alcohol, n-propanol and isopropyl alcohol are the most commonly used antimicrobial agents. Methanol is also a disinfecting agent but is not generally used as it is highly poisonous. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; are a few bacteria whose growth can be inhibited by alcohols. Alcohols have a high efficiency against enveloped viruses (60–70% ethyl alcohol) 70% isopropyl alcohol or ethanol are highly effective as an antimicrobial agent. In the presence of water, 70% alcohol causes coagulation of the proteins thus inhibiting microbial growth. Alcohols are not quite efficient when it comes to spores. The mode of action is by denaturing the proteins. Alcohols interfere with the hydrogen bonds present in the protein structure. Alcohols also dissolve the lipid membranes that are present in microorganisms. Disruption of the cell membrane is another property of alcohols that aids in cell death. Alcohols are cheap and effective antimicrobials. They are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry.  Alcohols are commonly used in hand sanitizers, antiseptics, and disinfectants.

=== Phenol and Phenolic compounds ===
Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, was one of the first chemicals which was used as an antimicrobial agent. It has high antiseptic properties. It is bacteriostatic at concentrations of 0.1%–1% and is bactericidal/fungicidal at 1%–2%. A 5% solution kills anthrax spores in 48 hr. Phenols are most commonly used in oral mouth washes and household cleaning agents. They are active against a wide range of bacteria, fungi and viruses.  Today phenol derivatives such as thymol and cresol are used because they are less toxic compared to phenol. These phenolic compounds have a benzene ring along with the –OH group incorporated into their structures. They have a higher antimicrobial activity. These compounds inhibit microbial growth by precipitating proteins which lead to their denaturation and by penetrating into the cell membrane of microorganisms and disrupting it. Phenolic compounds can also deactivate enzymes and damage the amino acids in microbial cells. Phenolics such as fentichlore, an antibacterial and antifungal agent, are used as an oral treatment for fungal infections. Trischlosan is highly effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Hexachlorophene (Bisphenol) is used as a surfactant. It is widely used in soaps, handwashes, and skin products because of its antiseptic properties. It is also used as a sterilizing agent. Cresol is an effective antimicrobial and is widely used in mouthwashes and cough drops. Phenolics have high antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&quot; 2-Phenylphenol-water solutions are used in immersion treatments of fruit for packing. (It is not used on the packing materials however.) Ihloff and Kalitzki 1961 find a small but measurable amount remains in the skin of fruits processed in this manner.

=== Aldehydes ===
Aldehydes are highly effective against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.  Aldehydes inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting the outer membrane. They are used in the disinfection and sterilization of surgical instruments. As they are highly toxic, they are not used in antiseptics. Currently, only three aldehyde compounds are of widespread practical use as disinfectant biocides, namely glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) despite the demonstration that many other aldehydes possess good antimicrobial activity. However, due to its long contact time other disinfectants are commonly preferred.

==Physical==

===Heat===
Microorganisms have a minimum temperature, an optimum, and a maximum temperature for growth. High temperature as well as low temperatures are used as physical agents of control. Different organisms show different degrees of resistance or susceptibility to heat or temperature, some organisms such as bacterial endospore are more resistant while vegetative cells are less resistant and are easily killed at lower temperatures. Another method that involves the use of heat to kill microorganisms is fractional sterilization. This process involves the exposure to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius for an hour per day for several days. Fractional sterilization is also called tyndallization. Bacterial endospores can be killed using this method. Both dry and moist heat are effective in eliminating microbial life. For example, jars used to store preserves such as jam can be sterilized by heating them in a conventional oven. Heat is also used in pasteurization, a method for slowing the spoilage of foods such as milk, cheese, juices, wines and vinegar. Such products are heated to a certain temperature for a set period of time, which greatly reduces the number of harmful microorganisms. Low temperature is also used to inhibit microbial activity by slowing down microbial metabolism.

===Radiation===
Foods are often irradiated to kill harmful pathogens. There are two types of radiations that are used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms – ionizing and non-ionizing radiations. Common sources of radiation used in food sterilization include cobalt-60 (a gamma emitter), electron beams and . Ultraviolet light is also used to disinfect drinking water, both in small-scale personal-use systems and larger-scale community water purification systems.

=== Desiccation ===
Desiccation is also known as dehydration.  It is the state of extreme dryness or the process of extreme drying. Some microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts and molds require water for their growth. Desiccation dries up the water content thus inhibiting microbial growth. On the availability of water, the bacteria resume their growth, thus desiccation does not completely inhibit bacterial growth. The instrument used to carry out this process is called a desiccator. This process is widely used in the food industry and is an efficient method for food preservation. Desiccation is also largely used in the pharmaceutical industry to store vaccines and other products.

=== Antimicrobial surfaces ===
Antimicrobial surfaces are designed to either inhibit the ability of microorganisms to grow or damaging them by chemical (copper toxicity) or physical processes (micro/nano-pillars to rupture cell walls). These surfaces are especially important for the healthcare industry. Designing effective antimicrobial surfaces demands an in-depth understanding of the initial microbe-surface adhesion mechanisms. Molecular dynamics simulation and time-lapse imaging are typically used to investigate these mechanisms.

=== Osmotic pressure ===
Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent a solvent from passing from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration through a semipermeable membrane.  When the concentration of dissolved materials or solute is higher inside the cell than it is outside, the cell is said to be in a hypotonic environment and water will flow into the cell.When the bacteria is placed in hypertonic solution, it causes plasmolysis or cell shrinking, similarly in hypotonic solution, bacteria undergoes plasmotysis or turgid state. This plasmolysis and plasmotysis kills bacteria because it causes change in osmotic pressure.

== Antimicrobial resistance ==

The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. It is estimated that bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths.

<text>A monkey stick (also called a mendoza, mendozer, Murrumbidgee river rattler, lagerphone or zob stick) is a traditional English percussion instrument, used in folk music. Some musicians have taken to fixing a small stuffed toy monkey to the tops of their instruments.

The instrument is constructed from a stout pole with metal &quot;jingles&quot; fastened at intervals along the shaft. These are commonly beer-bottle tops with a 1-inch washer in between the tops and the shaft. A boot that might be attached to the base of the pole is a recent &#x27;Zob Stick&#x27; addition.

When played on a wooden floor (common in ale-houses), the sound produced is a combination of a bass drum and tambourine. It can also be played with an additional small notched or serrated stick held in the other hand, allowing it to not only be shaken or hammered onto the ground, but also &quot;bowed&quot; to produce a combined clicking and rattling sound. Bands such as Groanbox, Zapoppin&#x27; and Dr. Busker have incorporated the monkey stick into their recordings and live shows.

==Other names and versions==
In Australia, this instrument constructed with beer-bottle tops is known as a lagerphone. The same name and construction is found in New Zealand. The town of Brooweena in Queensland, Australia claims to hold the unofficial record when 134 people simultaneously played the lagerphone in 2009.

In Newfoundland, it is referred to as an &quot;ugly stick&quot;. In the Dutch province of Friesland this type of instrument is known as a &#x27;kuttepiel&#x27;. In the American upper-Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the closely related vozembouch, stumpf fiddle or pogocello originated in Czech communities and adds small cymbals, strings, and a drum. A similar instrument, the batih, is found in Ukraine.

The &quot;zob stick&quot; variation of this instrument was constructed and named in 1968 by percussionist and songwriter Keef Trouble of the band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts and Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs, and included a sprung-boot attached to the bottom of the pole and a metal sleeve round its centre, to be hit with a serrated wooden stick. It is now, with the term ‘Lagerphone’, the most commonly used name for this instrument. The term &#x27;&#x27; was taken from the British naval slang term for &quot;penis&quot;.

<text>The sake bomb or sake bomber is a beer cocktail made by dropping a shot glass of sake into a glass of beer.

== Preparation ==
Two chopsticks are placed parallel on top of the glass of beer, and the shot glass is placed on top of them. The drinker slams the table with their fists, causing the sake to fall into the beer. It should be drunk immediately. The drinker may count to three in Japanese, &quot; (一)... (ニ)... (三)...sake bomb!&quot; Or they may simply yell &quot;!&quot; (乾杯, a Japanese toast, from Chinese words meaning &quot;dry cup&quot;). The sake bomb chant may also be said before drinking. The chant has one person say &quot;sake&quot; and others say &quot;bomb&quot;, before consuming the drink. It is usually made with cold sake.

A variation of the sake bomb is to &quot;bomb&quot; a shot of warm sake into a chilled Red Bull energy drink.

<doc id="965332" wikidata="Q7448122" url="?curid=965332" title="Self-interest">
<text>Self-interest generally refers to a focus on the needs or desires (&quot;interests&quot;) of one&#x27;s self. Most times, actions that display self-interest are often performed without conscious knowing. A number of philosophical, psychological, and economic theories examine the role of self-interest in motivating human action. Individuals may have a self-serving bias towards their self-interest.

==In philosophy==
Philosophical concepts concerned with self-interest include:
* Enlightened self-interest, a philosophy which states that acting to further the interests of others also serves one&#x27;s own self-interest.
* Ethical egoism, the ethical position that moral agents &quot;ought&quot; to do what is in their own self-interest.
* Hedonism, the school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
** Cyrenaics, the Aristippean pre-Socratic original.
** Epicureanism, a philosophical system related to hedonism.
* Individualism, a philosophy stressing the worth of individual selves.
* Rational egoism, the position that all rational actions are those done in one&#x27;s self-interest.

===Legalism===
Legalism is a Chinese political philosophy that holds that self-interest underlies human nature and therefore human behavior. It is axiomatic in Legalism that a government can not truly be staffed by upright and trustworthy men of service, because every member of the elite—like any member of society—will pursue their own interests and thus must be employed for their interests. It contends that even acts of virtue are intrinsically mercenary, driven by self-interest, like the pursuit for a life of morality in the hopes that the resulting reputation will be convertible into abundant benefits or riches.

In Legalism, a regular pattern of the natural world is that the basic nature of human beings comprises a set of interests that are primarily self-regarding and not amenable to cultivation, morally or otherwise. Therefore, Legalists argue that political systems are only viable if it allows individuals to pursue their selfish interests exclusively in a manner that benefits rather than contradicts the needs of a state. Conversely, their concerns lie with political systems based on trust and respect for ministers and other officials—rather than on impersonal norms and standards, such as laws, regulations, and rules—as these systems will result in an irresolvable power struggle. Their sober realization herein is that administrative systems are fundamentally unable to monitor themselves in the long term despite the impersonal mode of rule, because they must rely for their implementation on individuals who themselves are driven by self-interest.

Legalists hold that an ideal state is not achieved through solving social problems that are fundamentally moral, but that self-interest—such as the competing interacting interests of rulers, ministers, and common people—is the genuine force in the world. They argue that people can be shaped behaviorally to yield social order if it is in the individual&#x27;s own self-interest to abide by the norms, meaning that different interests must be aligned to each other and the social good, which is most efficiently ensured if the norms are publicly and impartially enforced. They advocate the use of rewards and punishments, as mankind reacts out of self-interest, to achieve a desired behavior from people. According to them, the application of reward and punishment in a sociopolitical system is necessary to influence people&#x27;s calculations and direct them towards pursuits that benefit the state.

==In psychology==
Psychological concepts concerned with self-interest include psychological egoism, the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest and narcissism, which is an unhealthy self-absorption due to a disturbance in the sense of self.

==In business==
In business, self interest focuses on actions or activities that are advantageous to an individual or organization. For a business or individual to survive and grow, a degree of self-interest is necessary. When there is too much focus on self-interest, the benefits of the group at large diminishes.
* Leadership,
** The Wells Fargo scandal, proved that top managers who were concerned about meeting their quotas encouraged employees to set up fake checking and savings accounts so that their managers could meet quotas, and thus, gain incentives. In this case, the top managers put their own self-interest, i.e. desire for money and personal gain, above the well-being of their employees, and the reputation of the company they work for.
* Innovation
** Samuel P. Langley&#x27;s desire to create the world&#x27;s first aircraft was based primarily on his own self-interest rather than to improve humanity. Langley was an astronomer and around the age of 50 he decided that the only way to achieve his goal of becoming one of the great figures in the history of science was to be the first to create the “flying machine”. Eventually, the Wright brothers were able to accomplish this task of creating the first flying machine in 1903. Even they were motivated by the fortune and fame that came with the feat. In this case, the brothers’ self-interest benefited humanity for decades to come.
* Conflict of interest
** Managers are tasked with the responsibility of hiring new employees for open positions. When these managers choose to give these positions to friends or family, instead of the most qualified person for the job, it can be a result of the manager&#x27;s desire to create a better situation for people in their family thus appealing to their own self-interest.
** Bribes, i.e. when a store manager takes a bribe from an eager sales representative to close a deal. Perhaps accepting bribes is against the store&#x27;s policy, but a store manager may make a deal because it is to his own personal benefit to do.

<doc id="965333" wikidata="Q6406275" url="?curid=965333" title="Kiki and Herb">
<text>Kiki and Herb (Justin Bond and Kenny Mellman) are an American drag cabaret duo. Bond portrays Kiki DuRane, an aging, alcoholic, female lounge singer. Mellman portrays her gay, male piano accompanist, known only as Herb.

Despite Bond and Mellman being middle aged, their Kiki and Herb characters are, according to their elaborate fictional biographies, more than eighty years old. Both performers live in New York City, but the pair have performed from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., as well as Europe.

The act alternates between musical numbers and long, seemingly inebriated monologues by Kiki. The musical numbers, often , draw on an enormous range of popular music, from Broadway musicals to Nirvana and from Britney Spears to REO Speedwagon. Kiki and Herb have also covered songs by Suicidal Tendencies, The Mountain Goats, and Butt Trumpet.

==First wave: 1990–2004==
Bond and Mellman began performing together in 1989, and created the characters of Kiki and Herb in the early 1990s in San Francisco.

Between 1995 and 1996 Kiki and Herb appeared regularly at &quot;Cowgirl Hall of Fame&quot; in Greenwich Village, where they honed their show and built their fanbase. Among the devotees was John Cameron Mitchell, who later included Bond in his 2006 movie &quot;Shortbus&quot;.

In 1998, the duo appeared at the first Gay Shame event, held at DUMBA in Brooklyn, and are seen briefly in the documentary short &quot;Gay Shame &#x27;98&quot; by Scott Berry.

In 1999, they performed weekly in &quot;Have Another&quot; at the Fez and received their first &quot;New York Times&quot; review. Their first album, the Christmas record &quot;Do You Hear What We Hear?&quot;, was released in 2000. In 2001, they received an Obie Award for the show &quot;Kiki and Herb: Jesus Wept&quot;.

The duo appeared in a cameo role in the 2004 feature film &quot;Imaginary Heroes&quot;, released that year by Sony Pictures and starring, among others, Emile Hirsch, Jeff Daniels, and Sigourney Weaver. Kiki and Herb appear at a Christmas party attended by the main characters and perform an excerpt from &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Kind of Night&quot;, the final track from their Christmas album. The same year, Kiki and Herb gave a &quot;farewell&quot; performance at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.
The one-night-only show &quot;Kiki and Herb Will Die for You&quot; featured several celebrities, including Sandra Bernhard, Isaac Mizrahi, Jake Shears, Michael Cavadias, and Rufus Wainwright; the recording of the show was released as the two-disc album &quot;Kiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;. After the performance the duo worked on other projects; Bond moved to London to study scenography, while Mellman worked in New York.

==Second coming: 2004–2008==
Their hiatus was short lived. In 2005, the duo reunited for &quot;The Resurrection Tour&quot; of select U.S. cities. A European tour followed, which included a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Also in 2005, two films about the duo screened at festivals: &quot;Kiki and Herb Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Kiki and Herb on the Rocks&quot;.

In the early summer of 2006, Bond and Mellman announced that Kiki and Herb would make their Broadway debut that August. After a handful of preview performances at the Wilma Theatre in Philadelphia, &quot;Kiki &amp; Herb: Alive on Broadway&quot; debuted for a four-week run at the Helen Hayes Theatre on August 11. Reviews were mostly favorable, including a glowing assessment by Ben Brantley of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. For Brantley, Kiki &quot;suggests some wondrous hybrid of Marianne Faithfull, Elaine Stritch, Patti Smith and Kitty Carlisle Hart,&quot; her vocals &quot;radioactive with an angry sorrow, ecstasy, and cosmic fatigue&quot; in which &quot;the point is never the prettiness of the voice but the history behind it and the passion to endure that vibrates within.&quot;

The duo began a run of Sunday-night shows at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City in January 2007, and toured the United States with &quot;The Year of Magical Drinking&quot; in the Spring and Summer of that year.

On May 15, 2007, &quot;Kiki and Herb: Alive on Broadway&quot; was nominated for a Tony Award for &quot;Best Special Theatrical Event&quot;; the &quot;New York Observer&quot; predicted the duo would win, but they did not.

Following a world tour, the duo returned to Carnegie Hall on December 12, 2007 with the holiday show &quot;Kiki and Herb: The Second Coming.&quot;

Their concert DVD &quot;Kiki and Herb: Live at the Knitting Factory&quot; was recorded in 2007 and released January 2008; in addition to the performance, the DVD release included bonus clips from performances by Bond and Mellman in 1993, 1999, and 2005.

Their March 2008 performance at Perez Hilton&#x27;s 30th birthday party would be their final show for many years.

==Revivification: 2016==
In September 2015, Justin Vivian Bond and Kenny Mellman announced the return of Kiki and Herb with a new show, &quot;Seeking Asylum!&quot; at Joe&#x27;s Pub from April 21 to May 6, 2016.

==Fictional biography==
For years, Bond and Mellman maintained a meticulous backstory for their characters, one made official on the Kiki and Herb MySpace page and their official website. This involved the characters meeting as children in a mental institution before becoming a jazz act in the fifties, beginning a long and chequered career mixing periods of success and misfortune. The shows were supposedly part of their comeback trail, and they would perform songs supposedly from throughout their career (which were actually anachronistic covers). Between songs Kiki would tell anecdotes from her life, including her friendships with Billie Holiday and Grace Kelly, and the details of her various relationships, whilst drinking heavily and often having on-stage rages and breakdowns.

However, in &quot;Alive on Broadway,&quot; they introduced the notion that the fictional backstory may be meta-fictional—Kiki spoke of the duo actually being thousands of years old, implying that some of her previous stories were, at least in part, lies told by the character. After the Broadway show, Bond and Mellman consistently included this twist in their shows&#x27; monologues—Kiki will talk about knowing Jesus &quot;in the Biblical sense,&quot; hanging around with Marie Antoinette, and even romancing a young Adolf Hitler.

<doc id="965334" wikidata="Q273785" url="?curid=965334" title="Bridget Powers">
<text>Bridget Powers (born October 11, 1980) is an American pornographic actress with dwarfism. She is often credited as &quot;Bridget the Midget&quot; or with the alternate spelling &quot;Bridget Powerz&quot;. Besides her adult work, she has also appeared in many films in either comedic or dramatic roles, such as &quot;Big Money Rustlas&quot;, &quot;Tiptoes&quot;, and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;. She also is the singer in the punk band Bridget and the Nameless.

==Early life==
Powers was born in Boise, Idaho. Her parents divorced when she was one year old, and she had a number of operations between the ages of three and fourteen to correct bowed legs; the results left her with one straight leg and one that points to the left. Powers has to wear a knee brace.

== Career ==
Powers was discovered at a goth nightclub by a man who was working as a make-up artist for a gothic vampire adult movie. She made her first porn film in 1999. By her own count, she appeared in 65 to 70 original films, with compilations bringing that up to over 110. She left the business, as she wished to do condom-only scenes yet many of the male performers would remove the condoms. Disillusioned with the exploitation of the porn film industry, she then set up her own video on demand website.

She was a co-host on Ed Powers&#x27; radio show &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. She is also in a band named Blakkout. In addition to her erotic film roles, she has appeared in several mainstream films, such as &quot;8mm&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell&quot; and independent films such as &quot;Almost Amateur&quot;, &quot;Tiptoes&quot;, and &quot;Lynsey does Jody 2 – Extreme Edition&quot;.

She appeared as herself in the 2002 HBO documentary series &quot;&quot;, which explored the lives of the owners, management, staff and customers of the Moonlite BunnyRanch brothel in Mound House, Nevada. As &quot;Bridget the Midget&quot;, she was featured in an episode of the History Channel series &quot;Wild West Tech&quot;. In 2006, she appeared on an episode of VH1&#x27;s celebrity reality show, &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. She has also appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on E! She also played the role of Tink, Sheriff Sugar Wolf&#x27;s love interest in the 2010 film &quot;Big Money Rustlas&quot;.

In 2022, Powers formed the punk band Bridget and the Nameless.

==Personal life==
She has one child. On September 18, 2019, she was arrested and booked into the Clark County Detention Center after stabbing her boyfriend Jesse James in the leg at her home in Las Vegas, after discovering him in bed with another woman.

<text>Venke Knutson (born 20 October 1978) is a Norwegian singer. Since 2003, she has had six top 10 hits in Norway.

==Life and career==
Venke Knutson was born in Birkeland, in 1978. She was the youngest of three sisters, in a musical family, and she got inspired to sing by her elder sisters.

Early in her life she lived with her family in the United States.

She joined the school choir. Inspired by two older sisters, she applied for music at the Vågsbygd skole (Vågsbygd High School), when the family was about to go back home to Norway.

She used to be an elementary teacher in Norway. She was earlier married to Svenn Kåre Liodden, but they divorced. She married Thomas Wold in 2008.

She debuted in 2003 with the single &quot;Panic&quot;, followed by her first album &quot;Scared&quot; and the singles &quot;Scared&quot; and &quot;Kiss&quot;.

Venke Knutson entered the qualifying rounds of the Melodi Grand Prix 2010 (the Norwegian selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest) on 16 January and was voted through to the national &quot;second chance&quot; program, with the song &quot;Jealous &#x27;Cause I Love You&quot;, where she was voted through to the national final.

<doc id="965348" wikidata="Q1474584" url="?curid=965348" title="Functional calculus">
<text>In mathematics, a functional calculus is a theory allowing one to apply mathematical functions to mathematical operators. It is now a branch (more accurately, several related areas) of the field of functional analysis, connected with spectral theory. (Historically, the term was also used synonymously with calculus of variations; this usage is obsolete, except for functional derivative. Sometimes it is used in relation to types of functional equations, or in logic for systems of predicate calculus.)

If formula_1 is a function, say a numerical function of a real number, and formula_2 is an operator, there is no particular reason why the expression formula_3 should make sense. If it does, then we are no longer using formula_1 on its original function domain. In the tradition of operational calculus, algebraic expressions in operators are handled irrespective of their meaning. This passes nearly unnoticed if we talk about &#x27;squaring a matrix&#x27;, though, which is the case of formula_5 and formula_2 an formula_7 matrix. The idea of a functional calculus is to create a &quot;principled&quot; approach to this kind of overloading of the notation.

The most immediate case is to apply polynomial functions to a square matrix, extending what has just been discussed. In the finite-dimensional case, the polynomial functional calculus yields quite a bit of information about the operator. For example, consider the family of polynomials which annihilates an operator formula_8. This family is an ideal in the ring of polynomials. Furthermore, it is a nontrivial ideal: let formula_9 be the finite dimension of the algebra of matrices, then formula_10 is linearly dependent. So formula_11 for some scalars formula_12, not all equal to 0. This implies that the polynomial formula_13 lies in the ideal. Since the ring of polynomials is a principal ideal domain, this ideal is generated by some polynomial formula_14. Multiplying by a unit if necessary, we can choose formula_14 to be monic. When this is done, the polynomial formula_14 is precisely the minimal polynomial of formula_8. This polynomial gives deep information about formula_8. For instance, a scalar formula_19 is an eigenvalue of formula_8 if and only if formula_19 is a root of formula_14. Also, sometimes formula_14 can be used to calculate the exponential of formula_8 efficiently.

The polynomial calculus is not as informative in the infinite-dimensional case. Consider the unilateral shift with the polynomials calculus; the ideal defined above is now trivial. Thus one is interested in functional calculi more general than polynomials. The subject is closely linked to spectral theory, since for a diagonal matrix or multiplication operator, it is rather clear what the definitions should be.

<doc id="965359" wikidata="Q2038289" url="?curid=965359" title="Tony Greig">
<text>Anthony William Greig (6 October 194629 December 2012) was a South African-born cricketer and commentator. Greig qualified to play for the England cricket team by virtue of his Scottish father. He was a tall () all-rounder who bowled both medium pace and off spin. Greig was captain of England from 1975 to 1977, and captained Sussex. His younger brother, Ian, also played Test cricket, while several other members of his extended family played at first-class level.

A leading player in English county cricket, Greig is thought by some former players and pundits to have been one of England&#x27;s leading international all-rounders. He helped Kerry Packer start World Series Cricket by signing up many of his England colleagues as well as West Indian and Pakistani cricketers, a move which cost him the England captaincy. He is also known for a controversial run-out of Alvin Kallicharran in a Test Match against the West Indies in 1974, and often clashed with Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee on the 1974–75 Ashes Tour in Australia. His statement in the lead-up to the 1976 tour of England by the West Indies that he intended &quot;to make them grovel&quot; was met with severe criticism.

Greig became a commentator following the end of his playing career, later emigrating to Australia. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2012, and died in Sydney, on 29 December 2012, from an apparent heart attack.

==Early life and career==

Greig was born to a Scottish father, Alexander &#x27;Sandy&#x27; Greig, an RAF officer posted to Queenstown, Union of South Africa, and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen&#x27;s College, Queenstown. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen&#x27;s College—during Greig&#x27;s schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig&#x27;s developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig&#x27;s father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. &quot;He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He would look at me sometimes and say &#x27;Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war&#x27;, but in the end he grinned and said: &#x27;Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do&#x27;&quot;.

After Greig scored 156 in 230 minutes against a strong Lancashire attack in his first game for Sussex, his future direction changed irrevocably. He wrote a brief note to his father, telling him he would not be coming back to go to university. Greig set a goal of making the England Test team in six years, though he returned to play in South Africa during the winter for a number of years, eventually transferring to Eastern Province for the 1970–71 season.

==Controversy and triumph in the Caribbean==

Greig was now experimenting with finger-spin to complement his medium pace. He set off to the West Indies with the England team in early 1974 and ran straight into a major controversy. On the second day of the first test at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Trinidad, the West Indies had cruised to a first innings lead of 143, thanks mainly to 142 not out from Alvin Kallicharran. With four wickets still in hand, the home team was in a dominant position when the last ball of the day was bowled to Bernard Julien, who blocked it past Greig (fielding in close on the off side) and then headed off to the pavilion with Kallicharran. According to Wisden India:

&quot;Julien fended towards Greig&#x27;s right, and thought he&#x27;d seen off the day as he turned around and began walking back. Alan Knott, the England wicketkeeper, seemed to think the same as he dislodged the stumps, but even as he did so, Greig, who had collected the ball, threw down the stumps at the non-striker&#x27;s end, with Kallicharan already out of the crease, on the way to the dressing room. Greig appealed, and the umpire gave it out. There was confusion as everyone in the venue came to terms with what had happened. Some only realised when the wickets column on the scoreboard ticked over to seven, and according to an &quot;ESPNcricinfo&quot; piece looking back at the incident, the crowd began to boo. The commentators on radio speculated that, given Knott had dislodged the stumps before Greig broke the stumps, the ball was dead, and on the basis of that, the scoreboard reverted to 274–6.

In a meeting involving the two captains, the West Indies board representatives and England&#x27;s tour manager Donald Carr, it was decided – after two and a half hours – that Kallicharan would be reinstated, despite the umpire standing by his call. In a press conference the next day – a rest day – the captains announced that, in the &quot;interest of cricket as a whole&quot; the appeal against Kallicharan had been withdrawn. The statement also contained an apology from Greig, with the Englishman and Kallicharan publicly shaking hands when play resumed.&quot;

West Indies secured a seven-wicket victory in this test match, Greig making only a modest contribution with the bat. This was not the last time Greig courted controversy both on and off the field.

However, despite this initial setback, Greig dominated the remainder of the series scoring 430 runs at 47.7, taking 24 wickets (most of them with spin) at 22.6, and seven catches. He scored 148 runs, backed up with six wickets, in the third Test in Barbados, 121 in the fourth test in Guyana and won the fifth test in Trinidad for his team with bowling figures of 8 for 86 and 5 for 70. Many of his victims in this game were gained via off-spin, a new addition to the Greig repertoire. This victory enabled England to draw the series.

==Road to the captaincy==

During the summer of 1974, England faced three Tests against India and three against Pakistan. Overall, Greig averaged 41.5 with the bat and grabbed 14 wickets. His highlight was a century against India at Lord&#x27;s. This was a good tune-up for the Ashes tour of Australia at year&#x27;s end, where England would probably start favourite and Greig would be a key player. Shocked by the Australian fast bowling attack of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee, most English batsmen struggled in the first Test at Brisbane. However, Greig played a lone hand with 110 in the first innings.

Greig played in the first World Cup in England in 1975, when his team was eliminated by Australia in the semi-final. Although suited to the one-day game, Greig never really produced a major performance in the 22 ODIs that he played for England. After the tournament ended, Australia stayed on to play four Ashes Tests. England lost the first match at Edgbaston, and blame fell on the captain Mike Denness, who had just endured a 1–4 defeat in Australia. Denness was sacked and Greig appointed, to high expectation that he would play aggressively and fearlessly in an endeavour to counteract the Australians&#x27; strengths.

==Commercial skipper==

The transformation was swift. In the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, Greig received a huge ovation on his way to bat and delivered 96 runs. He scored 41 in the second innings and took three wickets in a drawn match that favoured England. The run continued in the next match at Leeds with England poised for victory at the end of the second last day. But vandals destroyed the pitch during the night and Greig agreed to abandon the match, thus conceding the Ashes. The final game ended in a long-winded draw. With a long gap between England commitments, Greig headed to Australia for the 1975–76 season to play grade cricket in Sydney. Greig was well known among colleagues as a man who wanted to take commercial advantage of his profile as a leading sportsman. He signed a number of endorsements and appeared in commercials in Australia, including in his ads for the new breakfast cereal &quot;Nutri-Grain&quot;, where his catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s just like a cricket bat with holes&quot; struck a chord.

==&quot;I intend to make them grovel&quot;==

When he returned to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, he spoke of the West Indies players:

The outcry was instantaneous. The word &quot;grovel&quot; had sinister connotations for West Indian people, many of whom have slave ancestry. Moreover, apartheid and the Gleneagles Agreement were prominent issues of the day, so a white South African using the word &quot;grovel&quot; heavily accentuated the &quot;faux pas&quot;. The West Indian fast bowlers took great delight in adding yards to their run-up when Greig came to the wicket and their supporters took equal delight when his wicket was captured. At times during the series, the West Indies were roundly criticised for their use of short-pitched bowling. To compensate for his unusual height and attempt to combat such bowling, Greig held the bat at shoulder height (rather than leave it on the ground) as the bowler ran in, thus not using a back swing of the bat. While it helped him to combat the short ball, it left him vulnerable to the yorker (full-pitch delivery) and he was bowled quite regularly for a top-order batsman: five times from his nine innings in the Test series, and once more in the second one-day international match. Outside of a formidable performance in the fourth Test at Leeds, where he fought back with 116 and 76 not out and shared a big partnership with wicketkeeper Alan Knott, Greig scored just 51 runs from his other seven innings. Worse, his bowling lost penetration and he took only five wickets as England slumped to a 0–3 series loss. However, Greig did not lose his sense of humour: exaggeratedly playing on his &quot;grovel&quot; comment, he pretended to crawl on his hands and knees in front of the open stands on the Harleyford Road side of The Oval in the last Test match, delighting the crowds that had previously jeered him.

==Redemption in India==

The best performance of Greig&#x27;s captaincy career came in 1976–77, when England toured India for a five-Test series. England had not won a Test series on the subcontinent for fifteen years and were clear underdogs against an Indian team that boasted some of the best spinners in the world and could count on the support of tens of thousands of vociferous fans who would fill the stadia. Greig made good use of his experience from his previous tour and consciously set out to build a rapport with the Indian crowd, for instance, playing &#x27;dead&#x27; when loud firecrackers went off in the ground. England went on to score one of their most convincing wins in a very long time when they won the first three Tests by huge margins. Greig rated the win at Calcutta, when he scored 103 on a broken pitch, and struggling with a stomach bug, in front of 100,000 Indian fans, as the finest moment of his career. With 342 runs (at 42) and ten wickets, Greig had regained form to take with him to Australia.

==Centenary Test and Packer==

After a brief sojourn in Sri Lanka, Greig&#x27;s team arrived in Australia in March 1977 to prepare for a unique moment in the game&#x27;s history. To commemorate 100 years of Australia vs England Test Matches, a one-off Test was organised for the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue of the first-ever Test. The associated functions and a gathering of hundreds of ex-players demonstrated the depth of the game and its history. Greig, recognising the spirit of the fixture, had his team play positively, and the match was still in the balance late on the last day before Australia won by 45 runs. Everyone marvelled at the margin, as it was the same as the first-ever Test, and there was a self-satisfied air to proceedings that would be shattered in just two months&#x27; time. Greig had played well in the match (18 and 41, two wickets and four catches) and he left an open letter with a newspaper thanking the people of Melbourne for their support. On his return home, a surprise crew was waiting to film an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Just weeks before, he had signed a contract with the owner of the Nine Network in Australia, Kerry Packer, to play cricket in a series that would take place during the next Australian summer.

Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer by signing a number of English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, although Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig&#x27;s Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig&#x27;s house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was taken aback by the severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.

Surprisingly, Greig retained his position in the team for the five Tests under his successor Mike Brearley. Jeering accompanied his appearance for the remainder of that summer. His form proved only average after he made a dramatic 91 at Lord&#x27;s in the opening Test. England defeated a dispirited Australian team 3–0 to reclaim the Ashes after four games. Brearley convinced the selectors to retain Greig for the last Test, and requested that he received a share of any bonus due to the team. Greig&#x27;s Test career ended quietly at The Oval on 30 August 1977.

But his work for World Series Cricket (WSC, Packer&#x27;s organisation) was just beginning. In September, backed by Packer, he was the plaintiff (along with Mike Procter and John Snow) in a case against the English authorities (the TCCB), who were attempting to ban Packer&#x27;s players from Test and first-class cricket. Greig was conspicuous throughout the trial and elated when the decision went in favour of WSC. The lack of regular domestic cricket as well as the intensity of World Series Cricket brought a premature end to his career as he could not recover from a poor start in the first season. The super-Test final of the 1978–79 season was the last match Greig played at any level of cricket. During an interview on the eve of the match, he &quot;promised&quot; a century to the audience. He fell short by exactly 100 runs, caught behind off his arch rival, Dennis Lillee.

==Epilepsy==

Greig had his first epileptic seizure at the age of 14, during a tennis match. As he successfully controlled the condition with medication and self-management, largely by sleeping as and when he could during Test Matches, few knew about it for much of his playing career. He was often forewarned by auras. In 1971–72, he collapsed on the field during his first match for Eastern Province and half a dozen teammates were required to hold down his large frame. The incident was explained away as heat stroke thanks to sympathetic media and team management. Returning from the tour of Australia in 1975, Greig had another epileptic seizure at Heathrow Airport. His condition became public during the Packer furore, when a number of commentators questioned his judgement in the matter and speculated that epilepsy impaired his ability to make decisions.

==Later career==

After forming a bond with the Nine Network&#x27;s Kerry Packer during the World Series Cricket days, Greig was offered a &quot;job for life&quot; by Packer as a commentator during Nine&#x27;s cricket coverage. Greig spent the rest of his life in Australia and continued his commentary role. He was regarded as one of cricket&#x27;s top commentators in his career, noted for being unbiased, witty, and deeply enthusiastic about the game. His pitch reports, where he would use a car key or a pen to illustrate pitch characteristics or crack sizes (including the odd moment where his implements would become stuck in the pitch), were fondly remembered and imitated by fans. During the 2006 Ashes Perth Test, on commenting on the need for England&#x27;s Steve Harmison to intimidate Australia&#x27;s number 11 Glenn McGrath, Greig indicated the need to &quot;Touch him up, before rolling him over&quot;.

Greig commentated for Channel Four in the United Kingdom, the SABC when making occasional trips home, and for Sky Sports&#x27; coverage of England&#x27;s 2012 tour of Sri Lanka. He also hosted a regular weekly podcast called &quot;The Tony Greig Show&quot; for Cricinfo, covering international cricket matters and airing his forthright views in a section called &quot;What&#x27;s eating Tony Greig this week?&quot;. His love of the game may be encapsulated by a comment he made on Cricinfo in mid-2012: &quot;Give your hand to cricket and it will take you on the most fantastic journey, a lifetime journey both on and off the field.&quot;

In 1999, Greig was involved in a controversy when, in a match at the North Sydney Oval, the camera zoomed onto a white, Caucasian man and an Asian woman in a marriage ceremony at a nearby church. Greig made a comment implying the woman shown was a mail-order bride: &quot;Do you think she&#x27;s been flown in?&quot;. He later said that the comment was made &quot;off microphone and not intended for broadcast&quot;. He joined the Indian Cricket League as an executive board member, but the league ultimately ceased relations due to the growing popularity of Indian Premier League. Greig was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).

Outside of cricket media, he served as a board member of Epilepsy Action Australia for 19 years up to his death. In March 2011, he was appointed as the brand ambassador for Sri Lanka Tourism. Initially, the appointment was for six months, for which he received about 10,000 (A$16,331 in 2021 terms).

On 26 June 2012, Greig delivered the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture and criticised the BCCI for misuse of powers and money and continuously rejecting the ICC&#x27;s call for universal acceptance of the Umpire Decision Review System. He also asked the BCCI to abandon self-interest and &quot;embrace the spirit of cricket and govern in the best interests of world cricket, not just for India and its business partners.&quot;

Tony Greig is regarded fondly by Sri Lankan cricket fans. He would often take the opportunity to advertise the country as a tourist destination during his commentary. A thinly veiled fictionalised version of Greig as a TV pundit living a rockstar lifestyle behind the scenes appeared in the Gratiaen-, Commonwealth-, and DSC South Asian Literature prize–winning novel &quot;Chinaman: The Legend of Pradeep Mathew&quot; by Shehan Karunatilaka.

==Lung cancer and death==

Greig began to have severe bouts of coughing in May 2012; initially, bronchitis was diagnosed. After undergoing tests, a small but malignant lesion was found in his right lung. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2012. He underwent an operation for the cancer in November, and the same month he told fellow commentator Mark Nicholas during an interview broadcast by the Nine Network that &quot;It&#x27;s not good. The truth is I&#x27;ve got lung cancer. It&#x27;s now just a question of what they can do.&quot;

Greig died at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Sydney on 29 December 2012 after going into cardiac arrest following a suspected heart attack. He was 66.

<doc id="965361" wikidata="Q7625238" url="?curid=965361" title="Structuring element">
<text>In mathematical morphology, a structuring element is a shape, used to probe or interact with a given image, with the purpose of drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. It is typically used in morphological operations, such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, as well as the hit-or-miss transform.

According to Georges Matheron, knowledge about an object (e.g., an image) depends on the manner in which we probe (observe) it. In particular, the choice of a certain structuring element for a particular morphological operation influences the information one can obtain. There are two main characteristics that are directly related to structuring elements: 
* Shape. For example, the structuring element can be a &quot;ball&quot; or a line; convex or a ring, etc. By choosing a particular structuring element, one sets a way of differentiating some objects (or parts of objects) from others, according to their shape or spatial orientation.
* Size. For example, one structuring element can be a formula_1 square or a formula_2 square. Setting the size of the structuring element is similar to setting the observation scale, and setting the criterion to differentiate image objects or features according to size.

==Mathematical particulars and examples==
Structuring elements are particular cases of binary images, usually being small and simple. In mathematical morphology, binary images are subsets of a Euclidean space &quot;R&quot;&quot;d&quot; or the integer grid &quot;Z&quot;&quot;d&quot;, for some dimension &quot;d&quot;. Here are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by &quot;B&quot;):

* Let &quot;E&quot;=&quot;R&quot;2; &quot;B&quot; is an open disk of radius &quot;r&quot;, centered at the origin.
* Let &quot;E&quot;=&quot;Z&quot;2; &quot;B&quot; is a 3x3 square, that is, &quot;B&quot;={(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)}.
* Let &quot;E&quot;=&quot;Z&quot;2; &quot;B&quot; is the &quot;cross&quot; given by: &quot;B&quot;={(-1,0),(0,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)}.

In the discrete case, a structuring element can also be represented as a set of pixels on a grid, assuming the values 1 (if the pixel belongs to the structuring element) or 0 (otherwise).

When used by a hit-or-miss transform, usually the structuring element is a composite of two disjoint sets (two simple structuring elements), one associated to the foreground, and one associated to the background of the image to be probed. In this case, an alternative representation of the composite structuring element is as a set of pixels which are either set (1, associated to the foreground), not set (0, associated to the background) or &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;.

<doc id="965363" wikidata="Q7767315" url="?curid=965363" title="The Sun (Malaysia)">
<text>The Sun (branded as theSun) is Malaysia&#x27;s national daily newspaper in tabloid form. Available from Mondays to Fridays except on public holiday, with a target audience of white-collar workers and urban youth.

Published by Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd, which is part of the Berjaya Media Group (formerly known as Nexnews Berhad), &quot;theSun&quot; was launched on 1 June 1993, which was originally &quot;The Sun&quot;. It stopped publication on 30 June 1994, for a revamp, and resumed a month later.

In audited circulation figures by Audit Bureau of Circulations Malaysia for January–June 2015, &quot;theSun&quot; was the highest circulated English newspaper, with a circulation of 306,249.

== History ==
Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd (SMCSB) was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 19 July 1991 as a private limited company under the name of Fikiran Abadi Sdn Bhd. On 8 December 1994, it changed its name to Sun Media Group Sdn Bhd before assuming its present name on 22 August 1998.

The principal activity of SMCSB is the publication of &quot;theSun&quot; newspaper, an English language national daily that was launched in 1993. On 8 April 2002, &quot;theSun&quot; newspaper was relaunched as a free national daily.

On 4 March 2008, Berjaya Corporation Berhad acquired a substantial stake from the holding company, Nexnews Berhad, and consequently SMCSB has been announced to be a subsidiary of Berjaya Corporation Berhad. On 23 April 2008, Nexnews Berhad changed its name to Berjaya Media Berhad.

== Sections ==
&quot;theSun&quot; covers national and international news as well as sports, property, media &amp; marketing and lifestyle &amp; entertainment. It has been redesigned with plenty of news briefs to cater to the reading habits of busy executives - the paper&#x27;s target audience.

&quot;theSun&quot; weekend was launched in the weekend of 15–16 May 2004, a revamp of its Saturday issue. It was discontinued in March 2006 due to its inconsistency with the free paper model.

== Target audience ==
As of 2010, &quot;theSun&quot; prints and distributes 300,512 copies a day to approximately 3,337 targeted distribution points, called &quot;SunSpots&quot; (office buildings, condominiums, LRT stations, fast food outlets), primarily in the Klang Valley, also known as Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. People can also get a copy of &quot;theSun&quot; in almost all Malaysian 7-Eleven stores or pay a newsvendor to deliver the paper to their homes. The paper&#x27;s circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC).

In 2006, prompted by the rising demand for copies and advertisers&#x27; thirst for a wider reach, &quot;theSun&quot;, increased its print run by 76%. The increase took place in two phases, the first on 8 March, with circulation bumped up to 230,000 from 150,000 previously. The second phase saw circulation rising by another 15% to 265,000 copies on 2 October. Out of that, 215,000 copies are distributed in the Klang Valley, solidifying &quot;theSun&quot; position as the top English daily in the nation&#x27;s top consumer region.

== Awards ==
&quot;theSun&quot; has won several awards for advertising. The Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia (4As) has awarded &quot;theSun&quot; the Media Partner of the Year Award (2004/2005). In the recent Malaysian Media Awards 2005, advertisements by MindShare/Nike and mediaedge:cia/ING Insurance published in &quot;theSun&quot; won Gold and Silver awards respectively.

In March 2007, &quot;theSun&quot; achieved another milestone when three of its journalists won top awards given by the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) based in Hong Kong. SOPA, the Asian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize in the United States, picked theSun for Excellence in Public Service Journalism and Opinion Writing. The competition included more established regional publications.

A first award, for Excellence in Opinion Writing, was for a series of six commentaries written by assistant news editor Jacqueline Ann Surin, who wrote a fortnightly column, Shape of a Pocket, published in the &quot;eXtra!&quot; section on Thursday. Surin beat an entry from the Far Eastern Economic Review&#x27;s series of commentaries on Singapore, which received an honorary mention.

&quot;theSun&quot; second win, for Public Service Journalism, was for the story &quot;Low Cost Palace&quot; by the Special Reporting and Investigations team of editor R. Nadeswaran and deputy news editor Terence Fernandez who exposed the illegal mansion built by a former Selangor executive councillor.

SOPA again gave &quot;theSun&quot; two awards in 2008; honourable mentions for Terence Fernancez and R. Nadeswaran in Public Service Journalism for their reports on the failed sports training centre in Brickendonbury and for R. Nadeswaran for Opinion Writing for his Citizen Nades bi-weekly columns.

&quot;theSun&quot; has also won a number of Malaysian journalism awards for entertainment writing and investigative reporting.

== Criticism ==
During the 1994 revamp of the newspaper, The Sun has been criticised for using a national flag in the masthead for commercial purposes. The Home Ministry said that the newspaper should not use the national flag in the masthead without permission. The newspaper resumed publication on 1 August 1994.

<doc id="965370" wikidata="Q5179620" url="?curid=965370" title="Cowcaddens">
<text>Cowcaddens (; , ) is an area of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It sits directly north of the city centre and is bordered by the newer area of Garnethill to the south-west and Townhead to the east.

Cowcaddens was originally a village and became an industrious and thriving part of the expanding Glasgow, being close to Port Dundas and the Forth and Clyde Canal immediately to its north. Its boundaries merged into the City of Glasgow in 1846. By the 1880s, the area was becoming a slum district with the highest level of infant mortality (190 per thousand births) in the city, a figure which was three times that of the West End. Like neighbouring Townhead, Cowcaddens was one of many areas in Glasgow declared a Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) by Glasgow Corporation which led to the mass demolition of the tenement slums, and their replacement with a mixture of lower density housing, commercial and educational zones. The construction of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road in the late 1960s brought huge changes to the northern part of Cowcaddens with major realignment of roads and throughfares.

Cowcaddens is served by Cowcaddens subway station on the Glasgow Subway system, and by bus services through it and emanating from Buchanan Bus Station. Glasgow Caledonian University is nearby.

The northern part of Cowcaddens forms part of the city&#x27;s &#x27;learning quarter&#x27; with neighbouring Townhead. In 1971 the new Glasgow College of Technology (GCT) was founded (in response to the city&#x27;s previous higher education college – the Royal College of Science and Technology – being elevated to university status to form the University of Strathclyde in 1964); an all new campus was constructed on the former site of Buchanan Street railway station in the early 1970s. GCT itself became a university in 1992 when it was renamed Glasgow Caledonian University, and has continued to grow and expand on the Cowcaddens site.

The southern fringes of Cowcaddens have historically housed one of Glasgow&#x27;s premier entertainment districts, with theatres and cinemas dotted throughout the neighbourhood. Notable venues included: the Theatre Royal on Hope Street; The Royalty Theatre on Sauchiehall and Renfield Streets; The Grand Theatre at Cowcaddens Cross; The Scottish Zoo and Hippodrome on New City Road; The Pavilion Theatre on Renfield Street; Green&#x27;s Playhouse, later the Apollo music hall on Renfrew Street; The Glasgow Film Theatre on Rose Street; The STV headquarters, built in 1974 on Renfield Street. As of 2021, only the Royal, Pavilion, and GFT remain, and the site of the old Apollo is now home to a Cineworld. Since 1988 the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, formerly RSAMD, has had its main campus on Renfrew Street, with another facility on Garscube Road. The former Cowcaddens Free Church now houses the National Piping Centre.

Housing in the area is primarily ex-council housing (there are no council houses in Glasgow since their transfer to the Glasgow Housing Association).

In 2007 the Cowcaddens pedestrian underpass was decorated with 15 screen prints by artist Ruth Barker.

==Cowcaddens Road==

Cowcaddens Road appeared on maps since at least 1560, as one continuous road that connected the small village of Cowcaddens to the burgeoning town of Glasgow. This was, until 1766, the Cow Lone, an unpaved road where herders would take their cattle up the hill to Cowcaddens where the animals would graze and be milked in the evening. This path would follow the alignment of current-day Queen Street, veering northwest off of George Square where Queen Street railway station is today. From there, it would join up with Buchanan Street, following toward Port Dundas before turning west into Cowcaddens Street. 

The alignment of Cowcaddens Street was altered slightly during a redevelopment beginning in 1968 and continuing into the late 1970&#x27;s. Several tenement blocks were demolished, and the road was brought slightly up the slope of Garnethill, and elevated. This facilitated new connections with Cambridge and Rose Streets, which both previously veered northwest into New City Road instead, as well as a new route into Great Western Road via West Graham Street, another new connection created by this new alignment. Other connections were severed however – New City Road chiefly among them. Itself vastly transformed by the construction of the M8 motorway, New City Road now leads into an underpass below Cowcaddens Road to the Subway – all that remains of Cowcaddens Cross. The road was also straightened and lengthened eastward to meet North Hanover Street, through where Buchanan Street railway station once stood. However, the original alignment of Cowcaddens Street is still preserved somewhat in Dundasvale Road, between the National Piping Centre and Garscube Road.

==People==

The socialist politician Edward Hunter, who was instrumental in helping build the Left in New Zealand, was a Labour councillor for Cowcaddens from 1937 until 1959.

Jimmy Barnes and his elder brother John Swan (aka Swanee) spent their early childhood living in Cowcaddens before emigrating to Australia.

<doc id="965373" wikidata="Q407515" url="?curid=965373" title="Silver bromide">
<text>Silver bromide (AgBr), a soft, pale-yellow, water-insoluble salt well known (along with other silver halides) for its unusual sensitivity to light. This property has allowed silver halides to become the basis of modern photographic materials. AgBr is widely used in photographic films and is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin. The salt can be found naturally as the mineral bromargyrite (bromyrite).

==Preparation==
Although the compound can be found in mineral form, AgBr is typically prepared by the reaction of silver nitrate with an alkali bromide, typically potassium bromide:

:AgNO3(aq) + KBr(aq) → AgBr(s)+ KNO3(aq)

Although less convenient, the salt can also be prepared directly from its elements.

Modern preparation of a simple, light-sensitive surface involves forming an emulsion of silver halide crystals in a gelatine, which is then coated onto a film or other support. The crystals are formed by precipitation in a controlled environment to produce small, uniform crystals (typically &lt; 1 μm in diameter and containing ~1012 Ag atoms) called grains.

==Reactions==
Silver bromide reacts readily with liquid ammonia to generate a variety of ammine complexes, like and . In general:

:AgBr + m NH3 + (n - 1) → 
Silver bromide reacts with triphenylphosphine to give a tris(triphenylphosphine) product:

==Physical properties==

===Crystal structure===
AgF, AgCl, and AgBr all have face-centered cubic (fcc) rock-salt (NaCl) lattice structure with the following lattice parameters:

The larger halide ions are arranged in a cubic close-packing, while the smaller silver ions fill the octahedral gaps between them, giving a 6-coordinate structure where a silver ion Ag+ is surrounded by 6 Br− ions, and vice versa. The coordination geometry for AgBr in the NaCl structure is unexpected for Ag(I) which typically forms linear, trigonal (3-coordinated Ag) or tetrahedral (4-coordinated Ag) complexes.

Unlike the other silver halides, iodargyrite (AgI) contains a hexagonal zincite lattice structure.

===Solubility===
The silver halides have a wide range of solubilities. The solubility of AgF is about 6 × 107 times that of AgI. These differences are attributed to the relative solvation enthalpies of the halide ions; the enthalpy of solvation of fluoride is anomalously large.

===Photosensitivity===
Although photographic processes have been in development since the mid-1800s, there were no suitable theoretical explanations until 1938 with the publication of a paper by R.W. Gurney and N.F. Mott. This paper triggered a large amount of research in fields of solid-state chemistry and physics, as well more specifically in silver halide photosensitivity phenomena.

Further research into this mechanism revealed that the photographic properties of silver halides (in particular AgBr) were a result of deviations from an ideal crystal structure. Factors such as crystal growth, impurities, and surface defects all affect concentrations of point ionic defects and electronic traps, which affect the sensitivity to light and allow for the formation of a latent image.

;Frenkel defects and quadropolar deformation
The major defect in silver halides is the Frenkel defect, where silver ions are located interstitially (Agi+) in high concentration with their corresponding negatively charged silver-ion vacancies (Agv−). What is unique about AgBr Frenkel pairs is that the interstitial Agi+ are exceptionally mobile, and that its concentration in the layer below the grain surface (called the space-charge layer) far exceeds that of the intrinsic bulk. The formation energy of the Frenkel pair is low at 1.16 eV, and the migration activation energy is unusually low at 0.05 eV (compare to NaCl: 2.18 eV for the formation of a Schottky pair and 0.75 eV for cationic migration). These low energies result in large defect concentrations, which can reach near 1% near the melting point.

The low activation energy in silver bromide can be attributed the silver ions&#x27; high quadrupolar polarizability; that is, it can easily deform from a sphere into an ellipsoid. This property, a result of the d9 electronic configuration of the silver ion, facilitates migration in both the silver ion and in silver-ion vacancies, thus giving the unusually low migration energy (for Agv−: 0.29–0.33 eV, compared to 0.65 eV for NaCl).

Studies have demonstrated that the defect concentrations are strongly affected (up to several powers of 10) by crystal size. Most defects, such as interstitial silver ion concentration and surface kinks, are inversely proportional to crystal size, although vacancy defects are directly proportional. This phenomenon is attributed to changes in the surface chemistry equilibrium, and thus affects each defect concentration differently.

Impurity concentrations can be controlled by crystal growth or direct addition of impurities to the crystal solutions. Although impurities in the silver bromide lattice are necessary to encourage Frenkel defect formation, studies by Hamilton have shown that above a specific concentration of impurities, the numbers of defects of interstitial silver ions and positive kinks reduce sharply by several orders of magnitude. After this point, only silver-ion vacancy defects, which actually increase by several orders of magnitude, are prominent.

;Electron traps and hole traps
When light is incident on the silver halide grain surface, a photoelectron is generated when a halide loses its electron to the conduction band:

:X− + hν → X + e− 

After the electron is released, it will combine with an interstitial Agi+ to create a silver metal atom Agi0:

:e− + Agi+ → Agi0

Through the defects in the crystal, the electron is able to reduce its energy and become trapped in the atom. The extent of grain boundaries and defects in the crystal affect the lifetime of the photoelectron, where crystals with a large concentration of defects will trap an electron much faster than a purer crystal.

When a photoelectron is mobilized, a photohole h• is also formed, which also needs to be neutralized. The lifetime of a photohole, however, does not correlate with that of a photoelectron. This detail suggests a different trapping mechanism; Malinowski suggests that the hole traps may be related to defects as a result of impurities. Once trapped, the holes attract mobile, negatively charged defects in the lattice: the interstitial silver vacancy Agv−:

:h• + Agv− h.Agv

The formation of the h.Agv lowers its energy sufficiently to stabilize the complex and reduce the probability of ejection of the hole back into the valance band (the equilibrium constant for hole-complex in the interior of the crystal is estimated at 10−4.

Additional investigations on electron- and hole-trapping demonstrated that impurities also can be a significant trapping system. Consequently, interstitial silver ions may not be reduced. Therefore, these traps are actually loss mechanisms, and are considered trapping inefficiencies. For example, atmospheric oxygen can interact with photoelectrons to form an O2− species, which can interact with a hole to reverse the complex and undergo recombination. Metal ion impurities such as copper(I), iron(II), and cadmium(II) have demonstrated hole-trapping in silver bromide.

;Crystal surface chemistry;
Once the hole-complexes are formed, they diffuse to the surface of the grain as a result of the formed concentration gradient. Studies demonstrated that the lifetimes of holes near the surface of the grain are much longer than those in the bulk, and that these holes are in equilibrium with adsorbed bromine. The net effect is an equilibrium push at the surface to form more holes. Therefore, as the hole-complexes reach the surface, they disassociate:

:h.Agv− → h• + Agv− → Br → FRACTION Br2

By this reaction equilibrium, the hole-complexes are constantly consumed at the surface, which acts as a sink, until removed from the crystal. This mechanism provides the counterpart to the reduction of the interstitial Agi+ to Agi0, giving an overall equation of:

:AgBr → Ag + FRACTION Br2

;Latent image formation and photography
Now that some of the theory has been presented, the actual mechanism of the photographic process can be discussed. To summarize, as a photographic film is subjected to an image, photons incident on the grain produce electrons which interact to yield silver metal. More photons hitting a particular grain will produce a larger concentration of silver atoms, containing between 5 and 50 silver atoms (out of ~1012 atoms), depending on the sensitivity of the emulsion. The film now has a concentration gradient of silver atom specks based upon varying intensity light across its area, producing an invisible &quot;latent image&quot;.

While this process is occurring, bromine atoms are being produced at the surface of the crystal. To collect the bromine, a layer on top of the emulsion, called a sensitizer, acts as a bromine acceptor.

During film development the latent image is intensified by addition of a chemical, typically hydroquinone, that selectivity reduces those grains which contain atoms of silver. The process, which is sensitive to temperature and concentration, will completely reduce grains to silver metal, intensifying the latent image on the order of 1010 to 1011. This step demonstrates the advantage and superiority of silver halides over other systems: the latent image, which takes only milliseconds to form and is invisible, is sufficient to produce a full image from it.

After development, the film is &quot;fixed&quot;, during which the remaining silver salts are removed to prevent further reduction, leaving the &quot;negative&quot; image on the film. The agent used is sodium thiosulfate, and reacts according to the following equation:

:AgX(s) + 2 Na2S2O3(aq) → Na3[Ag(S2O3)2](aq) + NaX(aq)

An indefinite number of positive prints can be generated from the negative by passing light through it and undertaking the same steps outlined above.

===Semiconductor properties===
As silver bromide is heated within 100 °C of its melting point, an Arrhenius plot of the ionic conductivity shows the value increasing and &quot;upward-turning&quot;. Other physical properties such as elastic moduli, specific heat, and the electronic energy gap also increase, suggesting the crystal is approaching instability. This behavior, typical of a semi-conductor, is attributed to a temperature-dependence of Frenkel defect formation, and, when normalized against the concentration of Frenkel defects, the Arrhenius plot linearizes.

<text>In mathematics, a minimal counterexample is the smallest example which falsifies a claim, and a proof by minimal counterexample is a method of proof which combines the use of a minimal counterexample with the ideas of proof by induction and proof by contradiction. More specifically, in trying to prove a proposition &quot;P&quot;, one first assumes by contradiction that it is false, and that therefore there must be at least one counterexample. With respect to some idea of size (which may need to be chosen carefully), one then concludes that there is such a counterexample &quot;C&quot; that is &quot;minimal&quot;. In regard to the argument, &quot;C&quot; is generally something quite hypothetical (since the truth of &quot;P&quot; excludes the possibility of &quot;C&quot;), but it may be possible to argue that if &quot;C&quot; existed, then it would have some definite properties which, after applying some reasoning similar to that in an inductive proof, would lead to a contradiction, thereby showing that the proposition &quot;P&quot; is indeed true. 

If the form of the contradiction is that we can derive a further counterexample &quot;D&quot;, that is smaller than &quot;C&quot; in the sense of the working hypothesis of minimality, then this technique is traditionally called proof by infinite descent. In which case, there may be multiple and more complex ways to structure the argument of the proof. 

The assumption that if there is a counterexample, there is a minimal counterexample, is based on a well-ordering of some kind. The usual ordering on the natural numbers is clearly possible, by the most usual formulation of mathematical induction; but the scope of the method can include well-ordered induction of any kind.

== Examples ==
The minimal counterexample method has been much used in the classification of finite simple groups. The Feit–Thompson theorem, that finite simple groups that are not cyclic groups have even order, was proved based on the hypothesis of some, and therefore some minimal, simple group &quot;G&quot; of odd order. Every proper subgroup of &quot;G&quot; can be assumed a solvable group, meaning that much theory of such subgroups could be applied.

Euclid&#x27;s proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a simple proof which uses a minimal counterexample.

Courant and Robbins used the term minimal criminal for a minimal counter-example in the context of the four color theorem.

<text>Trabuco Canyon (&quot;Trabuco&quot;, Spanish for &quot;Blunderbuss&quot;) is a small unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains in eastern Orange County, California, and lies partly within the Cleveland National Forest.

Trabuco Canyon is north of the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. Plano Trabuco Road leads from the top of the canyon south to Rancho Santa Margarita.

==History==
Trabuco is Spanish for blunderbuss, a type of shotgun. Some credit a Franciscan friar traveling with the Gaspar de Portolá Expedition in 1769 with the story that a blunderbuss was lost in the canyon, after which the area was named. A mission was originally to be built in the canyon, but was instead established in San Juan Capistrano.

The Trabuco Adobe was built in 1810 next to the Acjachemen village of Alume that was also identified during the 1769 Portolá expedition, where Juan Crespí wrote, &quot;we made camp close to a village of the most tractable and friendly heathens we have seen upon the whole way.&quot;

John (Don Juan) Forster received a Mexican land grant in 1846 and established Rancho Trabuco. The grant was bordered by Rancho Cañada de los Alisos on the west, and by Rancho Mission Viejo on the east.

Trabuco Canyon was the site of attempts to mine tin in the early 1900s. Mining remains from this activity include: tunnels into the sides of the canyon &quot;(closed for public safety)&quot;; the stone foundation of an ore-processing stamp mill; and several dams on the creek.

The Trabuco Canyon National Forest was established in 1907, which was quickly combined into the Cleveland National Forest in 1908.

One of the last California grizzly bears was killed in Trabuco Canyon in 1908, a female bear thought to be the mate of the so-called &quot;Monster of San Mateo.&quot;

On October 21, 2007, a large wildfire started in Silverado Canyon and spread to Trabuco Canyon. The Canyon was evacuated by the Fire Department.

On August 23, 2023, it was the site of a mass shooting that resulted in four dead, including the perpetrator, and six injured.

On September 9, 2024, a spark from heavy equipment working near Trabuco Creek Road caused a wildfire within Trabuco Canyon, dubbed the Airport Fire. The fire spread to Santiago Peak. The Canyon and nearby residencies were evacuated by the local Fire Department.

==Features==
Fourth of July features an old-fashioned parade of locals riding horses and pulling home-made floats. A local landmark is the Trabuco Oaks Steakhouse, which was a favorite restaurant of former President Richard Nixon.

The Vedanta Society of Southern California has the Ramakrishna Mission monastery on in the canyon, founded in 1942 by author and philosopher Gerald Heard. The Trabuco Canyon Community Church is located in the canyon also.

==Demographics==
For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau first listed Trabuco Canyon as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 census.

<doc id="965380" wikidata="Q7830118" url="?curid=965380" title="Townhead">
<text>Townhead (, ) is a district within the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It is one of Glasgow&#x27;s oldest areas, and contains two of its major surviving medieval landmarks – Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand&#x27;s Lordship.

In medieval times, Townhead was the gateway into Glasgow from the north, while today it forms the north eastern extremity of the city centre. Townhead experienced great change between the mid 1950s and late 1970s following the publication of the infamous Bruce Plan, when it was substantially depopulated and redeveloped. Today, it contains a much reduced resident population, a commercial/industrial sector and an educational quarter centred around the campuses of both the University of Strathclyde and City of Glasgow College.

==Location==
In ancient times, Townhead was an undeveloped area situated north of the cathedral and town with no definitive boundaries. Today, it is bordered to the west by Cowcaddens, to the north by Sighthill, to the east by Royston and Ladywell/Dennistoun and to the south by the Merchant City. The notional boundaries of Townhead are thus North Hanover Street and Dobbie&#x27;s Loan to the west, the M8 motorway to the north, Castle Street and High Street to the east and George Street to the south.

==Housing==
Housing is primarily ex-council stock (Glasgow has no council houses since their transfer to the Glasgow Housing Association), although the area contains a large number of student residences for International Christian College, Glasgow Caledonian University and Strathclyde University. Most of the housing units are fairly modern &quot;8 in a block&quot; flats, although its most visually obvious features are the four 24-storey high-rise flats named &quot;2 Taylor Place&quot;, &quot;15 Grafton Place&quot;, &quot;7 St Mungo&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;12 Dobbies Loan Place&quot;.

== History==

===Early history 15th–20th century===
It is widely accepted that near the eastern edge of modern day Townhead, is where St Kentigern, also known as St Mungo, built his church by the banks of the Molendinar Burn and thus established Glasgow. Glasgow Cathedral, dedicated to St Mungo, is roughly situated where Mungo&#x27;s original church once stood. The present building dates back to the 12th century. Today, the Cathedral sits immediately outside of Townhead&#x27;s boundaries and falls into the Ladywell area.

Provand&#x27;s Lordship, Glasgow&#x27;s oldest remaining house, was constructed from the late 15th century by Bishop Andrew, later given the surname Muirhead as part of St Nicholas Hospital, a lodging for the poor. The hospital, or more accurately hospitium, provided accommodation and care for twelve poor men who contributed through work in the hospital, Bible study and growing produce in the gardens. The gardens were restored in 1997 and, like the original St Nicolas garden, the herbs grown are those known for healing properties and medicinal use.

The martyrdom of the Covenanters took place in the modern area called Townhead. The northern part of Castle Street was the town limits beyond which was called the &quot;Howgait&quot;. Howgait was the scene of public hangings and used until 1781, when they moved to Glasgow Green. The area is now mainly taken up by Junction 15 of the M8.

The former Martyrs&#x27; Church building (moved to its current location in 1975 and then closed by members vote in 2011) contained until September 2013 the Martyrs stone, which details the executions in 1684 of James Nisbet (a farmer from Louden Parish in Ayrshire), James Lawson and Alex Wood. The stone, which originally stood in front of Townhead library, along with a large part of the once densely packed Townhead, was demolished to make way for the M8 motorway. The stone can now be found in the church wall of &quot;The Evangelical Church&quot; which is at the South East side of Cathedral square. Martyrs church also contained the &quot;Martyrs church bell&quot;, which was preserved from the old Martyrs West church building until 2013 at which point, finding no new home, the bell was melted. The church of Scotland is currently seeking a buyer for the land which has planning permission for an extensive housing development and community building.

The Church of Scotland still supporting Townhead through the parish ministry of Glasgow Cathedral and by giving temporary accommodation to SIMY Community Development charity which was formally an active part of the previous church&#x27;s parish care. Since closure, SIMY has become an independent, local volunteer lead charity providing youth work support, arts provision, sports coaching, life skills, outdoor education, drop in diversionary clubs and is a DofE centre. SiMY owes its survival to the support it receives from the Church, Iona Community, Townhead community council, AplusM training, Glasgow Housing Association, Glasgow Community Safety Services, Glasgow Life and a dedicated group of volunteers many of whom have grown up in the local area or work nearby.

St Mungo&#x27;s Church, Parson Street (George Goldie, 1869) is Italiante-Gothic in style. 70 Parson Street is the birthplace of architect Charles Rennie MacIntosh, who also aided in the design of Martyr&#x27;s School, at 17 Parson Street.

===Mid 20th century to present: slum clearance, gentrification and regeneration===

In line with post-war gentrification going on in Glasgow at the time, and in line with recommendations from the Bruce Report, and the wider trend towards slum clearance the mid 1950s onward saw great change in Townhead. Like Anderston and the Gorbals, Townhead was designated a Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), which meant that huge swathes of tenement housing was demolished and its population rehomed. Townhead&#x27;s original main thoroughfare – Parliamentary Road, was destroyed along with most of the original street plan, upon which new housing estates – a mixture of lower density maisonette blocks and four 24-storey tower blocks replaced the old tenement housing. While some Townhead residents were rehomed in the new buildings, others were moved to new estates on the outer fringes of the city. As a result, almost none of the tenements in Townhead have survived, although some of the original street names live on in the names of the tower blocks and footpaths. North of Parliamentary Road, the cleared area was devoted to a new industrial zone, which stretched towards Baird Street with the new Glasgow Inner Ring Road acting as its boundary, and comprised mainly new industrial units. The controversial eastern flank of the ring road, which would have swung southwards along the route of Castle Street and necessitated the demolition and rebuilding of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, was abandoned and the original Victorian hospital was given an indefinite stay of execution (although the hospital was substantially expanded in the late 1970s). The artist Joan Eardley captured much of this redevelopment from her studio in Townhead.

The southern reaches of Townhead between Parliamentary Road and George Street were cleared to make way for a new educational zone, which would see several new colleges constructed such as the Central College of Commerce, Glasgow College of Food Technology and Stow College of Building. The centerpiece of this area would be the new University of Strathclyde, created out of the former Royal College of Science and Technology. Here can be found the most famous and oldest of Townhead&#x27;s streets – Rottenrow. It was from this high vantage point at the top of Balmanno Brae that St. Mungo could see, south, down to the River Clyde and be forewarned of the approach of any hostile people. Rottenrow was also home to the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. This hospital was demolished in 2001, and replaced by a garden.

In 1972, agreement was reached between the publishing company William Collins, Sons and the University of Strathclyde for the latter to acquire its printing works located at the eastern end of Cathedral Street which was once one of the biggest industrial complexes in Townhead. The land and buildings were turned over for academic use – a notable example being the giant warehouse building at the junction of Cathedral Street and St James&#x27;s Road being converted to a new home for the Andersonian Library in 1980.

The New Barony Church was acquired by the University of Strathclyde in 1986, restored in 1989, and is now a ceremonial hall and events venue known as the Barony Hall.

The 2010s saw the creation of the new City of Glasgow College, which was formed from an earlier amalgamation of several further education colleges in the city (Glasgow Metropolitan College). A new &quot;supercampus&quot; was built on the former site of Allan Glen&#x27;s College on Cathedral Street, and opened in 2014. The University of Strathclyde built a new sports centre adjacent the same year.

== Artistic connections==
The artist Joan Eardley spent the years 1950–1957 living and working in Townhead and was especially interested in portraying its children.

==Recent developments==
Townhead has a community council of local volunteers. Recently Townhead was merged for community council purposes with the neighbouring Ladywell area of Glasgow. This resulted in the formation of Townhead and Ladywell Community Council. The community council members were instrumental in obtaining the funding for a village hall in Townhead, which opened in 2013. They were less successful in obtaining planning concessions in relation to a massive campus development being built in Townhead by City of Glasgow College. Although this area of Townhead had long been zoned for educational use as far back as the 1950s, the community council had expressed concerns about the proximity of the development to residential property, and argued for special planning conditions to be included given the potential for disruption to local people. Townhead has witnessed an abnormally high number of applications to convert standard homes into Houses of Multiple occupation (bedsits). The local community council has been at the forefront of articulating the local community&#x27;s concerns in this regard.

The recent sell off of the Glasgow Cathedral, Martyrs church building Removed a key community meeting space from the community and is due to add more student housing to the area.

SIMY Community Development, a large local volunteer-run youth and community charity, are backed by the community council in efforts to develop new youth work for young people in Townhead by transporting to other areas as Townhead no longer as any indoor sports areas. The demolition of the Martyrs church will be the third large community building removed from the area since 2012 which saw the closure of St David School and The Hurdy Gurdy. It will also remove the only indoor sports courts still available to the public and community groups in the G4 / South G21 area.

SiMY&#x27;s silver DofE groups were working to improve the environment around the form Martyrs church building aesthetically as well as making it a useful place for them once the building is demolished. They were unsuccessful in their submitted plan for &quot;stalled spaces&quot; project as the General trustees of the church of Scotland were concerns that any work could hamper sale of the land. The DofE&#x27;s group plans were supported by the &quot;Townhead and Ladywell Community Council&quot; and so are seeking advice from Glasgow Planning about possibilities.

The Martyrs stone was moved on 12 September 2013 to the Glasgow Evangelical Church in Cathedral square by Glasgow City Council at the request of the Glasgow Evangelical Church and the Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association to Cathedral Square, a historical centre of Glasgow, where it can be seen by Glaswegians and tourists.

The Townhead Village Hall opened in 2013 and provides for social activities and services for the Townhead community. The building and the land on which it has been built is owned by a community led company. With the recent changes preventing school lets in St Mungos School, the Village Hall is now the only facilities with space for community activities and functions. The hall is in use every day and evening providing vital services to the local community and private function space Thursday – Sunday. In Nov 2013 the village hall opened their Townhead Orchard providing a green space for local residence to enjoy gardening and tree maintenance under the supervision of centre staff during opening hours. The garden is protected by a high fence and security cameras.

In 2013, Townhead&#x27;s status as the city&#x27;s largest educational zone was expanded with planning applications being received for increased student accommodation to match the new large college campus for the area. This is part of the council&#x27;s 2013–2018 development strategy for the area

<text>The Société d&#x27;Études Aéronautiques (SEA) (, &quot;Society for Aeronautical Studies&quot;) was a French aircraft manufacturer founded in 1916 by Henry Potez, Marcel Bloch, and Louis Coroller at Suresnes.

Having been established amid the First World War, the company was from its onset focused upon the manufacture of military aircraft. It quickly found work producing large numbers of combat aircraft on behalf of the French military. However, following the end of the conflict, a major glut in surplus aircraft and the cancellation of many outstanding orders rapidly pushed the company into dire straights. Some officials, like Bloch, decided to withdraw from the aviation sector entirely in light of the poor economic prospects of the early 1920s aviation market.

==History==
The formation of the Société d’Etudes Aéronautiques (SEA) can be largely attributed to the undertakings of two French engineers, Henry Potez and Marcel Bloch. Prior to SEA, Potez and Bloch had been talented aeronautical engineers that decided to form a partnership to development and manufacture of their original design of propellers, establishing the Société des Hélices Éclair. However, they soon sought to go beyond just manufacturing components, but to undertake the design and construction of whole aircraft, thus, they both joined forces with another friend, Louis Coroller, to establish SEA. Its founding coincided with the First World War, and thus much of its activity was heavily influenced by the demands and lack thereof from this conflict.
The company was originally engaged to manufacture the SPAD VII fighter under licence. However, it soon developed its original designs and put those into production as well. Several early aircraft, starting with the SEA I, proved somewhat unsatisfactory and requiring further development. However, one such aircraft, the SEA IV, was selected for production for the French military. The &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Armement et des Fabrications de guerre&quot; (Ministry of Armament and War Production) opted to place an order for 1,000 aircraft, which were intended to be produced at a rate of 200 per month and to be fulfilled by early 1919. To meet this rapid demand, Potez and Bloch founded a separate company, the &quot;Compagnie Anjou Aéronautique&quot; (&quot;Anjou Aeronautical Company&quot;), to undertake their production. This entity was established at Angers with a new partner Julien Bessonneau. However, the outstanding production order would ultimately be cancelled, causing fatal economic hardship for both companies.

However, the company&#x27;s fortune quickly reversed following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that marked the end of the conflict. Without a major ongoing war driving demand, peace quickly led to a major downturn in the sale and production of aircraft, pushing many aviation companies to the brink. The French Government&#x27;s aircraft manufacturing department allegedly lacked interest in providing support to any of the nation&#x27;s manufacturers. Accordingly, many companies and individuals alike decided to withdraw from the aviation sector during the late 1910s and early 1920s in favour of other endeavours.

SEA was wound up shortly after the conflict&#x27;s end. However, Potez and Bloch went on to found their own separate and highly successful companies shortly thereafter. The &quot;Société d&#x27;Etudes Aéronautiques&quot;, a Belgian firm of the same name established in 1936 was entirely unrelated to the earlier French company.

<text>Ajahn Khemadhammo OBE (also known as Chao Khun Bhavanaviteht; born ) is a Theravāda Buddhist monk and retired professional actor. He is one of the founders of the Thai Forest Tradition in the West.

==Biography==
Khemadhammo was born in Portsmouth, England. In 1971, after training at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and Drama Centre, London and practising as a professional actor, working for several years at the Royal National Theatre in London with Laurence Olivier and Edward Petherbridge (a period in which he appeared in Shakespearian dramas as well as in plays by Tom Stoppard and Anton Chekov, studying intensively Stanislavski&#x27;s system), he travelled to Thailand via the Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India. In December 1971 in Bangkok he became a novice monk and about a month later moved to Ubon to stay with Ajahn Chah at Wat Nong Pah Pong : Wat Nong Pah Pong (Generally shortened to: Wat Pah Pong, Thai: วัดหนองป่าพง) is a Theravada Buddhist hermitage in Ubon Ratchathani Province, (Amphoe) Warin Chamrap, devoted to the practice of contemplation, Dhutanga practice and asceticism which was established by the late Ajahn Chah as the main monastery of the Thai Forest Tradition. On the day before Vesakha Puja of that year, 1972, Ajahn Khemadhammo received Upasampadā as a bhikkhu, a fully ordained Buddhist monk.

In 1977, Khemadhammo returned to the UK with Ajahn Chah and stayed with him during his two-month visit at the old Hampstead Vihara. After Ajahn Chah&#x27;s return to Thailand, Ajahn Khemadhammo remained at Hampstead and eighteen months later set up a small recluse monastery on the Isle of Wight. In 1984, at the invitation of a group of Buddhist Samatha and Vipassanā meditators that he had been visiting monthly for some years, he moved to Banner Hill near Kenilworth and formed the Buddha-Dhamma Fellowship. In 1985, he moved to his current residence, the contemplative Forest Hermitage, a property in Warwickshire; in 1987, with considerable help from meditator-acolytes and devotees in Thailand, this land was purchased by the Buddha-Dhamma Fellowship. A stupa was built there in 1988 by Sayadaw U Thilawunta, known as the English Shwedagon Pagoda.

Khemadhammo began Buddhist prison chaplaincy work in 1977. In 1985, with the help of others, Angulimala, the Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy, was launched with him as its Spiritual Director. Currently, Luang Por Khemadhammo continues to visit prisons and teach meditation both at his forest hermitage contemplative monastery Vihara and at Warwick University.

Ajahn Khemadhammo was appointed an OBE (Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, June 2003 for &#x27;services to prisoners&#x27;.

In December 2004, on the birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, he was made a &quot;Chao Khun&quot; with the ecclesiastical title of &quot;Phra Bhavanaviteht&quot;. He was only the second foreign-born monk to receive such an honour.

In May 2013 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Vipassanabhavana by Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, Thailand.

In January 2015, on Burmese Independence Day (Independence Day (Myanmar)), it was announced by the President of Burma that he had been awarded the title &quot;Aggamaha Saddhamma Jotikadhaja&quot;. This was duly conferred at an investiture ceremony in Nay Pyi Taw, the new capital of Myanmar (Burma), on 4 March 2015.

He is the Chair of TBSUK – the Theravada Buddhist Sangha in the UK.

<text>Bathymetry (; ) is the study of underwater depth of ocean floors (&quot;seabed topography&quot;), lake floors, or river floors. In other words, bathymetry is the underwater equivalent to hypsometry or topography. The first recorded evidence of water depth measurements are from Ancient Egypt over 3000 years ago. Bathymetry has various uses including the production of bathymetric charts to guide vessels and identify underwater hazards, the study of marine life near the floor of water bodies, coastline analysis and ocean dynamics, including predicting currents and tides.

Bathymetric charts (not to be confused with &quot;hydrographic charts&quot;), are typically produced to support safety of surface or sub-surface navigation, and usually show seafloor relief or terrain as contour lines (called &quot;depth contours&quot; or &quot;isobaths&quot;) and selected depths (&quot;soundings&quot;), and typically also provide surface navigational information. Bathymetric maps (a more general term where navigational safety is not a concern) may also use a digital terrain model and artificial illumination techniques to illustrate the depths being portrayed. The global bathymetry is sometimes combined with topography data to yield a global relief model. Paleobathymetry is the study of past underwater depths.

Synonyms include seafloor mapping, seabed mapping, seafloor imaging and seabed imaging. Bathymetric measurements are conducted with various methods, from depth sounding, sonar and lidar techniques, to buoys and satellite altimetry. Various methods have advantages and disadvantages and the specific method used depends upon the scale of the area under study, financial means, desired measurement accuracy, and additional variables. Despite modern computer-based research, the ocean seabed in many locations is less measured than the topography of Mars.

==Seabed topography==
==Measurement==


Originally, bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean depth through depth sounding. Early techniques used pre-measured heavy rope or cable lowered over a ship&#x27;s side. This technique measures the depth at one point at a time, and is therefore less efficient than other methods. It is also subject to movements of the ship and currents moving the line out of true, and thus is also less accurate.

The data used to make bathymetric maps today typically comes from an echosounder (sonar) mounted beneath or over the side of a boat, &quot;pinging&quot; a beam of sound downward at the seafloor or from remote sensing LIDAR or LADAR systems. The amount of time it takes for the sound or light to travel through the water, bounce off the seafloor, and return to the sounder informs the equipment of the distance to the seafloor. LIDAR/LADAR surveys are usually conducted by airborne systems.


Starting in the early 1930s, single-beam sounders were used to make bathymetry maps. Today, multibeam echosounders (MBES) are typically used, which use hundreds of very narrow adjacent beams (typically 256) arranged in a fan-like swath of typically 90 to 170 degrees across. The tightly packed array of narrow individual beams provides very high angular resolution and accuracy. In general, a wide swath, which is depth dependent, allows a boat to map more seafloor in less time than a single-beam echosounder by making fewer passes. The beams update many times per second (typically 0.1–50 Hz depending on water depth), allowing faster boat speed while maintaining 100% coverage of the seafloor. Attitude sensors allow for the correction of the boat&#x27;s roll and pitch on the ocean surface, and a gyrocompass provides accurate heading information to correct for vessel yaw. (Most modern MBES systems use an integrated motion-sensor and position system that measures yaw as well as the other dynamics and position.) A satellite-based global navigation system positions the soundings with respect to the surface of the earth. Sound speed profiles (speed of sound in water as a function of depth) of the water column correct for refraction or &quot;ray-bending&quot; of the sound waves owing to non-uniform water column characteristics such as temperature, conductivity, and pressure. A computer system processes all the data, correcting for all of the above factors as well as for the angle of each individual beam. The resulting sounding measurements are then processed either manually, semi-automatically or automatically (in limited circumstances) to produce a map of the area. a number of different outputs are generated, including a sub-set of the original measurements that satisfy some conditions (e.g., most representative likely soundings, shallowest in a region, etc.) or integrated digital terrain models (DTM) (e.g., a regular or irregular grid of points connected into a surface). Historically, selection of measurements was more common in hydrographic applications while DTM construction was used for engineering surveys, geology, flow modeling, etc. Since –2005, DTMs have become more accepted in hydrographic practice.

Satellites are also used to measure bathymetry. Satellite radar maps deep-sea topography by detecting the subtle variations in sea level caused by the gravitational pull of undersea mountains, ridges, and other masses. On average, sea level is higher over mountains and ridges than over abyssal plains and trenches.

In the United States the United States Army Corps of Engineers performs or commissions most surveys of navigable inland waterways, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) performs the same role for ocean waterways. Coastal bathymetry data is available from NOAA&#x27;s National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), which is now merged into National Centers for Environmental Information. Bathymetric data is usually referenced to tidal vertical datums. For deep-water bathymetry, this is typically Mean Sea Level (MSL), but most data used for nautical charting is referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) in American surveys, and Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) in other countries. Many other datums are used in practice, depending on the locality and tidal regime.

Occupations or careers related to bathymetry include the study of oceans and rocks and minerals on the ocean floor, and the study of underwater earthquakes or volcanoes. The taking and analysis of bathymetric measurements is one of the core areas of modern hydrography, and a fundamental component in ensuring the safe transport of goods worldwide.

===Satellite imagery===
Another form of mapping the seafloor is through the use of satellites. The satellites are equipped with hyper-spectral and multi-spectral sensors which are used to provide constant streams of images of coastal areas providing a more feasible method of visualising the bottom of the seabed.

====Hyper-spectral sensors====

The data-sets produced by hyper-spectral (HS) sensors tend to range between 100 and 200 spectral bands of approximately 5–10 nm bandwidths. Hyper-spectral sensing, or imaging spectroscopy, is a combination of continuous remote imaging and spectroscopy producing a single set of data. Two examples of this kind of sensing are AVIRIS (airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer) and HYPERION.

The application of HS sensors in regards to the imaging of the seafloor is the detection and monitoring of chlorophyll, phytoplankton, salinity, water quality, dissolved organic materials, and suspended sediments. However, this does not provide a great visual interpretation of coastal environments.

====Multi-spectral sensors====

The other method of satellite imaging, multi-spectral (MS) imaging, tends to divide the EM spectrum into a small number of bands, unlike its partner hyper-spectral sensors which can capture a much larger number of spectral bands.

MS sensing is used more in the mapping of the seabed due to its fewer spectral bands with relatively larger bandwidths. The larger bandwidths allow for a larger spectral coverage, which is crucial in the visual detection of marine features and general spectral resolution of the images acquired.

===Airborne laser bathymetry===
High-density airborne laser bathymetry (ALB) is a modern, highly technical, approach to the mapping the seafloor. First developed in the 1960s and 1970s, ALB is a &quot;light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technique that uses visible, ultraviolet, and near infrared light to optically remote sense a contour target through both an active and passive system.&quot; This means that airborne laser bathymetry also uses light outside the visible spectrum to detect curves in the underwater landscape.

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, &quot;a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances&quot;. These light pulses, along with other data, generate a three-dimensional representation of whatever the light pulses reflect off, giving an accurate representation of the surface characteristics. A LiDAR system usually consists of a laser, scanner, and GPS receiver. Airplanes and helicopters are the most commonly used platforms for acquiring LIDAR data over broad areas. One application of LiDAR is bathymetric LiDAR, which uses water-penetrating green light to also measure seafloor and riverbed elevations.

ALB generally operates in the form of a pulse of non-visible light being emitted from a low-flying aircraft and a receiver recording two reflections from the water. The first of which originates from the surface of the water, and the second from the seabed. This method has been used in a number of studies to map segments of the seafloor of various coastal areas.

====Examples of commercial LIDAR bathymetry systems====
There are various LIDAR bathymetry systems that are commercially accessible. Two of these systems are the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) and the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS). SHOALS was first developed to help the United States Army Corps of Engineers in bathymetric surveying by a company called Optech in the 1990s. SHOALS is done through the transmission of a laser, of wavelength between 530 and 532 nm, from a height of approximately 200 m at speed of 60 m/s on average.

===High resolution orthoimagery===

High resolution orthoimagery (HRO) is the process of creating an image that combines the geometric qualities with the characteristics of photographs. The result of this process is an orthoimage, a scale image which includes corrections made for feature displacement such as building tilt. These corrections are made through the use of a mathematical equation, information on sensor calibration, and the application of digital elevation models.

An orthoimage can be created through the combination of a number of photos of the same target. The target is photographed from a number of different angles to allow for the perception of the true elevation and tilting of the object. This gives the viewer an accurate perception of the target area.

High resolution orthoimagery is currently being used in the &#x27;terrestrial mapping program&#x27;, the aim of which is to &#x27;produce high resolution topography data from Oregon to Mexico&#x27;. The orthoimagery will be used to provide the photographic data for these regions.

==History==

The earliest known depth measurements were made about 1800 BCE by Egyptians by probing with a pole. Later a weighted line was used, with depths marked off at intervals. This process was known as sounding. Both these methods were limited by being spot depths, taken at a point, and could easily miss significant variations in the immediate vicinity. Accuracy was also affected by water movement–current could swing the weight from the vertical and both depth and position would be affected. This was a laborious and time-consuming process and was strongly affected by weather and sea conditions.

There were significant improvements with the voyage of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; in the 1870s, when similar systems using wires and a winch were used for measuring much greater depths than previously possible, but this remained a one depth at a time procedure which required very low speed for accuracy. Greater depths could be measured using weighted wires deployed and recovered by powered winches. The wires had less drag and were less affected by current, did not stretch as much, and were strong enough to support their own weight to considerable depths. The winches allowed faster deployment and recovery, necessary when the depths measured were of several kilometers. Wire drag surveys continued to be used until the 1990s due to reliability and accuracy. This procedure involved towing a cable by two boats, supported by floats and weighted to keep a constant depth The wire would snag on obstacles shallower than the cable depth. This was very useful for finding navigational hazards which could be missed by soundings, but was limited to relatively shallow depths.

Single-beam echo sounders were used from the 1920s-1930s to measure the distance of the seafloor directly below a vessel at relatively close intervals along the line of travel. By running roughly parallel lines, data points could be collected at better resolution, but this method still left gaps between the data points, particularly between the lines. The mapping of the sea floor started by using sound waves, contoured into isobaths and early bathymetric charts of shelf topography. These provided the first insight into seafloor morphology, though mistakes were made due to horizontal positional accuracy and imprecise depths. Sidescan sonar was developed in the 1950s to 1970s and could be used to create an image of the bottom, but the technology lacked the capacity for direct depth measurement across the width of the scan. In 1957, Marie Tharp, working with Bruce Charles Heezen, created the first three-dimensional physiographic map of the world&#x27;s ocean basins. Tharp&#x27;s discovery was made at the perfect time. It was one of many discoveries that took place near the same time as the invention of the computer. Computers, with their ability to compute large quantities of data, have made research much easier, include the research of the world&#x27;s oceans. The development of multibeam systems made it possible to obtain depth information across the width of the sonar swath, to higher resolutions, and with precise position and attitude data for the transducers, made it possible to get multiple high resolution soundings from a single pass.

The US Naval Oceanographic Office developed a classified version of multibeam technology in the 1960s. NOAA obtained an unclassified commercial version in the late 1970s and established protocols and standards. Data acquired with multibeam sonar have vastly increased understanding of the seafloor.

The U.S. Landsat satellites of the 1970s and later the European Sentinel satellites, have provided new ways to find bathymetric information, which can be derived from satellite images. These methods include making use of the different depths to which different frequencies of light penetrate the water. When water is clear and the seafloor is sufficiently reflective, depth can be estimated by measuring the amount of reflectance observed by a satellite and then modeling how far the light should penetrate in the known conditions. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on NASA&#x27;s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) is a photon-counting lidar that uses the return time of laser light pulses from the Earth&#x27;s surface to calculate altitude of the surface. ICESat-2 measurements can be combined with ship-based sonar data to fill in gaps and improve precision of maps of shallow water.

Mapping of continental shelf seafloor topography using remotely sensed data has applied a variety of methods to visualise the bottom topography. Early methods included hachure maps, and were generally based on the cartographer&#x27;s personal interpretation of limited available data. Acoustic mapping methods developed from military sonar images produced a more vivid picture of the seafloor. Further development of sonar based technology have allowed more detail and greater resolution, and ground penetrating techniques provide information on what lies below the bottom surface. Airborne and satellite data acquisition have made further advances possible in visualisation of underwater surfaces: high-resolution aerial photography and orthoimagery is a powerful tool for mapping shallow clear waters on continental shelves, and airborne laser bathymetry, using reflected light pulses, is also very effective in those conditions, and hyperspectral and multispectral satellite sensors can provide a nearly constant stream of benthic environmental information. Remote sensing techniques have been used to develop new ways of visualizing dynamic benthic environments from general geomorphological features to biological coverage.

<text>Kingswinford is a town of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the English West Midlands, situated west-southwest of central Dudley. In 2011 the area had a population of 25,191, down from 25,808 at the 2001 Census.

The current economic focus of Kingswinford is education and housing for commuters. Positioned at the far western edge of the West Midlands Urban Area it borders on a rural area extending past the River Severn; but its position at the edge of the Black Country and its long standing in the area means it has had significant industrial influence in the past. This is illustrated by the influence in creating local workhouses, which shows a population of 15,000 plus in the 1831 census.

==History==
Kingswinford has historically been in Staffordshire. The larger Kingswinford manor mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 was located in the hundred of Seisdon in Staffordshire, with exclaves in Oldswinford in the ancient hundred of Clent in Worcestershire. Rural manors perpetuated noncontiguous holdings to allow diverse agriculture production and decrease risk of catastrophic crop failure due to natural disasters. The name Kingswinford relates to a ford for the King&#x27;s swine (Kingswin(e)ford) – Latin Swinford Regis. The ancient parish of Kingswinford spanned Wordsley, Brierley Hill and Quarry Bank.

The parishes of Kingswinford and Amblecote formed the Kingswinford rural district in 1894, and gave its name to the Kingswinford Parliament constituency from 1885 until 1950. However, Amblecote became its own urban district in 1898, leaving Kingswinford one of a minority of single-parish rural districts in England. Kingswinford rural district was added to the Brierley Hill Urban District in 1934, which became part of the County Borough of Dudley in 1966, now the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. However, the rural part of the parish was removed to Kinver in 1933, becoming part of Seisdon Rural District in 1966 and since 1974 part of South Staffordshire. In 1951 the parish had a population of 27,757. On 1 April 1966 the parish was abolished and merged with Dudley, Stourbridge, Himley and Kinver, part also went to form Warley.

Recent house building, commencing in the 1950s and 1960s, has largely destroyed the original rural character of Kingswinford, the result being the complete absorption of the former village into the adjoining urban area.

Until its closure in 2012, Kingswinford was home to food retailer Julian Graves&#x27; head office and distribution centre.

==Geography==
Kingswinford is a part of the West Midlands metropolitan county, West Midlands conurbation, and the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. It is situated on the extreme western edge of the conurbation, and to the north, east and south lie other suburban areas of the Black Country. However, the border to the west is green belt, which stretches for many miles through Staffordshire, Shropshire, beyond the Severn Valley and into Wales.

The Kingswinford DY6 postal district covers the entirety of Kingswinford and its suburban village of Wall Heath, as well as nearby rural areas such as Hinksford and Ashwood.

===Closest cities, towns and villages===
==Places of interest==
===Glass Museum===

Broadfield House Glass Museum, on Compton Drive, was housed in a Grade II listed building set in its own grounds, and formed part of the historic Stourbridge Glass Quarter. It had a notable collection of British glass, much of it made locally, from historic 18th-century pieces to contemporary works from Britain&#x27;s leading glass artists. Plans to retain the collection at Broadfield House were shattered and the museum eventually closed in September 2015, to make way for a new glass museum in nearby Wordsley.

===Holbeche House===
Near Kingswinford is Holbeche House, a small country house which has now been turned into a nursing home although as of August 2023 is boarded up. It was here in 1605 that most of the men who had attempted to blow up Parliament with Guy Fawkes were cornered, and a bloody gunfight ensued, resulting in the deaths of at least four of the conspirators, including their leader Robert Catesby. Bullet holes can still be seen in the house&#x27;s walls, but it is not open to the public.
Many of the streets of the Charterfields housing development, built during the 1970s, adopted the names of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators, such as Catesby Drive (Robert Catesby), Digby Road (Sir Everard Digby), Keyes Drive (Robert Keyes), Tresham Road (Francis Tresham), Ambrose Crescent (Ambrose Rokewood), Monteagle Drive (Lord Monteagle – William Parker) and Rokewood Close (Ambrose Rokewood).

===The Cross Inn===
Located in the heart of Kingswinford on the corner of Moss Grove and the High Street lies The Cross Inn. The building was Grade II listed in the 1970s. First recorded in the 1750 parish map, it was owned in the early 19th century by Diana Briscoe of Summerhill House. The pub was purchased from a previous owner by Wetherspoons in 2019.

===Townsend===
There is an area at the end of Kingswinford which has been known as Townsend dating back to 19th century maps of the area. It was centred on Townsend House, the family seat of the Badley family from the 17th until the early 20th century. The Georgian house was demolished in the 1950s to build a shopping precinct. John Badley of Townsend (1678–1768) was an ancestor of John Badley, F.R.C.S. and John Haden Badley the centenarian educator and founder of Bedales School.

===Local churches===
The parish church of St. Mary dates back to the 11th century, although much of the main body of the building is from the 17th century. It contains a notable Norman carving of St. Michael slaying the dragon. The church is also home to a well-regarded two manual Nicholson and Lord pipe organ. It remained the church of the huge parish of Kingswinford until it was closed because of mining activities in 1831, when a new parish church was built, Holy Trinity Church in Wordsley. It reopened in 1846, initially as a chapel of ease, before regaining parochial status (with a smaller parish). It is the parish church for the Kingswinford Team of Anglican churches. The building is now a Grade II listed building. The churchyard contains Commonwealth war graves of four service personnel of World War I and six of World War II.

In addition to the parish church, Kingswinford is also home to several churches of other denominations, including:
*Our Lady of Lourdes R.C. Church
*Arise Church UK
*Crestwood Church
*Kingswinford Methodist Church
*Kingswinford Christian Fellowship

==Transport==
Kingswinford is well served by buses that connect it to Dudley, Stourbridge, Wolverhampton, Merry Hill and Brierley Hill. There has never been an official rail connection in Kingswinford, but there were halts on the now-disused Wombourne Branch Line. The nearest stations were the Gornal Halt, Himley, and Pensnett Halt. It was linked by rail to Oxley, and the colliery at Baggeridge.

The halts and stations closed to passengers in 1932, and the entire line from Wolverhampton to Kingswinford was closed to freight traffic in the 1960s, although the stub near Pensnett Halt served the nearby Pensnett Trading Estate until 1994, when the entire stub to Kingswinford Junction was closed. Portions of the track remain in situ, however, as well as the platforms as far as Pensnett Halt. Gornal Halt has since been replaced by residential development, and Himley station now forms part of the South Staffordshire Railway Walk.

Today, the nearest active railway stations are in Wolverhampton and Stourbridge. When the West Midlands Metro extension from Wednesbury to Brierley Hill is completed, its nearest stops to Kingswinford will be Brierley Hill and Merry Hill.

In 2019, PMOL announced plans to reopen the South Staffordshire Line from Stourbridge to Merry Hill with the possibility of reopening the Wombourne Branch Line to Pensnett, a mile away. Plans had previously been forestalled by the discovery of an ancient ant colony in the area designated for development.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
Kingswinford serves 5–11 year olds with eight primary schools, one of which is a special school.

* Blanford Mere Primary School
* Bromley Hills Primary School
* Crestwood Park Primary School
* Dawley Brook Primary School
* Dingle Community Primary School
* Glynne Primary School
* St Mary&#x27;s Church of England (VC) Primary School
* The Brier School (Special School) 
Bromley Hills, The Brier School and secondary school, The Crestwood School, sit together on a site located on Bromley Lane, Kingswinford. They are part of a project that involves a standard Primary School and a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school, and a secondary school, which work closely with each other. The area known as Campus 21 has benefitted from investment including the building of The Brier School (SEN 5–19) and a new sports hall.

===Secondary schools===
The area has three major secondary schools:
*Kingswinford Academy is located a five-minute walk from the main road that runs through Kingswinford, the A491 (Market Street).
*Summerhill School is located some half-mile away and has recently undergone major building works. Perhaps reflecting the area&#x27;s emotion, it was rebuilt in 2003 with a brand new 21st century design replacing the original 1950s buildings. This project was one of the first large scale PFI projects (the deal was worth around £27 million) and is considered to be a showcase for the local authority&#x27;s education provision. A remaining building from the old school that was built in 1993 was the subject of local debate since its closure in 2003, with Dudley Metropolitan Borough council intent upon using it to house the borough&#x27;s archives. This caused conflict following the proposal of an alternative scheme (The C.I.C Kingswinford) put forward by a local young entrepreneur (John Hackett) to use the building as an arts centre that was rejected by the council. The council planned to move the archives service to this building in 2007, but the scheme was cancelled in 2008 after it was found to be uneconomical. The building was damaged, but not destroyed, in an arson attack on 5 November 2008, carried out by 2 current students at the time. It sat derelict for a while before being finally demolished.
*The Crestwood School is located on another hectic road through Kingswinford that joins the A491 (Market Street) to the Brierley Hill area, often used, to residents&#x27; dismay, as a fast way to Merry Hill Shopping Centre. The Crestwood School has recently also undergone major building works, which has seen the moving of the Brier school upon land between Crestwood (As known to locals) and Bromley Hills Primary School. This has also been seen as an inconvenience to local residents as it has brought extra traffic to an already busy road, especially at school run times.

==Notable people==
Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, owned the manor of Kingswinford and was largely responsible for developing the mining industry in the area.

George Saxby Penfold was Rector of Kingswinford from December 1831 until his death in 1846, but held other livings as well.

William Robertson Coe, insurance, railroad and business executive, emigrated to the US.

Frederick Augustus Coe, Iron works manager

<doc id="965390" wikidata="Q1559685" url="?curid=965390" title="Matching hypothesis">
<text>The matching hypothesis (also known as the matching phenomenon) argues that people are more likely to form and succeed in a committed relationship with someone who is equally socially desirable, typically in the form of physical attraction. The hypothesis is derived from the discipline of social psychology and was first proposed by American social psychologist Elaine Hatfield and her colleagues in 1966.

Successful couples of differing physical attractiveness may be together due to other matching variables that compensate for the difference in attractiveness. For instance, some men with wealth and status desire younger, more attractive women. Some women are more likely to overlook physical attractiveness for men who possess wealth and status.

It is also similar to some of the theorems outlined in uncertainty reduction theory, from the post-positivist discipline of communication studies. These theorems include constructs of nonverbal expression, perceived similarity, liking, information seeking, and intimacy, and their correlations to one another.

== Research ==

=== Walster &quot;et al.&quot; (1966) ===
Walster advertised a &quot;Computer Match Dance&quot;. 752 student participants were rated on physical attractiveness by four independent judges, as a measure of social desirability. Participants were told to fill in a questionnaire for the purposes of computer matching based on similarity. Instead, participants were randomly paired, except no man was paired with a taller woman. During an intermission of the dance, participants were asked to assess their date. People with higher ratings were found to have more harsh judgment of their dates. Furthermore, higher levels of attractiveness indicated lower levels of satisfaction with their pairing, even when they were on the same level. It was also found that both men and women were more satisfied with their dates if their dates had high levels of attractiveness. Physical attractiveness was found to be the most important factor in enjoying the date and whether or not they would sleep with them when propositioned. It was more important than intelligence and personality.

One criticism Walster assigned to the study was that the four judges who assigned the attractiveness ratings to the participants had very brief interactions with them. Longer exposure may have changed the attraction ratings. In a follow-up of the experiment, it was found that couples were more likely to continue interacting if they held similar attraction ratings.

=== Walster and Walster (1971) ===
Walster and Walster ran a follow-up to the Computer Dance, but instead allowed participants to meet beforehand in order to give them greater chance to interact and think about their ideal qualities in a partner. The study had greater ecological validity than the original study, and the finding was that partners that were similar in terms of physical attractiveness expressed the most liking for each other – a finding that supports the matching hypothesis.

=== Murstein (1972) ===
Murstein also found evidence that supported the matching hypothesis. Photos of 197 couples in various statuses of relationship (from casually dating to married), were rated in terms of attractiveness by eight judges. Each person was photographed separately. The judges did not know which photographs went together within romantic partnerships. The ratings from the judges supported the matching hypothesis.

Self-perception and perception of the partner were included in the first round of the study; however, in the later rounds they were removed, as partners not only rated themselves unrealistically high, but their partners even higher.

=== Huston (1973) ===
Huston argued that the evidence for the matching hypothesis didn&#x27;t come from matching but instead on the tendency of people to avoid rejection hence choosing someone similarly attractive to themselves, to avoid being rejected by someone more attractive than themselves. Huston attempted to prove this by showing participants photos of people who had already indicated that they would accept the participant as a partner. The participant usually chose the person rated as most attractive; however, the study has very flawed ecological validity as the relationship was certain, and in real life people wouldn&#x27;t be certain hence are still more likely to choose someone of equal attractiveness to avoid possible rejection.

=== White (1980)===
White conducted a study on 123 dating couples at UCLA. He stated that good physical matches may be conducive to good relationships. The study reported that partners most similar in physical attractiveness were found to rate themselves happier and report deeper feelings of love.

The study also supported that some, especially men, view relationships as a marketplace. If the partnership is weak, an individual may devalue it if they have many friends of the opposite sex who are more attractive. They may look at the situation as having more options present that are more appealing. At the same time, if the relationship is strong, they may value the relationship more because they are passing up on these opportunities in order to remain in the relationship.

=== Brown (1986) ===
Brown argued for the matching hypothesis, but maintained that it results from a learned sense of what is &quot;fitting&quot; – we adjust our expectation of a partner in line with what we believe we have to offer others, instead of a fear of rejection.

=== Garcia and Khersonsky (1996)===
Garcia and Khersonsky studied this effect and how others view matching and non-matching couples. Participants viewed photos of couples who matched or did not match in physical attractiveness and completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire included ratings of how satisfied the couples appear in their current relationship, their potential marital satisfaction, how likely is it that they will break up and how likely it is that they will be good parents. Results showed that the attractive couple was rated as currently more satisfied than the non-matching couple, where the male was more attractive than the female. Additionally, the unattractive male was rated as more satisfied (currently and marital) than the attractive female in the non-matching couple. The attractive woman was also rated as more satisfied (currently and marital) in the attractive couple.

=== Shaw Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) ===
Shaw Taylor performed a series of studies involving the matching hypothesis in online dating. In one of the studies, the attractiveness of 60 males and 60 females were measured and their interactions were monitored. The people with whom they interacted were then monitored to see who they interacted with, and returned messages to. What they found was different from the original construct of matching. People contacted others who were significantly more attractive than they were. However it was found that the person was more likely to reply if they were closer to the same level of attractiveness. This study supported matching but not as something that is intentional.

=== Other studies ===
Further evidence supporting the matching hypothesis was found by:
*Berscheid and Dion (1974)
*Berscheid and Walster et al. (1974)

== Quotations ==
*Price and Vandenberg stated that &quot;the matching phenomenon [of physical attractiveness between marriage partners] is stable within and across generations&quot;.
*&quot;Love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect, considering their value on the personality market.&quot; — Erich Fromm

<doc id="965392" wikidata="Q920233" url="?curid=965392" title="Chaga people">
<text>The Chagga (&quot;Wachagga&quot;, in Swahili) are a Bantu ethnic group from Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania and Arusha Region of Tanzania. They are the third-largest ethnic group in Tanzania. They founded the now former sovereign Chagga states on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro which governed both the current Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions (eastern) of Tanzania.

The Chagga people are recognized as one of the economically successful groups in Tanzania. Their relative wealth is attributed to the fertile soil of volcanic Mount Kilimanjaro, which supports intensive agricultural activities. The Chagga have developed a strong work ethic and engaged in trade, contributing to their current economic standing in the country.They are known for historically employing various agricultural techniques, including sophisticated irrigation systems and terracing. Furthermore, they have intensive farming methods for centuries, a tradition that dates back to the time of the Bantu expansion within their historical states.

Around the beginning of the twentieth century, the German colonial government estimated that there were about 28,000 households on Kilimanjaro. In 1988, the Chagga population was estimated at over 800,000 individuals.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Dschagga&quot; originally referred to a geographical location rather than a specific ethnic group. Notably, German explorer Johannes Rebmann described &quot;the inhabitants of the Dschagga&quot; while documenting the Taita and Kamba peoples during his early expeditions to the region. The name appears to have been a general designation for the mountainous area, used by distant residents to describe it. When Rebmann&#x27;s Swahili guide referred to &quot;Dischagga,&quot; it was likely an overarching term rather than a specific name for a community. Over time, the term underwent anglicization, evolving to &quot;Jagga&quot; by 1860 and &quot;Chagga&quot; by 1871. The latter spelling was chosen by Charles New, who associated it with the Swahili words meaning &quot;to stray&quot; or &quot;to get lost,&quot; reflecting the area&#x27;s dense forests that often disoriented visitors.

==History==
===Origins===


The Chagga people are believed to have descended from several Bantu groups that migrated from different regions of Africa to the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro. This migration is thought to have commenced around the beginning of the eleventh century. While the Chaga are Bantu-speakers, their language has a number of dialects somewhat related to Kamba, which is spoken in southeast Kenya. One word they all have in common is &quot;Mangi&quot;, meaning &#x27;king&#x27; in Kichagga. The British called them chiefs as they were deemed subjects to the British crown, thereby rendered unequal.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European travelers to Mount Kilimanjaro documented conversations with various Chagga kings regarding the origins of their clans. Notably, Karl Peters recorded information from Mangi Marealle of Marangu, who stated that the Wamarangu descended from Ukamba, the Wamoshi from the Usambara Mountains, and that the Wakibosho had always inhabited the mountain. 

Some historical accounts suggest that certain Chagga clans may have origins linked to the Usambara and Kamba peoples. However, few modern mangis assert these connections, emphasizing their long-standing lineage as exclusively Chagga and rooted in Mount Kilimanjaro. Acknowledging other origins could undermine the Chagga&#x27;s historical claim to the land, and early European interrogators may have oversimplified or led the responses they received.

Chagga histories reveal the origins of various clans, indicating whether they emerged locally or migrated from the plains. Much of the region, particularly the high forest, remains unexplored, including ancient shrines and sacred plants that may indicate the paths of early pygmies. Unexamined stone-wall enclosures in the upper chiefdoms (Mitaa) could provide further insights into Chagga history.

Additionally, wild olives on the northern side of Kilimanjaro may suggest previous habitation by the Chagga, as the area could regenerate with olive trees. It is possible that ancestors often said to have &quot;come from the mountain&quot; originally settled on the north side before moving to the south.


Language, customs, and housing styles in Chaggaland reveal insights into the region&#x27;s history. The Kichagga language is rapidly evolving, with contemporary speakers finding older forms nearly &quot;classical.&quot; While some areas retain distinctive dialects, such asnthe Ngasseni dialect, which is largely unintelligible to other Kichagga speakers, the influence of standardized dialects from Machame and Marangu is notable.

Distinct customs indicate clan origins, with practices like unique cursing stones and fire worship in the ancient chiefdoms of Samake, Nguni, and Kyuu in Siha Kingdom. Clan histories often detail the arrival of ancestors with various tools, reflecting their roles as hunters, blacksmiths, livestock keepers, or cultivators.

Cultural similarities across the central chiefdoms create unity, although differences emerge beyond the Weru Weru River and Mriti hills. Male Circumcision is common, and initiation rituals in the central zone involve tribal lore and secret symbols. Architectural styles vary, with distinct house designs east and west of the Weru Weru River.

Historically, many Chagga are believed to have originated in the northeastern region of the mountain, influenced by migrations from surrounding areas, including recently the Maasai, Pare, and as far as the Kikuyu. Additionally, movements from the south, including Shambaa and Zigua, contribute to the region&#x27;s complex settlement history, with legends indicating various groups migrated towards Kilimanjaro from different directions.

===The Kilindi, Koningo and Ongamo influence===
According to some Chagga origin legends, the Usambara Kilindi dynasty originated from the Nguu Mountains, are some of their ancestors. The coastal Wanika are believed to have migrated from Kilema to Rombo and then to the southern Kenyan coast, a journey detailed by von der Decken, linked to the rule of Munie Mkoma (Mangi Rongoma) of Kilema Kingdom.

Chagga oral traditions also mention pygmies, known as &quot;Wakoningo,&quot; who crossed Kilimanjaro from east to west toward the Congo Basin. A story from the Uru describes visitors from the west seeking lumber for a mythical king, but the primary narrative involves the pygmies&#x27; migration.The Ongamo people significantly influenced Chagga culture by adopting later abandoned practices such as female circumcision and age sets &quot;rika&quot;. By the late 19th century, they were increasingly integrated into Chagga society, leading to the emergence of the deity &quot;Ruwa,&quot; a blend of both cultures&#x27; beliefs.

Munie Mkoma of Pangani may have initiated a tradition, possibly as a Swahili leader, with later connections seen in Mangi Mamkinga of Machame&#x27;s reliance on a resident Swahili living in his kingdom. These elements suggest that the Chagga&#x27;s origins are more complex than those of the Taita, who claimed a simpler migration narrative.

==Chagga religion==
Before Christianity and Islam took root in Kilimajanro during the 19th century, the Chagga faith centered on their supreme deity Ruwa and his power and assistance in their daily life. Ruwa is the Chagga name for him in Eastern and Central Kilimanjaro states of from usseri to Kibosho, while in the western states, especially Machame and Masama, the deity was referred to as &quot;Iruva&quot;. Both names are also Chagga words for the sun. Ruwa is not looked upon as the creator of humankind, but rather as a liberator and provider of sustenance. He is known for his mercy and tolerance when sought by his people.

Much of the Chagga lifestyle was shaped by their earth based and ancestral veneration based religious beliefs. Before the arrival of Christianity and Islam, the Chaga practiced a diverse range of faith with a thoroughgoing syncretism. The importance of ancestors is strongly maintained by them to this day.Ruwa who resides on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, which mean the mountain sacred to them. Parts of the high forest contain old shrines with masale plantings, the sacred Chagga plant.

===Chagga Religion and cosmology===

In Chagga cosmology, the natural and supernatural realms are deeply interconnected, with all human activities viewed as having spiritual significance. Misfortunes can result from improper conduct, malevolent actions, or the ill-will of spirits, while good fortune must be coaxed from a universe inhabited by unpredictable ancestral spirits. Rituals are performed to appease these spirits, particularly Ruwa, the sun god, who resides in the sky. Unlike superior spirits, the spirits of deceased ancestors are more actively involved in human affairs, influencing their descendants. The ancestors of kings require propitiation on behalf of their entire kingdom, reflecting a belief system that intricately links the living with the spiritual world. 

In Chagga cosmology, sexual reproduction is viewed as a fundamental force governing life and death. The harmonious combination of male and female is believed to create life, while improper unions are thought to lead to death. Notably, marriage and incest are seen as opposing forces of life and death, stemming from male-female interactions. The potent nature of sexuality is acknowledged, with Chagga cursing instruments often adorned with male and female sexual symbols, highlighting their dual capacity for creation and destruction.

To mitigate the dangers associated with sexual combinations, a degree of segregation between male and female elements is practiced. Additionally, adherence to a proper temporal sequence in life stages is crucial. Each individual is expected to follow a designated life cycle, progressing from youth to maturity, and eventually to death. For instance, once a child reaches the age of circumcision and is prepared for marriage, the parents are expected to cease procreation to prevent potential fatalities within the family.

Death occurring out of sequence, particularly among the young, is interpreted as a sign of foul play, indicating that the individual has died prematurely. A failure to produce offspring—either due to youth or infertility—is seen as a disruption of the ancestral lineage, severing the continuity between ancestors and descendants. Consequently, the bodies of childless individuals and infertile women are disposed of in the wilderness, rather than being buried in family graves, reflecting their perceived lack of connection to the ongoing cycle of life.

The most profound concern within this cosmology is the fear of dying without leaving descendants. A man without male heirs faces eternal extinction, as there would be no one to perform the necessary rituals to ensure his passage to the afterlife. Sterility symbolizes a form of perpetual death, raising existential questions about legacy and remembrance in the context of Chagga beliefs.

In Chagga cosmology, the cyclical renewal of life—encompassing humans, animals, plants, and natural cycles—depends on maintaining order through the principles of separation, combination, and sequence, particularly concerning male and female roles. Proper timing and combinations are essential to prevent chaos and disaster.

Key themes in this belief system include: (1) the continuity of life through an ancestral chain where the dead exist in the spirit world; (2) the mysterious processes of sexual reproduction; and (3) the magical properties of food, which sustain both the living and the spirits. Food and sexuality are intertwined, serving as vital means to prevent death and promote life.

Animal sacrifice is a significant ritual, viewed as a means of communication with ancestral spirits. The offerings, including the stomach and intestines, connect the living with the dead. Furthermore, analogies between feeding and reproduction highlight the importance of sustenance in both life and spiritual contexts. Rituals emphasize these connections, with special foods for mothers post-childbirth and communal sharing symbolizing bonds of kinship and friendship. Overall, the Chagga worldview reflects a deep interconnection between fertility, sustenance, and the cycles of life and death.

===Initiation mythology===
In Chagga initiation mythology, a significant narrative for women and children describes the ritual alteration of men&#x27;s bodies during initiation. It is believed that men&#x27;s anuses are sealed, paralleling the state of pregnant women, symbolizing a form of &quot;closure&quot; associated with masculinity. This myth suggests that the completeness of a man&#x27;s digestion is linked to his procreative abilities.

During initiation ceremonies, men&#x27;s feces play a crucial role, despite young women&#x27;s ignorance of male defecation. In the girls&#x27; initiation, a mixture containing male feces is applied to each girl&#x27;s forehead as a symbol, while in the boys&#x27; ceremony, it is ingested as part of swearing oaths. These rites signify the transition to adulthood and the ability to procreate, reflecting the importance of fecal symbolism in Chagga culture.

Chagga rituals draw heavily from everyday life, encompassing bodily functions and products (such as spittle, semen, blood, and urine), fundamental foods (like bananas, meat, and beer), agricultural practices, and various natural and man-made elements. Symbols within this cosmology often possess dual meanings; for instance, fire represents both the nurturing warmth of the hearth and the destructive force of flames. Similarly, water can symbolize both tranquility and danger.

In this worldview, men are seen as protectors and creators, yet also as potential destroyers in war. Women are revered for their capacity to bear children but are also viewed as dangerous due to menstruation and the potential for harm through witchcraft or poisoning. Thus, Chagga cosmology encompasses a complex ambivalence, where both genders embody the capacities for life and death, reflected in their myths and symbols.

===The Chagga Kingdoms===
Traditionally, The Chagga states were divided into several small kingdoms known as &quot;&quot;Umangi&quot;,&quot; following a patrilineal system of descent and authority. The Chagga people in their countries primarily engaged in intensive agriculture, utilizing terraced fields and irrigation. While bananas are the staple crop, they also grow yams, beans, and maize, with coffee emerging as a significant cash crop by the late 19th century duringthe German cocupation.

The Chagga states, located on Mount Kilimanjaro, historically functioned as a vital provisioning point within the Swahili commercial inland network. Their strategic location enabled trade with various Swahili ports, including Mombasa and Pangani, and attracted traders from groups like the Kamba and Nyamwezi. Notable trader Chief Kivoi Mwendwa famously climbed Kilimanjaro and led large caravans before European colonization.

By 1899, the Chagga population was organized into 37 autonomous kingdoms.

Early accounts often classify the inhabitants of each kingdom as distinct &quot;tribes.&quot; While the Chagga primarily reside on Mount Kilimanjaro, many families have migrated to other regions throughout the 20th century. Following significant reorganization by the British administration in 1946, the number of kingdoms was greatly reduced, leading to the establishment of newly settled lands on the lower slopes of Kilimanjaro&#x27;s western and eastern sides.

The historical development of various Chagga states constitutes an essential part of Kilimanjaro&#x27;s internal history. Today, over 100 mitaa (parishes) reflect the amalgamation of two or three former mitaa, which were independent units in earlier times, apart from newly opened territories on the lower slopes. For many elderly Chagga, these former mitaa still hold cultural significance. 

By 1964, there were fifteen recognized Chagga states, referred to by elders as &quot;the countries of Kilimanjaro.&quot; Within each chiefdom, the term &quot;country&quot; is still used to describe the past when referring to each old mtaa. In the pre-colonial era, the Chagga population was smaller, land was more abundant, and distances were greater compared to the present day, where modern transportation has reduced travel time. Nevertheless, in many areas of Kilimanjaro, distances are still measured by the pace of walking.

==The Chagga in the 19th century==
In the 19th century as recorded by French missionary Alexandre Le Roy who visited the Chagga in 1890 confirmed that the Chagga were a primarily an agricultural society, distinguished among African farming communities by their innovative practices. Notably, their irrigation system is highly developed; water is collected from distant sources, including areas beyond virgin forests, and channeled along hillsides and cliffs. This water is then directed down less noticeable slopes to reservoirs, from which it is distributed through an intricate network of small channels, ensuring equitable access for all.

===Land tenure in Chaggan society===
In Chagga communities, land designated for banana cultivation is categorized under a specific tenure known as &quot;vihamba&quot; (singular: &quot;kihamba&quot;). This type of land is permanently cultivated and is typically owned by males, who allocate individual plots to their wives. The plots of land owned by patrilineally related men are often contiguous, reflecting a communal approach to landholding. In this system, these men maintain contingent interests in each other&#x27;s plots, ensuring that if a man dies without male heirs, his land may be inherited by a male relative.

&quot;Kihamba&quot; lands are traditionally passed down from father to son, but they can also be loaned or given to non-kin with the approval of the local lineage. In cases of loans, an annual payment known as &quot;masiro&quot;, often in the form of beer, is made to commemorate the transaction and to allow the donor lineage the option to reclaim the land if desired.

Unimproved land, meanwhile, becomes inheritable by anyone who cultivates it. &quot;Mangis&quot; often grant permission for immigrants to settle on such lands to increase their following. In families with multiple sons, the eldest and youngest may receive land directly, while middle sons might seek land through the lineage branch head or the chief. When an area is conquered, patrilineal territories retain their inheritance patterns, although the right to allocate unused lands to non-kin may be lost, as chiefs assert rights over these lands.

The second type of land tenure, referred to as &quot;shamba&quot;, is typically granted for one year and is used for annual crops such as beans, maize, and &quot;mbege&quot; (eleusine). While &quot;shamba&quot; lands are officially granted for a single year, they are often reallocated to the same individual annually. Similar to &quot;kihamba&quot; lands, &quot;masiro&quot; is paid for &quot;shamba&quot; land, frequently in the form of a portion of the harvested produce. Despite various legislative changes introduced up to 1974, both &quot;kihamba&quot; and &quot;shamba&quot; land tenure systems continue to persist in these communities.

===Cattle ownership===
In 19th-century Kilimanjaro, wealth was primarily measured by cattle holdings rather than land ownership. However, cattle were not typically herded in many regions; instead, they were stall-fed in Chagga huts, particularly in areas like Rombo and parts of Machame, where pasture land was more abundant than in Vunjo. Women gathered fodder from the plains, carrying heavy loads up the mountain slopes for their cattle.

Due to the labor-intensive nature of stall feeding and the limited space of the huts, households generally maintained only two or three cattle, along with a few goats and sheep. Male animals were commonly slaughtered during lineage feasts. Cattle could be accumulated through natural increase or as war booty, and surplus cattle were often placed in the care of other households under an agistment agreement. In this arrangement, the borrower would keep the milk and manure, receiving a share of any bull-calf slaughtered.

Heifers were usually placed in households other than their birth homes due to taboos, while bull-calves remained with their mothers until slaughtered by their owners. Old cows could also be reclaimed for slaughter after appropriate apologies were made. She-goats were similarly loaned, with the borrower entitled to every third kid.

There were several motivations for accumulating cattle, including the ability to pay tribute to &quot;Mangis&quot; or mtaa chiefs, host lineage feasts, provide bridewealth, and exert influence over borrowers. Cattle-rich individuals were expected to provide tribute and support for chiefs&#x27; guests, making it advantageous to conceal their assets by distributing animals across various households. While some wealthy men managed this openly, many did so secretly to avoid unwanted demands.

This secrecy often led to legal complications, particularly if a lender died without revealing their assets or if a borrower failed to uphold their end of the agreement. Complex legal issues also arose when cattle were placed in different chiefdoms, as was common with families from Vunjo placing animals with those in Rombo. Legal practices evolved around debt hostages and the assumption of debts by chiefs, who became substitute creditors in these transactions.
===The Chagga homestead===
The Chagga people exhibit a distinct artistic sensibility in the layout of their communities. Typically, settlements consist of smaller clusters rather than large conglomerations, with each family residing in individual homes. A typical household may include multiple structures for the head of the family, spouses, children, and any slaves, as well as facilities for livestock. Additionally, there is often a well-maintained, smaller building raised on poles for storing millet, bananas, beans, honey, and banana beer. This storage area is surrounded by a garden enclosed by a living hedge, often made of dracaena or thorny capers. Above the entrance, flowering creepers create an arch, and a nearby stream from the irrigation system enhances the picturesque quality of these family enclosures.

===The home===
Every single Chagga family lived in the seclusion of their fenced-in farmhouse, or &quot;kihamba&quot; in Kichagga, even in the most crowded sections of Chaggaland. Each home was surrounded by the &quot;Masale&quot; plant, a revered symbol of peace and forgiveness in the Chagga culture (Dracaena fragrans). It contains a banana grove, with its long, overhanging fronds shading tomatoes, onions, and various varieties of yam. In the middle of the grove was a round, beehive-shaped house made of earth and covered in grass or banana leaves. The husband&#x27;s hoe and other equipment can be stored in the sleeping quarters, which can be either a leather hide or a dry banana leaves bed and is close to the door. A fire is burning in the middle of the room, supported by three stones, and bananas are drying in a little loft above the fire.

In various homesteads, a blacksmith can often be observed working diligently over hot embers, utilizing an anvil and goatskin bellows. In contrast, the sight of a woman crafting and firing earthen pots is less commonly encountered. Additionally, beehives constructed from hollowed tree trunks, with stoppers, are typically suspended from trees in the vicinity. Hides are frequently stretched on pegs to dry at the entrance of these dwellings..

Typically, neighbors come from the same clan. Interior paths connect the homesteads in the region controlled by that clan, and the entire area is separated from the neighboring homes of the next clan by a larger hedge or an earth bank. A &quot;mtaa&quot; is chiefdom made up of multiple clans. When Rebmann arrived in Kilema in 1848, he immediately remarked on the order that had taken hold due to the mangi&#x27;s firm authority. He was enthralled by the prosperity and abilities of the populace, as well as by the pleasant weather and natural beauty of the area.

===Work tools and weapons===
The Chagga employ wooden implements for farming, including a large pike used to turn the soil, which yields favorable results. This type of pike, often crafted from ebony, is also utilized by other southern tribes. Interestingly, the Chagga use iron tools to create these wooden implements. In terms of metallurgy, the Chagga are adept craftsmen, operating primitive forges equipped with goatskin bellows and utilizing wood charcoal instead of coal. They produce various iron tools, including hatchets, double-edged knives, robust swords, and particularly well-crafted spears, which have gained recognition for their aesthetic appeal, leading some European observers to doubt their Chagga origins. Historically, the Chagga sourced iron from the Pare people, but they now obtain it from Swahili traders dealing in sticks of varying thickness.
===Wooden craftmanship===
In contrast to their expertise in metalwork, the Chagga show limited interest in pottery, preferring wooden bowls to ceramic ones. The wood used is typically a soft variety that can be skillfully shaped by male artisans, particularly in the Uru Kingdom. This craftsmanship results in a diverse range of utensils, including troughs, household vessels, bowls, plates, and even items functioning as spoons and forks. Additionally, inspired by European designs, the Chagga have begun to create their own smoking pipes y the turn of the 20th century.

===Blacksmithing===
Chagga blacksmiths, or &quot;fundis&quot;, are skilled metalworkers from Chagga land, known for crafting a variety of items, including spears, knives, agricultural tools, and intricate ornaments. Many of these artisans have held esteemed positions as &quot;Mangis&quot; or Kings, enhancing their social standing. Some prominent clans like the Nkini clan of the chiefdom of Mae in Siha were highly repected. In the area, the Chagga blacksmiths were highly regarded. Some even traded their weapons to the coast, and they were frequently in charge of producing weapons for the Taveta and Maasai.

Their craftsmanship is notable for its sophistication despite using simple tools. For example, a typical spear involves extensive resources, including numerous rings of iron. The blacksmithing process requires heating metal in charcoal fires, gradually forging and carbonizing it to create a steel-like quality. Instead of anvils, they use ironstone and manipulate hot metal with long-handled pincers.

Fire is maintained through traditional bellows operated by a craftsman, and charcoal is treated as a valuable resource, prepared through a careful burning process of trees. This meticulous approach highlights the skill and resourcefulness of Chagga blacksmiths in producing durable and culturally significant metalwork.

The Pare, Taveta, and Taita peoples had been the chief suppliers of iron to the Chagga blacksmiths. The demand for iron increased from the beginning of the nineteenth century because of military rivalries among the Chagga rulers. It is likely that there was a connection between this rivalry and the development of long-distance trade from the coast to the interior of the Pangani River basin, suggesting the Chagga&#x27;s contacts with the coast may have dated to about the end of the eighteenth century.

===Diet===
The Chagga diet in the 19th century was predominantly vegetarian, featuring crops such as eleusine (a key ingredient in Chagga banana beer), pearl millet, over 18 varieties of bananas, edible lilies (Caribbean cabbage), a variety of peas and beans, sweet potatoes, yams, maize, cassava, guinea corn, and sugar cane. Unlike the coastal communities, Poultry was not raised, and fishing was uncommon. Cattle , goats and sheep were raised for their milk and meat. Tobacco is also cultivated and was consumed through smoking or chewing, noted for its strong potency.

In terms of animal based nutrition, the Chagga consume significant amounts of milk and butter, although the butter often has a pronounced flavor from local aromatic herbs. Meat is highly valued, and warm fresh blood is particularly enjoyed, although access to meat is often more limited for the common people.

===Dress and jewelry ===
Members of the Chagga community during the 19th century fashion are known for their distinctive traditional jewelry, which includes large and heavy pewter armlets and leglets, as well as multiple necklaces that individuals may wear simultaneously if they possess several. Women typically wear beaded belts featuring specific patterns, while those identified as wealthy often adorn themselves with numerous colorful beaded fringes. These fringes serve as cinctures and fillets, from which long strands of Chagga metal beads or chains made of copper, iron, and brass are suspended. These adornments play a significant role in expressing cultural identity and social status within the Chagga community.


The Mangis, elders, and married women are the main wearers of modest clothing, which is typically very simple among the Chagga. According to similar Maasai customs from the late 19th century, young men usually dislike wearing full clothing until they are older or more affluent, at which point they may wear larger pieces of fabric. Poorer people, known as &quot;small men,&quot; on the other hand, usually wear very little clothing, usually made from cowhide or scraps of cloth.

It is important to note that the absence of extensive clothing does not correlate with moral character; many children are unclothed without any negative connotation. In fact, local art, often sought after by both the young and old in more developed societies, might be seen as scandalous by the Chagga.

The desire for aesthetic presentation is evident in their grooming practices. Men maintain their hair meticulously and pay particular attention to their ears, which are pierced in childhood. Over time, they gradually enlarge the lobes by inserting progressively larger pieces of wood, often resulting in lobes that can touch the shoulders. In some areas, intricate carved wood pieces are placed atop the ear cartilage, resembling small horns. Women are skilled in creating elaborate ornamental jewelry, including earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and girdles made from iron, copper, and tin, as well as colorful pearl beads. Often, impoverished individuals may choose decorative pearls over practical cloth, valuing their visual appeal.

===Lineage rituals: slaugtering feasts===
Slaughtering feasts play a crucial role in Chagga lineage structures, primarily involving male participants. These communal events are organized at the invitation of the animal owner, with the scale of the feast depending on the size of the sacrificed animal. Smaller animals like goats or sheep may involve fewer guests, while larger animals, such as cattle, require broader participation from various lineage sub-branches.

The slaughter is typically performed by a designated partner, often a brother, rather than the owner, due to beliefs about the animal&#x27;s spirit recognizing its owner and potentially causing harm. Rituals preceding the slaughter include dedicating the animal to ancestral spirits and participants placing spittle between its horns. The method of slaughter varies by species, with cattle traditionally killed by striking them on the head and suffocating them, while smaller animals are stabbed.

Once the animal is deceased, blood is collected and distributed, with portions reserved for the owner and the individual who raised the animal. The meat is allocated according to traditional rights, with specific cuts designated for certain kin, and misallocation is believed to bring misfortune. The &quot;Kiuno&quot;, a portion consumed on-site, is typically prepared by roasting if fatty, and is eaten with fresh blood mixed with salt. The distribution of meat follows a hierarchy, with senior members receiving their shares first.

During the feasts, participants engage in social activities, consuming banana beer and conversing while the meat cooks. Although only a portion of the animal is cooked on-site, it is customary for the &quot;kiuno&quot; to be eaten there, while larger portions are taken home for redistribution among neighbors and friends. Portions of the animal are also dedicated to ancestors, and various cuts are allocated to specific family members, reflecting the social structure and customs of the community.

Additionally, &quot;kishongu&quot;, or skin rings made from animal hide, were traditionally given out during these feasts as protective amulets and symbols of solidarity. While historically significant, the frequency of these feasts has declined due to modern influences, with many now opting to purchase meat. Nevertheless, slaughtering feasts continue to mark important life events within Chagga culture, demonstrating both culinary and sacrificial significance.

==Customs: birth, marriage and death==
At birth, the Chagga midwife determines whether the child should live or die, although the father has the authority to reject her decision. The newborn must remain in the house of birth until able to walk and is only named when they can respond to it. This naming is a simple affair, typically marked by a meal and expressions of joy. As the child grows, they are assigned age-appropriate tasks; for instance, girls may be tasked with pounding grain, while boys tend to flocks.

Circumcision, performed around the age of fourteen, is celebrated with dancing and festivities, though it lacks religious significance. This practice is not unique to the Chagga, as it has historical roots in Egypt, Ethiopia, and even in regions such as Polynesia and Central America. The Bible recounts Abraham&#x27;s family adopting circumcision, but it does not imply that this was its origin.

===Pregnancy and birth===
In Chagga culture, significant life events—such as birth, circumcision, initiation, marriage, parenthood, and death—are marked by a series of rituals that convey their meanings for the individual, their close relatives, and the broader cosmic context. Key themes of food, sex, and death are prevalent throughout these rituals and are also evident in crisis rituals performed during times of illness or misfortune.

During a woman’s first pregnancy, both spouses must adhere to specific customs to ensure the child&#x27;s healthy development. Pregnant women are advised against consuming male-associated foods, such as bananas and beer, which symbolize male property and fertility. Instead, they are encouraged to eat foods associated with femininity, such as milk, sweet potatoes, and butter. Any disputes between the couple or their families are believed to jeopardize the unborn child, and infidelity during this period is thought to lead to the child’s death.

Ritual feasts during pregnancy include the slaughter of an animal, from which skin rings are made for the couple to symbolize their unity and to invoke spirit protection. A second feast, typically held around the fifth month, involves ceremonial covering of the wife&#x27;s breasts, accompanied by singing and dancing, aimed at supporting the mother and child. The couple receives guidance on childbirth and parental responsibilities, including the instruction that the woman should not cry out during labor. Older women praise the expectant mother, drawing parallels to warriors and recounting myths of women&#x27;s lost power.

As birth approaches, the husband&#x27;s belongings are removed from the hut. During delivery, the woman is supported by her mother-in-law and other female relatives. Any complications in labor are thought to stem from the mother&#x27;s or the husband’s misdeeds, prompting libations and magical remedies to rectify the situation.

Upon the child&#x27;s first cry, women ululate in celebration, and the husband’s mother ties the umbilical cord with banana fiber from a specific tree planted at marriage. The afterbirth is buried according to the child’s gender, either beneath the cattle byre for boys or under the woman’s food storage area for girls.

After the baby is cleaned and wrapped in a banana leaf or cloth, it is presented to relatives by the husband’s mother. She introduces the child to the “food of this world” by chewing a mixture of roasted plantains, milk, and butter and feeding it to the infant. The child is also given dracaena to “open the mouth” and some medicinal plants. A significant concern in Chagga culture is the birth of a child without proper body orifices, which is believed to bring disaster. This anxiety aligns with male initiation myths about a “closed” state and the rituals aimed at ensuring the newborn&#x27;s mouth is opened.

In Chagga culture, the sex of a newborn is traditionally concealed from the father for several days, although it may be symbolically hinted at through the use of specific numbers in women&#x27;s ululations or the knots in a dracaena necklace worn by the infant. The mother is confined to her hut and its surroundings for three months, attended by a female relative, typically a sister-in-law, who assists her with daily tasks such as fetching water and firewood. During this confinement, the mother is nourished with a dish called kitawa, made from bananas and beans cooked with milk. Her husband is responsible for providing her with mlaso, a meal consisting of fat, fresh blood, and milk, with the blood sourced from a tapped animal.

Ceremonies mark the presentation of the child to both maternal and paternal families. At the conclusion of the three-month confinement, the mother has her head shaved and is allowed to visit the women’s market, where she is celebrated as a returning warrior. It is customary for births to occur approximately every three years, allowing for intensive care during early childhood.

Infants remain in close proximity to their mothers, with frequent breastfeeding. Weaning is gradual, often beginning early, and children may continue to breastfeed until around three years of age, or longer if circumstances permit. Until the child’s first tooth appears, they are considered nameless and incomplete, which prompts a ceremony marking their full emergence into the community. Naming ceremonies follow, with the first male and female children “belonging” to the paternal grandparents and named after them, while subsequent children alternate between maternal and paternal naming rights.

After weaning, grandparents may take custody of the child for extended periods, sometimes until the child reaches adulthood. Women, even those beyond childbearing age, have the right to claim a grandchild to live with them. This practice, along with the alternating naming rights, persists in many families today.

===Childhood===
In Chagga culture, specific rites of passage are observed during childhood. At around six years of age, ear-piercing ceremonies are conducted, with the paternal grandfather piercing the right ear and the maternal grandfather piercing the left. Ancestors are invoked to bless the child&#x27;s health and growth.
At approximately twelve years, following the emergence of the second set of teeth, the two central lower incisors are extracted and offered to the ancestors. However, these traditional practices, including ear piercing and tooth removal, are not widely observed in contemporary Chagga society.

From birth until the ages of seven to ten, children, regardless of gender, typically sleep in their mother&#x27;s house, often sharing her sleeping space. After this age, boys transition to sleeping in a separate hut designated for fathers, known as the &quot;tengo&quot;, while girls continue to reside with their mothers.

During early childhood, both boys and girls assist their mothers with domestic tasks. As they mature, boys often face pressure to abandon activities associated with girls, leading them to engage with older male peers in activities such as play fighting and mock battles. Boys accompany their fathers to learn essential male responsibilities, including agriculture, livestock care, and construction techniques, and attend lineage feasts to learn appropriate social behaviors.

In contrast, girls focus on acquiring skills related to food production and preparation, gathering firewood, and assisting their mothers. They often form close peer bonds and work together in the fields.

Traditionally, children&#x27;s labor was viewed as the property and right of their parents. The introduction of compulsory free schooling in recent years has led to some resentment among families regarding the loss of child labor. Nevertheless, parents continue to recognize the importance of education for their children&#x27;s future and aspire for their success.

====The rika====
In traditional Chagga culture, boys underwent circumcision in groups, often timed to coincide with the Mangi&#x27;s declaration for the circumcision of his own son. This practice was associated with age-sets known as &quot;rika&quot;, which were declared &quot;closed&quot; by the chief when a new *rika* was to be initiated. Following circumcision, the initiates entered a period of seclusion and instruction in the forest, where they lived for several months. This experience served as both an ordeal and a learning opportunity, allowing young men from various tribes to interact peacefully.

During this seclusion, initiates were cared for by sponsors, typically elder brothers, and transitioned to hunting for their food, using bows and arrows to capture birds. Symbolically, these hunting activities were integral to the boys&#x27; transformation into men, with comparisons drawn between hunting and procreation. Instruction involved the use of a &quot;teaching stick,&quot; a decorated cane inscribed with symbols related to reproduction, reinforcing the connection between masculinity and fertility.

As part of the initiation, the initiates swore oaths using meat from their hunts, which was dipped in a pit designated for faeces, symbolizing the secrets of their initiation.
A key myth, known as the &quot;ngoso&quot;, suggested that initiates&#x27; rectums were sealed, allowing them to digest food without defecating until a ceremonial aging process. This myth reinforced notions of masculinity, with the &quot;plugged&quot; rectum symbolizing male strength. The initiates were instructed to keep these truths hidden from women and children, as knowledge of their bodily functions could lead to social repercussions, such as sterility.
During their training, young men were warned against drinking with the uninitiated to prevent sexual transgressions and were instructed to avoid eating certain foods, including animal rectums, which were reserved for women and children. Following various rituals, the initiates returned to the chief&#x27;s hut for a celebratory feast, during which oxen were slaughtered. In the weeks that followed, the initiates participated in sexual license, asserting their right to engage with any unrelated woman they encountered.

====The shinga====
Girls traditionally underwent circumcision shortly before the onset of menstruation, either individually or in small groups.
The ceremony took place in the hut of an experienced operator, typically an elderly woman, and was attended by family members. In the Vunjo region, the procedure involved the removal of part of the labia minora and clitoris, with the wounds treated using herbal remedies. Following the operation, the girls were celebrated with dancing and the consumption of banana beer. If betrothed, a fiancé would present gifts. A subsequent dance featured the girl using a stick to demand presents from attendees, symbolically preparing for her future role by receiving an old hoe, believed to bring good fortune in planting.

The circumcision celebration marked a significant milestone in a girl&#x27;s life, during which she received the most gifts she would ever obtain, including livestock and cash contributions from her family and relatives. After the festivities, she entered a period of seclusion for three months, during which she was cared for and fattened by her family. Following this confinement, she and her circumcised peers would publicly emerge adorned in special cloaks and decorations, celebrating their re-entry into society over a two-week period.

Before marriage, girls were required to undergo the &quot;shiga&quot;, a two-month course of instruction for uninitiated girls in their community. This training was initiated by one of the girls or her family and took place in a local banana grove, with the girls returning home each night. The instructor, a woman knowledgeable about male secrets, would ceremonially paint each girl’s head with a mixture of ochre and water.

The instruction involved riddles and metaphors related to female procreation, focusing on symbols such as clay pots, fire, and small animals. Participants would engage in activities that symbolized the search for progeny, paralleling the male initiation process.
The teachings included explanations of menstruation and sexual matters, emphasizing the need to conceal menstruation to prevent witchcraft. The girls were instructed about the historical narrative that the attributes of masculinity, such as the penis, were once the domain of women before being taken by force. This instruction not only conveyed cultural teachings about femininity and procreation but also reinforced community bonds among the girls.

===Marriage===
In terms of marital structures, the Chagga practice both monogamy and polygamy, with the latter dependent on a man&#x27;s wealth, as marriage can be costly. The first wife is regarded as the primary wife, and other wives are expected to show her respect and obedience. Each wife maintains her own household and children, and meals are taken separately from their husband.

When a girl reaches marriageable age, she undergoes premarital instruction (&quot;shinga&quot;) from an older female relative for several months. Upon completion, she adorns her legs with bells, signaling her impending marriage. The wedding itself resembles a market transaction, where the bridegroom palyfully &quot;kidnaps&quot; the bride in a symbolic manner, reflecting a practice found among various other African tribes.
====Marriage customs====
Historically, Chagga marriage practices involved parental arrangements for betrothal, contingent upon the consent of the children involved. Senior female relatives often acted as intermediaries and matchmakers, conducting inquiries into the families&#x27; reputations through conversations with neighbors. The initial phase of courtship included a visit by the young woman and her female companions to the young man’s home, where festivities of singing and dancing would take place. If the young woman was pleased with her reception and the prospective husband&#x27;s family, negotiations would advance.

The marriage process was characterized by a series of elaborate ceremonies, beginning with beer feasts that involved the transfer of gifts, including beer, goats, and meat, from the groom’s family to the bride’s family. Upon returning from the visit to the groom&#x27;s homestead, a beer-drinking celebration was held to discuss marriage arrangements, during which the bride received a necklace from her fiancé, presented by his sister. If applicable, the bride would undergo circumcision at this stage, followed by a period of seclusion in her mother-in-law&#x27;s hut, where she would be cared for and prepared for her new role.

During this seclusion, it was considered auspicious for the bride to menstruate for the first time. The evidence of this was ceremonially sent back to her natal home, where her mother and female relatives would celebrate and perform rituals to promote her fertility. A kinsman of the groom was appointed as the marriage trustee, known as mkara, with his wife serving as a female counterpart. Their responsibilities included overseeing rituals, witnessing bridewealth payments, and mediating any disputes between the couple.

====Gender segregation norm====
In traditional Chagga society, social segregation of men and women was normative and widely accepted. Marital dynamics reflected this separation, as husbands and wives did not dine together; the wife typically ate with the children, while the husband ate alone. At communal beer feasts, men and women gathered in distinct groups, maintaining their separation, a practice that extends to church services today.

Women held significant roles in the marketplace, which was traditionally a female domain, allowing them to retain the profits from their trading activities. In public, men and women exhibited camaraderie among same-sex friends, such as holding hands, yet such displays were not permitted between men and women.

Ownership of property was gender-specific; while women could not own or manage land, they maintained influence over its use through their male relatives and held a degree of power through traditional practices. The domestic sphere, particularly the family hut, was primarily the woman&#x27;s domain, especially after the husband established a separate auxiliary hut, known as the *tengo*. Women frequently visited one another, fostering companionship among sisters-in-law and nurturing relationships with their maternal kin.

Women often returned to their natal homes, especially to visit children raised by grandmothers. In cases of serious marital conflicts, women could seek refuge with their fathers or brothers, with male relatives representing their interests during disputes. The appointed marriage trustees, or mkara, would mediate these conflicts, involving the woman&#x27;s family.

===Old age===
In Chagga society, aging carries both advantages and disadvantages. Elders are viewed as possessing spiritual power, especially if they have prosperous families and grown sons, providing them with protection against witchcraft and malevolent spirits.
As they age, individuals gain significant privileges within their lineage, receiving larger portions of food and drink at communal feasts and assuming roles as religious leaders. They are respected figures at gatherings, believed to be closer to ancestral spirits, and thus wield considerable supernatural influence.

However, elder status is not without its limitations. As individuals age, they often allocate much of their property to their wives and children, thereby losing control over their resources. While physical decline affects their ability to perform strenuous labor, they gain spiritual strength as custodians of traditional knowledge. Offending an elder can have serious consequences, as unresolved grievances are thought to persist into the spirit realm.

Women also experience increased authority with age. As grandmothers, they can influence marriage arrangements and manage household dynamics, enjoying social freedoms denied to younger women. The transition to senior status for men is marked by their child&#x27;s circumcision, celebrated with rituals that signify their formal entry into the elder age-grade. This process is metaphorically described as &quot;taking oneself off the banana stem,&quot; indicating the end of childbearing years.

===Death===
In the event of a death, the Chagga do not attribute it to external malice but regard it as a natural occurrence. The burial customs vary: if the deceased is a child, an unmarried man, or a childless individual, the body is taken deep into the woods, covered with leaves, and left there. Conversely, married individuals with children are buried within the household, with the husband interred to the right of the door and the mother to the left.

====Burial customs====
In Chagga culture, burial customs vary according to the deceased&#x27;s gender and social status. When a man dies, he is typically buried in his first wife’s hut, specifically beneath the milk storage area. The grave is dug by the deceased&#x27;s principal heirs—usually his eldest and youngest sons—or by a brother designated as the inheritor.
Following the death, it is customary to slaughter an ox, often belonging to the deceased, in a nearby banana grove. This act serves as an offering to the &quot;Mangi&quot; of the other world, facilitating the deceased&#x27;s admission into the afterlife; a goat may be substituted in the case of financial hardship.

For women, burial ceremonies are similar but simpler. Women are also buried in their homes; however, a goat is sacrificed in lieu of an ox, and the grave is dug by her male relatives, such as her father or brother. Burial in a hut is reserved for individuals with children; deceased children are laid in the banana grove, while the bodies of sterile or barren individuals are discarded in the wild, where they are typically consumed by scavengers.

Prior to burial, the body of a man is stripped of ornaments and adorned with dracaena leaves shaped into necklets, armlets, and anklets. The corpse is anointed with butter and red ochre, and food, such as fat and milk, is placed in its mouth to sustain the deceased on their journey to the afterlife. The body is then covered with the hide of the slaughtered ox or banana leaves and positioned either seated or lying on its right side, facing Kibo peak. Digestive contents from the sacrificed ox are scattered on the corpse by mourners before the grave is filled. The meat from the ox is subsequently distributed among fatherless men and widows.

Following burial, a vigil is maintained at the grave for four days. If the deceased was wealthy, another ox is slaughtered the following day; otherwise, leftover meat is consumed. During this time, mourners refrain from work, receiving food and beer from neighbors. They also perform cursing ceremonies aimed at anyone believed to be responsible for the death. On the fourth day, a gathering of relatives, neighbors, and creditors takes place to discuss the deceased&#x27;s property and obligations, making arrangements for the guardianship of minor children and widows.

One to two years after the burial, a second slaughtering of an ox occurs, and the bones of the deceased are exhumed and relocated to a sacred area in the banana grove designated for ancestral skulls. The bones are removed through a tunnel excavated beneath the house&#x27;s wall, as no bones are allowed to remain in the home. The skull, tied to the arm bone with dracaena, is placed facing Kibo alongside other ancestral skulls. A cutting from the grandfather&#x27;s dracaena is planted next to the new skull&#x27;s resting place, which is marked by three surrounding stones and a flat stone atop it. In some regions of Kilimanjaro, skulls are placed in clay pots rather than buried. Lastly, some stomach contents from the slaughtered animal are placed on the covering stone, and a senior elder offers final farewells on behalf of the lineage.

<text>Konstantin Ozgan (, ) was a leading politician in Abkhazia serving i.a. as Supreme Soviet Chairman, Foreign Minister, Economy Minister, First Vice Premier and as Chairman of the Council of Elders of Abkhazia

== Early life and career ==
Konstantin Ozgan was born on 15 May 1939 in the village of Lykhny, Gudauta District. In 1978, Ozgan became first secretary of the Gudauta Raikom of the Communist Party (a post he held until 1989) and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian ASSR and deputy head of its Presidium. In 1987, Ozgan became Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, a ceremonial function.

According to Anri Jergenia, in 1989, the Central Committee of the Georgian SSR tried to nominate Ozgan, who enjoyed popularity, for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to thwart the election of Vladislav Ardzinba. However, Ozgan refused to be nominated. In 1990, Ozgan resigned as Supreme Soviet Chairman to make way for Ardzinba, because the Presidium had been abolished and it had become the most important office.

He has been accused by Georgian intellectuals of being responsible for the July 1989 clashes in Sukhumi, in which 25 people died.

From 1991 until 1996, Ozgan was a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly of Abkhazia.

== Minister for Foreign Affairs ==
Konstantin Ozgan rose to the position of Abkhazian foreign minister in 1996, when his predecessor Leonid Lakerbaia resigned. He handled much of the early negotiations with the United Nations. He met then Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze multiple times, as part of a regular series of negotiations during his two years in office.

As one of the entity&#x27;s more moderate leaders, he once proposed a five-year moratorium on discussions of Abkhazia&#x27;s future political status as an interim compromise, in a similar fashion to the deal Russia had at that time with Chechnya. While this was the closest the two sides had come to agreement, it was rejected by the Georgian side.

In the earlier stages of Ozgan&#x27;s term, he had overseen some of the more successful negotiations between the two sides. However, in 1997, tensions began to rise again. Ozgan accused the Georgian government of being behind terrorist attacks on Abkhaz soldiers. He also demanded that the Commonwealth of Independent States lift sanctions before any Georgian refugees could return to their homes – a policy which has since continued under his successors.

==Vice Premier and Minister for the Economy==
After being replaced as foreign minister, Ozgan was appointed Vice Premier of Abkhazia and minister for the Economy. In 1999, he headed the Abkhaz commission that was to oversee the unilateral repatriation to the Gali district of ethnic Georgian displaced persons. On April 2, 1999, Ozgan survived an assassination attempt when four colleagues were seriously injured by a landmine.

== Deputy of Parliament ==
Though he no longer occupied as much of a public role as he once did, Ozgan remained a deputy in the People&#x27;s Assembly of Abkhazia. He lost a 2002 bid for the position of speaker to Nugzar Ashuba, and became deputy speaker instead. Ozgan failed to be re-elected in the 2007 elections.

Konstantin Ozgan joined the opposition movement against former President Vladislav Ardzinba, which in 2005 was successful in installing opposition candidate Sergei Bagapsh as President. One of his recent proposals was an unsuccessful attempt to have the segment of the Abkhaz constitution overturned that demanded that a presidential candidate have lived in Abkhazia for more than five years before running for office.

==Chairman of the Council of Elders==
On 31 July 2009 Konstantin Ozgan was chosen by the Council of Elders of Abkhazia to succeed outgoing chairman Pavel Adzynba. Adzynba had asked to be allowed to step down after heading the council for 16 years.

On 21 March 2016, in response to a planned recall referendum, Ozgan on behalf of the Council of the Elders called upon government and opposition to form a coalition government instead.

==Death==
Konstantin Ozgan died on 22 March 2016. On 25 March, Ozgan was posthumously awarded the Order of Leon by President Raul Khajimba.

<doc id="965398" wikidata="Q1147722" url="?curid=965398" title="Fox Glacier">
<text>Fox Glacier (; officially Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe) is a temperate maritime glacier located in Westland Tai Poutini National Park on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Like nearby Franz Josef Glacier, Fox Glacier is one of the most accessible glaciers in the world, with a terminal face as low as 300 m above sea level, close to the village of Fox Glacier. It is a major tourist attraction and about 1000 people daily visit it during high tourist season.

== Naming ==
The glacier is known by local Māori as &quot;Te Moeka o Tuawe&quot; (&#x27;The bed of Tuawe&#x27;). According to oral tradition, Hine Hukatere loved climbing in the mountains and persuaded her lover Tuawe to climb with her. Tuawe was a less experienced climber than Hine Hukatere but loved to accompany her, until an avalanche swept him from the peaks to his death. Hine Hukatere was broken-hearted and her many, many tears flowed down the mountain. Rangi the Sky Father took pity on her and froze them to form the glacier now known as Franz Josef; the glacier now known as Fox marks Tuawe&#x27;s resting place.

In 1857 local Māori led Pākehā Leonard Harper and Edwin Fox to both glaciers, the first Europeans to see them. In 1865, German geologist Julius von Haast was the first to explore and survey the glaciers at the head of this valley, and named them Victoria and Albert, after the queen and her consort. The Victoria Glacier kept its name, but the lower part of the Albert Glacier was renamed in 1872 after a visit by then Premier of New Zealand Sir William Fox.

Explorer Charlie Douglas had already visited the glacier himself in the 1860s, looking for a cow. &quot;In those ancient days I did not pay much attention to the glaciers,&quot; he later wrote.

With the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the glacier&#x27;s name changed once again to Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe.

== Geography ==

Fed by four alpine glaciers, Fox Glacier descends on its 13 km journey from the Southern Alps towards the coast, finishing near rainforest above sea level. After retreating for most of the previous 100 years, it advanced between 1985 and 2009. In 2006, the average rate of advance was about a metre a week. In January 2009, the terminal face of the glacier was still advancing and its vertical or overhanging faces regularly collapsed. Since then there has been a significant retreat, with the 2009 high level clearly visible as vegetation line on the southern slope above what is left of the lower glacier today.

The outflow of the glacier forms the Fox River. During the last ice age, its ice reached beyond the present coastline, and the glacier left behind many moraines during its retreat. Lake Matheson formed as a kettle lake within one of these. 

==Tourism==

In an 1890s report on &quot;Tourist Attractions in the Okarito District&quot;, Charlie Douglas listed several sights in the Fox Glacier area, including the view from Malcolm&#x27;s Knob at the mouth of the Cook River. &quot;If the road was cleared up through to Cook&#x27;s [Flat] it would be an easy day&#x27;s stage through to the Fox Glacier; one day would do that place, thence down to Malcolms Knob and Gillespies,&quot; he wrote. He also noted the road between the farming settlement of Weheka at Fox Glacier and Waiho to the north (now Franz Josef) was very poor. &quot;…when I came through that way, I left the track and took to the bush as being far better walking.&quot; By 1903 it had been improved and Dr Ebenezer Teichelmann described it as a good horse track.

Douglas had previously surveyed the glacier with A.P. Harper and William Wilson, and had built the first hut there, known as the iron hut, near the 1896 glacier terminal.

In the 1920s Westland was being marketed as a tourist destination for the scenic vistas of its mountains, lakes and forests. Visitors to Weheka would stay in the Williams or Sullivan homesteads, until in 1928 the Sullivan brothers opened the first hotel in the valley, the 40-room Fox Glacier Hostel (which, expanded and refurbished several times over the years, is still operating as a hotel).

Official glacier guiding began at this point, employing well-known mountaineers like Frank Alack, Harry Ayres, and Tom Christie. Access to the glacier was via a track along the north side of the Fox River valley and across a swingbridge. They could climb onto the ice at a lunch shelter at the Chalet Viewpoint, built in 1931 (and which burnt down in 1973). As the glacier retreated a gallery was built along the side of Cone Rock to allow access, until it retreated still further. Eventually the northern route became the main access road for tourists.

Chancellor Hut was built in 1930–31 on the southwest face of Chancellor Ridge, now 200 m above the glacier. Planned by mountain guides Alec and Peter Graham in 1929, all the materials had to be packed up Fox Glacier manually in 1930 in the days before helicopter airlifts. It is the oldest remaining mountain hut in the Southern Alps still on its original site, and is a Category II Historic Building on the Heritage New Zealand list. At an altitude of 1200 m, it was designed to provide climbing opportunities to tourists, rather than as a staging post for mountaineers climbing on the Great Divide. A hut was also built at on Craig&#x27;s Peak () for overnight climbing trips.

In the early 1930s and early 1940s roads were built up the northern and southern sides of the valley to improve access. The northern road led to main car park for tourists who wanted to walk up to the glacier face, although barriers and warning signs prevented them from entering the &quot;danger zone&quot; close to the active glacier face. Safety warnings were ignored, however, by up to one third of the 600,000 tourists a year visiting West Coast glaciers. Two Australian tourists were killed in January 2009 after they crossed safety barriers and walked 500 m to the terminal face to take photos. On 21 November 2015, seven people were killed when a Eurocopter Écureuil (squirrel) helicopter operated by Alpine Adventures crashed on the glacier.

On 26 March 2019 heavy rains caused flooding in the area, destroying the Waiho Bridge across State Highway 6 at Franz Josef. The rains also triggered an enormous landslide in the Fox River valley that washed away about 150 m of the northern glacier access road and destroyed the car park. The road had already been washed out several times in the previous year, and just two months previously it had been repaired at a cost of $430,000. The Alpine Gardens landslide comprises 50–70 million cubic metres of rock and is still active, moving 100–700 mm a day. The road has been closed indefinitely, with no practical solutions available for repairing it, and access to the glacier is now by helicopter. To compensate for the closure of the access road, a $3.9 million spending package was announced in August 2019 for other tourism projects around Fox Glacier: extending a cycleway to Lake Matheson, upgrading and reopening the track to Lake Gault, improving the road and track access on the south side of the Fox River valley, and reopening the coastal walkway to Galway Beach north of Gillespies Beach.

<doc id="965399" wikidata="Q1361620" url="?curid=965399" title="Go ranks and ratings">
<text>There are various systems of Go ranks and ratings that measure the skill in the traditional board game Go. Traditionally, Go rankings have been measured using a system of dan and kyu ranks. Especially in amateur play, these ranks facilitate the handicapping system, with a difference of one rank roughly corresponding to one free move at the beginning of the game. This system is also commonly used in many East Asian martial arts, where it often corresponds with a belt color. With the ready availability of calculators and computers, rating systems have been introduced. In such systems, a rating is rigorously calculated on the basis of game results.

== Kyu and dan ranks ==
Traditionally, the level of players has been defined using &quot;kyu&quot; and &quot;dan&quot; ranks. Kyu ranks are considered &quot;student&quot; ranks. Dan ranks are considered &quot;master&quot; ranks. Beginners who have just learned the rules of the game are usually around 30th kyu. As they progress, they advance numerically downwards through the kyu grades. The best kyu grade attainable is therefore 1st kyu. If players progress beyond 1st kyu, they will receive the rank of 1st dan, and from then on will move numerically upwards through the dan ranks. In martial arts, 1st dan is the equivalent of a black belt. The very best players may achieve a &quot;professional dan rank&quot;.

The rank system is tabulated from the lowest to highest ranks:

(There is also an amateur title of 8-dan and a professional title of 10-dan, but these are not the same as ranks.)

Although almost all organizations use this system, there is no universal calibration. The methods of awarding each of those ranks and the corresponding levels of strength vary from country to country and among online Go servers. This means that a player who is considered to be a 2nd kyu in one country, may only be considered a 5th kyu in another.

Differences in strength up to amateur dan level generally correspond to the level of handicap that would yield an even game between the two players. For instance, it is expected that a 3d player could give 2 handicap stones to a 1d player and win half of their games. In contrast, differences in professional ranks are much smaller, perhaps 1/4 to 1/3 of a handicap stone. There are some significant differences in strength between ordinary 9p players and the best players in the world because 9p is the highest rank possible, which may account for this variation.

===Origin===
The first Go ranks were given in 2nd century (CE) China, when Handan Chun (Chinese: ) described the 9 Pin Zhi (九品制) ranking system in his book &quot;Classic of Arts&quot; (艺经).
From the early 17th century, the Japanese formalised the teaching and ranking of Go. The system was later used in martial arts schools; and is thought to be derived originally from court ranks in China. It is thought that the fact that there are 9 professional dan grades finds its base in the original 9 Chinese Pin Zhi grades.

===Achieving a dan rank===
&quot;Dan&quot; (abbreviated online as &quot;d&quot;) ranks are for advanced amateur players. Although many organisations let players choose their own kyu rank to a certain extent, dan ranks are often regulated. This means that players will have to show good results in tournaments or pass exams to be awarded a dan rank. Serious students of the game will often strive to attain a dan rank, much as martial arts practitioners will strive to achieve a black belt. For amateurs, dan ranks up to 7th dan are available. Above this level, a player must become a professional player to achieve further promotions. In Japan and China, some players are awarded an amateur 8th &quot;dan&quot; rank as an honorary title for exceptional achievement. In the United States, amateur dan ranks are often based on the AGA rating system. Under this system, some strong amateurs and former professional players have achieved up to 9th dan amateur, though generally they will register as 6th or 7th dan in international events. Similarly, some players have achieved 9th dan amateur ranks in the rating system of online Go servers.

Although players who have achieved professional dan ranks are nominally stronger than amateur dan players, in practice some of the strongest 7th dan amateur players have a playing level on par with that of some professional players. Such players have either never tried for a professional rank, or have chosen to remain amateur players because they do not want to make a career out of playing Go.

===Professional ranks===

The professional dan ranking system is similar to that of amateurs in that it awards dan ranks that increase numerically with skill. The difference between these grades is much smaller than with amateurs however, and is not based on the number of handicap stones required. Professional dan ranks go up to 9th dan, but the strength difference between a 1st dan and a 9th dan professional is generally no more than 2–3 handicap stones.

To distinguish between professional &quot;dan&quot; and amateur &quot;dan&quot; ranks, the former is often abbreviated to &quot;p&quot; (sometimes called &quot;ping&quot;) and the latter to &quot;d&quot;. There was no such abbreviation in the past, and this is not generally used as an abbreviation beyond the Internet, where it is common, but not universal.

==Rating systems==
With the invention of calculators and computers, it has become easy to calculate a rating for players based on the results of their games. Commonly used rating systems include the Elo and Glicko rating systems. Rating systems generally predict the probability that one player will defeat another player and use this prediction to rank a player&#x27;s strength.

===Elo ratings as used in Go===
The European Go Federation (EGF) implementation of the Elo rating system attempts to establish rough correspondence between ratings and kyu/dan ranks. This is done by varying some of the components of the Elo formula to achieve a close match to the adjacent table. The probability (SE) that the player with the lower rating, player A, wins against a higher rated player B is given by the formula

:formula_1

* &quot;D&quot; is the rating difference: formula_2
* &quot;a&quot; is varied depending on the prior rating of player A.

The probability that player B wins is calculated as
:formula_3

The new rating of a player is calculated as

:formula_4

* &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; = new rating
* &quot;R&quot;&quot;o&quot; = old rating
* &quot;S&quot; = score (1, 0.5 or 0)
* &quot;S&quot;&quot;E&quot; = expected score
* &quot;K&quot; is varied depending on the rating of the players

&quot;K&quot; is varied depending on the rating of the players, because of the low confidence in (lower) amateur ratings (high fluctuation in the outcome) but high confidence in pro ratings (stable, consistent play). K is 116 at rating 100 and 10 at rating 2700

In the EGF system, the Elo points won by the winner almost equal the ones lost by the loser and the maximum points movement is the constant &quot;K&quot; (from above). However, there is a slight inflationary mechanism built into the ratings adjustment after each game to compensate for the fact that newcomers usually bring fewer ELO points into the pool than they take out with them when they cease active play. Other Elo-flavor ratings such as the AGA, IGS, and DGS systems use maximum likelihood estimation to adjust ratings, so those systems are anchored by prior distributions rather than by attempting to ensure that the gain/loss of ratings is zero sum.

===Other rating systems===

A variation of the Elo rating system called WHR (&#x27;Whole History Rating&#x27;), differs from standard Elo in that it retroactively re-rates players based on their entire history after each new result is added, rather than incrementally changing a player&#x27;s rating on a game-by-game basis. This involves more intense computation than other methods, but is claimed that &quot;in comparison to Elo, Glicko, TrueSkill, and decayed-history algorithms, WHR produces better predictions.&quot;. The website Go Ratings implements the WHR method to calculate global player rankings.

===Rating base===

The ratings of players are generally measured using the game results of Go competitions and tournaments. Most clubs and countries maintain their own ratings, as do Go playing servers. Go tournaments in Europe use the EGF Official ratings. 

In a small club, ranks may be decided informally and adjusted manually when players consistently win or lose. In larger clubs or country wide rating systems, a mathematical ranking system is generally easier to maintain. Players can then be promoted or demoted based on their strength as calculated from their wins and losses.

Most Go playing servers use a mathematical rating system to keep track of the playing strength of their members. Such ratings may or may not be translated to kyu and dan ranks for the convenience of the players.

Player pools that do not regularly mix (such as different countries, or sub-groups on online servers) often result in divergent playing strengths compared to the same nominal rank level of other groups. Players asked to give their rank will therefore often qualify it with &quot;in my country&quot; or &quot;on this Internet server&quot;.

=== Winning probabilities ===
The rating indirectly represents the probability of winning an even game against other rated players. This probability depends only on the difference between the two players&#x27; ratings, but its magnitude varies greatly from one implementation to another. The American Go Association adopted a uniform standard deviation of 104, i.e. slightly more than one rank, while the European Go Federation ratings have a sliding standard of deviation from 200 for beginners down to 70 for top players. The IGS has a fixed standard deviation for all levels of play, but a non-standard distribution. The following table displays some of the differences:

=== Winning chances and handicaps in Go versus chess ===

While in chess a player must take some risks to avoid a draw, in Go draws (jigo) are either impossible (with superko and non-integer komi, such as 6.5 points, as is common) or less likely in the case of integer komi. Also, an average game of Go lasts for 240 moves (120 moves in chess terms), compared to 40 in chess, so there are more opportunities for a weaker player to make sub-optimal moves. The ability to transform a small advantage into a win increases with playing strength. Due to this ability, stronger players are more consistent in their results against weaker players and will generally score a higher percentage of wins against opponents at the same rank distance.

<doc id="965402" wikidata="Q772561" url="?curid=965402" title="Alfa Romeo 155">
<text>The Alfa Romeo 155 (Type 167) is a compact executive car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer Alfa Romeo between 1992 and 1998. It was unveiled in January 1992 at Barcelona, with the first public launch in March 1992, at the Geneva Motor Show. A total of 195,526 units were made before it was replaced by the 156.

==Design==

Developed to replace the 75 and based on the parent company Fiat Group&#x27;s &quot;Tipo Tre&quot; platform, the 155 was somewhat larger in dimension than the 75 and had evolved styling from that of its predecessor. The 155 was designed by Italian design house I.DE.A Institute. An exceptional drag coefficient of 0.29 was achieved with the body design. The boxy design of the 155 allowed for a big boot space of .

The most significant technical change from the 75 was the switch to a front-wheel drive layout. A four-wheel-drive model called the 155 Q4 was also available, which had a turbocharged engine and a permanent four-wheel drive powertrain, both derived from the Lancia Delta Integrale; it was essentially considered to be a Lancia Delta Integrale with a different body.

The new model came in &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Super&quot; trims. The Sport had a slightly lowered ride height and more aggressive dampers while the Super had the option of wood trim and electronically controlled dampers and seat controls.

The reception of the 155 was generally lukewarm. The 75 had been conceived prior to Fiat&#x27;s acquisition of Alfa Romeo, so as the last automobile independently developed by Alfa Romeo made it cast a shadow over the 155; the loss of rear-wheel drive was frequently cited as the main cause of disappointment. Nevertheless, the 155 was entered in Touring Car racing and was very successful in every major championship it entered, which gradually improved its image.

The 155 received a facelift in 1995 and changes included a wider body as well as a wider track and revised steering based on Alfa Romeo&#x27;s racing experience. The facelift also brought in new 16 valve engines for the 1.8 and 2.0 litre models, whilst retaining the 2.5 litre V6 and making some improvements to cabin materials and build quality.

There were several Sport Packs available, including a race inspired body kit (spoiler and side skirts) and black or graphite coloured 16-inch Speedline wheels. The luxury oriented Super trim came with wood inserts in the cabin and silver-painted alloy wheels.

The 155 was never produced in the &quot;Sportwagon&quot; bodystyle (Alfa Romeo&#x27;s term for an estate or station wagon), but Sbarro made a proposal for such a model in 1994 which was not put into production.

Production of the 155 ceased in 1998, when it was replaced by the 156.

==Timeline==

* 1992 – 155 launched
* 1993 – Grille design changed from “flushed” to “recessed”
* 1994 – 155 1.8 T.Spark Silverstone introduced to the British market, 155 Q4 and turbodiesel to some markets
* 1995 – New &quot;widebody&quot; series 2 155 launched with wider track and quick rack steering wheel; initially only available with 2.0 L 16v engine
* June 1996 – Widebody design becomes available with 1.6 L 16v and 1.8 L 16v engines
* 1998 – Production ends

==Specifications and special editions==

The 155 was initially available with 1.7 L Twin Spark, 1.8 L Twin Spark, and 2.0 L Twin Spark petrol engines, the latter two were equipped with variable valve timing. The 1.7 L was not sold in the United Kingdom.

Two four cylinder turbocharged diesel engines, a Fiat derived 1.9 L () and a VM Motori 2.5 L () were available in some markets, except for the United Kingdom.

At the top of the 155 range were the 2.5 L V6, using a engine derived from the 3.0 L V6 used in the larger 164, and the Q4 which used a drivetrain derived from the Lancia Delta Integrale which meant a 2.0 L 16V turbocharged engine and permanent four-wheel drive.

The Q4 also incorporated three differential gears (normal at the front, epicyclic at the centre (including a Ferguson viscous coupling) and Torsen self-locking at the rear). Both the 2.5 V6 and Q4 models were also available with electronically adjustable suspension with two damper settings (automatic and sport).

The most notable special edition was the &quot;Silverstone&quot; edition released in the United Kingdom which was known as the &quot;Formula&quot; in Europe: this was intended to homologate an aero pack for Alfa Romeo in the British Touring Car Championship race series. The pack was included in the boot as bolt on aero kit, consisting of an adjustable rear spoiler and extendable front air splitter. These changes caused controversy during the 1994 BTCC as it was seen as an unfair advantage by the other teams and after missing 1 race, Alfa Romeo were forced to run with aero in its lowest downforce form to finish the championship. 

The Silverstone was a lighter but no more powerful version of the 1.8 L, even though the race car it was homologating had a 2.0 L engine. This anomaly came about because the 1.8 L engine block, with its narrower bore, allowed Alfa Romeo to use a longer stroke on the racing car and stay within the 2.0 L capacity limit.

The Silverstone was only available in either Alfa red or Black paintwork with plain, unpainted bumpers.

==Facelift==


In 1995, the 155 was given an extensive revamp, resulting in wider front and rear tracks with subtle enlargement to the wheel arches to accommodate the changes underneath.

The revised car also received a quicker steering rack, with 2.2 turns lock-to-lock (initially only on the 2.0 litre model, but later followed by the 1.8 litre). The four-cylinder cars retained the twin spark ignition system but received the Alfa Romeo designed 16-valve cylinder heads with belt driven camshafts, still based on engine blocks of Fiat design. They replaced the elderly 8 valve, chain driven camshaft motors of the earlier models.

The 2.5 L V6 engine continued in wide body form (but without the steering changes) while the Q4 was discontinued. In Europe, the 1.7 L Twin Spark was replaced by a 1.6 L 16 valve Twin Spark. Some 8 valve engines continued in series 2 cars in some markets. The wide bodied cars also received revised interiors and equipment specifications to keep the cars competitive in the market.

The wide body (&quot;Series 2&quot;) 155s can be distinguished from their earlier counterparts by their flared front and smooth rear wheel arches (the latter replacing the lip round the wheel arch of the original). They also sported round or oblong indicator side-repeaters and had their model badges moved below the rear lights rather than having them above.

== Engines ==

==155 GTA Stradale==
In 1992, Alfa Romeo on the wake of the wins obtained by the 155 GTA in the Italian CIVT championship, decided to start the production of a &quot;Stradale&quot; version to be manufactured at the Abarth workshop. The car was displayed at Bologna Motor Show and being used at Monza GP d&#x27;Italia as safety car.

Designed by Abarth engineer Sergio Limone, the Stradale used the 155 Q4 as a base using its drivetrain and four-wheel drive system. The interior was stripped of some creature comforts and the car was fitted with a race inspired body kit with a large rear spoiler. Only one unit was made before the project was abandoned due to high manufacturing costs.

==155 TI.Z and GTAZ==
Two special editions of the 155 were made by Zagato. In 1993, the 155 TI.Z was introduced, followed by the 155 GTAZ in 1995. Both models had more muscular looking exterior and increased power than the standard 155, the TI.Z had the Twin Spark engine and GTAZ had the 155 Q4&#x27;s turbocharged two litre engine now rated at . Both models were built only in limited numbers and many of the cars were sent to Japan.
==Motorsport==
The 155 was very successful in touring car racing, using the Supertouring-homologated GTA and the V6 TI for the DTM. Between 1992 and 1994, the 155 managed to take the Italian Superturismo Championship, the German DTM championship (both with Nicola Larini at the wheel), the Spanish Touring Car Championship (with Adrián Campos), and the British Touring Car Championship (with Gabriele Tarquini).

The 155 remained competitive until it was replaced with the 156, finishing third in the DTM (then known as the International Touring Car Championship, or ITC) in 1996 with Alessandro Nannini and winning the Spanish championship again in 1997 with Fabrizio Giovanardi. In 1993, Larini in an Alfa 155 placed second in the FIA Touring Car Challenge behind Paul Radisich in a Ford Mondeo. The 156 was to continue the high standard set by the 155, winning the European Touring Car Championship multiple times.

===155 V6 TI===

The Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI was a FIA Class 1 touring car that Alfa Corse raced from 1993 to 1996 in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft and the subsequent International Touring Car Championship. A naturally-aspirated high-revving 2.5 L 60° V6 engine was coupled to a four wheel drive system, rated at at 11,500 rpm.

Alfa Corse entered two 155 V6 TIs for works drivers Alessandro Nannini and Nicola Larini; the 1993 season was dominated by Larini winning 11 of 22 races.

In 1994, the rivals from Mercedes seemed to have the advantage, but Alfa did manage to win a further eleven races. A more consistent performance from the Germans gave them the title. Since the 1995 season, the team got new sponsorship livery from Martini Racing.

The 1996 version had a 2.5 L naturally-aspirated type 690 90° V6 engine based on the PRV engine rated at at 11,900 rpm. The car has a top speed of around and weighed

The Alfa 155 V6 TI has a record of 38 wins (plus 3 other non championship races). The victories were obtained by seven different drivers: 17 (+1) Nicola Larini, 13 (+1) Alessandro Nannini, 2 Stefano Modena, 2 (+1) Christian Danner, 2 Michael Bartels, 1 Kris Nissen, and 1 Gabriele Tarquini.

<text>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability.
The ICF received approval from all 191 World Health Organization (WHO) member states on May 22, 2001, during the 54th World Health Assembly. Its approval followed nine years of international revision efforts coordinated by WHO. WHO&#x27;s initial classification for the effects of diseases, the &quot;International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps&quot; (ICIDH), was created in 1980.

The ICF classification complements WHO&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD), which contains information on diagnosis and health condition, but not on functional status. The ICD and ICF constitute the core classifications in the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).

==Overview==
The ICF is structured around the following broad components:

* Body functions and structure
* Activities (related to tasks and actions by an individual) and participation (involvement in a life situation)
* Additional information on severity and environmental factors

Functioning and disability are viewed as a complex interaction between the health condition of the individual and the contextual factors of the environment as well as personal factors. The picture produced by this combination of factors and dimensions is of &quot;the person in his or her world&quot;. The classification treats these dimensions as interactive and dynamic rather than linear or static. It allows for an assessment of the degree of disability, although it is not a measurement instrument. It is applicable to all people, whatever their health condition. The language of the ICF is neutral as to etiology, placing the emphasis on function rather than condition or disease. It also is carefully designed to be relevant across cultures as well as age groups and genders, making it highly appropriate for heterogeneous populations.

== Benefits ==
There are benefits of using the ICF for both the patient and the health professional. A major advantage for the patient is the integration of the physical, mental, and social aspects of his or her health condition. All aspects of a person&#x27;s life (development, participation and environment) are incorporated into the ICF instead of solely focusing on his or her diagnosis. A diagnosis reveals little about one&#x27;s functional abilities. Diagnoses are important for defining the cause and prognosis, but identifying the limitations of function is often the information used to plan and implement interventions. Once a rehabilitation team is aware of the daily activities a client is required to participate in, the problem solving sequence set up by the ICF can be utilized. An occupational therapist, for example, would observe a patient performing his or her daily activities and note the patient&#x27;s functional abilities. This information would then be used to determine the extent to which the individual&#x27;s abilities can be improved through therapy and to what extent the environment can be changed to facilitate the individual&#x27;s performance. Intervention at one level (current abilities) has the potential to prevent or modify events at a succeeding level (participation). For example, teaching a deaf child manual signs will foster effective interaction and increase one&#x27;s participation with his or her family.

Rehabilitation therapists will be empowered with the ICF not only in their daily work with their patients, but also when working with other medical disciplines; hospitals and other health care administrations; health authorities and policy makers. All items are operationally defined with clear descriptions that can be applied to real life evaluations with clarity and ease. The language used in the ICF helps facilitate better communication between these groups of people.

== Clinical relevance ==
Knowing how a disease affects one&#x27;s functioning enables better planning of services, treatment, and rehabilitation for persons with long-term disabilities or chronic conditions. The current ICF creates a more integrative understanding of health forming a comprehensive profile of an individual instead of focusing on one&#x27;s disease, illness, or disability. The implications of using the ICF include an emphasis on the strengths of individuals, assisting individuals in participating more extensively in society by the use of interventions aimed at enhancing their abilities, and taking into consideration the environmental and personal factors that might hamper their participation.
Qualifiers: The ICF qualifiers &quot;may be best translated clinically as the levels of functioning seen in a standardized or clinic setting and in everyday environments&quot;. Qualifiers support standardization and the understanding of functioning in a multidisciplinary assessment. They enable all team members to quantify the extent of problems, even in areas of functioning where one is not a specialist. Without qualifiers codes have no inherent meaning. An impairment, limitation or restriction, is qualified from 0 (No problem; 0–4%), 1 (Mild problem: 5–24%), 2 (Moderate problem: 25–49%), 3 (Severe problem: 50–95%) to 4 (Complete problem: 96–100%). Environmental factors are quantified with a negative and positive scale denoting the extent to which the environment acts as a barrier or facilitator. For insurance purposes, the qualifiers can describe the effectiveness of treatment. One can interpret the decreasing of a qualifier score to be an increase in the functional ability of a patient.

== Core sets ==
An ICF Core Set can serve as a reference framework and a practical tool to classify and describe patient functioning in a more time efficient way. ICF Core Sets can be used along the continuum of care and over the course of a health condition. The ICF classification includes more than 1,400 categories limiting its use in clinical practice. It is time-consuming for a clinician to utilize the main volume of the ICF with his or her patients. Only a fraction of the categories is needed. As a general rule, 20% of the codes will explain 80% of the variance observed in practice. ICF Core Sets contain as few as possible, but as many ICF categories as necessary, to describe a patient&#x27;s level of functioning. It is hypothesized that using an ICF Core Set will increase the inter-rater reliability when coding clinical cases as only the relevant categories for a particular patient will be utilized. Since all of the relevant categories are listed in an ICF Core Set, its use in multidisciplinary assessments protects health professionals from missing important aspects of functioning.

== Pediatric use ==
As clinicians and researchers used the ICF, they became more aware of its limitations. The ICF lacks the ability to classify the functional characteristics of a developing child. Different ICF codes are needed across the first years of a child&#x27;s life to capture the growth and development of a disability even when the child&#x27;s diagnosis does not change. The coding system can provide essential information about the severity of a health condition in terms of its impact on functioning. This can serve a significant role for providers caring for children with spectrum disorders such as autism or cerebral palsy. Children with these conditions may have the same diagnoses, but their abilities and levels of functioning widely vary across and within individuals over time.

The first draft of the &quot;International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth&quot; (ICF-CY) was completed in year 2003 and published in 2007. The ICF-CY was developed to be structurally consistent with the ICF for adults. A major difference between the ICF-CY and ICF is that the generic qualifiers from the adult ICF now include developmental aspects for children and youth in the ICF-CY. Descriptions of codes in the ICF-CY were revised and expanded and new content was added to previously unused codes. Codes were added to document characteristics as adaptability, responsivity, predictability, persistence, and approachability. &quot;Sensing&quot; and &quot;exploration of objects&quot; codes were expanded as well as the &quot;importance of learning&quot;. Since a child&#x27;s main occupation is playing, it is also important to include more codes in this area. Different levels of play have separate codes in the ICF-CY (solitary, onlooker, parallel). This contrasts with the adult ICF as only one code existed in regards to leisure or recreation.

Changes in ICF-CY codes over time reflect developmental effects attributable to the child&#x27;s interaction with the environment. Environmental factors influence functioning and development and can be documented as barriers or facilitators using the ICF-CY. The key environments of children and adolescents include their homes, day care centers, schools and recreation settings of playground, parks, and ball fields. Children will transition between different environments many times as they grow. For example, a child will transition into elementary or high school or from one service setting or agency to another. Attention to these transitions of children with disabilities has been identified as an important role for health care providers. A transition requires preparation and planning to find an appropriate and accommodating setting for a child&#x27;s needs. With a coding system such as the ICF-CY, the transition will be smoother and interventions can start where the previous health provider left off.

<doc id="965407" wikidata="Q6487289" url="?curid=965407" title="Lano and Woodley">
<text>Lano and Woodley (Colin Lane and Frank Woodley) is an Australian comedy duo. Previously, the two had been part of comedy trio The Found Objects along with Scott Casley. Casley left and so Lano and Woodley debuted as a double-act in March 1993 at Melbourne&#x27;s Prince Patrick Hotel. Their act features sketch comedy and slapstick theatre. Their television show &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot; aired on the ABC in 1997 and 1999.
In 1994, they won the Edinburgh Fringe Perrier Comedy Award. They have written one book, &quot;Housemeeting&quot;, published in 1996.

Lano and Woodley reunited to tour nationally with a new show named &quot;Fly&quot;, begun in Canberra March 2018.

==Career==
===Stage shows===
Their stage productions include &quot;Curtains&quot;, &quot;Fence&quot;, &quot;Glitzy&quot;, &quot;Slick&quot;, &quot;Bruiser&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; - all original shows that they wrote and performed themselves. The show &quot;Fence&quot; was co-written and directed by Neill Gladwin who also directed &quot;Curtains&quot;.

===&quot;Bruiser&quot;===
The show follows the adventures of Frank and Colin after a nasty confrontation at the local gym where Frank accidentally is challenged to a fight by the local strongman &#x27;Bruiser&#x27;. Both Lano and Woodley alternate between playing themselves and the characters Bruiser and Juliet (the love interest) throughout the show through the use of costumes (at times forced to play each other as well).

===1996: &quot;Housemeeting&quot;===
&quot;Housemeeting&quot;, a book by Lano and Woodley, was published by Penguin Books in 1996, with illustrations by Woodley and a foreword by Andrew Denton.

The story follows their conversations after Colin announces that after years of them living together, Frank has to move out. Throughout the book, Frank makes several desperate attempts to change Colin&#x27;s mind, none of which seem to work.

The story is written in the style of a script, with several chapters covering various subjects (e.g. nicknames, cooking, graffiti etc.) that Colin and Frank discuss (and argue about) as Frank prepares to move out. The style in which it is written is very self-referential and often breaks the fourth wall by talking directly to the reader, putting in deliberate spelling mistakes and filling pages with ellipses (or nothing at all).

===1997: &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot;===
Lano and Woodley created their own television show called &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot; which debuted on Australian TV on ABC in 1997 with the episode &quot;The Girlfriend&quot;. In 2004, all 12 episodes were released on a 2-disc DVD, entitled &quot;The Complete Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot;.

===2004: &quot;The Island&quot;===
In 2004 - 2005, the comedy duo took a tour across Australia called &quot;The Island&quot;. The show consisted of comedy sketches, songs and interaction with the audience, all based around them being stranded on a desert island. A stand-out feature of this performance was the one major set piece used: a motorised, revolving platform, which was used as a stairway, aeroplane, palm tree and court room stand. This performance has been released on DVD and is periodically screened on The Comedy Channel (Foxtel).

===2005: &quot;Lano &amp; Woodley Sing Songs&quot;===
October 2005 saw the release of &quot;Lano &amp; Woodley Sing Songs&quot;, a CD recording of their live performance at the Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne as part of their Australian &quot;Sing Songs&quot; tour. The show consisted of songs that had been written and performed over the course of their career as a comedy duo. The CDs were sold at each of the touring venues, as well as in most music retail and department stores.

===2006: &quot;Goodbye&quot;===
In February 2006, they announced their final tour, entitled &quot;Goodbye&quot;, after 20 years of performing together. The show premiered at the 2006 Adelaide Fringe Festival in March 2006 and was performed in 37 cities and towns across Australia, selling out at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in May 2006 where they filmed the show for DVD. This recorded performance, from 6 May, marked the first time they have ever wrestled an audience member to the ground. It also saw quite a few fumbles by the pair, because they were unnerved by the irregular lighting required for the audience to be seen on the DVD (house lights on the audience are usually dimmed). The show featured material from previous shows, as well as some new material. The last show of their &quot;Goodbye&quot; tour was performed on 11 November 2006 at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne. The DVD release received an ARIA nomination for best comedy release.

The real reason for their goodbye, according to Colin Lane (stated both on stage and appearing on Andrew Denton&#x27;s &quot;Enough Rope&quot; interview show), is summed up like this: &quot;Imagine spending 20 years driving in a car with your best friend.&quot; They have both stated that they are dissolving Lano and Woodley so that they do not end up hating each other five years down the track. Both have also expressed interest in exploring other careers.

===2017: Comeback and &quot;Fly&quot; ===
On 13 November 2017, Lano and Woodley announced they were reuniting and going on tour nationally with a new show named &quot;Fly&quot;, which began in Canberra in March 2018.

<text>HD-MAC (High Definition Multiplexed Analogue Components) was a broadcast television standard proposed by the European Commission in 1986, as part of Eureka 95 project. It belongs to the MAC - Multiplexed Analogue Components standard family. It is an early attempt by the EEC to provide High-definition television (HDTV) in Europe. It is a complex mix of analogue signal (based on the Multiplexed Analogue Components standard), multiplexed with digital sound, and assistance data for decoding (DATV). The video signal (1250 lines/50 fields per second in 16:9 aspect ratio, with 1152 visible lines) was encoded with a modified D2-MAC encoder.

HD-MAC could be decoded by normal D2-MAC standard definition receivers, but no extra resolution was obtained and certain artifacts were visible. To decode the signal in full resolution a specific HD-MAC tuner was required .

== Naming convention ==

The European Broadcasting Union video format description is as follows: width x height [scan type: i or p] / number of full frames per second

European standard definition digital broadcasts use 720×576i/25, meaning 25 720 pixels wide and 576 pixels high interlaced frames: odd lines (1, 3, 5 ...) are grouped to build the odd field, which is transmitted first, then it is followed by the even field containing lines 2, 4, 6... Thus, there are two fields in a frame, resulting in a field frequency of 25 × 2 = 50 Hz.

The visible part of the video signal provided by an HD-MAC receiver was 1152i/25, which exactly doubles the vertical resolution of standard definition. The amount of information is multiplied by 4, considering the encoder started its operations from a 1440x1152i/25 sampling grid.

== Standard history ==

Work on HD-MAC specification started officially in May 1986. The purpose was to react against a Japanese proposal, supported by the US, which aimed to establish the NHK-designed Hi-Vision (also known as MUSE) system as a world standard. Besides preservation of the European electronic industry, there was also a need to produce a standard that would be compliant with the 50 Hz field frequency systems (used by a large majority of countries in the world). Truth be said, the precisely 60 Hz of the Japanese proposal was also worrying the US, as their NTSC M-based standard definition infrastructure used a practical frequency of 59.94 Hz, potentially leading to incompatibility problems.

In September, 1988, the Japanese performed the first High Definition broadcasts of the Olympic games, using their Hi-Vision system (NHK produced material using this format since 1982). In that same month of September, Europe showed for the first time a credible alternative, namely a complete HD-MAC broadcasting chain, at IBC 88 in Brighton. This show included the first progressive scan HD video camera prototypes (Thomson/LER).
Golden SCART was developed as a transmission interface for consumer devices, a special and backward-compatible implementation of the normal SCART connection. Some television sets from Philips and Telefunken are said to have been equipped with it.

For the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics and Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics, a public demonstration of HD-MAC broadcasting took place. 60 HD-MAC receivers for the Albertville games and 700 for the Barcelona games were set up in &quot;Eurosites&quot; to show the capabilities of the standard. 1250 lines (1152 visible) CRT projectors were used to create an image a few meters wide in public spaces in Barcelona for the Olympics. There were some Thomson &quot;Space system&quot; 16:9 CRT TV sets as well. The project sometimes used rear-projection televisions. In addition, some 80,000 viewers of D2-MAC receivers were also able to watch the channel (though not in HD). It is estimated that 350,000 people across Europe were able to see this demonstration of European HDTV. This project was financed by the EEC. The PAL-converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as SWR, BR and 3sat. The HD-MAC standard was also demonstrated at Seville Expo &#x27;92, exclusively using equipment designed to work with the standard such as Plumbicon and CCD cameras, direct view and rear projection CRT TVs, BCH 1000 Type B VTRs, single mode fiber optic cables, and Laserdisc players with their respective discs. Production equipment was visible to the public through windows.

Because UHF spare bandwidth was very scarce, HD-MAC was usable &quot;de facto&quot; only to cable and satellite providers, where their bandwidth was less constricted, similarly to Hi-Vision that was only broadcast by the NHK through a dedicated satellite channel called BShi. However, the standard never became popular among broadcasters. For all this, analogue HDTV could not replace conventional SDTV (terrestrial) PAL/SECAM, making HD-MAC sets unattractive to potential consumers.

It was required that all high-powered satellite broadcasters use MAC from 1986. However, the launch of middle-powered satellites by SES and the use of PAL allowed broadcasters to bypass HD-MAC, reducing their transmission costs. HD-MAC was left for transcontinental satellite links, however.

The HD-MAC standard was abandoned in 1993, and since then all EU and EBU efforts have focused on the DVB system (Digital Video Broadcasting), which allows both SDTV and HDTV.

This article about IFA 1993 provides a view of the project&#x27;s status close to its end. It mentions &quot;a special BBC compilation encoded in HD-MAC and replayed from a D1 Video Tape Recorder&quot;.

HD-MAC development was stopped alongside the EUREKA project in 1996, because picture quality was not deemed to be good enough, receiving TVs didn&#x27;t have enough resolution, the 16:9 aspect ratio that would later become standard was seen as exotic, and receiving TVs weren&#x27;t large enough to exhibit the image quality of the standard, and those that were, were CRT TVs which made them extremely heavy.

== Technical details ==

=== Transmission ===

PAL/SECAM analogue SDTV broadcasts use 6-, 7- (VHF), or 8 MHz (UHF). The 819-line (System E) used 14 MHz wide VHF channels. For HD-MAC, the transmission medium must guarantee a baseband bandwidth of at least 11.14 MHz. This translates to a 12 MHz channel spacing in cable networks. The specification allows for 8 MHz channels, but in this case assistance data can no longer be correctly decoded, and it is only possible to extract a standard definition signal, using a D2-MAC receiver. 
For satellite broadcasting, due to FM modulation spectrum expansion, an entire satellite transponder would be used, resulting in 27 to 36 MHz of bandwidth. The situation is pretty much the same in analogue standard definition : a given transponder can only support one analogue channel. So from this point of view, going to HD does not represent an inconvenience.

=== Bandwidth reduction ===

BRE (Bandwidth Reduction Encoding) operation started with analogue HD video (even when the source was a digital recorder, it was reconverted to analogue to feed the encoder). It was specified to have a 50 Hz field frequency. It could be interlaced, with 25 frames a second (called 1250/50/2 in the recommendation), or it could be progressively scanned with 50 full frames a second (called 1250/50/1). The interlaced version was the one used in practice. In any case, the number of visible lines was 1152, twice the standard 576 lines vertical definition. The full number of lines in a frame period, included those that cannot be displayed, was 1250. This made for a 32 μs line period. According to ITU recommendation for HDTV standards parameters the active part of the line was 26.67 μs long (see also the LDK 9000 camera document ).

Had the modern trend for square pixels applied, this would have yielded a 2048x1152 sampling grid. There was no such requirement in the standard, though, since CRT monitors don&#x27;t need any extra scaling to be able to show non-square pixels. According to the specification, the sampling rate for the interlaced input to use was 72 MHz, resulting in 72 x 26.67 = 1920 horizontal samples. It was then reconverted to 1440 from within the sampled domain. The input signal often originated from sources previously sampled at only 54 MHz, for economical reasons, and therefore already containing no more than the analogue equivalent of 1440 samples per line.
Ultimately, the starting point for BRE was a 1440x1152 sampling grid (twice the horizontal and vertical resolutions of digital SD), interlaced, at 25 fps.

To improve horizontal resolution of the D2-MAC norm, only its bandwidth had to be increased. This was easily done as, unlike PAL, the sound is not sent on a sub-carrier, but multiplexed with the picture. 
However, to increase vertical bandwidth was more complex, as the line frequency had to stay at 15.625 kHz to be compatible with D2-MAC. This offered three choices:

* 50 frames per second with only 288 lines for fast moving scenes (20 ms mode)
* 25 frames per second with 576 lines for normally moving scenes (40 ms mode)
* 12.5 frames per second with all 1152 lines for slow motion (80 ms mode)

As none of the three modes would have been sufficient, the choice during encoding was not made for the whole picture, but for little blocks of 16×16 pixels. The signal then contained hints (the DATV digital stream) that controlled which de-interlacing method the decoder should use.

The 20 ms mode offered an improved temporal resolution, but the 80 ms was the only one that provided High spatial definition in the usual sense. The 40 ms mode threw away one the HD fields and reconstructed it in the receiver with the 
assistance of motion compensation data. Some indications were also provided in case of a whole frame movement (camera panning..) to improve the quality of the reconstruction.

The encoder could work in &quot;Camera&quot; operating mode, using the three coding modes, but also in &quot;film&quot; mode where the 20 ms coding mode was not used.

The 80 ms mode took advantage of its reduced 12.5 fps frame rate to spread the contents of an HD frame over two SD frames, meaning four 20 ms fields = 80 ms, hence the name.

But that was not enough, as a single HD frame contains the equivalent of 4 SD frames. This could have been &quot;solved&quot; by doubling the bandwidth of the D2-MAC signal, thus increasing the allowed horizontal resolution by the same factor. Instead, the standard D2-MAC channel bandwidth was preserved, and one pixel out of two was dropped from each line. This sub-sampling was done in a quincux pattern. Assuming pixels on a line independently numbered from 1 to 1440, only pixels 1, 3, 5... were retained from the first line, pixels 2, 4, 6... from the second, 1, 3, 5...again from the third, and so on. That way, information from all the columns of the HD frame were conveyed to the receiver. Each missing pixel was surrounded by 4 transmitted ones (except on the sides) and could be interpolated from them. The resulting 720 horizontal resolution was further truncated to the 697 samples per line limit of the D2-HDMAC video multiplex.
As a consequence of those operations, a 4:1 reduction factor was achieved, allowing the high definition video signal to be transported in a standard D2-MAC channel. The samples retained by the BRE were assembled into a valid standard definition D2-MAC vision signal and finally converted to analogue for transmission. The modulation parameters were such that the independence of the samples was preserved.

To fully decode the picture, the receiver had to sample the signal again and then read from the memory several times. The BRD (Bandwidth Restoration Decoder) in the receiver would then reconstruct a 1394x1152 sampling grid from it, under the control of the DATV stream, to be fed into its DAC.

The final output was a 1250 (1152 visible) lines, 25 fps, interlaced, analogue HD video signal, with a 50 Hz field frequency.

=== Progressive scanning ===

European systems are generally referred to as 50 Hz standards (field frequency). The two fields are 20 ms apart in time. The Eu95 project stated it would evolve towards 1152p/50, and it is taken into account as a possible source in the D2-HDMAC specification. In that format, a full frame is captured every 20 ms, thus preserving the quality of motion of television and topping it with solid artifact-free frames representing only one instant in time, as is done for cinema. The 24 fps frame frequency of cinema is a bit low, though, and a generous amount of motion smear is required to allow the eye to perceive a smooth motion. 50 Hz is more than twice that rate, and the motion smear can be reduced in proportion, allowing for sharper pictures.
In practice, 50P was not used very much. Some tests were even done by having film shot at 50 fps and subsequently telecined.

Thomson / LER presented a progressive camera. However, it used a form of quincunx sampling and had therefore some bandwidth constraints.

This requirement meant pushing the technology boundaries of the time, and would have added to the notorious lack of sensitivity of some Eu 95 cameras (particularly CRT ones). 
This thirst for light was one of the problems that plagued the operators shooting the French film &quot;L&#x27;affaire Seznec (The Seznec case)&quot; in 1250i.
Some CCD cameras were developed in the context of the project, see for example LDK9000 : 50 DB signal to noise ratio at 30 MHz, at F/4.

The Eu95 system would have provided better compatibility with cinema technology than its competitor, first because of progressive scanning, and second because of the convenience and quality of transfer between 50 Hz standards and film (no motion artifacts, one just needs to invert the usual &quot;PAL speed-up&quot; process by slowing down the frame rate in a 25/24 ratio). Taking one frame out of two from a 50P stream would have provided a suitable 25P video as a starting point for this operation. If the sequence is shot at 50 P with a fully opened shutter, it will produce the same amount of motion smear as a 25P shot with a half opened shutter, a common setting when shooting with a standard movie camera.

In practice, Hi-Vision seems to have been more successful in that regard, having been used for films such as Giulia e Giulia(1987) and Prospero&#x27;s books(1991).

=== Recording ===
==== Consumer ====
A consumer tape recorder prototype was presented in 1988. It had an 80-minute recording time and used a 1.25 cm &quot;metal&quot; tape. Bandwidth was 10.125 MHz and signal to noise ratio 42 dB.

An HD-MAC videodisc prototype had been designed as well. The version that was presented in 1988 could record 20 min per side of a 30 cm disc. Bandwidth was 12 MHz and S/N 32 dB. This media was used for several hours at Expo 92.

==== Professional equipment ====
On the studio and production side, it was entirely different. HD-MAC bandwidth reduction techniques bring the HD pixel rate down to the level of SD. So in theory, it would have been possible to use an SD digital video recorder, assuming it provides enough room for the DATV assistance stream, which requires less than 1.1 Mbit/s. SD video using 4:2:0 format (12 bits per pixel) needs 720x576x25x12 bits per second, which is slightly less than 125 Mbit/s, to be compared with the 270 Mbit/s available from a D-1 machine.

But there is no real reason for the studio equipment to be constrained by HD-MAC, as the latter is only a transmission standard, used to convey the HD material from the transmitter to the viewers. Furthermore, technical and financial resources are available to store the HD video with better quality, for editing and archiving.

So in practice, other methods were used. At the start of the Eureka95 project the only means of recording the HD signal from a camera was on a massive 1-inch reel-to-reel tape machine, the BTS BCH 1000, which was based on the Type B videotape format but with 8 video heads instead of the two normally used, together with a higher linear tape speed of 66 cm/s, thus accommodating the higher bandwidth requirements of HD Video.

The plan within the Eureka95 project was to develop an uncompressed 72 MHz sampling digital recorder, dubbed the &quot;Gigabit&quot; recorder. It was expected to take a year to develop, so in the interim, two alternative digital recording systems were assembled, both using the standard definition &quot;D1&quot; uncompressed digital component recorder as starting points.

The Quincunx-subsampled, or double/dual D1 system developed by Thomson used two D-1 digital recorders which were synchronized in a master/slave relationship. Odd fields could then be recorded on one of the D-1 and even fields on the other. Horizontally the system recorded just half the horizontal bandwidth, with samples taken in a quincunx sampling grid. This gave the system a full bandwidth performance in the diagonal direction, but halved horizontally or vertically depending on the exact image temporal-spatial characteristics.

The Quadriga system was developed by the BBC in 1988 using 4 synchronised D1 recorders, 54 MHz sampling, and distributed the signal in such a way that blocks of 4 pixels were sent to each recorder in turn. Thus if a single tape was viewed, the image would appear as a fair but distorted representation of the whole image, enabling edit decisions to be taken on a single recording, and a three-machine edit was possible on a single quadriga by processing each of the four channels in turn, with identical edits made on the other three channels subsequently under the control of a programmed edit controller.

The original D1 recorders were restricted to a parallel video interface with very bulky short cables, but this was not a problem, since the digital signals were contained with the 5 half-height racks (4 D1s and the interface/control/interleaving rack) which made up the Quadriga, and initially all external signals were analogue components. The introduction of SDI (the 270 Mbit/s Serial Digital Interface) simplified cabling by the time the BBC constructed a second Quadriga.

Philips also constructed a Quadriga but used a slightly different format, with the HD image divided into four quadrants, each quadrant going to one of the four recorders. Excepting a slightly longer processing delay, it otherwise worked similarly to the BBC approach, and both versions of the Quadriga equipment were made to be interoperable, switchable between interleaved and quadrant modes.

In about 1993 Philips, in a joint venture with Bosch (BTS), produced a &quot;BRR&quot; (or Bit Rate Reduction) recording system to enable the full HD signal to be recorded onto a single D1 (or D5 HD) recorder. A low-resolution version of the image could be viewed in the centre of the screen if the tape was replayed on a conventional D1 recorder, and was surrounded by what appeared to be noise, but was in fact simply coded/compressed data, in a similar way to later MPEG digital compression techniques, with a compression rate of 5:1, starting with 72 MHz sampling. Some BRR equipment also contained Quadriga interfaces, for ease of conversion between recording formats, also being switchable between BBC and Philips versions of the Quadriga format. By this time, Quadriga signals were being carried on four SDI cables.

Finally, with help from Toshiba, in around 2000, the Gigabit recorder, by now known as the D6 HDTV VTR &quot;Voodoo&quot;, was produced, some years after work on the 1250-line system had ceased in favour of the Common Image Format, the HDTV system as it is known today.

Hence the quality of Eureka 95 archives is higher than what viewers could see at the output of an HD-MAC decoder.

==== Transfer to film ====
For the making of the HD-based movie &quot;L&#x27;affaire Seznec&quot;, the Thomson company certified it would be able to transfer HD to 35 mm film. But none of the attempts were successful (shooting was done on dual-D1).
However, another French movie shot in 1994, &quot;Du fond du coeur: Germaine et Benjamin&quot;, allegedly achieved such a transfer. It is said to have been shot in digital high definition in 1250 lines.
If so, it would arguably be the first digital high definition movie, using a film-friendly 50 Hz field rate, 7 years before &quot;Vidocq&quot; and 8 years before &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;.. For a historical perspective on HD-originated movies, one can mention early attempts such as &#x27;Harlow&#x27;, shot in 1965 using a near-HD analogue 819 lines process that later evolved to higher resolutions (see Electronovision).

== Project&#x27;s afterlife ==

Experience was gained on important building blocks like HD digital recording, digital processing including motion compensation, HD CCD cameras, and also in factors driving acceptance or rejection of a new format by the professionals, and all of that was put to good use in the subsequent Digital Video Broadcasting project which, in contrast to HD-MAC, is a great worldwide success. Despite early claims by competitors that it could not do HD, it was soon deployed in Australia for just that purpose.

The cameras and tape recorders were reused for early experiments in digital high definition cinema.

The US brought home some of the Eu95 cameras to be studied in the context of their own HDTV standard development effort.

In France, a company called VTHR (Video Transmission Haute Resolution) used the Eu95 hardware for some time to retransmit cultural events to small villages (later, they switched to upscaled 15 Mbit/s MPEG2 SD).

In 1993, Texas Instruments built a 2048x1152 DMD prototype. No rationale is exposed in the papers for choosing this specific resolution over the Japanese 1035 active lines system, or alternatively doubling the 480 lines of the standard US TV to 960, but that way it could cover all resolutions expected to be present on the market, and that included the European one, which happened to be the highest. Some legacy of this development may be seen in &quot;2K&quot; and &quot;4K&quot; digital movie projectors using TI DLP chips, which run a slightly wider than usual 2048x1080 or 4096x2160 resolution, giving 1.896:1 aspect ratio without anamorphic stretching (vs the 1.778:1 of regular 16:9, with 1920 or 3840 horizontal pixels), give a little (6.7%) more horizontal resolution with anamorphic lenses when showing 2.21:1 (or wider) movies specifically prepared for them, and further enhancement (~13.78%) through reduced letterboxing if used &quot;without&quot; such lenses.

As of 2010, some computer monitors with 2048x1152 resolution were available (e.g. Samsung 2343BWX 23, Dell SP2309W). This unlikely to be in reference to Eu95, especially as the refresh rate will generally default to &quot;60 Hz&quot; (or 59.94 Hz), but simply a convenient &quot;HD+&quot; resolution made for bragging rights over ubiquitous 1920x1080 HD panels, with the slimmest possible actual resolution improvement whilst keeping the same 16:9 resolution for video playback without cropping or letterboxing (the next nearest &quot;convenient&quot; 16:9 resolution being the comparatively much larger, so much more expensive 2560x1600 &quot;2.5K&quot; as used in e.g. Apple Cinema and Retina displays); it is also a &quot;neat&quot; power-of-2 width, twice the width of one-time standard XGA (so, e.g. websites designed for that width can be smoothly zoomed to 200%), and happens to be 4x the size of the 1024x576 panels commonly used for cheaper netbooks and mobile tablets (much as the 2.5K standard is 4x the 1280x800 WXGA used in ultraportable laptops and midrange tablets). In this way, it can be considered a form of convergent specification evolution - although there&#x27;s little chance the two standards are directly related, their particulars will have been landed on by broadly similar methods.

Although the fact is now mainly of historical interest, most larger-tube CRT PC monitors had a maximum horizontal scan rate of 70 kHz or higher, which means they could have handled 2048x1152 at 60 Hz progressive if set to use a custom resolution (with slimmer vertical blanking margins than HD-MAC/Eu95 itself for those rated for less than 75 kHz). Monitors able to support the lower refresh rate, including smaller models incapable of 70 kHz but good for at least 58 kHz (preferably 62.5 kHz) and able to support the lower vertical refresh rate could instead be set to run 50 Hz progressive, or even 100 Hz interlace to avert the flicker that would otherwise cause.

<text>Tuam (; , meaning &#x27;mound&#x27; or &#x27;burial-place&#x27;) is a town in Ireland and the second-largest settlement in County Galway. It is west of the midlands of Ireland, about north of Galway city. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

Humans have lived in the area since the Bronze Age while the historic period dates from the sixth century. The town became increasingly important in the 11th and 12th centuries in political and religious aspects of Ireland. The market-based layout of the town and square indicates the importance of commerce.

The red Latin cross of the coat of arms is representative of Tuam&#x27;s importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The double green flaunches at the sides, represent the two hills or shoulders of Tuam&#x27;s ancient name, . The two crowns recall the High Kings, Tairrdelbach and Ruaidrí, who were based in Tuam. The broken chariot wheel is a reference to the foundation of the monastic town when St Jarlath&#x27;s chariot wheel broke. The motto of the town, &quot;Tuath Thuama go Buan&quot;, translates as &quot;Long Live the People of Tuam&quot;.

==History==
The record of human settlement in Tuam dates back to the Bronze Age when an area adjacent to Shop Street was used as a burial ground. The name Tuam is a cognate with the Latin term &quot;tumulus&quot; (burial mound). The town&#x27;s ancient name was , i.e. the burial mound of two shoulders. The name probably refers to the high ground on either side of the River Nanny, overlooking a probable fording point over the River Nanny (or Corchra). In 1875, a Bronze Age burial urn was discovered in the area by workmen, dating from c.1500 B.C.

Records date from the early sixth century and mention that a monk called Jarlath was a member of a religious community at Cloonfush some west of Tuam and adjacent to the religious settlement at Kilbannon. According to the Life of Brendan of Clonfert, Brendan eventually told Jarlath &quot;Not here at all shall be thy resurrection&quot;. When Jarlath asked where this may be, Brendan responded: &quot;Have a new chariot made for thou art old; and go thy way in it, and wherever the two hind shafts of the chariot will break, there will be thy resurrection, and that of many others with thee&quot;. Jarlath&#x27;s wheel broke at Tuam and he established a monastery there, known as the School of Tuam. In Ireland, early settlements typically arose through the establishment of a religious site, around which a town subsequently grew. In this way, Tuam grew up around the monastery and has kept the broken chariot wheel as its heraldic symbol.

In 1049, Aedh O&#x27;Connor defeated Amalgaid ua Flaithbertaigh, King of Iar Connacht, making the O&#x27;Connors provincial kings of Connacht. He then built a castle at Tuam and made it his principal stronghold. This event was directly responsible for the subsequent rise in the importance of the town. Its position dominated the Iar Connacht heartland of Maigh Seóla.

In the twelfth century, the town became the centre of Provincial power during the fifty-year reign of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (r. 1106–1156). He also brought Tuam its most prominent status as seat of the High King of Ireland which he achieved by force of arms during his long career.

About 1140 Tairrdelach founded an Augustinian priory in Tuam with possession over three church sites in Ciarraige Airne, east County Mayo. At the Synod of Kells in 1152, the centre of government also became the ecclesiastical centre, as Tuam was elevated to an Archbishopric, with Áed Ua hOissín as the first Archbishop.

Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as High King of Ireland from 1128–1156, was a great patron of the Irish Church and it was due to his patronage that Tuam became the home of some masterpieces of 12th century Celtic art, including the Cross of Cong. Tairrdelbach was succeeded by his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the last native High King of Ireland. In 1164, Ruaidrí had a &quot;wonderful castle&quot; erected, with a large courtyard defended by lofty and massive walls and a deep moat into which the adjacent river was diverted through. This was the first Irish built stone castle. A small part of the castle still stands. Following the destruction of the first Cathedral in 1184, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair left Tuam and retired to Cong Abbey, where he entrusted the Church valuables from the Cathedral at Tuam into the care of the abbot. This left Tuam as a small settlement and it wasn&#x27;t until the early 17th century that it began to grow in importance again.

Throughout history, Tuam has been an important commercial centre with fairs and markets being an important part of commerce in the region. One of its fairs dates to 1252 when Letters Patent were granted to Archbishop MacFlynn by Henry III of England. Other fairs were authorised by Charters granted by James VI and I and George III of the United Kingdom.

The Annals of the Four Masters record that in 1488 &quot;A whirlwind attacked a number of persons, as they were cutting turf on the bog of Tuaim-Mona, which killed one of them, and swelled the faces of the rest; and four others were killed by the same wind in Machaire-Chonnacht.&quot;

The High Cross of Tuam was brought to Dublin for the Great Exhibition of 1852. However, prior to its return to Tuam, a disagreement arose between the two Churches. Catholic Archbishop Dr John MacHale claimed the Cross rightfully belonged to Catholics, with Dean Charles Seymour of the Church of Ireland asserting a Protestant claim. Agreement was reached with the Cross erected halfway between both Cathedrals and positioned so that it was visible from all main streets of the town. It was in the Square in the town centre in 1874.

In July 1920, Tuam Town Hall and other properties were attacked and badly damaged by armed Royal Irish Constabulary men, after two had been killed in an ambush by the Irish Republican Army near the town the day before.

The Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home (St Mary&#x27;s Mother and Baby Home), or simply The Home, was a maternity home for unmarried mothers and their children that operated between 1925 and 1961 in the town. It was run by the Bon Secours religious order of nuns. From its construction in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century, before it was operated by the Bon Secours sisters, the building served as a workhouse for the poor.

Excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 that had been ordered by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation, under Judge Yvonne Murphy, found a &quot;significant&quot; quantity of human remains, aged from 35 foetal weeks to two to three years, interred in a disused former cesspit with twenty chambers. Most of the burials were from the 1950s.

The report said: &quot;The Commission has not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appears to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water. The Commission has also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.&quot; Carbon dating confirmed that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the Mother and Baby Home by the Bon Secours order. The Commission stated that it was shocked by the discovery and that it is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.

A monumental &quot;Chair of Tuam&quot; was unveiled in May 1980 by the late Cardinal Tomás O&#x27;Fiaich. The 1980s saw the High Cross re-erected in the south transept of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Administration==
On 30 March 1613, Tuam received a royal charter from James I, which enabled the Tuam constituency to send two representatives to Irish House of Commons until its abolition in 1801. The town was laid out as a market town to its present plan with all the streets converging on the central square. The charter also established a formal local council with an elected sovereign and 12 burgesses. The sovereign was sworn into office at the site of the &quot;Chair of Tuam&quot; which is believed to be within the remaining tower of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair&#x27;s castle. The borough was abolished under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.

The town was later granted town commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854. This body became a town council in 2002, under the Local Government Act 2001. Along with other similar town councils in Ireland, the body was abolished in 2014 under the Local Government Reform Act 2014. The local electoral area of Tuam elects 7 councillors to Galway County Council and forms the Municipal District of Tuam.

==Climate==
==Transport==
Tuam is served by the N17 road (to Collooney) and the N83 road (Galway to Sinolane Cross) as well as the R332 and R347. A bypass of the N17, avoiding congestion to the west of the town, involved acquisition of land by Galway County Council in late 2006. The design of this road includes a bridge over the existing closed railway lines, allowing for future re-opening of the line. The M17 was opened ahead of schedule on 27 September 2017.

Tuam railway station is located on the disused railway line from Athenry to Sligo. There was a part-successful campaign by West-on-track to have the line reopened as a Western Railway Corridor which was recognised in the Transport21 project. Construction work to reopen the line between Ennis and Athenry was completed in 2009. Passengers trains run between Limerick and (where connections to Galway can be made) with further extensions planned. Tuam railway station opened on 27 September 1860, closed to passenger traffic on 5 April 1976 and finally closed altogether on 18 December 1978. The railway lines were heavily used by trains transporting sugar beets to the Irish Sugar Factory (Comhlucht Siúcra Éireann Teo.) formerly located off the Ballygaddy Road. The railway line was used during the filming of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, and can be seen when John Wayne disembarks at Ballyglunin, around 6 km (4 mi) from Tuam.

Tuam is served by multiple Bus Éireann routes.

==Education==
Tuam is the location of several second-level educational institutions, St Jarlath&#x27;s College, Archbishop McHale College, Presentation College Currylea, and St Bridget&#x27;s Secondary School. In September 2023 both Presentation College and St. Bridget&#x27;s amalgamated into High Cross College. St Patrick&#x27;s College (formerly Tuam Christian Brothers School), was amalgamated with St Jarlath&#x27;s College in June 2009. There are five main primary schools: the Mercy Convent and the Presentation Convent, St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School, the Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil Iarfhlatha, an Irish language primary school (bunscoil lán Ghaeilge).

==Economy==
Tuam is home to several large employers, the largest of which is Valeo Vision Systems, which currently employs over 1000 people.

==Religion==
Tuam has two cathedrals, Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Tuam, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam, and the Church of Ireland&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. The town&#x27;s patron saint is Saint Jarlath. The ancient monastic site of Kilbannon, founded by Benignus of Armagh in the fifth century, lies to the northwest of Tuam.

==Sport==
===Gaelic games===
Tuam Stars, founded in 1888, is the local Gaelic football team, and are one of Galway&#x27;s most successful clubs. From 1953 to 1960, Tuam Stars were a dominant force in the Galway County Championship winning seven titles in a row, with players such as Seán Purcell and Frank Stockwell playing at the time. St Jarlath&#x27;s College, Tuam has won the Hogan Cup (national championship for secondary schools) a record 12 times since the competition began in 1946. The parish has a second Gaelic football club, Cortoon Shamrocks, founded in 1888.

Tuam Stadium St Jarlath&#x27;s Park was officially opened on 21 May 1950 by the Archbishop of Tuam, Rev. Dr. Walsh. It became &quot;the home of Galway football&quot; and has hosted many important matches including Connacht Senior Football Finals. A €5 million redevelopment project has been granted planning permission including a new 6,400 capacity stand and ancillary facilities. Tuam Stadium Development Committee is currently fundraising for this project.

=== Soccer ===
There are also two soccer clubs in Tuam. Tuam Celtic A.F.C., founded in 1974, play their home matches at Celtic Park, Cloonthue. Dynamo Blues, founded in 1978, whose temporary home was the College Field Athenry Road, are now back in their original home, Dynamo Blues pitch behind Parkmore Estate.

===Rugby===
Tuam Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based on the outskirts of Tuam in Garraun Park. The club fields two adult junior-standard teams in J1A and J1C, senior women&#x27;s teams, and different youth age groups, both boys and girls. While football was primarily the first choice sport for many, the rugby club has grown annually since its foundation in 1969.

===Golf===
Tuam Golf Club was established on 17 October 1904 with the original clubhouse at Cloonascragh on the Athenry Road. The club relocated to Mayfield, on the Dunmore Road in 1937 due to a deterioration of the Cloonascragh course. In March 1940 a new club called the Commercial Golf Club was established, which renovated the course and remained for many years at Cloonascragh. World-renowned Irish golfer Christy O&#x27;Connor Snr joined Tuam Golf Club as club professional in 1948.

To develop an 18-hole course, Tuam Golf Club relocated to Barnacurragh (close to the original Cloonascragh course) and a new clubhouse. The first nine holes were opened in 1975. 18 holes came into play by 1979, on the course designed by golf architect, Eddie Hackett. Improvement works have continued over the years with Christy O&#x27;Connor Jnr advising the club on course improvement works. The most recent design work has been under the guidance of golf architect Ken Kearney.

===Athletics===
Tuam Athletics Club is a thriving and somewhat successful club which, in addition to its many juvenile training sessions, holds training sessions and meets for adults.

In June 2020, Tuam hosted the Rob Heffernan Academy Grand Final. This event, involving 40 youngsters who race walked in 1 km competitions, was the culmination of a virtual challenge in which young athletes were invited to race walk 100 metres in under 30 seconds and submit videos to 2013 world 50 km race walking champion and 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Heffernan. Of the 197 entrants, Heffernan initially selected the best ten to be part of the academy, which was subsequently expanded to over 50 athletes who received online coaching from the man himself and former international team-mate / Tuam resident, Pierce O&#x27;Callaghan

===Gymnastics===
Tuam All Star Gymnastics Club runs classes from its Athenry Road base. In 2010 the club reached the semi-finals of the All Ireland Talent Show.

===Swimming===
Tuam Swimming Club has been promoting swimming in the Tuam area since its foundation in 1950. The club season runs from September to the end of June each year.

==Culture==
===Arts===
The Marian Choral Society was formed in 1974, with an initial aim to sing church and secular music. Then, in 1977, the first musical production was staged, with an annual show each October since.

Earwig! Tuam Community Arts Group was formed in October 2003 to provide Tuam and its surroundings with an outlet for its creative talent. Since 2003, the group has organised an arts festival which includes visual arts, theatre, drama, spectacle, children&#x27;s arts workshops, street performance and music. Earwig! also takes part in the annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Tuam with an emphasis on bringing movement and spectacle.

===Music===
While The Saw Doctors are perhaps the town&#x27;s most famous band, in the 1960s, Tuam was known as &#x27;The Showband Capital of Ireland&#x27;. At the time, a number of showbands called the market town home, including the Johnny Flynn Showband. In 2009, a compilation CD of over 50 original songs, all by musicians from Tuam, entitled &quot;Songs from the Broken Wheel&quot;, was released. Tuam is referenced in song &quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin&quot;, popularised by The Dubliners and various other Irish folk artists. The song details a man&#x27;s experiences as he travels to Liverpool, England from his home in Tuam.

===Old Tuam Society===
The Old Tuam Society was founded in 1942 with a view to preserving a record of the town&#x27;s past and to foster and promote that knowledge for the benefit of future generations. The new society was open to &quot;all those who are interested in its aims, namely the preservation and study of the antiquities of Tuam and district.&quot; An invitation was issued to Tuam people scattered far and wide to join the circle for an annual subscription of two shillings and six pence. The Society publishes an annual called &quot;JOTS&quot; (&quot;Journal of the Old Tuam Society&quot;).

===Market day===
The Tuam market was revived in 2006 by the Energise Tuam, a group which organised by local traders in conjunction with Tuam Chamber of Commerce in an effort to promote shopping in the town. It currently takes place on the last Saturday of every month, at the plaza in front of Tuam Shopping Centre. In the future, Galway County Council has earmarked the Shambles car park nearer the town centre as the market&#x27;s location on a permanent basis.

===Media===
&quot;The Tuam Herald&quot; is a weekly local newspaper, founded in 1837 by Richard Kelly, which serves the town of Tuam and the surrounding areas of north County Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon. It is County Galway&#x27;s oldest newspaper and the fifth oldest newspaper in the Republic of Ireland.

===Public library===
Tuam Library is on High Street, between Temple Jarlath and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. A collection of general interest and local history books are available for reference along with copies of the &quot;Tuam Herald&quot; and the 1901–1911 census on microfilm. Free internet access and Wi-Fi are also available to library users.

==International relations==
===Twin towns===
Tuam is twinned with Straubing in Germany.

==Places of interest==
* Temple Jarlath at High Street, marks the site of the earliest monastic settlement in Tuam, established by St Jarlath circa 526–527 AD. Temple Jarlath is near the town centre. It marks the site of an early monastic settlement dedicated to St Jarlath, Tuam&#x27;s sixth century patron. The surviving ruins include a late 13th-century parish church containing an east window in Transitional style.
* The Mill Museum – This undershot water wheel mill found off Shop Street, which traces its origin to the 17th century, was in operation until 1964. It is the only preserved corn mill in the West of Ireland. The Mill Museum complex, located beside the river Nanny, consists of the restored corn mill with operating water wheel, an audiovisual museum and Tourist Information Office.
* Cathedral of the Assumption – Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam in County Galway.

* St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral – The Church of Ireland Cathedral was built 1861–1878, incorporating a 12th-century arch and sanctuary, and a 14th-century chancel.
* Castlehacket – a 13th-century tower house near Tuam, was home of the Hacket family at first; later of the Kirwans after the Cromwellian settlement. Many scenes from the 1969 movie &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; were filmed in the environs of Castlehacket and Knockma.
*Feartagar Castle, a Burke castle located 8 km (5 miles) northwest of Tuam.

===High crosses of Tuam===

The High Cross of Tuam was erected in 1152 possibly to commemorate the appointment of the first Archbishop of Tuam, Archbishop Áed Ua hOissín. An inscription at the base calls for &quot;A prayer for O&#x27;hOisín; for the Abbot; by whom it was made&quot;. It is reputed to have been the tallest of the High Crosses of Ireland, but its artistry is scarred by the absence of the top portion of the main shaft. The sandstone Cross was originally erected in proximity to the earliest Cathedral erected in the town, a part of which still remains and is incorporated into St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (12th-century red sandstone chancel arch in Irish Romanesque architecture, which is a National monument). The original High Cross or Market cross may have been erected close to what is now the Market Square and High Street.

When the first Cathedral collapsed after being destroyed by fire in 1184, the High Cross was dismantled into pieces, each under different ownership. The archaeologist George Petrie discovered the base of the High Cross around 1820 and later discovered two other pieces in other locations. The High Cross contains a portion from another High Cross, the ringed cross-section on top. In addition to the Market Cross, it is likely that there were at least four other carved stone crosses from the Connor&#x27;s reign in the town. An area close to the town Square, known as the Shambles, which continued to function as a market place until recently, was at one point the location of the Market Cross until 1721.

The Cross was brought to Dublin for the Great Exhibition of 1852. However, prior to its return to Tuam, a disagreement arose between the two Churches. Catholic Archbishop Dr John MacHale claimed the Cross rightfully belonged to Catholics, with Dean Charles Seymour of the Church of Ireland asserting a Protestant claim. Agreement was reached with the Cross erected halfway between both Cathedrals and positioned so that it was visible from all main streets of the town. It was in the Square in the town centre in 1874.

By the late 1980s, it was evident that the decorative stone carving of the Cross was deteriorating due to weathering and pollution. Experts thought that there was a danger from traffic passing nearby. After lengthy discussions, the Office of Public Works removed the monument from the Square in April 1992. Following cleaning and minor restoration, the High Cross was re-erected in the south transept of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, where it now is, near its original location. St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral also houses the shaft of a third Cross fashioned from limestone. It is thought that all of the High Crosses would have marked the boundaries of the monastic section of Tuam.

<text>Hartfield is a village and civil parish in the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. The parish also includes the settlements of Colemans Hatch, Hammerwood and Holtye, all lying on the northern edge of Ashdown Forest.

==Geography==
The main village of Hartfield lies seven miles (11.2 km) south-west of Royal Tunbridge Wells where the B2110 road between Groombridge and Forest Row meets the B2026 road between Edenbridge and Maresfield.

==Governance==
Hartfield Parish Council consists of 13 members. The population of this ward as taken at the 2011 census was 2,639.

==The parish settlements==

Hartfield is the main village in the parish. It lies on the upper reaches of the River Medway and on the edge of Ashdown Forest. A Roman road from London to Lewes runs across the parish, to the west of the village. According to Domesday Book, Hardfield, in the &#x27;Rape&#x27; of Pevensey, had 6 manor houses and a water mill. From the 13th Century up until the time of Queen Elizabeth I, much of the land was in the ownership of the Dukes of Dorset (the Sackville family). The modern village street remains narrow, precluding much parking. 

The church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. 

There were three public houses: the Anchor Inn, the Gallipot Inn and the Haywagon Inn. The Haywagon Inn (originally known as The Dorset Arms) dates to the 16th Century and was closed in 2015 following a planning application to convert to housing. 

Popes Cottage is reputedly the oldest building in the village, originally built as a hall house in 1236.

The elder brother of the writer W. Somerset Maugham, Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham PC QC, a lawyer and judge who served as Lord Chancellor from March 1938 until September 1939, and his son, the author Robin Maugham, are buried in the churchyard.
Cotchford Farm, Hartfield was the home of A.A. Milne (1882–1956), author of the Winnie the Pooh books, from where many of his books are set; later it was owned by Brian Jones, guitarist and founder of The Rolling Stones who was discovered dead in the pool in 1969. There is a shop in the village dedicated to all things connected with the Winnie the Pooh stories.

Henry VIII was believed to have used Bolebroke Castle, located a short distance from the village, where he hunted wild boar and deer at the nearby Ashdown Forest. He also was believed to have courted Anne Boleyn from this castle.

Hartfield had a railway station on the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line until it was closed in 1967. Most of the former trackbed is now part of the Forest Way, forms part of National Cycle Route 21, and is much used by walkers and cyclists. The station building itself is now used as a pre-school. There is a bus service that connects the village with Crawley, East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells.

There are a number of businesses in the village.

===Colemans Hatch===
The hamlet of Colemans Hatch lies to the south-west of Hartfield. It is a scattered settlement around a series of road junctions. The church here is dedicated to the Holy Trinity and is part of the joint benefice with St Mary&#x27;s Hartfield. The Hatch Inn is located here.

The imposing South Hartfield House was the residence of General Sir Reginald Hildyard, who died there in 1965.

===Hammerwood===

The name Hammerwood comes from the Wealden iron industry and relates to the numerous hammer-ponds found in the area. Streams in the locality can still run red with the colour of iron in the water. A hammer-pond is a water reservoir created specifically for providing power to water-powered hammers, forges or blast furnaces. There were many Medway watermills in the area.

Aside from a number of houses, the most notable buildings are St Stephen&#x27;s Church and Hammerwood Park at the end of the lane, which was the centre of what was a large country estate extending in its heyday to over .

The church was completed in 1880 funded by local landowner Oswald Augustus Smith and built to a design of E.P. Loftus Brock. Smith also funded the rebuilding of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Holtye within the same parish. The church can be found on the main road. Inside the church is a pipe organ built by T.C. Lewis of Brixton in 1884.

There is a Scout campsite at Hammerwood owned and operated by the Lewisham North District Scouts.

====Hammerwood Park====
Hammerwood Park is a country house south of the village: it is a Grade I listed building. Built in 1792, it was the first work of the architect Benjamin Latrobe, who was also responsible for the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.

It was purchased by the rock band Led Zeppelin in 1973, but not properly maintained by them. Left almost derelict, it was then bought in 1982 and restoration began: that restoration was award-winning and received a lot of television coverage. The house is often used for filming, and is open to the public in the summer: concerts are often held there.

===Holtye===
Holtye is immediately north-east of Hammerwood. Here the public house, The White Horse Inn, closed in 2014; the church is dedicated to St Peter, although the church is now redundant.

===Marsh Green===
Marsh Green is a group of buildings near Colemans Hatch. The region has been mentioned in census records since 1841. Marsh Green is close to the Poohsticks Bridge, and visitors missing the turning can find themselves there.

===Newbridge===
A small settlement most notable for the remains of the earliest blast furnace in England. Founded in about 1496, the furnace was last referred to in 1603. It was probably constructed on the site of an earlier bloomery. Also in the hamlet is an 18th century corn mill and mill house, both are Grade II listed.

==Landmarks==
Ashdown Forest falls partly within the parish. This Site of Special Scientific Interest is a large area of common ground comprising area of semi-natural woodland, heath and bog.

St Mary&#x27;s Church is another notable landmark in Hartfield. The oldest part of the current church building, the nave, is dated to the thirteenth century, to which the south aisle and tower were added in the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century, the shingled spire was added to the tower. In the nineteenth century, extensive repairs were made to the roof and many of the present furnishings in the church were added. 

==Demography==
In the 2001 census return, there were 2,105 people in the parish. Age breakdown is approximately as follows: 0–15: 28%; 16–59: 49%; 60+ : 23%. There were 1,640 registered voters in 1998. The average values of houses in 2001 for Hartfield parish for all property types was £286,736.

<text>Lantapan, officially the Municipality of Lantapan (Bukid and Higaonon: Banuwa ta Lantapan; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Bukidnon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 65,974 people.

Lantapan is known as the “vegetable basket” of Mindanao.

It used to be a barrio of Malaybalay until its creation, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4787 enacted on June 18, 1968, as a separate municipality.

==Geography==
The town is on a plateau in the heart of Bukidnon, situated between the Kalatungan and Kitanglad Mountain Ranges, after which its native name of &quot;lantapan&quot; was derived which means &quot;level-on-top&quot;.

Lantapan is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Sumilao and Impasugong; east by Malaybalay City; south by Valencia City; and west by Talakag. It lies above sea level at an average of and a maximum of of the Kitanglad range.

It has an aggregate area of 318.2 km2, mostly agriculture and forest lands. It has six river channels and 40 creeks and springs traversing across different points in the landscape. Lantapan is strategically located between two cities of Bukidnon, Malaybalay and Valencia. It can be reached via Aglayan crossing, which is a potential convergent zone of four cities: Iligan, Butuan, Davao and Cagayan de Oro.

===Barangays===
Lantapan is politically subdivided into 14 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.








===Flora and fauna===
Lantapan&#x27;s virgin forests are home to a diverse variety of flora and fauna. There are orchids, berries, pitcher plants, lichens, and a host of other wild flowers. A number of mammal species also thrive in the dense forests, including squirrels, monkeys, bats, flying lemurs, deer, tarsiers and wild pigs among others. The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) along with other bird species such as the serpent eagle and sparrow hawk takes its home within the Mt. Kitanglad Range.

===Climate===

The climatic condition of Lantapan is relatively cool and humid for Philippine standards with winds blowing at a northward direction. The temperature around noon tends to be 5-7 °C cooler than nearby coastal areas to the north. November to April is relatively dry and May brings the start of the rains which continue &#x27;til October. Mountains of neighboring towns in the north protect it from cyclone storms.

==Demographics==


In the 2020 census, the population of Lantapan was 65,974 people, with a density of .

Originally, the Talaandig were the main inhabitants of Lantapan. Then, migrants from the Visayas and northern Luzon started to settle in the area, even during the Spanish colonial period. More inflow took place after the Second World War. This stream of settlers eventually led to the varied mix of ethnic groups in Lantapan. Visayan is the predominant language, followed by Binukid. 2010 Census showed Lantapan&#x27;s population have reached 55,934 with the Poblacion as the most populated barangay. Its population growth rate between 1980 and 1990 of 4.18% was well above the national rate of 2.3 percent.

The Talaandig (one of the 7 Indigenous peoples of Bukidnon) ancestral territory includes Barangay Songco, where there are attempts to preserve Indigenous ways and customary law. A school for living tradition was built to teach the young the traditional Talaandig way of life, including its history, rituals, music, arts, embroidery, dance, and literature. Other activities involved earth paintings (painting utilizing soil as a medium), singing and dancing to traditional music, and making musical instruments and Indigenous accessories among others.
==Economy==
Agriculture

Lantapan has agriculture-based economy. Farming has remained a dominant economic activity among the Lantapanons. The major crops grown are corn, coffee, cabbage and potatoes, sugarcane and other high valued crops and bananas also becoming an important commercial crop.

Lantapan is also home to two banana plantations: the Mount Kitanglad Agri-Ventures Inc. (MKAVI) and the Dole Banana Plantation with thousands of hectares of lands in the highland-barangays of the town planted with export quality bananas. The plantations started their operation in 1998 with thousand of residents of the municipality employed.

Commerce

There are 428 commercial establishments registered at the Licensing Division of the municipality, 15 of which are classified under agro-industrial, manufacturing and servicing. Trading activities include wholesale buying of corn, coffee and vegetables by traders from within Lantapan, neighboring towns in Bukidnon and Cagayan de Oro.

Finance

For finance, the informal credit or &quot;suki&quot; system prevails. In this arrangement, the trader is usually the &quot;suki&quot; who provides credit too and buys the products of the farmer. A few cooperatives in some barangays also extend small loans to their members. An Asian Hills Bank located at the Poblacion and established in 1978, is owned by a private corporation. Its portfolio includes agricultural, commercial and real estate loans.

==Tourism==

;Kitanglad Mountain Range: The Kitanglad Mountain Range is a very significant landmark in the cultural history of the Indigenous peoples of Bukidnon with Mount Dulang-dulang considered as a sacred place. Being an ancestral domain, permission to enter must be secured from the tribal leaders of the Talaandig people of Lantapan in deference to the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) mandated by the Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Rights Act.

:The long trek to Mount Dulang-dulang’s summit goes through virgin dense forests, home to old trees covered with moss and lichens. At the highest peak, there is a panoramic view of the entire Kitanglad range, and on clear days, the distant Mount Apo. Sitio Bol-ogan in Barangay Songco of Lantapan is the shortest route towards the major start point to the peaks of Mount Kitanglad (with an elevation of above sea level) and Mount Dulang-dulang (with an elevation of above sea level) which is the country’s second-highest mountain, next to Mount Apo at above sea level

;Cinchona Forest Reserve: The Cinchona Forest Reserve was established through a presidential proclamation in 1936, and now forms part of the protected area of the Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park. It is home to the Cinchona Plantation, established at Barangay Kaatuan in 1929, and said to be the only of its kind left in Asia and the Pacific where the medicinal plant Cinchona (&quot;Cinchona ledgeriana&quot;) is grown. Cinchona, is a medium-sized tropical tree that can grow up with a diameter, is a source of quinine that is used for malaria treatment. The farm covers an area of where 7 Cinchona tree species are found and is planted mostly with Albizza falcataria (= &quot;Falcataria moluccana&quot;) and other medicinal trees. Located above sea level, the area is considered as the coldest place in Bukidnon with temperatures ranging from .

;Binahon Agro-forestry Farm: The Binahon Agro-forestry Farm, located at Sitio Bol-ogan, Barangay Songco, on the slopes of Mt. Kitanglad, is a learning institution for farmers, agriculturists, and rural development workers. Situated some above sea level, it cultivates various forest species such as Caribbean pine trees, lawaan, falcata, abaca, and eucalyptus. Fruit trees are also planted in the area with vegetables sown in between. Farm animals such as carabaos, horse, goats, sheep, hogs and other livestock animals are grown in the farm together with honeybees and tilapia. The farm also offers facilities for lodging to visiting tourists, researchers, scientists and mountaineers.

Barangay Kaatuan is also home to 8 conjoint water falls: 7 water falls pouring its contents onto another water falls. This conjoint waterfall is supplied by the Kulasihan River, and situated five kilometers from the barangay proper of Kaatuan called Block 2.

==Infrastructure==
===Health services===

The rural health unit (RHU) maintains one central health unit and 14 barangay health stations. The RHU provides medical, dental, family planning and laboratory services. It provides special care and rehabilitation to malnourished children. One privately owned clinic for urgent care on minor cases and two registered mini-pharmaceutical stores are found in the Poblacion.

===Water===

Potable water is distributed through individual installations of 3,958 households. A feasibility study is being developed for the establishments of an improved and modern water system for Lantapan which entails tapping the Kulasihan and Songco water sources for an estimated flow of 45,018.168 cubic meters per hour.

===Security===

Lantapan is generally peaceful. Security in the area is ably maintained by the local police force. Trained civilian forces, the &quot;Bantay-Bayan&quot; and the Civilian Volunteer Organization (CVO) in the barangays also provide support to crime prevention.

==Education==

Presently, there is a total of 24 primary, elementary and secondary schools in Lantapan. These schools serve approximately 7,000 children. Day care centers under the Department of Social Welfare and Development provide preparatory education to pre-schoolers in the barangays.

<text>David Lindsay (3 March 1876 – 16 July 1945) was a Scottish author best remembered for the philosophical science fiction novel &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920).

==Biography==

Lindsay was born into a middle-class Scottish Calvinist family in London, and was brought up partly in Jedburgh, where he had family background. He was educated at Colfe&#x27;s School, Lewisham, and won a scholarship to university, but for financial reasons went into business, becoming an insurance clerk at Lloyd&#x27;s of London. He was successful, but his career was interrupted by service in the First World War, starting at the age of 40. He first joined the Grenadier Guards, then the Royal Army Pay Corps, in which he was promoted to Corporal.

After the war Lindsay and his young wife, Jacqueline Silver, moved to Porth near Newquay in Cornwall, and lived there from 1919 to 1929. He became a full-time writer there. His novel &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; was published in 1920, but it was not a success, selling fewer than six hundred copies. The work shows links with Scottish fantasists such as George MacDonald, whose work Lindsay was familiar with, and it had a central influence on C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien said that he had read the book &quot;with avidity&quot;, and characterised it as a work of philosophy, religion and morality.

Lindsay attempted to write a more commercial novel with his next work &quot;The Haunted Woman&quot; (1922), but this was barely more successful than &quot;Voyage&quot;. He continued to write novels, including the humorous potboiler &quot;The Adventures of Monsieur de Mailly&quot;, set in France in the time of Louis XIV. After publishing &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tor&quot; in 1932 he found it increasingly difficult to get his work issued and spent much of his time on his last work, &quot;The Witch&quot;, which was not published in his lifetime.

With his wife, Lindsay opened a boarding house in Brighton, but they did not prosper and their marriage came under considerable strain. The house was damaged by the first bomb to fall on Brighton in the Second World War, and Lindsay, who was in his bath at the time, never recovered from the shock. His death from an infection resulting from an abscess in his tooth was unrelated to the bomb; Darrell Schweitzer attributed it to Lindsay allowing &quot;rotting teeth to develop into cancer of the jaw&quot;.

==Work==
&quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; has been described as the major &quot;underground&quot; novel of the 20th century. The secret of Lindsay&#x27;s apparent originality as a novelist lies in his metaphysical assumptions. Like the gnostics he seems to have viewed the &quot;real&quot; world as an illusion, which must be rejected in order to perceive genuine &quot;truth&quot;. In &quot;The Haunted Woman&quot;, the two main characters discover a room which seems to exist only some of the time; while they are there together, they can see more clearly and express themselves honestly. In &quot;The Violet Apple&quot;, the fruit of the title is of the species eaten by Adam and Eve, and Lindsay&#x27;s description of its effects is a startling, lyrical episode in a novel which is otherwise concerned with rather ordinary matters.

Lindsay&#x27;s austere vision of &quot;true reality&quot; seems to have been influenced by Norse mythology. After being out of print for many decades, Lindsay&#x27;s work has become increasingly available. In 1971, &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; was produced as a 35mm feature film by William J. Holloway. It was the first film to be funded by a National Endowment for the Arts grant and has recently been re-released. Harold Bloom was also interested in Lindsay&#x27;s life and career, going so far as to publish a novel, &quot;The Flight to Lucifer,&quot; which he thought of as a Bloomian misprision, an homage and deep revision of &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot;. Bloom, however, conceded that his late-comer imitation is overwhelmed by Lindsay&#x27;s great original. Colin Wilson was also interested in David Lindsay. He wrote an essay, &quot;The Haunted Man: Lindsay as Novelist and Mystic&quot; that first appeared in the book &quot;The Strange Genius of David Lindsay&quot; (1970), as well as prefaces to &quot;The Violet Apple&quot;, &quot;The Witch&quot; and &quot;Sphinx&quot;.

<text>Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon in which a signal that is normally too weak to be detected by a sensor can be boosted by adding white noise to the signal, which contains a wide spectrum of frequencies. The frequencies in the white noise corresponding to the original signal&#x27;s frequencies will resonate with each other, amplifying the original signal while not amplifying the rest of the white noise – thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, which makes the original signal more prominent. Further, the added white noise can be enough to be detectable by the sensor, which can then filter it out to effectively detect the original, previously undetectable signal.

This phenomenon of boosting undetectable signals by resonating with added white noise extends to many other systems – whether electromagnetic, physical or biological – and is an active area of research.

Stochastic resonance was first proposed by the Italian physicists Roberto Benzi, Alfonso Sutera and Angelo Vulpiani in 1981, and the first application they proposed (together with Giorgio Parisi) was in the context of climate dynamics.

==Technical description==
Stochastic resonance (SR) is observed when noise added to a system changes the system&#x27;s behaviour in some fashion. More technically, SR occurs if the signal-to-noise ratio of a nonlinear system or device increases for moderate values of noise intensity. It often occurs in bistable systems or in systems with a sensory threshold and when the input signal to the system is &quot;sub-threshold.&quot; For lower noise intensities, the signal does not cause the device to cross threshold, so little signal is passed through it. For large noise intensities, the output is dominated by the noise, also leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio. For moderate intensities, the noise allows the signal to reach threshold, but the noise intensity is not so large as to swamp it. Thus, a plot of signal-to-noise ratio as a function of noise intensity contains a peak.

Strictly speaking, stochastic resonance occurs in bistable systems, when a small periodic (sinusoidal) force is applied together with a large wide band stochastic force (noise). The system response is driven by the combination of the two forces that compete/cooperate to make the system switch between the two stable states. The degree of order is related to the amount of periodic function that it shows in the system response. When the periodic force is chosen small enough in order to not make the system response switch, the presence of a non-negligible noise is required for it to happen. When the noise is small, very few switches occur, mainly at random with no significant periodicity in the system response. When the noise is very strong, a large number of switches occur for each period of the sinusoid, and the system response does not show remarkable periodicity. Between these two conditions, there exists an optimal value of the noise that cooperatively concurs with the periodic forcing in order to make almost exactly one switch per period (a maximum in the signal-to-noise ratio).

Such a favorable condition is quantitatively determined by the matching of two timescales: the period of the sinusoid (the deterministic time scale) and the Kramers rate (i.e., the average switch rate induced by the sole noise: the inverse of the stochastic time scale).

Stochastic resonance was discovered and proposed for the first time in 1981 to explain the periodic recurrence of ice ages. Since then, the same principle has been applied in a wide variety of systems. Nowadays stochastic resonance is commonly invoked when noise and nonlinearity concur to determine an increase of order in the system response.

==Suprathreshold==
Suprathreshold stochastic resonance is a particular form of stochastic resonance, in which random fluctuations, or noise, provide a signal processing benefit in a nonlinear system. Unlike most of the nonlinear systems in which stochastic resonance occurs, suprathreshold stochastic resonance occurs when the strength of the fluctuations is small relative to that of an input signal, or even small for random noise. It is not restricted to a subthreshold signal, hence the qualifier.

==Neuroscience, psychology and biology==
Stochastic resonance has been observed in the neural tissue of the sensory systems of several organisms. Computationally, neurons exhibit SR because of non-linearities in their processing. SR has yet to be fully explained in biological systems, but neural synchrony in the brain (specifically in the gamma wave frequency) has been suggested as a possible neural mechanism for SR by researchers who have investigated the perception of &quot;subconscious&quot; visual sensation. Single neurons &quot;in vitro&quot; including cerebellar Purkinje cells and squid giant axon could also demonstrate the inverse stochastic resonance, when spiking is inhibited by synaptic noise of a particular variance.

==Medicine==
SR-based techniques have been used to create a novel class of medical devices for enhancing sensory and motor functions such as vibrating insoles especially for the elderly, or patients with diabetic neuropathy or stroke.

See the &quot;Review of Modern Physics&quot; article for a comprehensive overview of stochastic resonance.

Stochastic Resonance has found noteworthy application in the field of image processing.

==Signal analysis==
A related phenomenon is dithering applied to analog signals before analog-to-digital conversion. Stochastic resonance can be used to measure transmittance amplitudes below an instrument&#x27;s detection limit. If Gaussian noise is added to a subthreshold (i.e., immeasurable) signal, then it can be brought into a detectable region. After detection, the noise is removed. A fourfold improvement in the detection limit can be obtained.

<text>Luc Plamondon (born March 2, 1942) is a French-Canadian lyricist and music executive. His work includes the musicals &quot;Starmania&quot; and &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;.

He is the brother of Louis Plamondon, a long-serving member of the House of Commons of Canada.

Plamondon has accepted honours from Canadian institutions and is a francophone nationalist and Quebec sovereigntist.

He was born in Saint-Raymond. His father was a horse dealer. He learned the piano and undertook classical studies at the Petit Séminaire de Québec. He says that he entered the seminary to be a priest and that he came out a poet.

However, when his interview was published, the word &quot;poet&quot; became &quot;painter&quot;, hence the misunderstanding that he was an expert in painting. On the other hand, although he has never painted, he is a fan of modern painting.

== Activities ==
From 1972, in addition to his collaborations with Emmanuelle, Monique Leyrac, Renée Claude and Diane Dufresne, he also wrote songs for many Quebec and European artists, such as Céline Dion, Julien Clerc, Nicole Croisille, Françoise Hardy, Johnny Hallyday, Richard Cocciante, Claude Dubois, Nicole Martin, Robert Charlebois, Pierre Bertrand, Fabienne Thibeault, Nanette Workman, Martine St-Clair, Diane Tell, Éric Lapointe, Ginette Reno, Julie Arel, Donald Lautrec, Petula Clark, Murray Head, Catherine Lara, Garou, Julie Zenatti, Daniel Balavoine, Barbara, France Castel, Bruno Pelletier and Marie Denise Pelletier.

From 1976, he wrote, in collaboration with the composer Michel Berger, the rock opera Starmania, including SOS of an earthling in distress and A boy not like the others (Ziggy). Michel Berger chose him as lyricist precisely because he makes French sound in a particular way. The ambitious musical project, presented as the first French-speaking rock opera, was released on disc in the fall of 1978 with the help of French artists (France Gall, Daniel Balavoine), and Quebecois (Diane Dufresne, Fabienne Thibeault, Claude Dubois).

<text>Any Trouble are a British rock band, originating from Crewe, England, best known for their early 1980s recordings.

In 1980, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated that Any Trouble were &quot;the most exciting new rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group since the Pretenders&quot;.

==Early days==
Any Trouble&#x27;s founding members Clive Gregson (guitar), Tom Jackson (vocals) and Chris Parks (guitar) met at Crewe and Alsager Teacher Training College in 1974. Soon after, Mel Harley (drums) and Phil Barnes (bass) completed the line up.

Initially Any Trouble were a covers band, playing anything they liked, including songs by Bob Dylan, The Band and a selection of American rock and roll numbers. With the advent of punk rock and then new wave, Clive Gregson realised they needed a change of material and started taking songwriting seriously. He explained in a 1999 interview, &quot;We were like a human jukebox and it was obvious to me then if we wanted to get anywhere we needed original songs. I started to take it a bit more seriously then&quot;.

After vocalist Tom Jackson left, the band was fronted by rhythm guitarist and songwriter Clive Gregson. The remaining four were the first Any Trouble line-up to record, initially releasing the Gregson composition &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Love&quot; as an indie single in 1979. This was picked up by some radio stations and was played by BBC Radio 1 DJs John Peel, Andy Peebles and others in the UK.

==Signed to Stiff Records==
Airplay for Any Trouble&#x27;s debut indie single &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Love&quot; led to interest from major record labels including WEA, Chrysalis, EMI and Stiff. Any Trouble selected Stiff &quot;because they were our kind of people&quot;.

Their first release on the Stiff label, &quot;Where Are All the Nice Girls?&quot; was perhaps their most successful. The album was produced by John Wood (Fairport Convention etc.) and the band gained significant visibility after featuring on a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; front cover and in a gushing article by Allan Jones. In some ways the band&#x27;s career never recovered from this early rush of success and Gregson&#x27;s singing was unfairly compared to that of Elvis Costello and Ian Dury.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Wheels in Motion&quot;, with Martin Hughes replacing Mel Harley on drums, was produced by Mike Howlett; it would be the last recorded on the Stiff label in Any Trouble&#x27;s original incarnation.

Despite frequent touring and the release of &quot;Wheels in Motion&quot;, Any Trouble&#x27;s record sales failed to grow. The band were dropped by Stiff during a 1983 US tour supporting Ian Hunter, with their manager arranging for them to open for Molly Hatchet to help keep them afloat. At that point Clive Gregson &quot;pulled my plug... threw in the towel... we straggled back to NYC, where our van was robbed whilst we were in the Stiff offices trying to wrestle return tickets to the UK out of the office manager&quot;. The band flew back to the UK on standby tickets.

==Move to EMI America and break-up==
After returning from their US tour without a recording contract Any Trouble took a long break, after which Clive Gregson returned to making demos. He had a meeting with subsequent manager Ray Williams who persuaded him Any Trouble had a sufficient following to justify its revival. Gregson re-formed the band and, on the strength of the demos, Williams secured a contract with Gery Gersh at EMI America.

Any Trouble&#x27;s new line-up included Andy Ebsworth on drums and Steve Gurl on keyboards, with original members Clive Gregson and Phil Barnes. The sessions started promisingly enough with Val Garay (The Motels) as producer but Garay left after contract negotiations broke down. David Kershenbaum (best known for producing Joe Jackson and, later, Tracy Chapman) was brought on board to produce the band&#x27;s eponymous third album &quot;Any Trouble&quot; but they were unhappy with the synthesizer-heavy sound of the final mix. While they toured the UK to support the album there were no funds available from the record company for a US tour; the album failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic.

Gregson decided to throw everything into Any Trouble&#x27;s second effort for EMI America, producing an ambitious double album (an 11-track single LP in the US) that featured a mixture of new and previously recorded material to highlight the band&#x27;s diverse range of material. The new release, titled &quot;Wrong End of the Race&quot;, also failed to chart despite support from the record company. After the failure of their second EMI album, Clive Gregson broke the band up again. He recorded a solo album and joined Richard Thompson&#x27;s band for a time before starting a successful folk-rock duo with Christine Collister in the mid-1980s, on the dissolution of which he resumed his solo career from 1992 to the present. Gregson has also toured and recorded in various combinations of musicians, including Boo Hewerdine, Eddi Reader, Nanci Griffith, Andy Roberts, Ian Matthews and Dennis Locorriere. Andy Ebsworth was one of the members of Ryder, the purpose-made pop group which represented the United Kingdom at the 1986 Eurovision Song Contest.

==Re-formation==
In 2007, following the re-release of several Any Trouble albums on CD, the group reformed with the &quot;Wheels in Motion&quot; line-up of Clive Gregson, guitarist Chris Parks, bassist Phil Barnes and drummer Martin Hughes. After playing a few live gigs, Barnes had to bow out of the reformed group due to other commitments.

With Mark Griffiths as a session musician on bass, the revived group recorded a new album which was released on the reborn Stiff Records label on 10 September 2007. The album was titled &quot;Life in Reverse&quot; and featured thirteen new Gregson-penned songs. It was produced by John Wood, and had unique artwork by the Stiff Records designer Tobbe Stuhre. The band played a headlining reunion gig at the Jazz Cafe in London, England to support the release.

After another period of inactivity, in November 2013 Cherry Red Records released the 3-CD set &quot;The Complete Stiff Recordings 1980-81&quot;, comprising the band&#x27;s first two studio albums with assorted singles and B-sides, plus the &quot;Live at the Venue&quot; album, packaged in mini-sleeves. The band supported this by re-forming to perform a one-off gig at London&#x27;s 229 Club. By now, Griffiths was a full official member, and the line-up consisted of Gregson, Parks, Griffith and Hughes.

Any Trouble stayed together in 2014 to record the new album &quot;Present Tense&quot; and played a short tour in England in December 2014, which included Band on the Wall, Manchester, on 2 December 2014, dates in Newcastle, Birmingham and the 229 Club in London; they also played at the Purple Weekend Festival, in León, Spain. &quot;Present Tense&quot; was released in November 2015 featuring 18 new songs written by Gregson.
