<text>Jim Rondeau (born April 6, 1959) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2016, and served as cabinet minister in the provincial governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger from 2003 to 2013. Rondeau is a member of the New Democratic Party. Rondeau did not seek re-election in the 2016 Manitoba election.

==Early life and career==

The son of Gaston Joseph Rondeau and Dorothy Jean Finch, he was born in Winnipeg, and was educated at John Taylor Collegiate. He holds a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Winnipeg and has completed post-baccalaureate studies at the University of Manitoba. He was a teacher at Norway House High School from 1981 to 1984 and later taught at Cranberry Portage, before becoming coordinator of the Frontier School Division at the University of Winnipeg. Rondeau helped establish several learning centres and libraries throughout the province, and founded a school-to-work transition program for young people from northern Manitoba. He also coached the Winnipeg Eagles Volleyball Club, and was coach and manager of the Manitoba Volleyball team in several North American Aboriginal Games.

==Politician==

===Government backbencher===

Rondeau was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the 1999 provincial election with a dramatic victory in the west-end Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia, previously regarded as safe for the Progressive Conservative Party. On election night, the final vote totals showed Progressive Conservative incumbent Linda McIntosh winning re-election by two votes. After the institutional ballots were counted, however, Rondeau was declared elected by six votes. A recount later reduced his majority to four, and a subsequent judicial ruling struck it down to three.

Rondeau entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Gary Doer&#x27;s government, and soon became known as a strong constituency worker. He kept a strong interest in educational issues, and was a frequent participant in debates at the St. James-Assiniboia School Board. He represented the provincial government at Manitoba&#x27;s 2001 Hire a Student Day event, and was appointed to the board of Junior Achievement of Manitoba in 2003 with responsibility for Government, Education and Labor Relations. Rondeau also played an important role in assuring passage of the provincial Canadian Forces Personnel Act.

Rondeau is the first openly gay member of the Manitoba legislature, and was the keynote speaker of Winnipeg&#x27;s 2000 Gay Pride Parade. He encouraged the Doer government to introduce full legal equality for gay and lesbian couples during its first term, and strongly supported 2002 legislation that ensured full equality for all common-law relationships. He later became a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, which was legalized in Canada in 2005. Rondeau has said that his sexual orientation has never been controversial in his constituency, once telling a journalist, &quot;People don&#x27;t care one way or the other. I&#x27;m surprised, pleasantly surprised, that people don&#x27;t make it an issue.&quot;

Rondeau supported Jack Layton for the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party in 2003.

===Minister of Healthy Living===

Rondeau&#x27;s narrow victory in 1999 made his seat a key Progressive Conservative target in the 2003 election, but he was re-elected with 63% of the vote, winning every poll but one. In November 2003, he was appointed as Minister of Healthy Living within the Department of Health, with special responsibility for Seniors and Healthy Child Manitoba. He became a strong advocate for public awareness and preventative medicine, and indicated that the Doer government would consider removing the provincial sales tax from nutritional supplements and alternative foods.

In December 2003, Rondeau announced that Manitoba would ban all smoking from indoor public places and workplaces within a year. The initiative was described as the most ambitious anti-smoking strategy in Canada, and a February 2004 poll showed that many smokers were considering quitting in light of the ban. Rondeau introduced the anti-smoking bill in March 2004, and the ban came into effect at the beginning of October. The bill exempted tobacco shops as well as native reserves and casinos, which the government argued were outside provincial jurisdiction.

In March 2004, Rondeau announced that the Doer government had signed a $2.5-million contract to create a Prostate Centre at CancerCare Manitoba. He later handled negotiations concerning whether or not the Manitoba government would provide funding for an abortion clinic in Winnipeg. Despite some initial reluctance, he announced in July 2004 that the government would fully fund abortions at Jane&#x27;s Clinic, once owned by Henry Morgentaler. In late April 2004, he announced that the provincial government would pay for child vaccinations against chicken pox, meningitis and pneumococcus.

Rondeau and Fort Garry representative Kerri Irvin-Ross co-chaired public hearings on Manitoba&#x27;s privacy laws in May 2004. Later in the year, he announced that the government would establish a &quot;Healthy Kids, Healthy Futures&quot; committee of the legislature.

===Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines===

Rondeau was promoted to a full cabinet portfolio on October 12, 2004, as Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines. He indicated that Manitoba had the potential for strong economic growth in the mining sector, particularly in light of the need for raw materials in countries such as India and China. He also announced that he would work to reduce government bureaucracy in the sector, and make it easier for mining projects to get underway. The mining sector reported dramatic growth in 2005, highlighted by a new investment from Inco and a new gold mine project in Bissett.

Rondeau launched a farm immigration program in February 2005, making it easier for young farmers to move to Manitoba. He also expanded oil exploration in the province, removing the sales tax for drilling and exploration equipment. Manitoba&#x27;s oil sector grew at a record level in 2006, with 478 new wells started.

In 2004–05, Rondeau accused the federal government and federal Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh of undermining Manitoba&#x27;s online pharmaceutical industry, which was then shipping large quantities of medication to the United States of America. He argued that the government should compensate Manitoba for lost jobs if it chose to shut down the sector. Rondeau later indicated that he would support a ban on bulk exports to America, but added that government intervention appeared to be unnecessary in any event.

As Industry minister, Rondeau was responsible for overseeing the troubled Crocus Investment Fund and faced difficult questions relating to the fund&#x27;s management in early 2005. He acknowledged that the province was responsible for regulating Crocus, but argued that it had no involvement in the fund&#x27;s day-to-day operations.

===Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines===

After a cabinet shuffle on September 21, 2006, Rondeau was reassigned as Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines. Soon after his appointment, he announced that the Doer government would spend $70M to clean up the province&#x27;s abandoned mines.

Rondeau criticized the environmental strategy of Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative government in late 2006, saying that Harper was not moving as assertively as had the previous government of Paul Martin. Notwithstanding this criticism, he indicated in early 2007 that Manitoba&#x27;s share of a $1.5 billion federal Eco-Trust and Clean Air Fund will be at least $50 million, and could reach $100 million. He has said that the money will go to developing hydrogen technology for buses and providing energy efficiency programs for low-income Manitobans.

Rondeau supports a proposed east-west Canadian power grid, and has endorsed the federal government&#x27;s plan for a national ban on inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012. In February 2007, he announced that anyone who registers an energy-efficient hybrid vehicle in Manitoba between 15 November 2006 and 15 November 2008 will receive a $2,000 rebate from the provincial government.

Rondeau was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, as the New Democratic Party won a third consecutive majority government. He retained his position as Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines, and was also appointed as interim Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade, a position he held until February 2008.

Rondeau has said that Manitoba would neither raise Hydro rates nor implement a carbon tax to promote conservation, arguing that the goal could be achieved by other means. He announced a &quot;pause&quot; on further uranium exploration permits the following month, after health and environmental concerns were raised by the Northlands Dene First Nation. He has also indicated that the provincial and federal governments will spend over half a million dollars to expand a biodiesel testing laboratory in Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s East Selkirk plant, and has announced legislation to encourage further growth within the sector.

In late 2007, he wrote an editorial piece in support of a government policy requiring that 8.5% of the total volume of gasoline sold in Manitoba is to be ethanol. The mandate will take effect in 2008. In January 2008, Rondeau announced a tax credit for investments in small and medium-sized businesses.

<text>The Sikorsky S-38 was an American twin-engined ten-seat sesquiplane amphibious aircraft. It was Sikorsky&#x27;s first widely produced amphibious flying boat, serving successfully for Pan American Airways and the United States military.

==Design and development==
The S-38 was developed based upon experience with the Sikorsky S-34 and S-36. The S-38 first flew in May 1928. According to Sikorsky, &quot;The ship had very good takeoff characteristics from land and water. It had a climb of per minute fully loaded, and a maximum speed close to . The ship could cruise nicely around , and it stayed in the air on one engine. All these features were excellent for 1928 and at that time there were no other amphibians with such performance characteristics. In 1929, an S-38 was used by Colonel Lindbergh to inaugurate air mail service between the United States and the Panama Canal.&quot; The United States Navy ordered two aircraft, and Pan Am was an early customer.

A total of 101 aircraft were built, manufactured originally by the Sikorsky Manufacturing Corporation of Long Island, New York, and by the Sikorsky Aviation Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Sikorsky was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in mid-production.

==Reproductions==
During the 1990s two reproduction S-38s were built by the late Buzz Kaplan&#x27;s “Born Again Restorations,” of Owatonna, Minnesota. One was produced for Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr., the son of Herbert Fisk Johnson, to recreate his father&#x27;s flight, which he completed in 1998. the plane is suspended from the ceiling of Fortaleza Hall in the S. C. Johnson &amp; Son company headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin . The other S-38 replica, &quot;N28V&quot;, appeared in the movie &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), a story loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, who owned an S-38 during his lifetime. it is owned by Kermit Weeks and located at the Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida, bearing the &quot;Osa&#x27;s Ark&quot; paint scheme.

==Accidents and incidents==
* A SCADTA (actually Avianca, never was a Pan Am subsidiary) S-38, &quot;NC9107&quot;, crashed in the Colombian jungle near Pereira, killing all but one on board; the survivor was carried for seven days through the jungle to civilization.
* T. Raymond Finucane, a wealthy Rochester, NY businessman, and three others disappeared over the sea aboard a Sikorsky Amphibian after departing Norfolk, Virginia for New York City March 22, 1929. In Miami, Florida, Finucane had wagered a friend who was traveling ahead by train that he (Finucane) would reach New York first. He chartered Curtiss Flying Service to fly him to New York from Miami. Also on board the missing aircraft were Frank Ables and J. Boyd, Curtiss mechanics, along with Harry Smith, the pilot. A massive search by Curtiss planes, American military planes, coast guard cutters, and even the airship Los Angeles failed to turn up anything. Mrs. Finucane, founding president of the Rochester Community Players, visited the Curtiss operation at Roosevelt Field, the destination of the flight, for updates. Wreckage presumed to be from this plane was found eight years later by a fishing schooner.
* On September 25, 1932, a Panair do Brasil Sikorsky S-38 registration P-BDAD still bearing the titles of Nyrba do Brasil was seized in the company&#x27;s hangar by three men, who took a fourth man hostage. None were aviators but they managed to take off. However the aircraft crashed in São João de Meriti, killing the four men. Apparently the hijack was related to the events of the Constitutionalist Revolution in São Paulo and it is considered to be the first hijack that took place in Brazil.

<doc id="961659" wikidata="Q700682" url="?curid=961659" title="Battle of the Bulge (1965 film)">
<text>Battle of the Bulge is a 1965 American widescreen epic war film produced in Spain, directed by Ken Annakin and starring Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews and Charles Bronson. The feature was filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and exhibited in 70 mm Cinerama. &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; had its world premiere on December 16, 1965, the 21st anniversary of the titular battle, at the Pacific Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California.

The film is a highly fictionalized account of the battle. The filmmakers attempted to condense the Battle of the Bulge, a World War II battle that stretched across parts of Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and lasted nearly a month, into under three hours, and shot parts of the film on terrain, and in weather, that did not remotely resemble the actual battle conditions. That left them open to criticism for lack of historical accuracy, but they claimed in the end credits that they had &quot;re-organized&quot; the chronological order of events to maximize the dramatic story.

Unlike most other World War II epics, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; contains virtually no portrayals of actual senior Allied leaders, civilian or military. That is presumably because of controversies surrounding the battle, both during the war and afterward. Allied forces ultimately won the battle, but the initial German counteroffensive caught them by surprise and caused many casualties.

==Plot==
In December 1944, Military Intelligence officer Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley and his pilot, Joe, are flying a reconnaissance mission over the Ardennes forest that spans easternmost Belgium, northern Luxembourg, and parts of bordering France and Germany. They locate a German staff car and photograph its occupants, buzzing low enough for a close-up to cause its shell-shocked driver to flee the car without stopping its engine. His commanding officer scolds him for wasting petrol, extremely precious to the German war effort.

The officer, Col. Hessler, continues on to his new underground base, where General Kohler briefs him on the top secret plan to pierce American lines and recapture Antwerp. At the same time, English-speaking German paratroopers, led by Lt. Schumacher, are dropped behind American lines disguised as American MPs to confuse and disrupt the Allies. Hessler&#x27;s orderly and driver, Conrad, remarks upon the staggering losses Germany has sustained during the war, pointing out to his superior that his new young tank commanders are not the men he had trained and led through the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Crimea. Upon a review of the Panzer commanders, all of whom are, as Conrad said, young and inexperienced, both men are skeptical until the commanders break into a chorus of &quot;Panzerlied&quot;, showing him their fighting spirit. Hessler is tentatively won over.

Meanwhile, Kiley returns to U.S. headquarters and warns once again that the Germans are planning a new offensive. His superiors, Maj. Gen. Grey and his executive officer, Col. Pritchard, do not listen, believing Germany lacks the resources and manpower to mount an attack, especially in winter, let alone with the Christmas holidays looming immediately ahead. Seeking proof, Kiley is sent to an outpost on the Siegfried Line to capture prisoners for interrogation. At the loose disciplined American base, Maj. Wolenski sends callow Lt. Weaver and gung-ho Sgt. Duquesne on patrol. They capture young, green German soldiers. Rather than proof of German desperation, Kiley believes they are keeping their more experienced men back for an offensive, but is again dismissed by his superiors as a &quot;crackpot&quot;.

Hessler launches his attack the next day, leading columns of new King Tiger tanks, which heavily outclass the Allied tanks. Wolenski leads his men into the wooded area of the Schnee Eifel to fight back, but they are overrun. A group of Allied tanks, led by Sgt. Guffy, also attempts to slow the Panzers, but their tanks&#x27; weak guns and thin armor make them ineffective. On the trip back to Amblève, Guffy&#x27;s crew moves black market goods from a nearby farmhouse. Lt. Schumacher and his disguised troops capture the only bridge over the Our River that can carry heavy tanks, and Hessler continues toward Amblève, secretly observed by Kiley. Guffy meets up with his Belgian girlfriend, Louise, and they split the proceeds of their racket. They also discuss their feelings for each other, implying they will marry when the war is over.

Schumacher later takes control of a vital intersection of three roads that connect Amblève, Malmedy, and the Siegfried Line. He sabotages the road signs, and the rear echelon of Wolenski&#x27;s troops takes the wrong road to Malmedy. They are captured and massacred by SS troops, though a wounded Weaver escapes. Other US soldiers become suspicious when they observe Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;MPs&quot; pretending to be demolishing the Our bridge, but laying the explosives incorrectly.

As the Americans have improvised a strong defense at Amblève, Kohler orders Hessler to bypass it, but Hessler wishes to break the Americans&#x27; will to fight, and Kohler relents. Grey assigns Wolenski to cover an Allied evacuation. Hessler&#x27;s tanks and infantry lay siege to Amblève, then occupy its ruins. Although many Americans, including Wolenski, are captured, senior staff safely escapes to the Meuse River to regroup for a counterattack. Guffy learns that Louise died in the shelling.

Despite the dangers of flying in fog and at night, Col. Kiley conducts an aerial reconnaissance. He and Joe find Hessler&#x27;s tanks through a gap in the fog and radio in the coordinates. German fire causes the plane to crash near an American fuel depot, killing Joe and wounding Kiley.

In Hessler&#x27;s command caravan, an exasperated Conrad confronts the Colonel, calls him a warmonger, and demands a transfer. Hessler transfers him to the fuel battalion.

Meanwhile, Grey&#x27;s division, the Meuse at their backs, prepare to fight off Hessler&#x27;s determined effort to capture the fuel depot. In a headlong tank confrontation the Americans employ a gambit to lure the Germans into using up the last of their fuel. The American tanks are savaged, but the strategy works. Weaver, Guffy and a few soldiers kill off Schumacher and his disguised MPs at the Fuel Depot before the arrival of Hessler&#x27;s tanks. A wounded Kiley then staggers out of hiding and urges the men to burn the depot. Desperate, Hessler makes a last ditch effort to capture the depot. In defense, the Americans flood the road leading to it with gasoline and set it alight with grenades, immolating the German tanks and their crews. Hessler&#x27;s tank takes a fuel drum rolled directly at it, incinerating him. General Grey arrives in time to see the panzers afire.

With no alternative, the surviving German soldiers abandon their vehicles and begin a long walk back to Germany. Conrad, bringing up the rear, throws aside his weapons, done with the war.

== Cast ==
== Historical inaccuracies ==
The film&#x27;s opening narration by William Conrad inaccurately states, &quot;To the north stood Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army...&quot; In fact, the British Eighth Army, Montgomery&#x27;s previous command, was in Italy at the time; Montgomery&#x27;s northern command was the 21st Army Group. The narration continued, &quot;...To the south, Patton&#x27;s Third Army.&quot; Although Patton&#x27;s Third Army was indeed to the south it was not tasked in any way with defending the Ardennes. Instead, it was dug in on the west bank of the Rhine River, a component of a much larger force of four American armies of the 12th Army Group under General Omar Bradley poised to cross it into Germany.

After the introduction there is no reference to British forces in the area, though they were largely kept behind the Meuse River and thus almost entirely out of the fighting. Consequently, there is no mention of General Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to split the Bulge front into two, transferring temporary command of two American armies to Field Marshal Montgomery in the northern half of the Bulge. As a result, the film implies an all-American operation.

The film was shot on location in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range and Madrid, Spain, which bear no resemblance to the rugged, heavily wooded Ardennes of Belgium, Luxembourg and western Germany. Aside from the initial American encounters with the German offensive, the weather during filming was also at odds with the actual battle, which was fought during waves of heavy snow. The film&#x27;s major tank battle scene, and some other battle scenes, were fought in flat, bare, arid territory.

The aviation reconnaissance scenes with Henry Fonda were filmed with one or more Cessna L-19 aircraft, which did not fly until December 1949, instead of the Piper L-4 that was widely used during World War II.

The final tank battle is a rough depiction of the Battle of Celles on December 26, 1944, where the U.S. 2nd Armored Div. smashed the German 2nd Panzer Division. The film creates the false impression that large numbers of American tanks sacrificed themselves against heavy Tiger IIs and, in the process, lured the enemy off course, which caused them to run out of gas. In reality, they were already stranded. The tanks that were used, despite the claims of the producer in an interview in one of the DVD extras, are not historically accurate. Although the M24 Chaffee light tanks used in the movie in lieu of the ubiquitous M4 Sherman were introduced during World War II, they were not used in the scale shown in the film but were relatively rare.

U.S. M47 Pattons were used to represent German King Tiger tanks (of which none existed to use), in spite of being over 20 tons lighter.

Absent from the movie is the response of the U.S. Third Army under General George Patton in relief of the bypassed but encircled city of Bastogne.

There is also no mention of the key turning point in the battle, which was not an armor and infantry effort but rather Allied air power hitting the German spearhead hard at the first sign of clear weather, only the German HQ receiving word that the weather was set to clear.

The characters of Kiley, an American lieutenant colonel, and Hessler, a regular Wehrmacht tank commander, were loosely based on Colonel Benjamin Abbott &quot;Monk&quot; Dickson and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; lieutenant colonel Joachim Peiper, although the character of Hessler actually asks General Kohler about the reports of the massacre at Malmedy, which Kohler blames on another SS officer, making the comparison of Hessler and Peiper inaccurate. However, the fictional characters bore marked differences. For example, Peiper did not die in a kamikaze tank attack. He was tried and sentenced to death at the War Crimes Tribunal for his role in the Malmedy massacre, but was released after serving twelve years in prison. He lived until 1976, when he was killed in France by French vigilantes.

== Production ==
Screenwriter Bernard Gordon claims to have rewritten John Melson&#x27;s original screenplay. Some of the original choices for director were the experienced and successful Richard Fleischer, who turned it down, and Edward Dmytryk, with whom Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. refused to work. Ultimately, the job went to Ken Annakin who had made &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. Annakin wrote, &quot;It seemed quite a good narrative account of the German surprise onslaught against the American forces in the Ardennes and how the allied advance was nearly turned at this point, but the dialogue was not remarkable, the character relationships nothing special — it seemed to me just another war picture.&quot; However, he decided to take the job on the advice of his colleagues who said it would be a big hit.

The technical advisor on the film was Maj. Gen. (then Col.) Meinrad von Lauchert, who commanded the German tank division that made the most headway in the actual battle.

For an economical price and with no restrictions, the Spanish army provided an estimated 500 fully-equipped soldiers and 75 tanks and vehicles, some of which were World War II vintage.

A contentious matter in 1964-65 was another &quot;Bulge&quot; film—never completed—slated by Columbia Pictures, to have been called &quot;The 16th of December: The Battle of the Bulge&quot; and co-produced by Tony Lazzarino. The Columbia effort had the cooperation of the Pentagon, which offered to Lazzarino &quot;an unpublished battle history running to thousands of pages,&quot; and Eisenhower&#x27;s assistance as well. The film would have been shot largely in upper New York State at the Army&#x27;s Fort Drum, which would have offered authentic winter weather conditions. The proposed Columbia film had the cooperation of many officers who were part of the battle, including Germany&#x27;s General Hasso von Manteuffel (commander of the Fifth Panzer Army) and U.S. General Robert W. Hasbrouck (who had led Seventh Armored Division).

As late as December 1965—the month the Warner film was released—there were still plans to make the Columbia film. Casting announcements included Van Heflin as Eisenhower, John Wayne as General Patton, David Niven as General Montgomery, and Laurence Olivier as Hitler. Columbia issued a 1964 injunction against Warner&#x27;s for registering its &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; title with the MPAA; to get Columbia to drop it, Warners agreed not to mention actual names such as Eisenhower, Montgomery, Bradley, Patton, MacAuliffe (the U.S. general who issued the dumbfounding &quot;Nuts!&quot; response to the German request for surrender) and ten others &quot;whose stories have been contributed to the Morgan-Lazzarino version&quot;. Early in 1964, the press had announced a $1 million award to Columbia from the Warner production, also forbidden from &quot;seeking support from agencies and individuals with whom Columbia Pictures and Gotham Rhodes had already made agreements&quot;.

==Release==
=== Home media ===
The original VHS release of the film for home video use was heavily edited to fit on one VHS tape and used a full-screen &quot;pan and scan&quot; technique, which was often used in network telecasts of widescreen motion pictures. The 1992 Laserdisc and 2005 DVD releases feature the full-length film and are presented letterboxed in the original 2.76:1 aspect ratio. A Blu-ray release followed in 2007, also in the original 2.76:1 aspect ratio.

==Reception==
===Box office===

The film was one of the most popular films at the British box office in 1966.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Reviewers were impressed by the big-name cast, but they were unafraid to point out historical inaccuracies, as Bosley Crowther raged in his assessment of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

<text>The Aero Letňany A.10 was a biplane airliner produced in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I. It was the first commercial aircraft to be built in Czechoslovakia and was known as the Ae-10 Limousine. It was designed by Husnik and Vlasak and was intended to meet the growing need for aerial communication to and from the country. Behind the single nose-mounted engine was a cabin with seats for three and two tables, upholstered on the underside, and able to be inverted to provide another two seats if required. A double skinned firewall between the engine and cabin, together with double skinned surfaces to the walls, floor and roof and Triplex windows gave a (relatively) quiet ride. A rear window gave communication with the pilot, whose open cockpit was above and behind the cabin. The cockpit also accommodated the navigator who had a seat directly behind the pilot.

The upper wings were in three sections with the small center section mounted on a tubular cabane and the lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage. Balanced ailerons were fitted to the top plane only and the petrol tank was fitted in the centre section. The fuselage was a deep rectangular section tapering to a vertical knife-edge at the rear, thus rendering a tail fin unnecessary. The tailplane carried two balanced elevators hinged to the stabilisers, and a balanced rudder was fitted to the top of the fuselage.

The first example of the A.10 flew for the first time on 3 January 1922. The A.10 was important as one of &quot;Československé Státní Aerolinie&quot; - (Czechoslovak State Airlines) first aircraft, with five examples in service with the airline from the time of its inception in 1923 until 1928, on the Prague to Bratislava route.

<doc id="961668" wikidata="Q1321962" url="?curid=961668" title="Goal difference">
<text>Goal difference, goal differential or points difference is a form of tiebreaker used to rank sport teams which finish on equal points in a league competition. Either &quot;goal difference&quot; or &quot;points difference&quot; is used, depending on whether matches are scored by goals (as in ice hockey and association football) or by points (as in rugby union and basketball).

Goal difference is calculated as the number of goals scored in all league matches minus the number of goals conceded, and is sometimes known simply as plus–minus. Goal difference was first introduced as a tiebreaker in association football, at the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and was adopted by the Football League in England five years later. It has since spread to many other competitions, where it is typically used as either the first or, after tying teams&#x27; head-to-head records, second tiebreaker. Goal difference is zero sum, in that a gain for one team (+1) is exactly balanced by the loss for their opponent (–1). Therefore, the sum of the goal differences in a league table is always zero (provided the teams have only played each other).

Goal difference has often replaced the older goal average, or goal ratio. Goal average is the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded, and is therefore a dimensionless quantity. It was replaced by goal difference, which was thought to encourage more attacking play, encouraging teams to score more goals (or points) as opposed to defending against conceding. However goal average is still used as a tiebreaker in Australia, where it is referred to as &quot;percentage&quot;. This is calculated as points scored divided by points conceded, and then multiplied by 100.

If two or more teams&#x27; total points scored and goal differences are both equal, then often goals scored is used as a further tiebreaker, with the team scoring the most goals winning. After this a variety of other tiebreakers may be used.

==Goal difference &quot;v.&quot; goal average==
----


Under goal average, Team A would win:
Under goal difference, Team B would win:
Goal average was replaced by goal difference due to the former&#x27;s encouragement of lower-scoring games. For example, a team that scores 70 while conceding 40 would have a lesser goal average (1.750) than another team that scores 69 while conceding 39 (1.769). Or, for the team that has scored 70 while conceding 40, conceding another would reduce the goal average by 0.043 (to 1.707), whereas scoring another would increase it by only 0.025 (to 1.775), making not conceding much more important than scoring again.

The opposite effect occurs when the number of goals scored is less than the number of goals conceded, with goal difference encouraging more defensive play for teams in relegation battles. Consider a team that scores 10 while conceding 20. Under goal difference, an extra goal scored cancels out an extra goal conceded. However, under goal average, an extra goal would increase the goal average by 0.05, while conceding would reduce it by only 0.024.

Another issue with goal average is that, if a team has conceded no goals (e.g. England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Group 1), the value cannot be calculated, as division by zero is undefined.

====2007, PSV Eindhoven and Ajax====
Heading into the final day of the 2006–07 Eredivisie season, three teams were still in contention to win the title, and with it a guaranteed place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. PSV, looking to win their third straight league title, was the only one of the three to play its final match at home, against Vitesse Arnhem. Ajax, looking to win their first title since 2004, traveled to Willem II, while AZ faced Excelsior looking to win its first league title since 1981, after finishing in the top three in the previous two seasons.

These final matches were played on April 29, 2007. AZ struggled against Excelsior (who would have to go through a relegation play-off after the end of the game) as they played almost 72 minutes of the match with only 10 men, as goalkeeper Boy Waterman was red-carded in the 18th minute. AZ came from behind twice, with Danny Koevermans tying the match in the 70th minute with his 22nd goal of the season. AZ had a chance to take the lead after its numerical disadvantage was leveled as Excelsior&#x27;s Rene van Dieren was sent off for yellow card accumulation. AZ never took advantage and a goal from Johan Voskamp in the 90th minute gave Excelsior a shock 3–2 win.

Meanwhile, in Tilburg, Ajax took the lead in the 18th minute with a goal from Urby Emanuelson. Ajax added a second goal in the 69th minute as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 21st goal of the season.

Meanwhile, PSV scored twice in the first 10 minutes, but gave up a goal three minutes later and led only 2–1 at half-time. In the second half, Ibrahim Afellay scored in the 58th minute before another goal from Jefferson Farfan made the score 4–1 to PSV.

Following Huntelaar&#x27;s 69th-minute goal, PSV and Ajax were level on points and goal difference, but Ajax had a superior goals scored. But in the 77th minute, Philip Cocu put PSV up 5–1 and the team was up on goal difference (+50 to Ajax&#x27;s +49). The scores stayed that way at full time, and so PSV won the 2006–07 &quot;Eredivisie&quot; in one of the most exciting finishes to a season in recent memory.

==== 2010, Breiðablik UBK, ÍBV and FH Hafnarfjörður ====

The 2010 Úrvalsdeild season concluded on September 25, 2010, and three teams were still in contention to win the league title. Leading the table was Breiðablik, based in Kópavogur, who knew that a win would give them their first ever league title. Trailing one point behind were ÍBV from Vestmannaeyjar, who were looking to win their fourth league title, but its first since 1998. In third place was two-time defending champions FH, looking to win the league title, but trailing Breiðablik by only two points.

Breiðablik traveled to Stjarnan and were held to a scoreless draw, but would get encouraging news. Playing their final game at Keflavík, ÍBV were losing 2–0 with 16 minutes remaining when Denis Sytnik scored for ÍBV to cut the deficit to 2–1. But two late goals from Keflavík&#x27;s Magnús Þorsteinsson and Bojan Ljubicic denied ÍBV a chance to overtake Breiðablik, as ÍBV lost to Keflavík by 4–1.

Meanwhile, a draw opened the door for FH as they traveled to Reykjavík to face Fram needing to overturn an 11-goal difference. FH got two goals from Gunnar Kristjansson and a third from Atli Viðar Björnsson (which would tie him with two players for the league lead with 14 goals). However, the 3–0 victory was not enough to deny Breiðablik their first ever league title.

====2014, Debreceni VSC and Győri ETO FC====

Ahead of the final day of the 2013–14 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season, Debrecen was on course to win its 7th league title since 2005 as its closest competitor Győr had to overturn a 14-goal swing on the final matchday. Despite losing its season-finale 2–0 to Budapest Honved FC, Debrecen won the title as Győr only won 5–0 against already-relegated Mezőkövesd-Zsóry SE.

===England top-flight===

====2012, Manchester City and Manchester United====
The 2011–12 Premier League was largely a two-horse race contested between Manchester City and Manchester United for most of the season, with both clubs finishing 19 points ahead of third-placed Arsenal. City and United went into their final matches of the season level on points, but with City in first-place due to a goal difference superior by +8. The final matches were relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers at home for City, and Sunderland away for United. City were strong favourites, with United&#x27;s manager Alex Ferguson stating City would have to do &#x27;something stupid&#x27; not to beat QPR.

A Manchester City win would guarantee the title due to a realistically unassailable superior goal difference. If not a win, then City just needed to match United&#x27;s result at the Stadium of Light against Sunderland or have United lose against Sunderland. United scored in the 20th minute, winning 1–0. City scored two goals in injury time to come from behind and win 3–2.

====1989, Arsenal and Liverpool====

Arsenal won the league championship on goals-scored, after finishing level on points and goal difference with Liverpool in the 1988–89 season. Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2–0 in the final game of the season to win the championship.

===England lower division titles decided on goal difference===

====1983–84, Second Division – Chelsea–Sheffield Wednesday====

Chelsea 88 points and goal difference 50, Sheffield Wednesday 88 points and goal difference 38.

====1989–90, Second Division – Leeds United–Sheffield United====

Leeds United 85 points and goal difference 27, Sheffield United 85 points and goal difference 20.

====1981–82, Third Division – Burnley–Carlisle United====

Burnley 80 points and goal difference 21, Carlisle United 80 points and goal difference 15.

====2016–17, League 2 – Portsmouth-Plymouth Argyle====

Portsmouth 87 points and goal difference 39, Plymouth 87 points and goal difference 25.

====2021–22, League 2 – Forest Green-Exeter City====

Forest Green 84 points and goal difference 31, Exeter City 84 points and goal difference 24.

(N.B. in 1996–97 Wigan Athletic and Fulham finished level on 87 points at the top of the Third Division, but Wigan Athletic were awarded the championship on most goals scored, which was the first tie breaker in use in the Football League between 1992 and 1999, although Fulham had the greater goal difference. Coincidentally Brighton and Hove Albion avoided relegation from the same division on goals scored at the expense of Hereford United, although Hereford had the better goal difference. It reverted to the Goal Difference method from the start of the 1999–2000 season.)

===Scotland===

====1986, Premier Division – Hearts–Celtic====
In 1986, Hearts lost 2–0 at Dundee on the final day of the season, which allowed Celtic to win the league championship on goal difference. Had the first tie-breaker been a goal average, Hearts would have won the championship.

====2003, Premier League – Old Firm====
Rangers won the Scottish Premier League in 2003 on goal difference. In the final round of matches, Rangers played Dunfermline, while second-placed Celtic were playing at Kilmarnock. With Celtic and Rangers level on 94 points going into these matches, the Championship would be decided by which team, Celtic or Rangers, performed best during the final round of matches. If both teams won they would each finish on 97 points, and the League would be decided on goal difference. Rangers won 6–1 and Celtic won 4–0, which left Rangers with a goal difference of 73 (101 for and 28 against), and Celtic a goal difference of 72 (98 scored and 26 against) giving Rangers the title.

In the 1923–24 Football League Championship, Huddersfield Town and Cardiff City both finished on 57 points. Huddersfield Town won the title with 60 goals for to 33 against, for an average of 1.818. Cardiff City&#x27;s 61 to 34 gave 1.794. They would have been tied on goal difference but City would have won on goals scored.

====1950, First Division–Portsmouth-Wolverhampton Wanderers====
In the 1949–50 Football League Championship, Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers both finished on 53 points. Portsmouth won the title with 74 goals for to 38 against, for an average of 1.947. Wolverhampton Wanderers 76 to 49 gave 1.551.

====1953, First Division–Arsenal-Preston North End====
In the 1952–53 Football League Championship, Arsenal and Preston North End both finished on 54 points. Arsenal won the title with 97 goals for to 64 against, for an average of 1.516. Preston&#x27;s 85 to 60 gave 1.417.

====1965, First Division–Manchester United-Leeds United====
In the 1964–65 Football League Championship, Manchester United and Leeds United both finished on 61 points. Manchester United won the title with 89 goals for to 39 against, for an average of 2.282. Leeds United&#x27;s 83 to 52 gave 1.596, which was actually lower than third-placed Chelsea&#x27;s, although they finished five points adrift of Leeds.

===England lower divisions===

====1950, Second Division–Sheffield United-Sheffield Wednesday====
Going into the last game of the 1949–50 season, Sheffield Wednesday needed a win against Tottenham Hotspur to secure second place and clinch promotion at the expense of their local rivals Sheffield United. The resulting 0–0 draw meant Wednesday won promotion by a goal average difference of just 0.008 – a 1–1 draw would have left the two level on points and goal average, and a unique play-off match would have had to be played.

====1927, Second Division – Portsmouth-Manchester City====
Going into the last game of the 1926-27 season, both clubs were on 52 points. Portsmouth had a goal average of 1.708, Manchester City&#x27;s was 1.639. Manchester City won 8-0 and celebrated thinking that would be good enough. The Portsmouth game had kicked off fifteen minutes later than City&#x27;s, towards the end of the match they were winning 4-1 and knew that another goal would see them promoted which they duly scored. Portsmouth won 5-1, the results meant Portsmouth won promotion by a goal average difference of just 0.006. It is noted that had the current Goal Difference rules applied at this time, City would have been promoted.

===Scotland===

====1953, Division A – Rangers–Hibernian====
Rangers drew their last match of the 1952–53 season, against Queen of the South, 1–1, to finish level with Hibernian on 43 points. They won the title with a goal average of 80–39 to 93–51 (2.051 to 1.824).

====1965, First Division – Hearts–Kilmarnock====
Entering the final day of the 1964–65 season, Hearts were two points ahead of nearest rivals Kilmarnock, with two points awarded for a win. Hearts played Kilmarnock at Tynecastle in the last game, with Kilmarnock needing a 2–0 victory to win the league championship on goal average. Hearts could afford to lose 1–0 or 2–1, but lost 2–0 and Kilmarnock won the championship by a goal average of 1.88 to 1.84. Had goal difference been in use, Hearts would have been champions.

===Yugoslavia===

====1951, First League – Red Star Belgrade–Dinamo Zagreb====
Red Star Belgrade won the 1951 Yugoslav First League championship ahead of Dinamo Zagreb with a 0.013 better goal average. Dinamo&#x27;s final match against BSK Belgrade ended in a 2–2 draw, and the following day Red Star defeated Partizan 2–0, meaning that both teams finished on 35 points. Red Star&#x27;s 50 goals for and 21 against gave a goal average of 2.381, while Dinamo&#x27;s 45 to 19 gave 2.368.

====1958, First League – RNK Split–Budućnost====
In the 1957–58 Yugoslav First League championship, RNK Split and Budućnost finished the season leveled on points and goal average. Both teams had 25 points, with Budućnost&#x27;s 30 goals for and 36 against giving a goal average of 0.833, the same as RNK Split&#x27;s 35 goals for and 42 against. A two-legged play-off match between the two was needed to decide who will enter relegation play-offs. The match in Split ended in a goalless draw, while in the return leg Budućnost defeated RNK Split 4–0. RNK Split entered the relegation play-offs and was relegated in their first season in the top flight.

<doc id="961677" wikidata="Q1323342" url="?curid=961677" title="Krytron">
<text>The krytron is a cold-cathode gas-filled tube intended for use as a very high-speed switch, somewhat similar to the thyratron. It consists of a sealed glass tube with four electrodes. A small triggering pulse on the grid electrode switches the tube on, allowing a large current to flow between the cathode and anode electrodes. The vacuum version is called a vacuum krytron, or sprytron. The krytron was one of the earliest developments of the EG&amp;G Corporation.

==Description==
Unlike most other gas switching tubes, the krytron conducts by means of an arc discharge, to handle very high voltages and currents (reaching several kilovolts and several kiloamperes), rather than the low-current glow discharge used in other thyratrons. The krytron is a development of the triggered spark gaps and thyratrons originally developed for radar transmitters during World War II.

The gas used in krytrons is hydrogen; noble gases (usually krypton), or a Penning mixture can also be used.

==Operation==

A krytron has four electrodes. Two are a conventional anode and cathode. One is a keep-alive electrode, placed near the cathode. The keep-alive has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode. High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a positive pulse is applied to the trigger electrode (&quot;Grid&quot; in the image above). Once started, arc conduction carries a considerable current.

The fourth is a control grid, usually wrapped around the anode, except for a small opening on its top.

In place of or in addition to the keep-alive electrode some krytrons may contain a tiny amount of radioactive material (usually less than of nickel-63), which emits beta particles (high-speed electrons) to make ionization easier. The radiation source serves to increase the reliability of ignition and formation of the keep-alive electrode discharge.

The gas filling provides ions for neutralizing the space charge and allowing high currents at lower voltage. The keep-alive discharge populates the gas with ions, forming a preionized plasma. This can shorten the arc formation time by 3–4 orders of magnitude in comparison with non-preionized tubes, as time does not have to be spent on ionizing the medium during formation of the arc path.

The electric arc is self-sustaining. Once the tube is triggered, it conducts until the arc is interrupted by the current falling too low for too long (under 10 milliamperes for more than 100 microseconds for the KN22 krytrons).

Krytrons and sprytrons are triggered by a high voltage from a capacitor discharge via a trigger transformer, in a similar way flashtubes for e.g. photoflash applications are triggered. Devices integrating a krytron with a trigger transformer are available.

===Sprytron===
A sprytron, also known as vacuum krytron or triggered vacuum switch (TVS), is a vacuum, rather than a gas-filled, version. It is designed for use in environments with high levels of ionizing radiation, which might trigger a gas-filled krytron spuriously. It is also more immune to electromagnetic interference than gas-filled tubes.

Sprytrons lack the keep alive electrode and the preionization radioactive source. The trigger pulse must be stronger than for a krytron. Sprytrons are able to handle higher currents. Krytrons tend to be used for triggering a secondary switch, e.g., a triggered spark gap, while sprytrons are usually connected directly to the load.

The trigger pulse has to be much more intense, as there is no preionized gas path for the electric current, and a vacuum arc must form between the cathode and anode. An arc first forms between the cathode and the grid, then a breakdown occurs between the cathode–grid conductive region and the anode.

Sprytrons are evacuated to hard vacuum, typically 0.001 Pa. As kovar and other metals are somewhat permeable to hydrogen, especially during the 600 °C bake-out before evacuation and sealing, all external metal surfaces must be plated with a thick (25 microns or more) layer of soft gold. The same metallization is used for other switch tubes as well.

Sprytrons are often designed similar to trigatrons, with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization on the inner surface of an alumina tube. The trigger pulse causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals. An example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life can be done by storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 °C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged.

Sprytrons can be also triggered by a laser pulse. In 1999 the laser pulse energy needed to trigger a sprytron was reduced to 10 microjoules.

Sprytrons are usually manufactured as rugged metal/ceramic parts. They typically have low inductance (10 nanohenries) and low electrical resistance when switched on (10–30 milliohms). After triggering, just before the sprytron switches fully on in avalanche mode, it briefly becomes slightly conductive (carrying 100–200 amperes); high-power MOSFET transistors operating in avalanche mode show similar behavior. SPICE models for sprytrons are available.

==Performance==
This design, dating from the late 1940s, is still capable of pulse-power performance that even the most advanced semiconductors (even IGBTs) cannot match easily. Krytrons and sprytrons are capable of handling high-current high-voltage pulses, with very fast switching times, and constant, low jitter time delay between application of the trigger pulse and switching on.

Krytrons can switch currents of up to about 3000 amperes and voltages up to about 5000 volts. Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between the application of the trigger pulse and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds. The achievable jitter may be below 5 nanoseconds. The required trigger pulse voltage is about 200–2000 volts; higher voltages decrease the switching delay to some degree. Commutation time can be somewhat shortened by increasing the trigger pulse rise time. A given krytron tube will give very consistent performance to identical trigger pulses (low jitter). The keep-alive current ranges from tens to hundreds of microamperes. The pulse repetition rate can range from one per minute to tens of thousands per minute.

Switching performance is largely independent of the environment (temperature, acceleration, vibration, etc.). However, the formation of the keep-alive glow discharge is more sensitive, which necessitates the use of a radioactive source to aid its ignition.

Krytrons have a limited lifetime, ranging, according to type, typically from tens of thousands to tens of millions of switching operations, and sometimes only a few hundreds.

Sprytrons have somewhat faster switching times than krytrons.

Hydrogen-filled thyratrons may be used as a replacement in some applications.

==Applications==
Krytrons and their variations are manufactured by Perkin-Elmer Components and used in a variety of industrial and military devices. They are best known for their use in igniting exploding-bridgewire and slapper detonators in nuclear weapons, their original application, either directly (sprytrons are usually used for this) or by triggering higher-power spark gap switches. They are also used to trigger thyratrons, large flashlamps in photocopiers, lasers and scientific apparatus, and for firing ignitors for industrial explosives.

==Export restrictions in the United States==
Because of their potential for use as triggers of nuclear weapons, the export of krytrons is tightly regulated in the United States. A number of cases involving the smuggling or attempted smuggling of krytrons have been reported, as countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons have attempted to procure supplies of krytrons for igniting their weapons. One prominent case was that of Richard Kelly Smyth, who allegedly helped Arnon Milchan smuggle 15 orders of 810 krytrons total to Israel in the early 1980s. 469 of these were returned to the United States, with Israel claiming the remaining 341 were &quot;destroyed in testing&quot;.

Krytrons and sprytrons handling voltages of 2,500 V and above, currents of 100 A and above, and switching delays of under 10 microseconds are typically suitable for nuclear weapon triggers.

==In popular culture==
A krytron was the &quot;MacGuffin&quot; in Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Frantic&quot;. The device in the film was actually a Krytron-Pac, which consisted of a Krytron tube along with a trigger transformer encased in black epoxy.

The krytron, incorrectly called a &quot;kryton&quot;, also appeared in the Tom Clancy nuclear terrorism novel &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;.

The plot of Larry Collins&#x27; book &quot;The Road to Armageddon&quot; revolved heavily around American-made krytrons that Iranian mullahs wanted for three Russian nuclear artillery shells they had hoped to upgrade to full nuclear weapons.

The term &quot;krytron&quot; appeared in the season 3, episode 14 (Provenance) of the television drama &quot;Person of Interest&quot;.

In Season 3 of NCIS episode &quot;Kill Ari, Part 2&quot;, it was revealed that Ari Haswari, a rogue Mossad operative, had been tasked with acquiring a krytron trigger. Along with stolen plutonium from Dimona, these were key components for an Israeli sting operation. The krytron was also incorrectly called a &quot;kryton&quot;.

==Further developments==
Optically triggered solid-state switches based on diamond are a potential candidate for krytron replacement.

<text>The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), also called Asian tapir, Asiatic tapir, oriental tapir, Indian tapir, piebald tapir, or black-and-white tapir, is the only living tapir species outside of the Americas. It is native to Southeast Asia from the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra. It has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008, as the population is estimated to comprise fewer than 2,500 mature individuals.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name &quot;Tapirus indicus&quot; was proposed by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1819 who referred to a tapir described by Pierre-Médard Diard.
&quot;Tapirus indicus brevetianus&quot; was coined by a Dutch zoologist in 1926 who described a black Malayan tapir from Sumatra that had been sent to Rotterdam Zoo in the early 1920s. 

Phylogenetic analyses of 13 Malayan tapirs showed that the species is monophyletic.
It was placed in the genus &quot;Acrocodia&quot; by Colin Groves and Peter Grubb in 2011. However, a comparison of mitochondrial DNA of 16 perissodactyl species revealed that the Malayan tapir forms a sister group together with the &quot;Tapirus&quot; species native to the Americas. It was the first &quot;Tapirus&quot; species that genetically diverged from the group, estimated about in the Late Oligocene.

==Description==

The Malayan tapir is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its hindquarters. Black hair covers its head, shoulders, and legs, while white hair covers its midsection, rear, and the tips of its ears; these white edges around the rims of the outer ear as is true of other tapirs. The disrupted coloration breaks up its outline, providing camouflage by making the animal difficult to recognize against the varied terrain and dense flora of its habitat; potential predators may mistake it for a large rock, rather than prey, when it is lying down to sleep.

The Malayan tapir is the largest of the four extant tapir species and grows to between in length, not counting a stubby tail of only in length, and stands tall. It typically weighs between , although some adults can weigh up to . The females are usually larger than the males. Like other tapir species, it has a small, stubby tail and a long, flexible proboscis. It has four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan tapir has rather poor eyesight, but excellent hearing and sense of smell.
The tapir&#x27;s unique proboscis is supported by several evolutionary adaptations of its skull. It has a large sagittal crest, unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with elevated frontal bones, and a retracted nasal incision as well as retracted facial cartilage. This evolutionary process is believed to have caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the tapir&#x27;s nasal chamber.

===Vision===
Malayan tapirs have very poor eyesight, both on land and in water, instead relying heavily on their excellent senses of smell and hearing to navigate and forage. Their eyes are small and, like many herbivores, positioned on the sides of the face. They have brown irises, but the corneas are often covered in a blue haze; this corneal cloudiness is thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. This loss of transparency impacts the ability of the cornea to transmit and focus outside light as it enters the eye, impairing the animal&#x27;s overall vision. As these tapirs are most active at night on top of having poor eyesight, this habit may make it harder for them to search for food and avoid predators.

=== Color variation ===
Two melanistic Malayan tapirs were observed in Jerangau Forest Reserve in Malaysia in 2000. A black Malayan tapir was also recorded in Tekai Tembeling Forest Reserve in Pahang state in 2016.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Malayan tapir lives throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Sumatra in Indonesia, Peninsular Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand.

Pleistocene fossils were found in Java and other locations accompanied by herbivores more typical of grasslands, indicating that it evolved in more open habitats and retreated to closed forests in later times. It was found in Borneo until at least 8,000 years ago during the early Holocene in the Niah Caves of Sarawak, and some 19th century writers mentioned it as a contemporary species in Borneo, likely based on native accounts. It has been proposed to reintroduce the tapir to the island as a conservation measure.

In the continent, the Malayan tapir was found in historical times as far north as China.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Malayan tapirs are primarily solitary, marking out large tracts of land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap with those of other individuals. Tapirs mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.
Exclusively herbivorous, the animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 115 species of plants, of which around 30 are particularly preferred, moving slowly through the forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. The tapir can run quickly when threatened or frightened, and if forced to fight can defend itself with its strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan tapirs communicate with high-pitched squeaks and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively nocturnal; because they tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap in the middle of the night, they are considered to be crepuscular animals.

===Life cycle===

The gestation period of the Malayan tapir is about 390–395 days, after which a single calf is born that weighs around . Malayan tapirs are the largest of the four tapir species at birth and tend to grow more quickly than their relatives. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.

=== Predators ===
Because of its size, the Malayan tapir has few natural predators, and even reports of killings by tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;) are scarce.
Malayan tapirs can defend themselves with their very powerful bite; in 1998, the bite of a captive female Malayan tapir severed off a zookeeper&#x27;s left arm at the mid-bicep, likely because she stood between her and her offspring.

== Threats ==
The main threats to the Malayan tapir are loss and destruction of habitat through deforestation. Large tracts of forests in Thailand and Malaysia have been converted for planting oil palms. Habitat fragmentation in peninsular Malaysia caused displacement of 142 Malayan tapirs between 2006 and 2010; some were rescued and relocated, while 15 of them were killed in vehicle collisions.

<doc id="961687" wikidata="Q2723690" url="?curid=961687" title="D-Terminal">
<text>The D-Terminal or D-tanshi () is a type of analog video connector found on Japanese consumer electronics, typically HDTV, DVD, Blu-ray, D-VHS and HD DVD devices. It was developed by the EIAJ (Electronic Industry Association of Japan) in its standard, RC-5237, for use in digital satellite broadcast tuners. In appearance it is a small flat trapezoidal connector, the same connector as the AAUI connector used by Apple Computer for some time to connect to ethernet.

Some items sold outside Japan use the connector as well. Notable examples are Canon&#x27;s XH-A1 DVC high-definition camcorder and Panasonic&#x27;s AG-HVX200 DVCPro HD camcorder.

==D1~D5 types==

A D-Terminal connector carries a component video signal (YPBPR). A device with a D5 connector can understand and display the following video signals:
*D1 480i (525i)： 720 × 480 interlaced
*D2 480p (525p)： 720 × 480 progressive
*D3 1080i (1125i)： 1920 × 1080 interlaced
*D4 720p (750p)： 1280 × 720 progressive
*D5 1080p (1125p)： 1920 × 1080 progressive

A device with a D-Terminal connector supports that level and lower D-Terminal signal. For example, a D4 connector can be used with a D4, D3, D2, or D1 signal, but not with a D5 signal.

It is possible to use a simple breakout cable to connect a D-Terminal connector to a standard 3 RCA jack or BNC component connection.

==Compatibility Issues==
It is not always a given that output devices support all lower versions of the standard, so customers must take care to buy compatible products. For example, the PlayStation Portable (PSP-2000) initially supported only the 480p (D2) mode. System Software Ver. 5.00 added 480i (D1) support for the &quot;PS one Classics&quot; games, but not native PSP games. The later PSP-3000 and PSP Go models have 480i support for all games.

<text>Zagreb Film is a Croatian film company principally known for its animation studio. From Zagreb, it was founded in 1953. They have produced hundreds of animated films, as well as documentaries, television commercials, educational films and several feature films.

Zagreb Film produced the cartoon series &quot;Professor Balthazar&quot; (), created by Zlatko Grgić, about an amusing professor who solved various imaginative problems. Another popular cartoon of theirs was &quot;Inspector Mask&quot; ().

==History==
Zagreb Film was founded in 1953 with the main profile of an animated films production company. Since then, more than 600 animated films, 14 feature films, about 600 documentaries and 800 commercials as well as 600 educational films were produced in this studio.

The company operates at three locations; one with ateliers for artists, shooting equipment, small theater and one with film warehouse, video multiplication room and administration. The third location is used for commercial purposes. During all these years, Zagreb Film received more than 400 awards on Festivals all over the world. Among them is the Academy Award - Oscar for the best animated short film in 1962 where Dušan Vukotić had become the first European animator to win the Oscar award for &quot;Surogat (Ersatz)&quot;. Wealth of genres and different styles that were growing in Zagreb was the reason for Georges Sadoul, the French film theorist, critic and historian to coin the term &quot;Zagreb school of animation&quot;, what became the trademark for top grade and innovative animated films made in Zagreb. Besides artistic films Zagreb film produced films and TV series like &quot;Inspektor Maska&quot;, &quot;Professor Balthazar&quot;, &quot;The Little Flying Bears&quot; and &quot;Maxi Cat&quot;. Most of these films were distributed internationally. The biggest global success was with the famous character of Professor Balthazar.

<doc id="961694" wikidata="Q15221517" url="?curid=961694" title="Statue of José Gervasio Artigas (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>General Jose Gervasio Artigas is a bronze statue, in Washington, DC, capital of the United States, at the intersection of Constitution Avenue and Virginia Avenue, at 18th Street. It is one of a set called the Statues of the Liberators. José Artigas was a 19th-century general, sometimes called &quot;the father of Uruguayan independence&quot;, &quot;Protector de los Pueblos Libres&quot; or &quot;Jefe de los Orientales&quot;.

The Washington, DC, statue was created before 1948 by Juan Manuel Blanes. At its base are engraved the words &quot;Liberty of America is my dream and its attainment my only hope.&quot;

Although this statue was delivered before the identical one in Montevideo, Minnesota, Montevideo erected theirs in 1949 and the Washington, DC, Parks Department did not erect its until a year later on 19 June 1950.

Both statues were gifts from the people of Uruguay and are replicas of an original in San José de Mayo, Uruguay, created by Italian sculptor Dante Costa. The Uruguayan officer Edgardo Ubaldo Genta had conceived the idea in 1940 as a good-will gesture.

<doc id="961695" wikidata="Q745466" url="?curid=961695" title="Christian Democratic Party (Australia)">
<text>The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) was a Christian democratic political party in Australia, founded in 1977, under the name Call to Australia Party, by a group of Christian ministers in New South Wales. One of the co-founders, Fred Nile, a Congregational Church minister, ran as their upper house candidate in the NSW State election. The Christian Democratic Party&#x27;s platform espoused social conservatism. It changed its name in 1998.

The party was primarily active in New South Wales and, after the 1981 NSW state election, had at least one member in that state&#x27;s Legislative Council, often holding or sharing the balance of power. The Christian Democrats never succeeded in having a member elected to federal parliament, although John Bradford briefly sat with the party in the House of Representatives after defecting from the Liberal Party before the 1998 federal election.

In 2011, the Victorian and Western Australian branches of the CDP voted to form a new party, leading to the creation of the Australian Christians in those states. In June 2021, it was reported that the Christian Democratic Party had gone into receivership. On 17 March 2022, the federal branch of the party was deregistered by the AEC because it did not meet membership number requirements. On 29 March 2022, the Supreme Court of NSW dissolved the party.

==History==
===Formation===
Originally established as the &quot;Call to Australia Party&quot; in 1977, the CDP was founded by a group of Christian ministers, and Fred Nile ran as their candidate. These groups had sought to mobilise conservative and evangelical Protestants as an electoral force. Nile was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1981 and the party managed to get a candidate elected at every subsequent New South Wales election until the 2019 state election.

An earlier party called the &#x27;Christian Democrat Party&#x27; contested the 1980 federal election in the seat of Northern Territory and the Senate.

===Retirement of Elaine Nile and election of Gordon Moyes===
In August 2000, it was announced that Elaine Nile would retire due to ill health and be replaced by John Bradford, a former Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from Queensland who had defected to the CDP before being defeated at the 1998 Federal election. However, this fell through due to disagreements between Fred and Elaine Nile and Bradford. Elaine Nile served until 2002, at which time she was replaced by Gordon Moyes of Sydney&#x27;s Wesley Central Mission. Moyes was elected in his own right at the 2003 NSW election.

In 2004, Moyes suggested Nile make a bid for a Senate seat at the 2004 federal election. In that election, Nile achieved 2.6% of the primary vote, but narrowly missed attaining a seat. Another rival conservative party, Family First, won a seat in Victoria with 1.9% and a better preference deal. With Nile&#x27;s return to the New South Wales Legislative Council, Moyes began to question the leadership of his former party leader.

During the 2007 New South Wales state election, the CDP called for a moratorium on Muslim immigration to Australia, seeking to replace them with &quot;persecuted Christians from the Middle East&quot;. Nile said the moratorium should be in place to allow a study of the effects of Muslim migration. &quot;There has been no serious study of the potential effects upon Australia of more than 300,000 Muslims who are already here,&quot; he said. &quot;Australians deserve a breathing space so the situation can be carefully assessed before Islamic immigration can be allowed to resume. In the meantime, Australia should extend a welcoming hand to many thousands of persecuted Christians who are presently displaced or at risk in the Middle East.&quot; Nile and another CDP candidate Allan Lotfizadeh reported receiving death threats on account of this announcement.

Fred Nile was re-elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 24 March 2007, achieving a vote of 4.4%, the highest for the CDP since 1988.

===Battle between Nile and Moyes===
In 2007, the President of the Legislative Council, Meredith Anne Burgmann, retired from public service and the Council sought a replacement. Tensions flared when both Moyes and Nile applied for the position. Nile subsequently withdrew his application and nominated Moyes at Moyes&#x27; behest. Peter Primrose was confirmed President on 8 March 2007, Moyes having received only two votes, Nile&#x27;s and his own. After Nile was made Assistant Deputy President on 28 June 2007 and then Assistant President 28 November 2007, Moyes began to publicly attack Nile.

Moyes argued that Nile&#x27;s anti-homosexual, anti-abortion and anti-Muslim focus should be altered and that greater emphasis be placed on environmental issues. In contrast to Nile, Moyes inferred that the burden of responsibility for Islamic terrorism lay at the feet of western civilisation, the &quot;Crusades&quot; and the &quot;excesses of the &#x27;war on terrors&#x27;.

Moyes (then aged 70 years) claimed Nile (then aged 75 years) was too old and was too &quot;committed to gaining money and status, and [...attacked...] any who disagree[d] with himself&quot;. According to Moyes, Nile was a pathetic figure who has never laughed, has no friends, is a workaholic, has no interests or hobbies, eats fast-food meals and when in Sydney attending Parliament, spends every night alone in a cheap motel in western Sydney.

In February 2009, Nile wrote in his monthly newsletter that he regretted allowing Moyes to take his wife&#x27;s place upon her retirement &quot;because of his disloyalty and divisive actions and his frequent support of the Greens&quot;. Moyes stated that the Greens were &quot;far more Christian&quot;.

Moyes also attacked the Christian Democratic Party itself, stating that the party was a cult, a hypocritical, anti-Christian, anti-democratic dictatorship that adhered to the values of extremist fundamentalism. Moyes claimed that the &quot;end was nigh&quot; for the party as there was a conspiracy to disband the party and form a new conservative Christian political party. Moyes attempted to draw Nile&#x27;s parliamentary staff into the conflict by making claims that they had intimidated and bullied his own. Moyes ignored repeated warnings from the CDP management committee, claiming that they were dysfunctional: calling the committee &quot;sad, mad, senile and aggressively ambitious.&quot; As a result, Moyes was expelled from the Christian Democratic Party in March 2009 by secret ballot of its members. Moyes became an independent for several months before joining the Family First Party in 2009. Moyes failed in his attempt to be re-elected at the 2011 state election.

=== 2019 Leadership challenges ===
On the third of June 2019, Samraat Joshua Grewal announced that he had seized control of the Christian Democratic Party and removed the Party&#x27;s Board following a vote of no confidence at a Party State Council which had passed unanimously after half the membership vacated the meeting. This included the Party&#x27;s leader Rev Fred Nile, who is a longtime member of the New South Wales Parliament. This was allegedly done in an attempt to reform the Party. Subsequently, it was announced that he had established a Directional Committee, leaving the party with two competing Board of Directors to investigate internal party breaches of Electoral Commission regulations. In the following weeks, there were allegations made that the Party&#x27;s State President Ross Clifford had been bullying party members and staff of Morling Theological College of which he is Principal.

In the following weeks, it was confirmed that the Party had been involved in high level breaches of Government Regulations. The Party&#x27;s State Director Craig Hall said that &#x27;The Party needed to change if it was to survive,&#x27; and that the Party&#x27;s deficient Constitution was being changed by the orders of Government Regulators. By August, it was announced that the Party would have a re-vote of the motion. At this time a former State Director of the Party, Greg Bondar commented that the re-vote would give the membership an opportunity to set a new direction for the Party and its leaders. &quot;Eternity News&quot; reported that the coup by Samraat was partially instigated by succession issues, such as when Fred Nile allegedly reneged on a promise to hand over his parliamentary seat to Ross Clifford, Principal of the Baptist Morling College, resulting in the party losing 80 branches in a year, including four interstate organisations.

By the end of August 2019, the party had concluded its re-vote of the no-confidence motion which was defeated. Criticisms were made about the secret ballot requiring names to be written on them. In addition, claims were made that the Party Executive moved a motion to prevent Samraat from addressing the membership. In November 2019, it was announced that the Party President Ross Clifford had resigned his position, confirming the mismanagement claims made by Samraat and other party members.

In September 2020, the party&#x27;s treasurer Charles Knox filed a lawsuit against Fred Nile and his wife Silvana Nero-Nile for allegedly claiming $100,000 of party funds for their own use.

===Retirement of Fred Nile===
On 12 April 2021 Fred Nile announced that he would be retiring from parliament in November, and named Lyle Shelton as a candidate to replace his seat in the Legislative Council. Nile withdrew his endorsement of Shelton in September 2021 due to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; between the two, and announced that he would remain in parliament until 2023 to complete his parliamentary term.

==Schism and Dissolution of CDP==
However, following several years of animosity between Fred Nile and members of the Christian Democratic Party board of management, the party went into receivership in April 2021, in to an allegedly parlous financial condition. In March 2022, Fred Nile abandoned the Christian Democratic Party and sat in the New South Wales Legislative Council as the MLC for the Seniors United Party of Australia. The party was subsequently taken off the Australian federal register of political parties due to having insufficient membership. 

==Policies==
The Christian Democratic Party exists to support Christian representation in every level of government – federal, state and local – and to promote &quot;ethical values based on...Christian values&quot;.

The party is supportive of family values (including traditional marriage), freedom of speech, protective of children and their rights including those of unborn children, and policies that are protective of established Australian values and systems, inclusive of a requirement that immigrants to Australia demonstrate a desire to learn English. They are opposed to both abortion and euthanasia as well as pornography, drug decriminalisation and sharia law.

=== Law and order ===
The CDP supports rehabilitation of criminals when possible. They seek &quot;a wisely governed penal system that seeks to restore convicted persons where possible to good contributors to society.&quot;

=== Economy and housing ===
CDP&#x27;s policy on the economy is to ensure &quot;a healthy environment for business to start and grow&quot;. They support an adequately &quot;remunerated job&quot; to allow for &quot;a balance between work and non-work times&quot; and have an emphasis on &quot;the financial well-being of each person in [the] community&quot;. In 2015, Nile supported the Liberal government&#x27;s privatisation of electricity infrastructure, such as poles and wires.

=== Education and health ===
The Christian Democratic Party believe that parental input in a child&#x27;s education plus writing, reading and arithmetic are the basis of a good education system. They also support Special Religious Education (SRE). CDP believes that Health Care &quot;should be available, accessible and affordable&quot;.

=== Environment and social security ===
According to their 2018 policies, the CDP supports a balanced approach to both environment and social security. They seek a &quot;good and sustainable use of the earth&quot; and social security for &quot;those who genuinely need it&quot;.

=== Employment, immigration, and infrastructure ===
The CDP is for local industry and local jobs and &quot;proactively [work] to advocate for jobs growth&quot;. Their policy on immigration reads: &quot;Each nation needs to manage its immigration so that there is a balance of visitors and immigrants that will contribute positively to the nation. In the last several years we have seen a rise in immigration that has outpaced infrastructure and potentially affecting housing affordability, health affordability, and employment declines, and a strain on the social security system resulting in community disquiet towards some new immigrants. This has the potential to change the character of the Australian society. Immigration needs to be carefully managed, taken on the advice of demographic experts and not growth economics.&quot; The Christian Democrats also support strong infrastructure programs for roads, bridges, hospitals, airports, waterways and power supplies. They state that these should be &quot;steady and affordable&quot; and planned for &quot;future generations&quot;, not simply as short-term goals.

==Controversies==
The party and a candidate, Peter Madden, came under intense opposition from their policies and political campaign actions by the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Their campaign to have the Sydney Mardi Gras banned because of, as he puts it, &quot;the lifestyle and perversion that it promotes&quot; saw opposition from the RSL as one of their campaign YouTube videos, which featured Madden, labelled a &quot;battle cry&quot;, calls upon &quot;10,000 warriors&quot; to rally against the event and shows Madden in front of the Anzac War Memorial in Hyde Park inviting viewers to become &quot;lions&quot; and join him. The NSW RSL president, Don Rowe, said that returned servicemen and women and the public as a whole find it &quot;totally offensive&quot; that anyone would use the image of the War Memorial to make a political statement. Don Rowe said to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;I am neither a supporter nor a detractor of the Mardi Gras and the RSL has no official position on it, but we totally disapprove of the use of the War Memorial in a politicised way. It is a sacred site and symbolises those Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and for our freedoms … not for someone trying to make a political stand.&quot;

Peter Madden was also criticised by the LGBT community when he called for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras to be &quot;moved off the streets&quot;.’ and stated in an interview with Glenn Wheeler and Anthony Venn-Brown on the Sydney radio station 2GB that one of the main objectives of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras was &quot;recruitment&quot;.

==Electoral outcomes==

The CDP has built a small but stable electoral base among Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, as well as religious minorities, in New South Wales, particularly in the &quot;Bible Belt&quot; suburbs of north-western Sydney and in some country areas, but the CDP has only achieved modest results in its attempts to expand its electoral base further. The party has comparable support in Western Australia (which broke away to form the Australian Christians party) but has lacked similar representation in its state parliament because its seats have higher election quotas.

The Christian Democratic Party sees the policies of the major parties as an attack on their traditional views. Gordon Moyes (no longer a member of the party) explained, &quot;Our Christian heritage is under attack from pagan and secularist forces, militant Islamic groups, a neo communism under a Green guise and a strident homosexual lobby that has successfully gained the support of the Labor Party, Australian Democrats and the Greens, and many from the left of the Liberal Party.&quot;

For the 1983 federal election, the CDP formed an alliance with the Victoria-based Democratic Labor Party. They did not win any seats and contested subsequent elections separately.

The Christian Democratic Party generally had two (sometimes three) sitting members in the New South Wales Legislative Council at any one time. Usually, these two individuals have been Nile and one other member. At the 1984 New South Wales state election Nile was joined by former Liberal politician Jim Cameron. Cameron retired shortly after being elected, due to serious health problems, and was replaced by Marie Bignold. Nile&#x27;s wife, Elaine Nile, joined her husband and Bignold at the Legislative Council at the 1988 New South Wales state election. Bignold subsequently had a falling out with Fred and Elaine Nile over Bignold&#x27;s opposition to the Liberal Party stance on industrial relations; a policy position supported by the Niles. The restructuring of the Legislative Council in 1991 meant that Bignold&#x27;s seat was abolished and she was forced to an early election; but she failed in her bid for re-election.

The party was involved in Glenn Druery&#x27;s Minor Party Alliance.

Paul Green was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council at the 2011 state election, aged 45 years at the time of this election.
He failed to be re-elected in the 2019 election.
This was the first NSW Legislative Council election that the party failed to get any candidates elected since its founding.

<text>The first USS &quot;Luce&quot; (DD-99) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and the years following. She was named in honor of Stephen B. Luce.

==History==
&quot;Luce&quot; was laid down by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 9 February 1918. The ship was launched on 29 June 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Boutelle Noyes, daughter of Rear Admiral Luce. The destroyer was commissioned on 11 September 1918.

&quot;Luce&quot; departed Boston on 19 September 1918 and reported to Commander Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet, in New York two days later. She sailed with Troop Convoy 67 for France on 23 September. Upon arrival at the Azores on 1 October, she was detached and proceeded to Gibraltar on 19 October. &quot;Luce&quot; performed escort and patrol duty in the Mediterranean Sea for the duration of the war.

On 26 November she departed for the Adriatic Sea and for five months patrolled the area in cooperation with the Food Commission. After voyaging to the eastern Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas in May and June 1919, she returned to Gibraltar on 27 June en route to the United States. She arrived in New York on 10 July and proceeded to Boston for .

On 29 October she was transferred to Reserve Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet, and 18 March 1920 was reclassified Light Mine Layer (DM-4). In April she departed Boston for Newport, Rhode Island, where she operated with the destroyer force until July. On 5 July 1921 she joined Mine Squadron 1 at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and participated in tactical exercises until October. After a cruise to the Caribbean Sea in January 1922, &quot;Luce&quot; arrived at Philadelphia where she decommissioned on 30 June 1922.

&quot;Luce&quot; recommissioned on 19 March 1930 and sailed to Panama on 18 April where she operated with submarines of the Canal Zone Control Force until May. She returned to the east coast on 4 June and trained with Mine Squadron 1 until steaming to Boston where she decommissioned for the final time on 31 January 1931. &quot;Luce&quot; was sold to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, New York on 29 September 1936 and scrapped 13 November 1936.

<text>Dublin postal districts have been used by Ireland&#x27;s postal service, known as &quot;An Post&quot;, to sort mail in Dublin. The system is similar to that used in cities in Europe and North America until they adopted national postal code systems in the 1960s and 1970s. These were incorporated into a new national postcode system, known as Eircode, which was implemented in 2015. Under the Eircode system, the city is covered by the original routing areas D01 to D24, along with A## and K## codes for locations elsewhere in County Dublin.

==History==

The postal district system was introduced in 1917 by the British government, as a practical way to organise local postal distribution. This followed the example of other cities, including London, first subdivided into ten districts in 1857, and Liverpool, the first city in Britain or Ireland to have postcodes, from 1864. The letter &quot;D&quot; was assigned to designate Dublin and was retained by the new Irish government.

Dublin didn&#x27;t start using postal district numbers until 1927 when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs initiated a scheme that requested senders to add a code to each address in Dublin City and suburbs. When mail was addressed in English senders were to add an appropriate postman&#x27;s walk number but when addressed in Irish, different letters were used with the same walk numbers, such as Rathgar Road being D3 on mail addresses in English but S3 on Irish addressed mail. This scheme was not popular and within a few years became defunct. In 1961, new postal district numbers started and these numbers were added to street signs prior to which street signs only displayed the street name in Irish and English.

The number of districts increased as the city grew, and in the 1970s, large districts were subdivided. Dublin 5 was split, with the coastal part retaining the &quot;5&quot; and the inland part becoming Dublin 17. Dublin 8, Ballyfermot became Dublin 10, along with Palmerstown and Chapelizod. However, Dublin 10 was subsequently split again, with Palmerstown and Chapelizod forming Dublin 20.

In 1985, Dublin 6 was divided, with some areas, such as Templeogue, Kimmage and Terenure becoming part of a new district in order to facilitate the processing of mail by a new delivery office for those areas. Residents of some areas objected to the assignation of the next available number, &quot;Dublin 26&quot;, for the new postal district, citing property devaluation: the higher numbered districts typically represented less affluent and less central areas. An Post ultimately relented, and the western part of the district became known as Dublin 6W.

==Structure==

Historically, the postal district appeared with one or two digits (or in the case of one district, a digit and a letter) at the end of addresses:

Sample Address, Sample Street, Dublin 8

Under the Eircode postcode system, the postal district number is still retained in Dublin addresses, even though this information is also contained in the &quot;Locator code&quot; portion of the Eircode postcodes, e.g.:

Sample Address, Sample Street, Dublin 8, D08 1X2Y

In most cases, odd numbers are used for addresses on the Northside of the River Liffey, while even numbers are on addresses on the Southside. Exceptions to this are the Phoenix Park (along with a small area between the Park and the River Liffey), and Chapelizod Village which, although on the Northside, are parts of the Dublin 8 and Dublin 20 postal districts respectively.

The numbering system is not used for some areas in County Dublin, such as Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Lucan or Swords, though it is used for other county locations, for example Firhouse, Foxrock, Sandyford, Knocklyon and Tallaght.

== Dublin 1 (D1) ==

Dublin 1 includes most of the city centre north of the River Liffey, including Abbey Street, Amiens Street, Capel Street, Dorset Street, Henry Street and Mary Street, Mountjoy Square, Marlborough Street, North Wall, O&#x27;Connell Street, Parnell Square, and Talbot Street. This area include the General Post Office, from which distances are measured.

== Dublin 2 (D2) ==

Dublin 2 encompasses most of the city centre south of the River Liffey and takes in areas around Merrion Square, Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, St Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dame Street, and Leeson Street. Dublin 2 also covers the Grand Canal Dock and the City Quay areas. Dublin 2 is the location of a number of government departments and addresses such as Leinster House, Government Buildings, and the Mansion House. The borders of Dublin 2 are the Liffey in the north, the Grand Canal to the south and east and Aungier, Wexford and Camden Streets to the west.

== Dublin 3 (D3) ==
Dublin 3 encompasses areas such as Ballybough, North Strand, Clonliffe, Clontarf, Dollymount, East Wall (including East Point), Fairview, most of Killester, and Marino.

== Dublin 4 (D4) ==

Dublin 4 includes Ballsbridge, Belfield, Donnybrook, Irishtown, Merrion, Pembroke, Ringsend and Sandymount and contains the RDS grounds, Aviva Stadium (formerly Lansdowne Road stadium), and many embassies. Long considered the city&#x27;s wealthiest postcode, &quot;Dublin 4&quot; has acquired its own socio-economic identity.

== Dublin 5 (D5) ==
Dublin 5 includes most of Artane, central Coolock, Harmonstown, Kilbarrack, Killester, and Raheny.

== Dublin 6 (D6) ==
Dublin 6 includes Milltown, Ranelagh, parts of Terenure, Rathmines (including Dartry), and Rathgar.

== Dublin 6 West (D6W) ==

Dublin 6 West includes Harold&#x27;s Cross, Templeogue, Kimmage and Terenure.

== Dublin 7 (D7) ==
Dublin 7 includes Arbour Hill, some parts of Ashtown, Broadstone, Cabra, Grangegorman, Oxmantown, Phibsborough, Smithfield, Stoneybatter.

== Dublin 8 (D8) ==
Dublin 8 includes Dolphin&#x27;s Barn, Inchicore, Islandbridge, Kilmainham, Merchants Quay, Portobello, South Circular Road, the Phoenix Park and the Liberties. Notable buildings include Christ Church Cathedral and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. It is one of only two postal districts to span the Liffey.

== Dublin 9 (D9) ==
Dublin 9 includes parts of Ballymun east of Ballymun Road (Shangan and Coultry), Beaumont, Donnycarney, Drumcondra, Elm Mount, Griffith Avenue, parts of Glasnevin (St Mobhi, Botanic Gardens and Met Éireann), Santry, and Whitehall.

== Dublin 10 (D10) ==
Dublin 10 includes Ballyfermot, Sarsfield Road, and Cherry Orchard.

== Dublin 11 (D11) ==
Dublin 11 includes most of Ballymun west of Ballymun Road (Sillogue, Balcurris, Balbutcher, Poppintree, Sandyhill and Wadelai), Dubber Cross, Finglas (including Ballygall and Cappagh), most of Glasnevin (Cremore, Addison, Violet Hill, Willow Park, Finglas Road, Old Finglas Road and Glasnevin Cemetery), Kilshane Cross, The Ward and Coolquay.

== Dublin 12 (D12) ==
Dublin 12 includes Bluebell, Crumlin, parts of Terenure, Kimmage, Drimnagh, Greenhills, Perrystown and Walkinstown.

== Dublin 13 (D13) ==
Dublin 13 includes Baldoyle, Bayside, Donaghmede, Clongriffin, Sutton, Howth and Ayrfield.
== Dublin 14 (D14) ==
Dublin 14 includes Churchtown, Clonskeagh, most of Dundrum, Goatstown, lower Rathfarnham and Windy Arbour.

== Dublin 15 (D15) ==
Dublin 15 includes Ashtown, Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Coolmine, Clonsilla, Corduff, Mulhuddart, Tyrrelstown, and Ongar. While the town of Clonee is located in Dublin&#x27;s neighbouring County Meath, for mailing purposes it is designated as D15. This leads to a mailing quirk whereby the town&#x27;s addresses could be verbalised as ending with, &quot;County Meath, Dublin 15&quot;.

== Dublin 16 (D16) ==
Dublin 16 includes Ballinteer, Ballyboden, parts of Dundrum, Kilmashogue, Knocklyon, upper Rathfarnham and Rockbrook.

== Dublin 17 (D17) ==
Dublin 17 includes Balgriffin, most of Coolock, and Belcamp, Darndale, Priorswood and Riverside.

== Dublin 18 (D18) ==
Dublin 18 includes Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood, Foxrock, Loughlinstown, Kilternan, Sandyford, Shankill, Ticknock, Ballyedmonduff, Stepaside, and Leopardstown. 

== Dublin 20 (D20) ==
Dublin 20 includes Chapelizod, and Palmerstown. This is one of only two postal districts to span the Liffey.

== Dublin 22 (D22) ==
Dublin 22 includes Clondalkin, Lucan (Partially), Liffey Valley, Newcastle and Neilstown.

== Dublin 24 (D24) ==
Dublin 24 includes Firhouse, Jobstown, Old Bawn, Tallaght, and parts of Ballymount.

== County Dublin (A41–K78) ==

These areas do not fall inside the historic Dublin postal districts and their postal routing keys came about through the new Eircode system. This is because many of these suburbs and towns fell outside the purview of Dublin city in the past. Today, they form part of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;K&quot; Dublin Eircode areas. There are 12 of these districts in total. Notable locales include Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Malahide, Swords, Lucan, Rush and Balbriggan. While a small part of Bray lies in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, for mailing purposes, the entirety of Bray is in County Wicklow&#x27;s A98 routing area.

==Later developments==

Successive Ministers for Communications since 2005 announced plans to introduce a full postcode system across the state.

On 8 October 2013, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte announced a postcode system for the entire country. This came into effect during 2015 and gave an individual post code to every address in Ireland. The pre-existing Dublin district numbers are a component of the full postcode for relevant addresses, forming part of the routing code, the first three characters of the code. For example, a code for an address in Dublin 1 would start with D01, followed by four characters, hence Dublin D01 B2CD.

==Marketing==
The districts are sometimes used in a manner similar to the sub-districts of the London postal district whereby they replace a placename. A property might be described as being &quot;in D4&quot;, for example. This public awareness of Dublin postal districts allows occasional use in marketing. Dublin &quot;n&quot; is usually abbreviated to D&quot;n&quot;, with examples including the &quot;D7 Restaurant&quot;, &quot;Dtwo&quot; nightclub, or &quot;D4 Hotels&quot;.

<text>Choy sum (also spelled choi sum, choi sam in Cantonese; cai xin, caixin in Standard Mandarin) is a leafy vegetable commonly used in Chinese cuisine. It is a member of the genus &quot;Brassica&quot; of the mustard family, Brassicaceae (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot; var. &quot;parachinensis&quot; or &quot;Brassica chinensis&quot; var. &quot;parachinensis&quot;). Choy sum is a transliteration of the Cantonese name (), which can be literally translated as &quot;heart of the vegetable&quot;. Choy sum is also called yu choy (you cai in Standard Mandarin; Chinese: 油菜). It is also known as Chinese flowering cabbage.

==Description==
Choy sum is a green leafy vegetable similar to gai lan, and can be characterized by the distinct yellow flowers which it bears. Each flower has four yellow, oval to round petals with six stamens on fleshy, erect stems which are in diameter and tall with light to dark green, and are oval (becomes acuminate shaped, or basal-shaped near the flowering stage) with slightly serrated margins leaves, which never forms compact heads like the cabbage. Fruits can develop out of cross-pollination or self-pollination, and are silique structured, that open at maturity through dehiscence or drying to bare open to brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. A single pod can bear 4 to 46 seeds.

The height of the plant varies greatly, ranging from depending on the growing conditions and the variety. Flowering usually appears when there are about 7 to 8 leaves on the plant or about tall. The bulk of the root system is found within a depth of and is confined to a radius of .

The whole plant is overall an annual, herbaceous plant, rarely perennial, rarely growing into subshrubs. The whole plant consists of a simple or branched (when it is near the flowering stage), leafy structure. It grows best in soil with a minimum pH level of 5.6, maximum pH level of 7.5.

== Use == 
Choy sum is highly valued as a vegetable in China and Japan. It is commonly consumed in soup, blanched, or stir-fried.

<text>A horse opera, hoss opera, oat opera or oater is a Western film or television series that is clichéd or formulaic, in the manner of a (later) soap opera or space opera.

The term, which was originally coined by silent film-era Western star William S. Hart, is used variously to convey either disparagement or affection. The term &quot;horse opera&quot; is quite loosely defined; it does not specify a distinct sub-genre of the Western (as &quot;space opera&quot; does with regard to the science fiction genre).

<text>Overdrawn at the Memory Bank is a 1984 science fiction television film starring Raul Julia and Linda Griffiths. Based on the 1976 John Varley short story of the same name from the Eight Worlds series, the film takes place in a dystopian future where an employee at a conglomerate gets trapped inside the company&#x27;s computer and ends up affecting the real world. It was co-produced by Canada&#x27;s RSL Films, Ltd in Toronto and New York television station WNET. Because of its limited budget, the motion picture was shot on videotape instead of film and was pre-sold to small American cable companies.

It premiered on CBC Television in 1984 and was later broadcast on &quot;American Playhouse&quot; in 1985. The film received a mixed reception from critics. &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; was featured in the eighth season finale episode of the comedy television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1997.

==Plot==
In a future dystopia, Aram Fingal, a programmer working for the conglomerate Novicorp, is caught watching &quot;Casablanca&quot; at his workstation. As a consequence, the company assigns him mandatory prophylactic rehabilitation, where subjects are &quot;doppeled&quot; into wild animals to experience relaxation. Aram is sent into a baboon where he is monitored by controller Apollonia James. Aram begins to enjoy the experience until he is threatened by an elephant shaking the tree he is perched on. He activates an escape clause that is supposed to return his mind to his real body. However, during his doppel preparation, the routing tag on Aram&#x27;s body was misplaced. When no one can locate his body, Aram&#x27;s mind must be kept active by storing it in Novicorp&#x27;s central computer, the HX368, which controls everything from finances to the weather. His mind can only be maintained in the computer for a limited time before it is destroyed.

Aram&#x27;s disappearance is reported to a rival corporation. The news is broadcast worldwide, causing Novicorp&#x27;s share price to crash. Majority shareholders force Novicorp&#x27;s chairman to divert resources to keep Aram alive and find his body. Apollonia is assigned to locate his mind and keep him from hacking into Novicorp&#x27;s mainframe. With Apollonia&#x27;s help, Aram creates a virtual world where he encounters characters from &quot;Casablanca&quot;, including a version of Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s character, Rick. However, Aram quickly grows bored, and eventually plots a way to bring down Novicorp&#x27;s finances without being removed and killed. Apollonia tries to keep him out of trouble, even placing herself in opposition to Novicorp&#x27;s leaders. She eventually, despite the conflict of interest, falls in love with Aram.

With Apollonia&#x27;s help, Aram is finally able to &quot;interface&quot; with the mainframe and defeat his antagonists. He also returns to his body, which is discovered just before undergoing a sex change operation. Finally corporeal and reunited with his accomplice, Aram has taken complete control of the HX368. After ordering bonuses and stocks for every employee, committing Novicorp&#x27;s chairman to a month of &quot;compulsory rehab&quot; via doppeling, and changing both his and Apollonia&#x27;s identities to those of Rick and Ilsa from &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Aram vows to fight the dystopian government. The film ends with the new couple walking out the door and, now free from Novicorp&#x27;s oppression, talking about opening a club on the other side of town: Rick&#x27;s Place.

==Production and release==
&quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; was co-produced by New York television station WNET and Toronto-based production company RSL Films, Ltd. It was shot at Magder Studios and on-location in Toronto from August 20 to September 12, 1983. Co-producer Robert Lantos said that the film&#x27;s budget &quot;exceeded well into seven figures&quot;. To cover some of the costs, it was pre-sold to small American cable companies. The film was shot on videotape, with Lantos claiming that if it had been shot on photographic film, it would have been as expensive as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Douglas Williams directed the film and Corinne Jacker wrote the film treatment.

The film premiered on CBC Television on September 22, 1984, later being shown on PBS″s anthology series &quot;American Playhouse&quot; on February 4, 1985. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in June 1990. The film was released on VHS by New World Video and LaserDisc by Image Entertainment.

==Reception and legacy==
Tom Brinkmoeller for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; called &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; a &quot;tongue-in-cheek and imaginative 90-minute delight&quot;. &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, acknowledging the low production values, praised the film for its ideas and the strong romantic relationship between Julia&#x27;s and Griffiths&#x27; characters. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Sandy Rovner described the film as &quot;certainly inoffensive, occasionally funny and altogether watchable&quot;. Jim Murphy from &quot;The Age&quot; considered the plot to be &quot;quite tortuous&quot; but thought it to be imaginative enough to sustain interest. In his book &quot;The Sci-Fi Movie Guide&quot;, Chris Barsanti found &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; to be one of the better film translations of cyberpunk, despite being one of the least known. Barsanti also called the film a &quot;fun lark&quot; despite its confusing ending. In a negative review for &quot;Cinema Canada&quot;, Bruce Malloch remarked that, had it been released as a feature film rather than a direct-to-TV film, it would have been a failure. Malloch was critical of the film&#x27;s plot and special effects, as well as its attempts to balance both drama and comedy.

===&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;===
&quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; was featured in the eighth-season finale episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;), a comedy television series in which the character Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are forced to watch bad films as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel on December 6, 1997. &quot;MST3K&quot; cast member Bill Corbett disliked the film, calling it an &quot;extraordinarily dumb movie whose relentless &#x27;funny&#x27; techno-futuro-jargon was the screenwriting equivalent of water torture.&quot; Raul Julia had recently died, and the writers were wary of damaging his reputation. Fellow cast member and writer Paul Chaplin voiced his hatred towards &quot;Overdrawn&quot;, equating his disdain with later &quot;experiment&quot; &quot;Hobgoblins&quot;.

The episode was considered one of the best episodes in the series, both by critics and by fans of the show. Jim Vorel for &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it as the 40th best in the series, saying the film was ahead of its time and giving praise for the acting. Vorel was irritated by its soft focus appearance but overall considered it to be one of the most interesting films featured on &quot;MST3K&quot;. In a fan poll for the top 100 best episodes in the series, it ranked eleventh. Elliott Kalan, the head writer for the Netflix era of the series, considered it one of his favorite episodes in the series. In 2003, Rhino Entertainment released the &quot;MST3K&quot; episode as part of the &quot;Volume 4&quot; DVD collection, along with episodes focused on &quot;Girl in Gold Boots&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Space Mutiny&quot;.

<doc id="961757" wikidata="Q1376605" url="?curid=961757" title="Uesugi Kagekatsu">
<text>was a Japanese samurai &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Sengoku and Edo periods. He was the adopted son of Uesugi Kenshin and Uesugi Kagetora’s brother in law.

==Early life and rise==

Kagekatsu was the son of Nagao Masakage, the head of the Ueda Nagao clan and husband of Uesugi Kenshin&#x27;s elder sister, Aya-Gozen. After his father died, he was adopted by Kenshin. His childhood name was Unomatsu.

In 1577, he participated in Battle of Tedorigawa.
Upon Kenshin&#x27;s death in 1578, Kagekatsu battled Kenshin&#x27;s other adopted son Uesugi Kagetora for the inheritance, defeating Kagetora in the 1578 Siege of Otate.

In 1579, he forced Kagetora to commit suicide, and became head of the Uesugi clan. Kagekatsu married Takeda Katsuyori&#x27;s sister (Takeda Shingen&#x27;s daughter) after the Siege of Otate.

==Conflict with Oda==
By 1579, Kagekatsu had gained the upper hand and forced Kagetora to commit suicide. This bloody division allowed Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s generals (headed by Shibata Katsuie) to conquer the Uesugi&#x27;s lands in Kaga, Noto, and Etchu.

In 1582, Kagekatsu led an army into Etchu and was defeated by Oda forces at the Battle of Tenjinyama. He hastily returned to Echigo when he learned that Oda general Mori Nagayoshi had raided Echigo in his absence.

When Oda forces under Shibata Katsuie and Sassa Narimasa laid siege to Uozu castle in Etchu, in the course of which a number of important Uesugi retainers were killed, Kagekatsu&#x27;s fortunes appeared bleak. 
Kagekatsu sent a letter to Satake Yoshishige, his allies. It was like a suicide note.
:&quot;Please don&#x27;t worry about us.&quot;
:&quot;I was born in a good era. We will fight against over 60 provinces of Japan with only this Echigo province.&quot;
:&quot;If we survive, I&#x27;ll become an unmatched hero. Even if we are destroyed, my name will go down in history.&quot;

Uozu castle fell on June 3, 1582, and Oda Nobunaga would die eighteen days later, in Kyoto.
The Uesugi were given a reprieve with the death of Nobunaga shortly afterwards.

==Service under Hideyoshi==

Kagekatsu made friendly overtures to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and attacked Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s northern outposts during the Shizugatake Campaign (1583) and went on to support Hideyoshi during the Komaki Campaign (1584), in which he played a limited role by launching a foray into Shinano.

As a general under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Kagekatsu took part in the Odawara campaign 1590 under Maeda Toshiie, and rise to prominence to become a member of the Council of Five Elders. Originally holding a 550,000 &quot;koku&quot; fief in Echigo Province, Kagekatsu received the fief of Aizu, worth a huge 1.2 million &quot;koku&quot; when Hideyoshi redistributed holdings in 1598. After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, that year, Kagekatsu then allied himself with Ishida Mitsunari, against Tokugawa Ieyasu, as the result of some political dispute.

==Sekigahara Campaign==
The Sekigahara Campaign 1600 can be said to have begun, at least in part, with Kagekatsu, who was the first &quot;daimyō&quot; to openly defy the Tokugawa clan. He built a new castle in Aizu, attracting the attention of Ieyasu, who demanded that he explain his conduct at the capital. Kagekatsu refused, and Tokugawa began plans to lead a 50,000 man army north against him. Ishida and Uesugi hoped to occupy Tokugawa Ieyasu with this fighting in the north, distracting him from Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s attacks in the west. Anticipating this, Ieyasu remained to engage Mitsunari; his generals Mogami Yoshiaki and Date Masamune would fight Kagekatsu in Tōhoku (northern region Honshū, Japan&#x27;s main island). Kagekatsu had intended to move his force south, attacking the Tokugawa from the north-east while Ishida attacked from the west, but he was defeated very early in the campaign, at his castle in the Siege of Shiroishi and later in the end of campaign at Siege of Hasedo.

==Service under Tokugawa==
Declaring his allegiance to Tokugawa following his defeat in the Sekigahara campaign, Kagekatsu became a &quot;tozama&quot; (outsider) &quot;daimyō&quot;; he was given the Yonezawa han, worth 300,000 &quot;koku&quot;, in the Tōhoku region. Kagekatsu fought for the Tokugawa shogunate against the Toyotomi clan in the Osaka Campaign 1614–1615.

==Death==
On March 20, 1623, Kagekatsu died in Yonezawa. He was 67–69 years old. He was succeeded by Uesugi Sadakatsu, his illegitimate son.

Kagekatsu&#x27;s remains were laid at Shojoshin-in Temple at Mount Kōya, Koya city, while his ashes and court dress and kabuto were kept at the mausoleum of the Uesugi family located in Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture.

==Yamatorige sword==
, equally known as Sanchōmō by its Sino-Japanese reading, is a &quot;tachi&quot; (Japanese greatsword) forged during the middle Kamakura period (13th century). The set of the blade and its &quot;koshirae&quot; (mountings) is a National Treasure of Japan. It was wielded by Uesugi Kagekatsu, and had been inherited by his clan.

<text>The eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi) is a species of large, non-venomous snake in the family Colubridae. Native to the southeastern United States, it is the longest native snake species in the country.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
===Taxonomy===
The eastern indigo snake was first described by John Edwards Holbrook in 1842. For many years the genus &quot;Drymarchon&quot; was considered monotypic with one species, &quot;Drymarchon corais&quot;, with 12 subspecies, until the early 1990s when &quot;Drymarchon corais couperi&quot; was elevated to full species status according to the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, in their official names list.

===Etymology===
The generic name, &quot;Drymarchon&quot;, roughly translates to &quot;lord of the forest&quot;. It is composed of the Greek words &quot;drymos&quot; (Δρυμός), meaning &quot;forest&quot;, and &quot;archon&quot; (ἄρχων), meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;.

The specific name is a latinization of the surname of American planter James Hamilton Couper (1794–1866). Couper brought Holbrook the type specimen from south of the Altamaha River in Wayne County, Georgia.

===Common names===
The eastern indigo snake has a number of common names including indigo snake, blue indigo snake, black snake, blue gopher snake, and blue bull snake.

==Description==
The eastern indigo snake has uniform blue-black dorsal scales, with some specimens having a reddish-orange to tan color on the throat, cheeks, and chin. This snake received its common name from the glossy iridescent dorsal and ventral scales which can be seen as blackish-purple in bright light. This smooth-scaled snake is considered to be the longest native snake species in the United States. The longest recorded specimen measured in total length (including tail). Unlike many snakes, mature male indigo snakes are slightly larger than females. This is thought to be due to intraspecies competition and combat with the males. A typical mature male measures in total length, with a reported average of , and weighs , reportedly averaging . Meanwhile, a mature female typically measures around in total length, averaging , and weighs , averaging . Specimens over can weigh up to . Although the eastern indigo snake is similar in average body mass, extremely large specimens of the bulky, sympatric venomous eastern diamondback rattlesnake can outweigh it.

==Distribution==
The eastern indigo snake inhabits areas from far southwestern South Carolina through Florida, and west to southern Alabama and southeastern Mississippi. Their historic range extended into Louisiana. A related species, the Texas indigo snake &quot;(Drymarchon melanurus erebennus)&quot;, is found in southern Texas and Mexico.
==Conservation status==
Because of habitat loss, the eastern indigo snake is listed as a federally threatened species in Georgia and Florida. In 2012 the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources had listed the species as possibly extirpated within the state. A reintroduction program has shown initial signs of success, with an individual sighted in March 2022.

The eastern indigo snake was largely eliminated from northern Florida due to habitat loss and fragmentation. A restoration program is currently underway at Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve (ABRP) in northern Florida. The eastern indigo snake was last observed at ABRP in 1982, until 2017 when 12 snakes were released as part of the program. Twenty more snakes were released in 2018, and another 15 (10 female and 5 male) in 2019. The 10-year program is a collaborative effort between the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and private partners.

NatureServe considers the species to be &quot;Vulnerable&quot;.

Another issue the eastern indigo snake is facing would be dealing with infections due to the snake fungal disease (&quot;Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola)&quot;. This fungus infects the dermal layer of snake skin, causing a variety of lesions that commonly manifest on the head and near the vent.

==Preferred habitat==
The eastern indigo snake frequents flatwoods, hammocks, dry glades, stream bottoms, cane fields, riparian thickets, and high ground with well-drained, sandy soils. In Georgia, the eastern indigo snake prefers excessively drained, deep sandy soils along major streams, as well as xeric sandridge habitats. In the northern parts range is restricted to sandhills and require Gopher Tortoise burrows during colder seasons Xeric slash pine plantations seem to be preferred over undisturbed longleaf pine habitats. Habitat selection varies seasonally. From December to April, eastern indigo snakes prefer sandhill habitats; from May to July the snakes shift from winter dens to summer territories; from August through November they are located more frequently in shady creek bottoms than during other seasons. In a study in Georgia, winter sightings generally occurred on sandhills, in association with gopher tortoise (&quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot;) burrows. These burrows can be used as cover from predators, fires, or extreme temperatures that may come through the area.

The eastern indigo snake is most abundant in the sandhill plant communities of Florida and Georgia. These communities are primarily scrub oak-longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) with occasional live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;), laurel oak (&quot;Q. laurifolia&quot;), Chapman&#x27;s oak (&quot;Q. chapmanii&quot;), and myrtle oak (&quot;Q. myrtifolia&quot;). Other communities include longleaf pine-turkey oak (&quot;Q. laevis&quot;), slash pine-scrub oak (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;), pine flatwoods, and pine-mesic hardwoods.

==Cover requirements==
Because the cover requirements of eastern indigo snakes change seasonally, maintaining corridors that link the different habitats used is important. From the spring through fall snakes must be able to travel from sandhill communities and upland pine-hardwood communities to creek bottoms and agricultural fields. In winter, indigo snakes den in gopher tortoise burrows, which are usually found in open pine forests with dense herbaceous understories. Burrows need to be in areas where there is no flooding. Eastern indigo snakes heavily use debris piles left from site-preparation operations on tree plantations. These piles are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons but should be left intact because they provide important hiding cover for both the snake and its prey. Summer home ranges for the indigo snake can be as large as .

==Food habits and behavior==
The eastern indigo snake is carnivorous, like all snakes, and will eat any other small animal it can overpower. It has been known to kill some of its prey by pressing the prey against nearby burrow walls. Captive specimens are frequently fed dead items to prevent injury to the snake from this violent method of subduing its prey. Chemosensory studies with mice (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) have shown that &quot;D. couperi&quot; responds with significantly elevated rates of tongue
flicking and investigation towards visual cues of prey, and not volatile chemical cues. Its diet has been known to include other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous ones, as it is immune to the venom of the North American rattlesnakes. The eastern indigo snake also eats turtles, lizards, frogs, toads, fish, a variety of small birds and mammals, and eggs.

As defensive behavior the eastern indigo snake vertically flattens its neck, hisses, and vibrates its tail. If picked up, it seldom bites.

It often will cohabit with gopher tortoises in their burrows, although it will settle for armadillo holes, hollow logs, and debris piles when gopher tortoise burrows can&#x27;t be found. Hunters, hoping to flush out rattlesnakes, often wind up accidentally killing indigo snakes when they illegally pour gasoline into the burrows of gopher tortoises (a practice referred to as &quot;gassing&quot;), even though the tortoises themselves are endangered and protected.

==Predators==
As an apex predator, indigo snakes have no natural predators. Instead, humans represent the biggest threat to the eastern indigo snake. Highway fatalities, wanton killings, and overcollection for the pet trade adversely affect indigo snake populations. Snakes are taken illegally from the wild for the pet trade. Eastern indigo snakes are sometimes &quot;gassed&quot; in their burrows by rattlesnake hunters. Along with infrastructure and pet trade, indigo snake populations are drastically declining due to habitat fragmentation. The eastern indigo snake&#x27;s decline is correlated with the gopher tortoise decline as well since they utilize their burrows for brumation.

==Reproduction==
The eastern indigo snake is oviparous. The eggs are long by wide. Females will lay a single clutch of 4-14 eggs from late April through early June. The hatchlings are long. Eastern indigo snakes are often referred to as late maturing colubrids; they usually do not reach maturity until they are 3 to 5 years old and around 5 to 6 feet in length. Female eastern indigo snakes have the ability to retain live sperm for long periods, potentially over 4 years. Thus, females are able to choose when to release the sperm to fertilize the eggs. Mating season is at a peak from November to January but can occur from October through March.

===Captivity and care===
Due to its generally docile nature and appearance, some people find the eastern indigo snake to be a desirable pet, although its protected status can make owning one, depending on location, illegal without a permit. Only a few states require permits to own an eastern indigo snake, but a federal permit is required to buy one from out of state anywhere in the US. The permit costs $100; information about obtaining one can be found by doing a web search. Most states allow unrestricted in-state sales. To thrive in captivity, this snake requires a larger enclosure than most species do, preferably with something to climb on.

One notable owner of a pet eastern indigo snake was gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson during the time he wrote his &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; book. One evening, about 1966, he left his snake - with a mouse to eat - in a cardboard box in the Random House editor&#x27;s office, but the mouse gnawed through the box and both animals escaped. The snake was subsequently beaten to death by the night watchman, which still caused Thompson great anguish several years later, and was his justification for sending his - often excessive - room service bills to Random House.

<text>The first USS &quot;Maury&quot; (DD-100) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and the years following. She was named in honor of Matthew Fontaine Maury.

==History==
&quot;Maury&quot; was laid down on 4 May 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Miss Anna Hamlin. The destroyer was commissioned on 23 September 1918, Lieutenant Commander John H. Newton in command.

&quot;Maury&quot;, having completed a United States East Coast shakedown cruise, departed New York City on 12 November 1918 to escort a convoy bound for France. Detached off the Azores, she proceeded to Gibraltar, arriving on 26 November. She cruised in the western Mediterranean Sea until reporting for duty with the Adriatic Detachment at Venice on 18 February 1919. With that squadron for the next five months, she participated in their “umpiring” duties as first Rear Admiral Albert Niblack and then Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews sought to employ their influence in the political rivalry for the natural harbors of the Adriatic Sea. Primary contenders for this area, particularly Trieste, were Italy and the newly created state of Yugoslavia, itself fraught with internal nationalistic dissension. Secondary postwar problems connected with this duty involved clearing the Adriatic of the multitude of mines which broke away with winds and presented a menace to shipping; distribution of food to the hunger-stricken Balkans; and providing for the ever-growing numbers of refugees.

&quot;Maury&quot; returned to New York on 25 July and three months later steamed to Philadelphia where she remained, undergoing , until 24 April 1920. On 17 July she was redesignated DM-5, light minelayer, and after another lengthy stay at Philadelphia reported to Mine Squadron I at Gloucester, Massachusetts, on 23 July 1921. For the next seven years she cruised the waters off the United States East Coast, deploying each winter to join in fleet problems which, with one exception, 1925, took her to the Caribbean Sea. In 1925 she sailed to the Pacific Ocean for a problem involving protective screening, seizing, and occupying of an unfortified anchorage in the vicinity of enemy territory and fueling at sea.

After a winter deployment in waters off Cuba in 1929, &quot;Maury&quot; spent the summer in the Gulf of Mexico and in September returned to the United States East Coast. On 30 September 1929 she moored at Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 19 March 1930. Struck from the Naval Register on 22 October 1930, she was sold 17 January 1931 to Boston Iron &amp; Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and was scrapped on 1 May 1934.

<doc id="961776" wikidata="Q313298" url="?curid=961776" title="Suryavarman II">
<text>Suryavarman II (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ), posthumously named Paramavishnuloka, was the ruler of the Khmer Empire from 1113 until his death in 1150. He is most famously known as the builder of Angkor Wat, the largest Hindu temple in the world, which he dedicated to Vishnu. His reign&#x27;s monumental architecture, numerous military campaigns and restoration of strong government have led historians to rank Suryavarman II as one of the empire&#x27;s greatest rulers.

==Early years==
Suryavarman appears to have grown up in a provincial estate in 1094 or 1098, at a time of weakening central control in the empire. An inscription lists his father as Ksitindraditya and his mother as Narendralakshmi. As a young prince, he maneuvered for power, contending he had a legitimate claim to the throne. “At the end of his studies,” states an inscription, “he approved the desire of the royal dignity of his family.” He appears to have dealt with a rival claimant from the line of Harshavarman III, probably Nripatindravarman, who held sway in the south, then to have turned on the elderly and largely ineffectual king Dharanindravarman I, his great uncle. “Leaving on the field of combat the ocean of his armies, he delivered a terrible battle,” states an inscription. “Bounding on the head of the elephant of the enemy king, he killed him, as Garuda on the edge of a mountain would kill a serpent.” Scholars have disagreed on whether this language refers to the death of the southern claimant or of King Dharanindravarman. Suryavarman II also sent a mission to the Chola dynasty of south India and presented a precious stone to the Chola Emperor Kulothunga Chola I in 1114 CE.

Suryavarman was enthroned in 1113 AD. An aged Brahmin sage named Divakarapandita oversaw the ceremonies, this being the third time the priest had officiated a coronation. Inscriptions record that the new monarch studied sacred rituals, celebrated religious festivals and gave gifts to the priest such as palanquins, fans, crowns, buckets and rings. The priest embarked on a lengthy tour of temples in the empire, including the mountaintop Preah Vihear, which he provided with a golden statue of dancing Shiva. The king’s formal coronation took place in 1119 AD, with Divakarapandita again performing the rites.

The first two syllables in the monarch&#x27;s name are a Sanskrit language root meaning &quot;sun&quot;. &quot;Varman&quot; is the traditional suffix of the Pallava dynasty that is generally translated as &quot;shield&quot; or &quot;protector&quot;, and was adopted by Khmer royal lineages.

==Life and reign==
Dvaravati began to come under the influence of the Khmer Empire and central-southeast Asia was ultimately invaded by King Suryavarman II in the first half of the 12th century.

During his decades in power, the king reunited the empire. Vassals paid him tribute. He staged large military operations in the east against the Chams, but these were largely unsuccessful. Inscriptions in the neighboring Indianized state of Champa and accounts left by writers in Đại Việt (Dai Viet), a Vietnamese precursor state, say that Suryavarman II staged 3 major but unsuccessful attacks in Nghệ An province and Quảng Bình province, sometimes with the support of Champa. In 1128, he is said to have led 20,000 soldiers against Dai Viet, but was defeated and chased out. The next year he sent a fleet of more than 700 vessels to attack its coast. In 1132, combined Khmer and Cham forces again invaded Dai Viet, with a final attempt in 1137, to no real success. Later, the Cham king Jaya Indravarman III made peace with Lý king of Dai Viet and refused to support further attacks. In 1145 AD, Suryavarman II appears to have invaded Champa, defeated its king Jaya Indravarman III, and sacked the capital Vijaya with the help of Kulothunga Chola II. On the Cham throne he placed a new king, Harideva, said to be the younger brother of the Khmer ruler&#x27;s wife. In subsequent fighting, Cham forces under Jaya Harivarman I recaptured the capital and killed Harideva. A final expedition in 1150 ended in a disastrous withdrawal.

According to Vietnamese history books, Khmer planned to invade Dai Viet one more time in 1150. But while Khmer troops gathered in Nghe An (in southern Dai Viet), they faced widespread diseases and pandemics, and so retreated just before the invasion.

In addition to war, Suryavarman practiced diplomacy, resuming formal relations with China in 1116 AD. A Chinese account of the 13th century says that the Khmer embassy had 14 members, who after reaching Chinese soil were given special court garments. “Scarcely have we arrived to contemplate anear your glory than we are already filled with your benefits,” one of the ambassadors is quoted as telling the Chinese emperor. The embassy went home the following year. Another embassy visited in 1120; in 1128, the emperor conferred high dignities on the Khmer ruler, deeming him “great vassal of the empire.” Problems concerning commerce between the two states were examined and regulated.
The king&#x27;s reign saw great innovations in art and architecture and it is believed that the sudden change was due to the presence of Cholas. He presided over the construction of Angkor Wat, the largest temple ever built in the capital, and in many modern minds the ultimate masterpiece of Khmer architecture. Its five central towers evoke the peaks of Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. It was resplendent with more than 1,860 carved apsara, or heavenly nymphs, and hundreds of meters of elaborate bas-reliefs depicting the Hindu legends and scenes from contemporary life. Other temples dating to his reign include Banteay Samre, Thommanon, Chau Say Tevoda, Wat Athvea and, east of the capital, the huge Beng Mealea complex.

Suryavarman married, but no record exists of his wives&#x27; names. Suryavarman II was unusual among Khmer kings in making Vishnu rather than Shiva the focus of court religious life. The reasons for this decision are not known. Scholars have long debated whether his association with Vishnu helps explain why Angkor Wat faces west, the cardinal direction with which Vishnu is associated, rather than east, the more common orientation for Khmer temples.

Suryavarman II was the first Khmer king to be depicted in art. A bas-relief in the south gallery of Angkor Wat shows him seated on an elaborate wooden dais whose legs and railings are carved to resemble naga snakes. On his head is a pointed diadem, and his ears have pendants. He wears anklets, armlets and bracelets. His right hand holds what seems to be a small dead snake; the meaning of this is unclear. His torso curves gracefully, his legs folded beneath him. The general image projected is one of serenity, and comfort with power and position.

His image is part of a unique and detailed portrait of court life in the Angkor period. The scene&#x27;s setting appears to be outside, amidst a forest. Kneeling attendants hold over His Majesty a profusion of fans, fly whisks and parasols that denoted rank. Princesses are carried in elaborately carved palanquins. Whiskered Brahman priests look on, some of them apparently preparing things for a ceremony. To the right of His Majesty, a courtier kneels, apparently presenting something. Advisers look on, kneeling, some with hands over hearts in a gesture of obeisance. To the right we see an elaborate procession, with retainers sounding conches, drums and a gong. An ark bearing the royal fire, symbol of power, is carried on his shoulders.

Further on in the gallery is a display of Suryavarman&#x27;s military might. Commanders with armor and weapons stand atop fierce war elephants, with ranks of foot soldiers below, each holding a spear and shield. One of the commanders is the king himself, looking over his right shoulder, his chest covered with armour, a sharp weapon in his right hand.

==Death and succession==
Inscriptional evidence suggests that Suryavarman II died between 1150, possibly during a military campaign against Champa; before that, his troops were defeated by Vietnamese troops led by Tô Hiến Thành. Some sources said he died around 1150 in Angkor due to the fact that the records of Suryavarman II stopped around that year. He was succeeded by his cousin Dharanindravarman II. A period of weak rule and feuding began.

Suryavarman was given the posthumous name Paramavishnuloka, &quot;He Who Has Entered the Heavenly World of Vishnu&quot;. Angkor Wat appears to have been completed only after his death.

A modern sculpture that adapts his court image in the Angkor Wat bas-reliefs today greets visitors arriving at the Siem Reap airport. Parasols shelter this image of the king, as they did the real Suryavarman almost nine centuries ago.

<text>Mermaids is a 1990 American family comedy-drama film directed by Richard Benjamin, and starring Cher, Bob Hoskins, Winona Ryder, Michael Schoeffling, and Christina Ricci in her film debut. Based on Patty Dann&#x27;s 1986 novel of the same name, and set in the early 1960s, its plot follows a neurotic teenage girl who moves with her wayward mother and young sister to a small town in Massachusetts.

Originally planned as the English-language debut of Swedish director Lasse Hallström, the film was ultimately directed by Benjamin after both Hallström and Frank Oz abandoned the project. Filming of &quot;Mermaids&quot; took place in various locations in Massachusetts in the fall of 1989.

Released in December 1990, &quot;Mermaids&quot; was met with critical acclaim, particularly for the performance of Ryder, who received a Golden Globe Award nomination and a National Board of Review Award. Ricci also won a Young Artist Award for her performance.

==Plot==
In 1963 Oklahoma, Charlotte Flax is a 15-year-old whose carefree 31-year-old single mother, Rachel, relocates Charlotte and her 9-year-old half-sister, Kate, each time she ends a relationship. Rachel&#x27;s parenting approach – which more resembles friendship than mothering – troubles the anxiety-ridden Charlotte, who is embarrassed by her mother&#x27;s flamboyant nature.

After ending an affair with her married employer, Rachel and her daughters move to the small town of Eastport, Massachusetts where she also gets a job as a receptionist for a lawyer. Charlotte is ecstatic about their new home&#x27;s location, as it borders a convent, as she is obsessed with Catholicism, to the annoyance of her irreligious Jewish mother.

Charlotte soon becomes enamored with Joe Peretti, a 26-year-old caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver. Meanwhile, Rachel meets a local shoe store owner, Lou Landsky, and slowly begins a relationship with him. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Charlotte finds Joe ringing the convent bell and consoles him. However, as they begin to kiss, she feels filled with sin and flees. After the encounter, she begins fasting to purge her sinful thoughts, eventually passing out from hunger.

Uneducated about sex, Charlotte fears that God will punish her with pregnancy via Immaculate Conception, and decides to steal her mother&#x27;s car and run away. She drives all night before stopping at the home of a young family in New Haven, Connecticut, claiming to have suffered car troubles.

The family invites her to have breakfast, but Lou arrives to retrieve Charlotte during the meal, having tracked her after reporting the car stolen. Rachel chastises Charlotte when she returns home, but Charlotte doesn&#x27;t reveal why she ran away. The next day, Charlotte makes an appointment with a local obstetrician under the name Joan Arc. The doctor tells Charlotte it isn&#x27;t possible for her to be pregnant as she is a virgin.

At a New Year&#x27;s Eve costume party, Lou asks Rachel to marry and move in with him, but she declines, reminding him he is still legally married to his wife (who had left him). After the party, Rachel discovers her car will not start and Joe gives her a ride home. Upon arriving home, Rachel gives Joe a kiss, wishing him a happy New Year.

Charlotte observes the kiss and storms outside, accusing her mother of trying to thwart her budding relationship and asking Joe why he would kiss Rachel before he drives off. On New Year&#x27;s Day, with Rachel out for the day with Lou, Charlotte stays home with Kate and dresses up in her mom&#x27;s clothes and makeup. She drinks some wine and offers some to Kate, who drinks a large amount without Charlotte knowing. Charlotte takes Kate to see the convent, and Charlotte—not knowing Kate is drunk—goes to check out the top of the bell tower by herself, leaving Kate behind to collect rocks near the river. Charlotte unexpectedly finds Joe in the tower, and they embrace and start to have sex. An unattended Kate falls in the river and nearly drowns, but the nuns from the convent save her.

While Kate recovers, a crazed and angry Rachel gets into an argument with Charlotte about being irresponsible and threatens to again move them to another town. The argument ends after Rachel slaps Charlotte across the face, and they subsequently have a calm, heartfelt conversation.(&quot;You know... You&#x27;re just one year younger than I was when I gave birth to you.&quot;) Discussing her father, Charlotte realizes he is never coming back. Rachel ultimately agrees to Charlotte&#x27;s plea to stay in Eastport at least one more year.

Over the following year, Rachel and Lou continue their relationship, while Joe relocates to California to open a plant nursery; he and Charlotte keep in contact via postcards. At school, she has gained a new reputation due to her sexual encounter with Joe, and replaces her Catholicism obsession with Greek mythology. Kate has recovered and has returned to competitive swimming, although the accident has left her hearing &quot;sounding fuzzy&quot; sometimes.

The film ends with Rachel, Charlotte, and Kate playfully dancing as they set the dinner table for a family meal, something they had not done in the past.

==Production==
===Development===
Producers initially engaged Swedish director Lasse Hallström to direct &quot;Mermaids&quot; as his English-language feature debut, but he left the project to direct &quot;Once Around&quot; (1991). They subsequently hired Frank Oz as a replacement, but he also abandoned the project after clashing with actresses Cher and Winona Ryder. Ultimately, they hired Richard Benjamin to direct the project.

Producer Patrick Palmer commented that both Hallström and Oz had envisioned a darker tone for the film, and that at one point, Hallström&#x27;s version of the film included Charlotte committing suicide.

===Casting===
Emily Lloyd was originally cast in the role of Charlotte Flax. She had begun shooting the film when Cher complained that Lloyd did not look enough like her to play her daughter. Winona Ryder, who impressed both Cher and then-director Oz in &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988), was subsequently cast in the part. Lloyd sued Orion Pictures Corporation and Mermaid Productions for breach of contract and received US$175,000 in damages, reaching a settlement on the second day of the trial, 30 July 1991.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Mermaids&quot; began September 25, 1989 in Massachusetts, and completed on December 15 of that year. The Flax house exterior was built for the film in Coolidge Point near Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, and downtown Rockport, Massachusetts served as the fictional village of Eastport. In a rural area near North Easton, Massachusetts, the production crew built a bell tower for the convent set as well as a cottage. Some interior photography was completed on a soundstage constructed in a warehouse in Malden, Massachusetts. The majority of the film was shot in Massachusetts, and some additional photography occurred in Rhode Island and New Hampshire.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 72% based on reviews from 25 critics. On Metacritic it has a score of 56% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

Though the film&#x27;s coming-of-age story was seen as a somewhat familiar one, many critics argued the film was elevated by its performances—particularly Ryder&#x27;s—and a script imbued with &quot;a quality of everyday surrealism&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The film&#x27;s comedy springs out of the incongruous pairing of a rebellious, crazy mom and a devoutly conservative daughter—that and the nuttiness of having a Jewish girl obsessed with Catholicism.&quot; Of Ryder, Hinson wrote, &quot;What&#x27;s great about &quot;Mermaids&quot; is how easily it keys us into Charlotte&#x27;s hilariously warped teenage thought-waves…Having made something of a specialty of woe-is-me, adolescent angst, Ryder finds a deeper level here, a level of comedy with something genuinely painful mixed in.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote. &quot;&quot;Mermaids&quot;, adapted by the English writer June Roberts from the novel by Patty Dann, is a terribly gentle if wisecracking comedy about the serious business of growing up.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three out of four stars and wrote: &quot;&quot;Mermaids&quot; is not exactly good, but it is not boring. Winona Ryder, in another of her alienated outsider roles, generates real charisma. And what the movie is saying about Cher is as elusive as it is intriguing.&quot;

In a negative review, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; wrote: &quot;The film is burdened by curious details and observations, and its preoccupation with all things aquatic (little sister is an ace swimmer, Mom dresses up as a mermaid for New Year&#x27;s Eve, etc.) is overworked. Characterization suffers, with Charlotte and Rachel too self-absorbed to engage our sympathies. Crucially, they just aren&#x27;t funny&quot;.

<text>SimLife: The Genetic Playground is a video game produced by Maxis in 1992. The concept of the game is to simulate an ecosystem; players may modify the genetics of the plants and animals that inhabit the virtual world. The point of this game is to experiment and create a self-sustaining ecosystem. &quot;SimLife&quot; was re-released in 1993 as part of the &quot;SimClassics Volume 1&quot; compilation, alongside &quot;SimCity Classic&quot; and &quot;SimAnt&quot; for PC, Mac and Amiga.

==Development==

The producers of &quot;SimLife&quot; refer to it as &quot;The Genetic Playground&quot;. The game allows users to explore the interaction of life-forms and environments. Users can manipulate the genetics of both plants and animals to determine whether these new species could survive in the Earth&#x27;s various environments. Players can also create new worlds with distinctive environments to see how certain species (earth&#x27;s species or their own) fare within them.

&quot;SimLife&quot; gives players the power to:

* Create and modify worlds.
* Create and modify plants and animals at the genetic level. Exclusive animals appearing in this game are the Killer Penguin, the Monkeyphant, and the Orgot.
* Design environments and ecosystems.
* Study genetics in action.
* Simulate and control evolution.
* Change the physics of the universe in your computer.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 praised &quot;SimLife&quot;, stating that &quot;By neatly bridging the gap between entertainment and education, &quot;SL&quot; brings the engrossing science of genetics within reach of any interested person&quot;. 
Games Finder gave &quot;SimLife&quot; a score of 7 out of 10.

In 1993, &quot;SimLife&quot; received a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Simulation.

<doc id="961796" wikidata="Q667733" url="?curid=961796" title="House of Wax (1953 film)">
<text>House of Wax is a 1953 American mystery-horror film directed by Andre de Toth and released by Warner Bros. A remake of the studio&#x27;s own 1933 film, &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot;, it stars Vincent Price as a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated corpses as displays. The film premiered in New York on April 10, 1953, and had a general release on April 25, making it the first 3D film with stereophonic sound to be presented in a regular theater and the first color 3D feature film from a major American studio. &quot;Man in the Dark&quot;, released by Columbia Pictures, was the first major-studio black-and-white 3D feature and premiered two days before &quot;House of Wax&quot;.

In 1971, &quot;House of Wax&quot; was re-released to theaters in 3D with a full advertising campaign. Newly struck prints of the film in Chris Condon&#x27;s single-strip StereoVision 3D format were used for this release. Another major re-release occurred during the 3D revival of the early 1980s. Warner Bros. later released a loose remake of the film in 2005.

The Library of Congress later selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2014, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In New York City during the early 1900s, talented sculptor Professor Henry Jarrod runs a wax museum that features historical figures who have met grisly ends. His business partner, Matthew Burke, wants to end their partnership due to Jarrod&#x27;s refusal to make sensational exhibits, such as those that draw crowds to their competitors. Wealthy art critic Sidney Wallace wants to buy out Burke on his return from Egypt in three months. Impatient, Burke sets the museum on fire for the insurance money. Jarrod attempts to stop Burke, but Burke douses him in kerosene and leaves him to die in the fire.

After Burke receives the insurance money, a disfigured man in a cloak strangles him and stages the murder as a suicide. He murders Burke&#x27;s fiancée, Cathy Gray, but is interrupted by her roommate, Sue Allen, before he can arrange the scene. She runs to her friend Scott Andrews&#x27; home. The murderer steals Cathy&#x27;s body from the morgue.

Wallace meets Jarrod who survived the fire, now in a wheelchair and unable to sculpt with his crippled hands. Jarrod asks Wallace to invest in his new wax museum, featuring statues made by his assistants, deaf mute Igor and alcoholic Leon Averill. He concedes to popular taste by including a chamber of horrors showcasing acts of violence, including Burke&#x27;s apparent suicide.

Attending the opening of the museum with Scott, Sue is troubled by the resemblance of the Joan of Arc figure to Cathy. Jarrod claims he based the figure on newspaper photos of Cathy. He hires Scott as an assistant and asks Sue to model for a Marie Antoinette wax figure, as she resembles his earlier one. Sue tells police Detective Lieutenant Tom Brennan that the Joan of Arc figure shares a distinctive ear piercing with Cathy, which she does not believe would be discernible from a newspaper photo. He agrees to investigate. Sergeant Jim Shane recognizes Averill as Carl Hendricks, wanted for breaking parole. Averill is taken in by Shane who finds a missing attorney&#x27;s pocket watch in his possession.

Sue arrives at the museum after hours to meet Scott, but Jarrod had sent him on an errand when he heard she was coming. She removes the Joan of Arc figure&#x27;s wig, exposing Cathy&#x27;s hair beneath. Jarrod, watching, gets up from his wheelchair, revealing he can walk. Sue strikes him, breaking a wax mask from his disfigured face identifying him as the murderer. She faints and Jarrod heats wax for his Marie Antoinette sculpture.

Scott returns and is subdued by Igor. The police draw the truth out of Averill by withholding alcohol – Jarrod was driven mad by his previous museum&#x27;s destruction and his new wax figures are the wax-coated corpses of his victims. They arrive at the museum just in time to stop Igor decapitating Scott with a guillotine. Jarrod is knocked into the vat of hot wax and killed. Brennan saves Sue before the wax can cover her.

==Production==
Filmed under the working title &quot;The Wax Works&quot;, &quot;House of Wax&quot; was Warner Bros.&#x27; answer to the surprise 3D hit &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, an independent production that premiered in November 1952. Seeing promise in the future of 3D films, Warner Bros. contracted Julian and Milton Gunzburg&#x27;s Natural Vision 3D system, the same one used for &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, and decided to film a remake of their 1933 two-color Technicolor thriller &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot;, which was based on Charles S. Belden&#x27;s three-act play &quot;The Wax Works&quot;. Although the entire newspaper angle of the earlier film was eliminated and &quot;Mystery&quot; was set in the year it was released, whereas &quot;House of Wax&quot; was set in circa 1902, the two films have many similarities in plot and dialogue.

Among the foregrounded uses of 3D in the film were scenes featuring fights, can-can girls, and a paddle ball-wielding barker. In what may be the film&#x27;s cleverest and most startling 3D effect, the shadowy figure of one of the characters seems to spring up out of the theater audience and run into the screen. As director Andre de Toth was blind in one eye, he was unable to experience stereo vision or 3D effects. Vincent Price recalled: &quot;It’s one of the great Hollywood stories. When they wanted a director for [a 3D] film, they hired a man who couldn’t see 3D at all! André de Toth was a very good director, but he may not have been suited to direct a 3D movie. He’d go to the rushes and say &#x27;Why is everybody so excited about this?&#x27; It didn’t mean anything to him. But he made a good picture, a good thriller. He was largely responsible for the success of the picture. The 3D tricks just happened—there weren’t a lot of them. Later on, they threw everything at everybody.&quot; Some modern critics feel de Toth&#x27;s inability to see depth is what makes the film superior since he was more concerned with telling a thrilling story and getting believable performances from the actors than simply tossing things at the camera.

==Release==
The film premiered in Los Angeles at the Paramount Theatre on April 16, 1953. It played at midnight with a number of celebrities in the audience, Broderick Crawford, Gracie Allen, Eddie Cantor, Rock Hudson, Judy Garland, Shelley Winters, and Ginger Rogers among them. Producer Alex Gordon, knowing actor Bela Lugosi was in dire need of cash, arranged for him to stand outside the theater wearing a cape and dark glasses and holding a leash with actor Steve Calvert in a gorilla suit on the end. Lugosi was interviewed by reporter Shirley Thomas, who thoroughly confused the aging star when she asked the prearranged questions out of order, and, embarrassed, he left without attending the screening. Footage of Lugosi in front of the theater appeared in a Pathé Newsreel released in theaters on April 27, 1953.

Topping the box office charts for five weeks and earning an estimated $5.5 million in rentals from the North American box office alone, the film was one of the biggest hits of 1953. It was originally available with a stereophonic three-track magnetic soundtrack to accompany its stereoscopic imagery, though many theaters were not equipped to make use of it and defaulted to the standard monophonic optical soundtrack. Previously, films with stereo sound were only produced to be shown in specialty cinemas, such as the Toldi in Budapest and the Telecinema in London. As of 2013, no copy of the original three-channel stereo soundtrack is known to exist, and only the monophonic soundtrack and a separate sound-effects-only track are believed to have survived, but a new stereo soundtrack has been synthesized from the available source material. The initial 3D screenings of the 88-minute film included an intermission, which was necessary to change the reels because each of the theater&#x27;s two projectors was dedicated to one of the stereoscopic images.

==Reception==
===Initial reception===
Early reviews of the film were mostly mixed to negative. &quot;Variety&quot; was positive, writing: &quot;This picture will knock &#x27;em for a ghoul. Warners&#x27; &quot;House of Wax&quot; is the post-midcentury &quot;Jazz Singer&quot;. What the freres and Al Jolson did to sound, the Warners have repeated in third dimension.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;a first-class thriller of its kind&quot;, and &quot;the best 3-D picture yet made&quot;, though the reviewer felt that &quot;the added value of depth is not significant enough to warrant the annoyance of viewing the proceedings through the polaroid glasses, and that the picture would have been as much of a chiller if shown in the standard 2-D form, and probably even a greater thriller if shown on a wide screen.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that, as a 3D film, it was &quot;a smoother effort than its predecessors, obviously made with more care and less tiring to the eyes&quot;, but that, &quot;[i]n all but technical respects, the film is a childish and inept piece of work.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film &quot;disappointing&quot;, writing: &quot;This picture, apart entirely from the fact that it is baldly, unbelievably antique in its melodramatic plot and style, shows little or no imagination in the use of stereoscopic images and nothing but loudness and confusion in the use of so-called stereoscopic sound. The impression we get is that its makers were simply and solely interested in getting a flashy sensation on the screen just as fast as they could.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s supposed to be a horror movie and it&#x27;s horrible alright... The novelty has some appeal especially through its long shots into depths, but there is also a feeling of limitations once what novelty there passes. Then it is we go back to the gaga script devised by Crane Wilbur from a story which served one of the early talking films and one is inclined to shudderingly ask: Are we to go through all that again?&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also hated the film, writing that he thought it had &quot;set the movies back about forty-nine years. It could have set them back further if there had been anything earlier to set them back to&quot;, and concluding that &quot;when Mr. Price started clumping around and choking ladies with knots that wouldn&#x27;t pass muster at a Cub Scout meeting, I took off my glasses once and for all, put on my hat, and left.&quot;

===Later reception===

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 44 reviews and an average score of 7.5 out of 10. The site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;&quot;House of Wax&quot; is a 3-D horror delight that combines the atmospheric eerieness of the wax museum with the always chilling presence of Vincent Price.&quot;

==Impact==

&quot;House of Wax&quot; revitalized the film career of Vincent Price, who had been playing secondary character parts and occasional sympathetic leads since the late 1930s. After this high-profile role, he was in high demand for the rest of his career to play fiendish villains, mad scientists, and other deranged characters in genre films. The following year, Columbia Pictures hired &quot;House of Wax&quot; writer Crane Wilbur to pen the script for their attempt to capture the 3D craze alongside Price as star with &quot;The Mad Magician&quot; (1954). Price would go on to star in genre films such as &quot;The Tingler&quot; (1959), &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971). Supporting actress Carolyn Jones, who had her first credited role in &quot;House of Wax&quot;, gained a much higher profile more than a decade later when she played Morticia Addams in the TV comedy horror spoof &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released in 2D on DVD by Warner Home Video on August 5, 2003. This release included &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; as a bonus. A 3D Blu-ray disc of the film was released in the U.S. on October 1, 2013, to celebrate its 60th anniversary. Like the earlier DVD, the Blu-ray includes &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; as a bonus (in standard definition). A reissue of this format was released through the Warner Archive Collection on June 23, 2020.

<text>In mathematics, the algebra of sets, not to be confused with the mathematical structure of &quot;an&quot; algebra of sets, defines the properties and laws of sets, the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complementation and the relations of set equality and set inclusion. It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.

Any set of sets closed under the set-theoretic operations forms a Boolean algebra with the join operator being &quot;union&quot;, the meet operator being &quot;intersection&quot;, the complement operator being &quot;set complement&quot;, the bottom being and the top being the universe set under consideration.

== Fundamentals ==

The algebra of sets is the set-theoretic analogue of the algebra of numbers. Just as arithmetic addition and multiplication are associative and commutative, so are set union and intersection; just as the arithmetic relation &quot;less than or equal&quot; is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, so is the set relation of &quot;subset&quot;.

It is the algebra of the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection and complementation, and the relations of equality and inclusion. For a basic introduction to sets see the article on sets, for a fuller account see naive set theory, and for a full rigorous axiomatic treatment see axiomatic set theory.

== Fundamental properties of set algebra ==
The binary operations of set union () and intersection () satisfy many identities. Several of these identities or &quot;laws&quot; have well established names.
: Commutative property:
:* 
: Associative property:
:* 
: Distributive property:
:* 

The union and intersection of sets may be seen as analogous to the addition and multiplication of numbers. Like addition and multiplication, the operations of union and intersection are commutative and associative, and intersection &quot;distributes&quot; over union. However, unlike addition and multiplication, union also distributes over intersection.

Two additional pairs of properties involve the special sets called the empty set and the universe set ; together with the complement operator ( denotes the complement of . This can also be written as , read as &quot;A prime&quot;). The empty set has no members, and the universe set has all possible members (in a particular context).
: Identity:
:* 
: Complement:
:* 

The identity expressions (together with the commutative expressions) say that, just like 0 and 1 for addition and multiplication, and are the identity elements for union and intersection, respectively.

Unlike addition and multiplication, union and intersection do not have inverse elements. However the complement laws give the fundamental properties of the somewhat inverse-like unary operation of set complementation.

The preceding five pairs of formulae—the commutative, associative, distributive, identity and complement formulae—encompass all of set algebra, in the sense that every valid proposition in the algebra of sets can be derived from them.

Note that if the complement formulae are weakened to the rule , then this is exactly the algebra of propositional linear logic.

== Principle of duality ==

Each of the identities stated above is one of a pair of identities such that each can be transformed into the other by interchanging and , while also interchanging and .

These are examples of an extremely important and powerful property of set algebra, namely, the principle of duality for sets, which asserts that for any true statement about sets, the dual statement obtained by interchanging unions and intersections, interchanging and and reversing inclusions is also true. A statement is said to be self-dual if it is equal to its own dual.

== Some additional laws for unions and intersections ==

The following proposition states six more important laws of set algebra, involving unions and intersections.

PROPOSITION 3: For any subsets and of a universe set , the following identities hold:
: idempotent laws:
:* 
: domination laws:
:* 
: absorption laws:
:* 

As noted above, each of the laws stated in proposition 3 can be derived from the five fundamental pairs of laws stated above. As an illustration, a proof is given below for the idempotent law for union.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
The following proof illustrates that the dual of the above proof is the proof of the dual of the idempotent law for union, namely the idempotent law for intersection.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
Intersection can be expressed in terms of set difference:

== Some additional laws for complements ==

The following proposition states five more important laws of set algebra, involving complements.

PROPOSITION 4: Let and be subsets of a universe , then:
: De Morgan&#x27;s laws:
:* 
: double complement or involution law:
: complement laws for the universe set and the empty set:
:* 

Notice that the double complement law is self-dual.

The next proposition, which is also self-dual, says that the complement of a set is the only set that satisfies the complement laws. In other words, complementation is characterized by the complement laws.

PROPOSITION 5: Let and be subsets of a universe , then:
: uniqueness of complements:
:* If , and , then 

== Algebra of inclusion ==

The following proposition says that inclusion, that is the binary relation of one set being a subset of another, is a partial order.

PROPOSITION 6: If , and are sets then the following hold:
: reflexivity:
: antisymmetry:
:* and if and only if 
: transitivity:
:* If and , then 

The following proposition says that for any set &quot;S&quot;, the power set of &quot;S&quot;, ordered by inclusion, is a bounded lattice, and hence together with the distributive and complement laws above, show that it is a Boolean algebra.

PROPOSITION 7: If , and are subsets of a set then the following hold:
: existence of a least element and a greatest element:
: existence of joins:
:* If and , then 
: existence of meets:
:* If and , then 

The following proposition says that the statement is equivalent to various other statements involving unions, intersections and complements.

PROPOSITION 8: For any two sets and , the following are equivalent:
:* 
:* 

The above proposition shows that the relation of set inclusion can be characterized by either of the operations of set union or set intersection, which means that the notion of set inclusion is axiomatically superfluous.

== Algebra of relative complements ==

The following proposition lists several identities concerning relative complements and set-theoretic differences.

PROPOSITION 9: For any universe and subsets , and of , the following identities hold:
:* 
:* 
:* 
:* 
:* 
:*

<text>Philip Kapleau (August 20, 1912 – May 6, 2004) was an American Zen Buddhist teacher. He trained in the Harada–Yasutani tradition, which is rooted in Japanese Sōtō and incorporates Rinzai-school koan study. He established Rochester Zen Center, which grew to become one of the most influential Zen communities in the West. His independent lineage includes teachers active in the USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Germany, the UK and New Zealand. 

==Early life==
Kapleau was born in New Haven, Connecticut. As a teenager he worked as a bookkeeper. He briefly studied law and later became an accomplished court reporter. In 1945 he served as chief Allied court reporter for the Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal, which judged the leaders of Nazi Germany. It was the first of the series commonly known as the Nuremberg Trials.

Kapleau later covered the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, commonly known as the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. While in Japan he became intrigued by Zen Buddhism. He became acquainted with Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, then a prisoner at Sugamo Prison, who recommended that Kapleau attend informal lectures given by D.T. Suzuki in Kita-Kamakura. After returning to America, Kapleau renewed his acquaintance with D.T. Suzuki who had left Kita-Kamakura to lecture on Zen at Columbia University. Disaffected with a primarily intellectual treatment of Zen, he moved to Japan in 1953 to seek its deeper truth.

== Zen training ==
He trained initially with Soen Nakagawa, then rigorously with Daiun Harada at the temple Hosshin-ji. Later he became a disciple of Hakuun Yasutani, a dharma heir of Harada. After 13 years&#x27; training, Kapleau was ordained as a priest by Yasutani in 1965 &quot;according to the rites prescribed by the Patriarch Eihei Dogen&quot; as described by Yasutani in a certificate from the Sanbo &quot;Three Treasures&quot; Buddhist Religious Association, dated June 28, 1964, and given permission to teach. 

== Work and teaching ==

=== Three Pillars of Zen ===
During his time in Japan, Kapleau transcribed other Zen teachers&#x27; talks, interviewed lay students and monks, and recorded the practical details of Zen Buddhist practice. His book, &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot;, published in 1965, has been translated into 12 languages, and is still in print. It was one of the first English-language books to present Zen Buddhism not as philosophy, but as a pragmatic and salutary way of training and living. James Ishmael Ford has described the book as monumentally important, stating &quot;I cannot express how important that single book was in my life; and this has been true for so many others who&#x27;ve taken up the Zen way&quot;. 

=== Rochester Zen Center and wider sangha ===

During a book tour in 1966, he was invited to teach meditation at a gathering in Rochester, New York, which led to the founding of the Rochester Zen Center. Affiliate centers were founded around the world, including in Canada, Poland, Costa Rica, Germany, Sweden, Mexico and the UK. 

For almost 40 years, Kapleau taught at the Center and in many other settings around the world, and provided his own dharma transmission to several disciples. 

He also introduced many modifications to the Japanese Zen tradition, such as chanting the Heart Sutra in the local language. He often emphasized that Zen Buddhism adapted so readily to new cultures because it was not dependent upon a dogmatic external form. At the same time he recognized that it was not always easy to discern the form from the essence, and one had to be careful not to &quot;&quot;.

=== Break with Yasutani ===

Kapleau ended his relationship with Yasutani formally in 1967 over disagreements about teaching as well as Kapleau&#x27;s reservations about the conduct of Eido Shimano, whose pattern of sexual relationships with and alleged sexual harassment of female students was later exposed. In a letter to Yamada Koun Roshi, Kapleau wrote:

According to James Ishmael Ford, &quot;Kapleau had completed about half of the Harada-Yasutani kōan curriculum, the koans in the &quot;Gateless Gate&quot; and the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;,&quot; and was entitled to teach, but did not receive dharma transmission. According to Andrew Rawlinson, &quot;Kapleau has created his own Zen lineage.&quot;

Kapleau&#x27;s dharma heir Bodhin Kjolhede has been offered transmission in the Sōto lineage, which he declined. He explained his decision in a teisho:
==Writings==
Kapleau was an articulate and passionate writer. His emphasis in writing and teaching was that insight and enlightenment are available to anyone, not just austere and isolated Zen monks. Also well known for his views on vegetarianism, peace and compassion, he remains widely read, and is a notable influence on Zen Buddhism as it is practiced in the West. Today, his dharma heirs and former students teach at Zen centers around the world.

Kapleau&#x27;s book &quot;To Cherish All Life: A Buddhist Case for Becoming Vegetarian&quot; condemns meat-eating. He argued that Buddhism enjoins vegetarianism on the principle of nonharmfulness.

=== Grist for the mill ===
A favorite saying of Philip Kapleau was &quot;grist for the mill&quot; which means that all of our troubles and trials can be useful or contain some profit to us. In this spirit, his gravestone is one of the millstones from Chapin Mill, the Buddhist retreat center whose land was donated by a founding member of the Rochester Zen Center, Ralph Chapin.

== Later life and death ==
He suffered from Parkinson’s Disease for several years. While his physical mobility was reduced, he enjoyed lively and trenchant interactions with a steady stream of visitors throughout his life. On May 6, 2004, he died peacefully in the backyard of the Rochester Zen Center, surrounded by many of his closest disciples and friends.

<text>Captain Robert Edward Dudley Ryder (16 February 1908 – 29 June 1986) was a Royal Navy officer and a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He became a Conservative Member of Parliament after retiring from the navy.

==Early life==
Ryder was born in India in 1908 to Colonel Charles Henry Dudley Ryder, Surveyor General of India, and Ida Josephine Grigg. He was a great-grandson of the Right Reverend Henry Ryder, youngest son of Nathaniel Ryder, 1st Baron Harrowby. Ryder had two brothers; both were killed in the Second World War. Lisle Charles Dudley Ryder was killed in the Le Paradis massacre of 1940 in France. Ernle Terrick Dudley Ryder died in captivity after the defence of Singapore. Ryder was educated at Hazelhurst School and Cheltenham College before he entered the Royal Navy in 1926.

==Naval career==
Ryder served on several ships throughout his career. He served as a midshipman on the battleship from 1927 to 1929. As a lieutenant he served in the submarine as part of the 4th Flotilla in China from 1930 to 1933. Ryder also commanded several expeditions. This included captaining the ketch &quot;Tai-Mo-Shan&quot; on a 16,217 mile voyage from Hong Kong to Dartmouth, England during 1933–1934. &quot;Investigative work by the London Times in 2007 found that the voyage was more than a great yachting exploit. The young naval officers were spying on Imperial Japanese Navy anchorages in the Kurile Islands to survey the isles for potential Allied submarine bases for an attack on the Japanese Navy.&quot; &quot;That same base in the Kurile Islands was later used for the attack on Pearl Harbor.&quot; &quot;The yacht Tai-Mo-Shan was resold and repaired numerous times and later reached a wider audience when she starred in the box office hit Mama Mia in 2008.&quot;

From 1934 to 1937 he captained the schooner &quot;Penola&quot; during the British Graham Land Expedition in Antarctica.

When the Second World War started, Ryder was serving as a lieutenant commander on . In 1940, he was promoted to commander of the Q-ship which was sunk on the 29th of June 1940, torpedoed three times by German submarine U51 in the Atlantic, 200 miles west of Ireland; Ryder was adrift for four days before rescue by an off course convoy. After his recovery in hospital, he was appointed commander of the sloop . In early 1941, he went on to captain the &quot;Prince Philippe&quot; a cross-channel steamer converted to a Commando ship, which sank after a collision in the Firth of Clyde. Ryder, now a commander, led the St Nazaire Raid, codenamed Operation Chariot, on 28 March 1942. This was a successful operation to destroy the &quot;Normandie Dock&quot; in the German naval base in the town. The stated aim of the operation was to deny large German ships, particularly the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, a base on the Atlantic coast. For his actions during this operation he was one of five people awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour of the British Empire.

===Victoria Cross===
The official citation:

His medal is held by the Imperial War Museum, London.

===Later naval career===
Ryder took part in the Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe, Seine-Inférieure on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942. The Dieppe Raid was largely a failure, but it helped influence planning for Operation Overlord, the landings on D-Day. Ryder achieved a final rank of captain in 1948 and later served as naval attaché in Oslo.

== Personal life ==
Ryder married Constance Hilaré Myfanwy Green-Wilkinson on 26 April 1941 at St Pater&#x27;s Church, Cranbourne. Hilaré&#x27;s father (the Reverend Lumley Green-Wilkinson) was the Vicar of the parish of Ascot, and at one time had been the chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Robert and Hilaré were married by Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The Ryders had two children - Lisle (b 1943) who also joined the Royal Navy, before being ordained priest in the Church of England, and eventually becoming a Canon of Worcester Cathedral - and Susan (b 1944). who became a successful portraitist and painter. In 1981 she was commissioned by the Prince of Wales to paint Princess Diana in her wedding dress.

==Later life==
Following his naval career, he stood for election to the House of Commons as the Conservative Party candidate for Merton and Morden at the 1950 general election. He was elected and served as the Member of Parliament for five years. From 1955 to 1959 Ryder was Managing Director John Lewis Partnership.  In 1962 Ryder was appointed to the management committee of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He served until 1974, thereafter becoming a Life Vice-President. 

In 1964 the Ryders retired to live in the Old Rectory at Wolverton, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, in Norfolk. They were regularly guests of the Royal Family, and Robert occasionally joined shooting parties on the estate.

In 1977 the Ryders moved from Norfolk to Inkpen, near Newbury. Ryder’s wife Hilaré died on 19 September 1982. Ryder himself died on 29 June 1986, whilst on the yacht &quot;Watchdog&quot; during a sailing trip to France. He is buried in Headington Crematorium, Oxford.

<text>The Oregon Institute of Technology (Oregon Tech) is a public college in Oregon with a residential campus in Klamath Falls, Oregon, an urban campus in Wilsonville, Oregon, and additional locations in Salem and Seattle. Almost all students complete externships, co-ops, or other hands-on training inside and outside the classroom.

==History==
Oregon Tech was founded as the Oregon Vocational School on July 15, 1947, to train and re-educate returning World War II veterans. Under the direction of Winston Purvine, the first classes were held in a deactivated Marine Corps hospital three miles northeast of Klamath Falls. The following year, the school&#x27;s title was changed to the Oregon Technical Institute. In the first school year, 1947–1948, veterans constituted 98 percent of student enrollment. By 1950, the figure was 75 percent. In that year, in response to the Korean War, the school received a contract for training soldiers in welding and warehouse management. In 1953, Associate degree programs in Surveying and Structural Engineering Technologies were first accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development.

In 1954, KTEC, the institution&#x27;s first radio station went on air. By 1953, associate degree programs in the Surveying and Structural Engineering Technologies were first accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. Not long after in 1956, KOTI television opened on campus. However, KOTI is no longer operated on campus. In 1962, the institute was accredited by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools. In 1970, the first bachelor&#x27;s degree programs were accredited by ABET. It would be 25 years later when the first master&#x27;s degrees were offered. In 1975, the first Geo-Heat Center was established.

The campus was transferred to its current location in 1964, followed by another name change to the Oregon Institute of Technology in 1973. In 2012, the Oregon Institute of Technology officially rebranded to its current name &quot;Oregon Tech&quot;. Oregon Tech&#x27;s four locations in the Portland metropolitan area were consolidated into a single campus in Wilsonville in 2012 at InFocus&#x27; former headquarters. By 2015, the Oregon Institute of Technology became an independent public body governed by Board of Trustees.

On April 26, 2021, the faculty went on strike after more than 500 days of initial contract negotiations between the faculty union and administrators. This was the first strike conducted by a public college or university faculty union in Oregon&#x27;s history.

==Campuses==
*Oregon Tech Klamath Falls, the University Residential Campus
*Oregon Tech Wilsonville, the University Urban Campus
==Athletics==
The Oregon Tech (OIT) athletic teams are called the Owls and Lady Owls (sometimes known as the &quot;Hustlin&#x27; Owls&quot;). The institute of technology is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) since the 1993–94 academic year.

Oregon Tech competes in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball. 

The mascot for Oregon Tech Athletics is Hootie the Owl.

===Rivalries===
Oregon Tech&#x27;s traditional athletic nemesis is Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. The close proximity of the schools and alternate academic foci (science and technology at Oregon Tech, liberal arts at SOU) result in a natural rivalry between the two.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
OIT has won multiple NAIA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championships. Former men&#x27;s basketball coach Danny Miles completed his 1,000th win February 1, 2014, in his 43rd year of coaching at OIT. This is the fourth most of any men&#x27;s college basketball coach all-time (NCAA &amp; NAIA).

===Softball ===
OIT&#x27;s softball program won the NAIA Softball Championship in 2011.

===Mascot===

OIT&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Hootie the Hustlin&#x27; Owl&quot;, has been portrayed as a costumed character since 1980 and sports the jersey number 47 as an homage to the school&#x27;s founding year. 

Known originally as &quot;OIT OWL&quot;, he first hatched out of a giant paper mache egg during halftime at a home football game. Hootie&#x27;s other alias was &quot;OWLY OOP&quot; in the 1990s.
The beloved owl mascot was created by executive secretary Nancy Cox, inspired by the San Diego Chicken after attending a Padres game in 1980 and proceeding previous attempts at an official school mascot such as a rally head in the 1960s named &quot;OTIS&quot; and a live owl.

Notable stunts include skydiving, ziplining, half-court basketball throws, and various feats of acrobatics and professional dancing abilities. Performed by actress Brooke Eldridge (2021-2025), as featured on ABC Nightline News.

<doc id="961850" wikidata="Q7316676" url="?curid=961850" title="Retention rate">
<text>Retention rate is a statistical measurement of the proportion of people that remain involved with a group from one time period to another.

The concept is used in many contexts, including marketing, investment, education, employee management, research, and clinical trials. The exact definition depends on the context. As a general rule, high retention corresponds to a positive outcome.

In marketing, retention rate count customers and their activity irrespective transactions they make.
In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 63 percent responded that they found the &quot;retention rate&quot; metric very useful.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the &quot;retention rate&quot; metric in a marketing atmosphere is to monitor firm performance in attracting and retaining customers. &quot;Only recently have most marketers worried about developing metrics that focus on individual customers. In order to begin to think about managing individual customer relationships, the firm must first be able to count its customers. Although consistency in counting customers is probably more important than formulating a precise definition, a definition is needed nonetheless. In particular, we think the definition of and the counting of customers will be different in contractual versus non-contractual situations.&quot; Since there are multiple definitions of retention rates this could cause issues with interpreting retention rates in practice.

In the workplace arena, the purpose of the retention rate is to assist organizations with deciding when to take action in order to keep employees happy and motivated. According to a survey by CNN Money, the top 100 best companies to work for had less than a 3% turnover rate during a 12-month period.

Retention rate may also refer to &quot;colleges&quot;. According to the FAFSA, the retention rate is the percentage of a school’s first-time, first-year undergraduate students who continue at that school the next year. For example, a student who studies full-time in the fall semester and keeps on studying in the program in the next fall semester is counted in this rate.

==Contracts==
&quot;Retention applies to contractual situations in which customers are either retained or not. Customers either renew their magazine subscriptions or let them run out. Customers maintain a current account with a bank until they close it. Renters pay rent until they move out. These are examples of pure customer retention situations where customers are either retained or considered lost for good. In these situations, firms pay close attention to retention rates.&quot;

:&quot;Retention Rate:&quot; The ratio of the number of customers retained to the number at risk.

==Workplace==
Retention in the workplace refers to “the percentage of employees who were employed at the beginning of a period, and remain with the company at the end of the period”. For example, in January 2010, Company A had 500 employees. After one year, 200 of the 500 employees were still working for the company. The retention rate is 200/500 = 40%.

==See also==
*Employee retention
*Turnover (employment)
*University student retention

==Methodologies==
No retention rate methodologies have been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) according to MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol).

<doc id="961851" wikidata="Q251730" url="?curid=961851" title="Lepomis">
<text>Lepomis or true sunfish is a genus of North American freshwater fish from the family Centrarchidae in the order Centrarchiformes. The generic name &quot;Lepomis&quot; derives from the Greek (&quot;scale&quot;) and (&quot;cover&quot;, &quot;plug&quot;, &quot;operculum&quot;). The genus&#x27; most recognizable species is perhaps the bluegill.

Some &quot;Lepomis&quot; species can grow to a maximum overall length of , though most average around . Many species are sought by anglers as popular panfishes, and large numbers are bred and stocked in lakes, rivers, ponds and wetlands. They are widely distributed throughout the freshwater lakes and river tributaries of the United States and Canada, and several species have been translocated and flourished around the world, even becoming pests. Aquarium trade in some &quot;Lepomis&quot; species is prohibited in Germany for this reason.

&quot;Lepomis&quot; species, among others, are sometimes referred to as bream, but the term is also used to refer explicitly to the unrelated European cypriniform fish of genus &quot;Abramis&quot;.

==Phylogeny==
Phylogeny of all &quot;Lepomis&quot; species based on a partitioned mixed-model Bayesian analysis of a seven gene dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear gene DNA sequences by Near et al. (2005), expanded with fossil species. Subgenera in bold follow Bailey (1938):

*) &quot;L. peltastes&quot; was not originally included in the analysis by Near et al. (2005) and is included here based on commonly accepted sister relationship to &quot;L. megalotis&quot;.

**) See section &#x27;Evolutionary History&#x27; below for explanation.

***) Phylogenetic position in clade II uncertain. See section &#x27;Fossil record&#x27; for clarification.

==Evolutionary history==
Phylogenetic reconstructions using a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences calibrated with fossils to estimate ages of divergences suggests that the genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; diverged from the black bass in genus &quot;Micropterus&quot;, its sister taxon, about 25 million years ago. The deepest split among currently living species of &quot;Lepomis&quot; is dated to ~15 million years ago and separates genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; into two clades: clade I that leads to the modern bluegill, orange-spotted, green, and warmouth sunfish, and a clade II that includes the modern long-ear, red-breasted, pumpkinseed, redear, and red-spotted sunfish (see section &#x27;Phylogeny&#x27; above). The timing of this speciation event roughly corresponds with the Middle Miocene disruption that resulted in increased aridity on the plains of North America and a transition from savannah to grasslands, although the relevance of these environmental changes to the evolution of &quot;Lepomis&quot; is unclear.

==Fossil record==
No fossils unambiguously assigned to genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; are currently known from the putative stem-lineage that must have existed between 25 and 15 million years ago, spanning most of the early Miocene.

Currently, four extinct species of &quot;Lepomis&quot; are known from the fossil record:

There are at least two as yet undescribed fossil species of &quot;Lepomis&quot; that reach back to the middle Miocene:
* &quot;Lepomis&quot; sp. A consists of fragmentary fossils of its lower jaw from Nebraska, dated to 13.5 million years ago, and shows morphological similarities to the modern &quot;Lepomis microlophus&quot;, although its great age means that this species predates the divergence of any of the living species.
* &quot;Lepomis&quot; sp. B was found in deposits in Kansas, dated to 12 million years ago.
Two other more recent fossil species appear to be closely allied to &quot;Lepomis gulosus&quot;, and indeed their earliest occurrence may be close to the divergence of the lineage leading to the modern warmouth from other species of &quot;Lepomis&quot;:
* &quot;Lepomis kansasensis&quot; lived 6.6 million years ago, and had pterygoid teeth, indicating a close relationship to the warmouth.
* &quot;Lepomis serratus&quot; is known from 3.4 to 2.0 million year old deposits in Nebraska, and also appears to be closely related to or ancestral to the warmouth on the basis of its preopercle.

==Species==
There are currently 13 recognized species in this genus:

&quot;Lepomis&quot; frequently hybridize and many different hybrid combinations have been observed in the wild. Some of these hybrids include:
* &quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot; × &quot;cyanellus&quot; (greengill sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis macrochirus x microlophus&quot; (gillcracker)
*&quot;Lepomis cyanellus x gibbosus&quot; (pumpgreen sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis cyanellus x gulosus&quot; (green sunfish x warmouth)
*&quot;Lepomis gulosus x macrochirus&quot; (warmouth x bluegill)
*&quot;Lepomis macrochirus x megalotis&quot; (bluegill x longear sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis gibbosus x macrochirus&quot; (pumpkingill)
*&quot;Lepomis auritus x cyanellus&quot; (redbreast x green sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis microlophus x cyanellus&quot; (redear x green sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis auritus x microlophus&quot; (redbreast x redear sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis macrochirus x punctatus&quot; (bluegill x spotted sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis gibbosus x peltastes&quot; (pumpkinseed x northern sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis megalotis x cyanellus&quot; (longear x green sunfish)
*&quot;Lepomis miniatus x punctatus&quot; (redspotted x spotted sunfish)

<text>Eltham is a small inland town in South Taranaki, New Zealand, located south of the city of New Plymouth and southeast of the volcanic cone of Mount Taranaki. Stratford is north, Kaponga 13 km west, and Hāwera is south. State Highway 3 runs through the town.

Eltham is South Taranaki&#x27;s second largest town.

Eltham is known as the cradle of the Taranaki dairy industry (the co-operative system in particular), and for being the one place in New Zealand that manufactured rennet which is important in cheesemaking. It was also the first place to export butter to England.

==History==
European settlement began in Eltham in the 1870s, with blocks of densely forested land being taken up mainly to the north of Mountain Road. A profusion of sawmilling companies cleared the district which, when grassed, proved ideal for dairy farming. In 1884, the year Eltham was declared a town district, settlers, mainly from England, arrived there and the town had a population of 25. Eltham was declared a borough in 1901, and became part of South Taranaki District with the local body amalgamations of 1989.

High Street (which runs through the centre of town - as part of State Highway 3 connecting Stratford, Ngaere, Normanby and Hāwera) and Bridge Street (which heads westward towards Kaponga and joins State Highway 45 near Ōpunake), were the first tar-sealed roads in New Zealand.

== Geography ==

===Rivers and lakes===

The two main watercourses which run through Eltham itself are the Mangawharawhara Stream, and the Waingongoro River.

The Mangawharawhara Stream runs to the east of the Main Trunk railway line, flows under the central business district via a culvert, and on past Eltham School and the Eltham Golf Club to the south of the town.

The Waingongoro River forms a western boundary to the town itself, flowing through the Presbyterian Church campsite (in the town&#x27;s northwest) and Taumata Park (the town&#x27;s main camping area and sports ground - in the western part of the town) and winding itself southwestward to meet the Tasman Sea at Ohawe Beach, near Hāwera.

Eltham is also the gateway to Lake Rotokare, a scenic, natural lake surrounded by native bush (to the east of the town), and to the man-made Lake Rotorangi.

==Local administration==

Eltham and the surrounding community enjoys a full library and council service (coming under the aegis of the South Taranaki District Council, based in Hāwera). Services provided include being able to register your dog, pay your rates or inquire about obtaining a building permit. The LibraryPlus is also a NZ Post agency. Other services include a Tot Time for the under 5s and regular ‘coffee and blog’ meetings for locals to learn about new technologies in a friendly environment. The LibraryPlus also has three APN computers, offering free internet and Skype to the public.

==Industry==
The town&#x27;s main industry is cheese production, with much of Mainland Cheese&#x27;s speciality range such as feta and camembert being produced in the Bridge Street factory.

Other cheese products such as the processed cheese used in many burgers are produced at the company&#x27;s Collingwood Street site, formerly occupied by the Taranaki Co-operative Dairy Company&#x27;s milk powder plant, but now extensively remodelled.

Cheese has been used as a central symbol of the town, and to reinforce this view, the town&#x27;s water supply tank was painted to represent a large block of cheese in 2002.

Eltham&#x27;s other significant industry is the ANZCO ( formerly Riverlands) freezing works, which has a satellite plant in Bulls, in Manawatu. Both plants can process up to 1250 head of cattle daily.

<text>A newsreader is a software 
 application that reads articles on Usenet distributed throughout newsgroups. Newsreaders act as clients which connect to a news server, via the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), to download articles and post new articles. In addition to text-based articles, Usenet is also used to distribute binary files, generally in dedicated &quot;binaries&quot; newsgroups.

The term &quot;newsreader&quot; is sometimes (erroneously) used interchangeably with &quot;news aggregator&quot;.

Newsreaders that help users to adhere to the established conventions of Usenet, known as netiquette, are evaluated by the Good Netkeeping Seal of Approval (GNKSA).

==Types of newsreaders==
There are several different types of newsreaders, depending on the type of service the user needs—whether intended primarily for discussion or for downloading files posted to the alt.binaries hierarchy:

; Desktop newsreaders
: Designed to integrate well with common GUI environments, and often integrated with a web browser or email client. Examples: Windows Live Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, Xnews, Forté Agent, Unison, Newswatcher and Pan.
; Traditional newsreaders
: Designed primarily for reading/posting text posts; limited and often cumbersome binary attachment download functionality. Gnus, as well as more specialized newsreaders such as slrn, nn and tin.

; Binary downloaders
: Although Usenet originally started as a text-based messaging system without any file attachment ability, many Usenet users today do not participate in discussion groups, as was common during the 1980s and 1990s and only use newsgroups for downloading files such as music, movies, pornography, software and games. Therefore, streamlined clients have been developed for quickly grabbing binary articles, and without the extraneous clutter of text reading and posting features for which file downloaders have little use.

<text>The Roc Project is an American electronica act, composed of the New York City-based DJ Ray Roc and, most often, the vocalist Tina Novak. Their debut single, &quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot; was released in 2003. However, because of difficulty getting the song released due to Novak and Roc being signed to different record labels, Ray Roc decided to recruit the Australian singer Tina Arena to sing Novak&#x27;s vocals instead. Arena&#x27;s version of &quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot; was therefore the single release. It became a major club and dance radio hit in America, and even managed to peak at No. 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It also reached No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart in April 2003.

The Roc Project&#x27;s first album was released in early 2003 and, with the record label issues finally cleared up, Novak appeared as the vocalist on all tracks, although the album also included the version of &quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot; with Arena&#x27;s vocals. The group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, was released in the spring of 2004, and became a smaller club and dance hit than their debut single.

<text>Henry Wynkoop (March 2, 1737March 25, 1816) was an American politician, who was member of the Continental Congress (from 1779) and later a United States representative for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the First United States Congress, 1789 to 1791.

==Formative years and family==
Wynkoop was born in Northampton Township in the Province of Pennsylvania on March 2, 1737. His father engaged in the practice of chattel slavery to operate the family&#x27;s 153-acre farm in Newtown. Raised on the farm, Henry Wynkoop was subsequently admitted to Princeton University, but opted not to complete his studies, choosing instead to enter into local politics. In 1759, when his father died, he inherited both the farm and the people that his father had enslaved.

Wynkoop married three times and had eight children. In 1761, he wed Susannah Wanshaer, who died in 1776. In 1777, he wed Maria Cummings, who died in 1781. He then married his third wife, Sarah Newkirk, who died in 1813.

==Career==
As a farm owner in Pennsylvania, Wynkoop benefitted financially from the practice of chattel slavery, as his father did before him.

Prior to his term as a representative, Wynkoop served as a justice of the Court of Common Pleas and the orphan&#x27;s court in Kingston, Pennsylvania, from 1780 to 1789. After his term in Congress, he was appointed as an associate judge in Bucks County, a post he held until his death.

==Later years, death and interment==
During his later years, Wynkoop created a will in which he decreed that, upon his death, the people he had been enslaving should be freed by manumission, a process which finally occurred on March 25, 1816, when he died in Bucks County. Some of the individuals who were freed stayed and continued to work for the family.

Following his death, Wynkoop was interred in the graveyard of the Low Dutch Reformed Church in Richboro, Pennsylvania.

==Biography==

Campbell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and worked as a shipwright, including at the Williamstown dockyard, before entering politics. Campbell served as Victorian State Secretary of the Federated Shipwrights&#x27; and Ship Constructors&#x27; Union between 1970 and 1976, National President in 1974 and Federal Secretary between 1974 and 1976. In 1976 the Federated Shipwrights Union merged into the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (AMWU) and Campbell became Assistant National Secretary, serving in that role until 1988 and as National Secretary between 1988 and 1996. He was a member of the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions between 1987 and 1997 and ACTU Senior Vice-president from 1993 to 1997.

<doc id="961893" wikidata="Q1916913" url="?curid=961893" title="Earl Dodge">
<text>Earl Farwell Dodge Jr. (December 24, 1932 – November 7, 2007) was an American politician who served as the Prohibition Party&#x27;s chairman and presidential candidate from the 1984 to 2000 presidential elections and later ran with the nomination of his own faction during the 2004 presidential election.

==Early life==

Earl Farwell Dodge Jr. was born on December 24, 1932, to Earl Farwell and Dorothy May Harris in Malden, Massachusetts. He attended school until the tenth grade and on July 20, 1951, he married Barbara Regan. In 1952, he joined the Prohibition Party after attending a rally hosted by future Prohibition vice-presidential nominee Mark R. Shaw.

==Career==
===Politics===
From 1953 to 1956, he served as the executive secretary of the Massachusetts Prohibition Party and ran for Massachusetts Secretary of State in 1956. In 1956, he moved to Indiana and from 1958 to 1961, he served as the chairman of the Indiana Prohibition Party and ran for Indiana&#x27;s second congressional district in 1960. From 1961 to 1962, he lived in Denver, Colorado. From 1962 to 1966, he worked for the National Christian Citizens Committee and ran for the United States Senate.

From 1958 to 1962, he served as the co-chairman of the Prohibition Party under E. Harold Munn. In 1967, he was appointed to the Kalamazoo Community Relations Board and served until 1970. In 1974, he was appointed to the Colorado State Elections Advisory Board. In 1979, he was selected to serve as the chairman of the National Statesman Party, which the Prohibition Party had changed its name to in 1977, and served until 2003.

He also ran for the governorship of Colorado with the Prohibition nomination in every election from 1974 to 1994 except for in 1990. In 1990, he ran in Colorado&#x27;s Senate election while his daughter, Karen J. Thiessen, ran for state Treasurer, his son, Calvin G. Dodge, ran for Secretary of State, and Calvin&#x27;s wife, Elsi, ran for the regent of Colorado University.

===Presidential===
During the 1976 and 1980 presidential elections he was given the vice-presidential nomination of the Prohibition Party.

On June 24, 1983, forty five delegates voted to give Dodge the presidential nomination in Mandan, North Dakota, for the 1984 presidential election and on January 3, 1984, he suffered a heart attack, but recovered. He appeared on the ballots in North Dakota, New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, and Colorado and as a write-in candidate in Ohio and received 4,236 votes.

During the 1988 presidential election he was given the party&#x27;s presidential nomination again and appeared on the ballot in Arkansas, Tennessee, New Mexico, and Colorado and received 8,002 votes. During the 1992 presidential election he appeared on the ballot in Arkansas, Tennessee, and New Mexico and only received 961 votes. During the 1996 presidential election he appeared on the ballot in Colorado, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Utah and received 1,298 votes.

From June 28 to 30, 1999, around thirty delegates attended the national convention in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, and nine voted to give Dodge the presidential nomination against eight voting for Gary R. Van Horn and the vice-presidential nomination to W. Dean Watkins. He attempted to win the Independent American Party presidential nomination to receive ballot access in Utah, but was defeated by U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party presidential nominee Howard Phillips and in the general election he only appeared on the ballot in Colorado and received 208 votes.

===2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns===
During his tenure as chairman of the party Dodge was criticized by members for his financial actions. He avoided paying the Social Security tax on money earned through his involvement in the Prohibition Party by laundering it through the National Prohibition Foundation. During Earl Higgerson&#x27;s ten years as treasurer Dodge refused to allow him to see the party&#x27;s account books, donor lists, sign checks, or know of actions taken by Dodge on his account. In 1999, he sold the party&#x27;s headquarters for $119,500 saying that he would use the money to build one on his property, but was alleged to have kept the money for himself and moved the party&#x27;s headquarters to a tool shed.

In 2003, members of the party opposed to him met at a condo in Tennessee and promoted him to chairman emeritus, as a polite way of firing him according to James Hedges. During the 2004 presidential election their faction nominated Gene Amondson under the Concerns of People ballot line while eight delegates from his faction of the party gave him its presidential nomination at his home in Lakewood, Colorado. In the general election he appeared on the ballot in Colorado and received 140 votes while Amondson received 1,944 votes from Colorado and Louisiana.

On June 12, 2007, members of his faction from three states met in a church in Arvada, Colorado, where they nominated him for president and Howard Lydick, who received the vice-presidential nomination in 2004, for vice-president. On November 7, Dodge was waiting to board a flight en route from Denver International Airport to Pennsylvania, when he suddenly collapsed due to cardiac arrhythmia and was taken to the University of Colorado Hospital where he died. Following Dodge&#x27;s death Howard Lydick worked to unite the two factions of the Prohibition Party behind Gene Amondson before Lydick&#x27;s own death on August 5, 2008.

<doc id="961896" wikidata="Q5659178" url="?curid=961896" title="Harmon Trophy">
<text>The Harmon Trophy is a set of three international trophies, to be awarded annually to the world&#x27;s outstanding aviator, aviatrix, and aeronaut (balloon or dirigible). A fourth trophy, the &quot;National Trophy&quot;, was awarded from 1926 through 1938 to the most outstanding aviator in each of the twenty-one member countries and again from 1946–1948 to honor Americans who contributed to aviation. The award was established in 1926 by Clifford B. Harmon, a wealthy balloonist and aviator.

The awards are described by the Clifford B. Harmon Trust as:
:&quot;American awards for the most outstanding international achievements in the arts and/or science of aeronautics for the preceding year, with the art of flying receiving first consideration.&quot;

==World War II and Harmon&#x27;s death==
Prior to World War II, the award was administered by the International League of Aviators (&quot;Ligue Internationale des Aviateurs&quot;), an organization founded by Harmon to serve as &quot;an agent for Peace and National security.&quot; The League became defunct during the war and Harmon&#x27;s death on June 25, 1945 in Cannes, France put the awards in turmoil. Harmon left $55,000 of his estate to continue funding the award in &quot;perpetuity,&quot; but Harmon&#x27;s relatives challenged the bequest. Ultimately, a trust fund of $48,431 was created in 1948.

During the period the awards were in litigation (1945–1948), the American Section of the League awarded the International Aviator Trophy to three U.S. leaders in aviation. However, since the awards were not approved by other League Sections, the awards are technically invalid. Also, these three awards were given without consideration to the &quot;art of flying&quot; and the awards did not recognize a superlative aviation achievement, rather recognized American aviation industry leaders. President Truman&#x27;s staff questioned the award to Alexander de Seversky, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington stating, &quot;he [de Seversky] did absolutely nothing to deserve it.&quot; Truman also did not make time to present the 1948 award to Trans World Airlines CEO Ralph Damon or Brazilian aviation pioneer Francisco Pignatari The award to Pan American World Airways President Juan Trippe in 1946 was the only one presented without debate.

Since 1997 or 1998, the National Aeronautic Association has been responsible for awarding the trophies. With the exception of the Aeronaut trophy, all are inactive.

The trustees wrestled with how to treat space flight. Bound by the court to offer only three trophies, the trustees first agreed that &quot;feats of piloting in both earth orbiting or outer space vehicles will be considered for the Harmon Awards provided the vehicles are controlled by their pilots rather than from the ground.&quot; The advisory committee directed the trustees to alternate awarding the aeronaut trophy between balloonists and astronauts, but the trustees decided to offer the aviator award to aviation and astronaut recipients. A fifth trophy was created in 1969 to honor achievements in space flight.

Some aviatrix awards from 1980–1990 were awarded by the Ninety-Nines based on research performed by Fay Gillis Wells. This work was not coordinated with the NAA or Smithsonian.

The original awards were 24-inch-tall bronze statues. The aviator trophy depicts World War I flying ace Raoul Lufbery launching a biplane set next to an eagle about to take wing. The statuette was created by sculptor Roussadana M&#x27;divani. The Smithsonian Institution acquired the aviator&#x27;s trophy in 1950 from the Clifford B. Harmon Trust. The aviatrix trophy depicts a winged goddess cradling a falcon with outstretched wings. The aeronaut trophy was lost in Germany between May 1940 and October 1953 and was believed to have been sold as scrap. The three-foot-tall, 150-pound statue of five aviators holding the globe on their shoulders was found in a junk store and subsequently given to the Smithsonian after the presentation of the 1952 awards.

==List of award winners==
The following is an incomplete list compiled from several sources. The Aeronaut, National and Astronaut categories have not been listed in a central location. The NAA and the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum worked to assemble a complete list to be published in conjunction with the NAA&#x27;s hundredth anniversary in 2005, however this project was not completed and it appears that the source documents for a period of awards were destroyed.

<doc id="961911" wikidata="Q3025517" url="?curid=961911" title="Sheaf toss">
<text>The sheaf toss () is a traditional Scottish agricultural sport event originally contested at country fairs. A pitchfork is used to hurl a hessian bag stuffed with straw over a horizontal bar above the competitor&#x27;s head. Typical weight for the bag is 16 or 20 pounds (7.3 or 9.1 kg). Three chances are given to each competitor to cleanly go over the bar. After all challengers have made their attempts, the bar is raised and all successful competitors move on to the new height. This continues until all but one athlete is eliminated.

The Sheaf toss has been incorporated as an event at many of the Scottish highland games although technically it is not itself a heavy athletics event. The sheaf toss is also a traditional sport in the Basque Country. It is a feature of the annual Sykehouse Show in South Yorkshire, England.

Sheaf tossing is also contested in Ireland and Australia particularly at agricultural shows and at fairs; Irish sheaf tossing differs from sheaf tossing in Scotland and France in that the sheaf is made of rushes which are bound tightly with baling twine and are not placed in a bag. The rules are the same as the Scottish version and a pitchfork is used. The same pitchfork is usually used for all competitors so as not to give anybody an unfair advantage by allowing them use their own customised pitchfork. A variation of this rule is that if one brings a custom pitchfork to the competition, they must allow any other competitor to use that fork.

<doc id="961912" wikidata="Q331345" url="?curid=961912" title="Jesús T. Piñero">
<text>Jesús T. Piñero Jiménez (April 16, 1897 – November 19, 1952) was the first and only native Puerto Rican to be appointed governor of Puerto Rico by the Government of the United States.

==Early years==
Jesús Toribio Piñero Jiménez was born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Emilio Piñero Estrella (son of Basilio Piñero) and Josefa Jiménez Sicardó into a wealthy family with roots in the Canary Islands. His direct ancestor was Domingo Antonio José Piñero Pineda from Hermigua, La Gomera arriving in Puerto Rico around 1816. He obtained his primary and secondary education in his hometown. In 1914, he attended the College of Liberal Arts of the University of Puerto Rico. He also attended the School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

==Political career==
Between 1920 and 1944, Piñero&#x27;s interest in agriculture kept him engaged in the dairy business and in the cultivation of sugar cane. His interest in the agricultural development of Puerto Rico led him to participate in politics, particularly those concerning the issues of the cultivation of sugar cane and development of the industry.

Between 1928 and 1932, a period during which Puerto Rico&#x27;s internal government was still run by continental Americans appointed by the President of the United States, Piñero was president of the Assembly of the Municipality of Carolina. Between 1934 and 1937, he was the president of the Association of the Sugar Cane Industry and was elected to the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico.

In 1938, Piñero was one of the founders, along with Luis Muñoz Marín, of the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD). In the elections of 1940, he was elected to the House of Representatives. In 1944, he was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and represented the island in the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. His position did not have voting powers in Congress.

==First Puerto Rican governor appointed by the U.S.==

In 1946, President Harry S. Truman relieved Governor Rexford Guy Tugwell, who had served in this position from 1941, and named Piñero as governor in his place, the first native Puerto Rican appointed to that post under U.S. administration.

On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) when Governor Piñero signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both.

According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.

Piñero served as governor until 1949, when Puerto Rico celebrated its first popular election for the position, in which Muñoz Marín was elected governor. During Piñero&#x27;s administration, legislation was passed that later served as the basis for the economic development plan known as Operation Bootstrap. Plans for the construction of a new international airport for the Island were also drawn up during his governorship. From 1947 to 1951, Piñero served as U.S. representative to the Caribbean Commission.

==Death==
Jesús T. Piñero died on November 19, 1952, in the town of Loíza, and was buried at the Carolina Municipal Cemetery in his hometown, Carolina, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy and honors==
* A high school, public housing complex, and a principal avenue in San Juan and in Cayey have been named for him. 
* Carolina commissioned and installed a monument of him sculpted by Jose Buscaglia Guillermety; it is located at the entrance of the town. T
* The Agriculture building at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez is also named after him.
* Piñero&#x27;s personal papers and memorabilia are deposited at the Piñero Collection at the Universidad del Este in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

<text>Pearson plc is a multinational corporation, headquartered in the UK, focused on educational publishing and services.

Originating in 1844 and named S Pearson and Son by Samuel Pearson in 1856, what began as a small local civil engineering business in Yorkshire grew between 1880 and 1927 into a massive diversified international conglomerate under the subsequent leadership of Samuel&#x27;s grandson Weetman Pearson. By the time of World War II, the company had major national and international subsidiaries in manufacturing, electricity, oil, coal, banking and financial services, publishing (periodicals and books), and aviation.

After the Second World War and the British government&#x27;s nationalisation of many industries, Pearson refocused on publishing and media. In 1984 the company changed its name from S. Pearson &amp; Son plc to Pearson plc. Under the leadership of CEO Marjorie Scardino, in 1998 the company formed Pearson Education, and by 2016 education was Pearson plc&#x27;s exclusive focus. As of 2023 Pearson Education, known since 2011 as simply Pearson, is Pearson plc&#x27;s main subsidiary. Pearson owns one of the GCSE examining boards for the UK, Edexcel.

Pearson plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.

==History==
===Civil engineering businesses 1844 to 1925===
In 1844 Samuel Pearson became an associate partner in a small brickmaking and contracting civil engineering company in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. In 1856 Pearson&#x27;s eldest son George entered the business, which became known as S Pearson &amp; Son, &quot;sanitary tube and brickmakers and contractors for local public works in and around Bradford&quot;. In 1880, control passed to Samuel&#x27;s grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson (later 1st Viscount Cowdray), an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world&#x27;s largest construction companies.

Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor&#x27;s agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.

Between 1880 and 1902 the company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.

In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.

The construction business was shut down in the 1920s. Its final projects included construction of the Silent Valley Reservoir in Northern Ireland (contract awarded in 1923), and completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.

===Manufacturing businesses 1856 to 1993===
In 1856 S Pearson &amp; Son advertised itself as manufacturing sanitary tubes and bricks in Yorkshire. Manufacturing expanded beyond sanitary tubes and bricks to include a variety of items globally, including nuts and bolts, specialist glass, pottery, porcelain and fine china, and related items.

Pearson acquired Allied English Potteries (including Royal Crown Derby) in 1964 and Doulton &amp; Co. in November 1971, whereupon it merged those two potteries companies. Pearson purchased the Fairey Group in 1980, and its engineering was merged with Doulton&#x27;s industrial ceramics engineering.

Pearson sold Doulton Glass Industries Ltd. in 1982. The Fairey Group became independent of Pearson in 1986 via a management buy-out. As Pearson refocused on its core publishing and media industries, it divested Royal Doulton, which was its remaining fine china division and the last of Pearson&#x27;s manufacturing assets, in 1993.

===Electricity businesses 1900 to 1960===
The conglomerate entered the electrification market in 1900, when Weetman Pearson was requested to electrify Mexico&#x27;s tramway system, and then the general electrical supply in the city of Vera Cruz and elsewhere. This process was repeated in Chile. These electrical interests were consolidated into Whitehall Electric Investments Ltd. in 1922.

In 1929 the electricity businesses in Mexico and Chile were sold, but similar electricity utilities were developed in southwestern England until they were nationalised in 1948.

All of Pearson&#x27;s overseas electricity utility businesses, which had spread to Greece, were closed by 1960.

===Oil businesses 1901 to 1989===
While building the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico for president Porfirio Diaz, Weetman Pearson learned of oil deposits in south Texas and Mexico and in 1901 began buying prospective oil lands in those places. After striking oil in Mexico in 1908, he founded the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company in 1909 to handle all of S Pearson and Sons&#x27; oil interests.

In 1919 the Royal Dutch Shell Group acquired a large share of, and management of, Mexican Eagle, and Pearson formed Whitehall Petroleum Corporation Ltd. to take over Pearson&#x27;s oil interests and to prospect globally for oil. It established a major oil company in the U.S., Amerada Corporation, in 1919. Amerada was compulsorily acquired by the British government in 1941 due to World War II; a small interest was reacquired by Pearson in 1945.

In the 1950s Pearson expanded its North American oil and gas interests, and in the 1970s also expanded them globally. By 1989, Pearson divested its oil and gas exploration activities and sold Whitehall Petroleum.

===Banking and financial services 1919 to 1999===
In 1919, Pearson founded Whitehall Trust Ltd. as a finance and issuing house. In 1919 Pearson also acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years.

In 1976 Pearson acquired a stake in Embankment Trust Ltd.

By 1990 Pearson&#x27;s stake in Lazard Brothers was reduced to 50% following Lazard&#x27;s internationalization to Paris and New York, and Pearson acquired 10% stakes in the two overseas branches.

In 1999, due to the company&#x27;s refocus on education, publishing, and media, Pearson sold its Lazard holdings for £410 million.

===Coal businesses 1921 to 1947===
Following Wheetman Pearson&#x27;s 1907 creation of Whitehall Securities as its holding company for all of Pearson&#x27;s non-contracting industries, beginning in 1921 Pearson partnered with Dorman Long to form a coal-mining conglomerate in 1922, called Pearson &amp; Dorman Long Ltd. The company purchased and operated many collieries in the UK through at least 1947.

===Publishing businesses 1921 to 1997===
In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.

Following the British government&#x27;s acquisition and nationalisation of several of Pearson&#x27;s aviation, fuel, and energy divisions in the early 1940s due to World War II, Angela Murray became a director of the Pearson group and the chair of the Westminster Press in 1953. The Press owned local newspapers including the Oxford Mail, The Northern Echo and the Brighton Evening News with the backing of the Westmnster Press they were encouraged to find local news.

In 1957, it bought the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and acquired a 50% stake in &quot;The Economist&quot;. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.

Pearson was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.

It bought the paperback publisher Penguin in 1970, and the children&#x27;s imprint Ladybird Books in 1972. It bought a rival, the educational publisher Pitman Ltd, in 1985.

In 1996 Pearson sold Westminster Press to Newsquest, acquired the education division of HarperCollins from News Corporation, and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman &amp; Co..

===Aviation businesses 1929 to 1959===
In 1929, Pearson&#x27;s Whitehall Securities entered the aviation field, purchasing an interest in Airwork Services.

By 1935 Whitehall Securities had major interests in a number of British airlines and aviation companies, including Spartan Air Lines, Saunders-Roe,
United Airways, and Hillman&#x27;s Airways. In September 1935, Hillman&#x27;s Airways, Spartan Air Lines, and United Airways merged to form British Airways Ltd. In 1936, British Airways absorbed British Continental Airways and Crilly Airways. In 1940, British Airways was nationalised due to World War II.

In 1937 the company acquired Northern &amp; Scottish Airways and Highland Airways, and merged them into a new company, Scottish Airways. This airline was nationalised by the British government in 1947 and merged into British European Airways.

Pearson&#x27;s aviation interests ended by 1959, when Saunders-Roe was sold to Westland Aircraft.

===Entertainment media businesses 1981 to 2002===
in 1981 Pearson&#x27;s publishing subsidiary Pearson Longman established Goldcrest Films and Television in 1981, led by the founder of Goldcrest Films, John Eberts, and chaired by James Lee, chief executive of Pearson Longman. At its inception, the new concern owned 40% of Goldcrest Films.

In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which a few years later merged with Sky Television to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).

During the 1990s, the company acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets, including former ITV franchisee Thames Television, Australian production company Grundy Television, U.S. television company All American Communications Inc., Italian drama production company Mastrofilm, European animation financer and distributor EVA Entertainment, and UK production company Talkback Productions.

In 1994, Pearson acquired software publisher The Software Toolworks for US$462 million, and rebranded it Mindscape. In 1998, Pearson sold Mindscape to The Learning Company for US$150 million, taking a $346 million loss on the sale.

In 2000, Pearson merged its television holdings with CLT-UFA to form the RTL Group. In 2002 it exited the industry entirely by selling its 22% stake in RTL to Bertelsmann.

===Pearson Education and corporate refocus 1998 to 2016===
====Scardino and new focus on education====
Marjorie Scardino, who was CEO of Pearson plc from 1997 to 2013, increasingly focused the conglomerate on education and on making education acquisitions. In 1998, Pearson plc purchased the education division of Simon &amp; Schuster, which included Prentice Hall, Allyn &amp; Bacon, and parts of Macmillan Inc. including the Macmillan name. Later in 1998 it merged Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s educational business with Addison Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.

Pearson sold and divested most of its Simon &amp; Schuster divisions in 1999.

In March 2000 Pearson acquired the illustrated reference publisher Dorling Kindersley and integrated it within Penguin. It acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000, entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.

In 2002, Pearson purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin.

In 2003 it acquired Edexcel, a provider of qualifications in the UK, and in 2004 acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market. Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004, AGS in 2005, and Promissor in 2006. It acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in 2006 and acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group, in 2007.

It sold Silver Burdett Ginn Religion, a Catholic publishing division it operated under the Scott Foresman imprint, to RCL Benziger in 2007. In 2007 Pearson Education sold the Macmillan name to Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, which had purchased Macmillan Publishing Ltd. in the late 1990s.

In 2008 Pearson acquired Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier and merged them into Pearson Assessment &amp; Information.

In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&amp;F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.

In 2010, Pearson acquired the adult English training service Wall Street Institute and the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB). Also in 2010, the company sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus.

====Pearson Education rebrands as Pearson (2011) and Pearson plc rebrands as education-only (2016) ====
Pearson Education was rebranded as simply Pearson in 2011.

In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London. Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million. In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista to 76%.

In May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.

In October 2012 Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House, and said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann&#x27;s Random House to create the world&#x27;s biggest consumer book publisher.

In February 2013, following government changes to apprenticeship funding rules, Pearson sold its Pearson in Practice, a UK vocational training business, to West Nottinghamshire College, which renamed it Vision Workforce Skills.

In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings. The change supported the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combined the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company and Pearson reorganised around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English formed part of Pearson Professional.

In July 2014, the company announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company&#x27;s workforce.

Pearson announced in July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily &quot;Financial Times&quot;, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group&#x27;s London property at One Southwark Bridge. Pearson retained the publishing rights to FT Press and licensed the trademark from Nikkei. In August 2015, Pearson&#x27;s sold its 50% stake in &quot;The Economist&quot; to the Agnelli family, who previously held 4.7% of the group. The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.

Following the sale of its financial news publications &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2015, Pearson plc rebranded in January 2016 to focus solely on education, and the corporation adopted a new logo, the interrobang (‽), a combination of a question mark and an exclamation point, meant to convey a &quot;combination of excitement, curiosity and individuality&quot; and &quot;the excitement and fun of learning&quot;.

===2017 to present===
In July 2017, Pearson sold its Tutor Vista and Edurite lines of business to India-based education technology company, Byju&#x27;s. In July 2017, it also agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.

In August 2017 Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 staff in an effort to save £300 million annually. In August 2017 it also sold the language-training subsidiary Global Education to Chinese company Pu-Xin Education.

In 2019, Pearson sold its US K-12 courseware business to the private equity firm Nexus Capital Management, which rebranded it as Savvas Learning Company. Pearson also sold its remaining 25% stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann.

Pearson CEO John Fallon retired from the company in 2020, and was succeeded by Andy Bird on 19 October 2020.

In December 2021, Pearson announced that Omid Kordestani had been appointed as the chairman of the board of directors, effective March 2022.

In April 2022, Pearson announced it had acquired the online language learning platform, Mondly.

In April 2022, Pearson acquired ClutchPrep, which was renamed Channels and added to the Pearson website.

In September 2023, CEO Andy Bird announced his impending retirement. He was succeeded by Omar Abbosh, president of Microsoft&#x27;s Industry Solutions business, on 8 January 2024.

==Organisational structure==
Pearson plc is a holding company, and conducts its business primarily through subsidiaries and other affiliates. As of December 2022, its main subsidiaries are:
*Pearson Education Inc. (United States)
*Pearson Education Ltd. (United Kingdom)
*NCS Pearson, Inc. (United States)

According to the company&#x27;s website, its business divisions consist of:
*Assessment &amp; Qualifications
*Virtual Learning
*English Language Learning
*Workforce Skills
*Higher Education

==Criticism==
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, being a commercial company, has on public education. Other concerns are around tax avoidance, high value contracts, and an instance of laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing. In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson shareholders voted against the chief executive&#x27;s pay package of £1.5 million after the company made a record loss. Pearson US has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.

Pearson owns Edexcel, a British education and examination board. Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies. Edexcel has also faced criticism over repeated leaks of exam material in consecutive years; police investigations into some of the incidents were referred to prosecutors.

In June 2010, Pearson plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund had acquired 24.4 million shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2.1 million shares, resulting in a total interest of 26.5 million shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.

<doc id="961937" wikidata="Q1305299" url="?curid=961937" title="Fathers' Day (1997 film)">
<text>Fathers&#x27; Day is a 1997 American comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Nastassja Kinski. It is a remake of the 1983 French film &quot;Les Compères&quot;.

In the film, Collette Andrews (Kinski) enlists two former lovers, cynical lawyer Jack Lawrence (Crystal) and lonely, ex-hippie, suicidal writer Dale Putley (Williams) to help her search for her runaway teenage son Scott by telling each man that he is the father. When Jack and Dale run into each other and find out what is happening, they work together to find Scott and determine the identity of the actual father.

The film features an appearance by the musical groups Sugar Ray and the Muffs. It was a critical and commercial failure.

== Plot ==

16-year-old Scott Andrews runs away from home with his girlfriend Nikki. His mother, Collette, visits her ex-boyfriend, lawyer Jack Lawrence, telling him that Scott is really his son, and she wants him to find the boy. Jack refuses at first but changes his mind when work keeps him overnight in San Francisco.

Meanwhile, writer Dale Putley is planning suicide when he gets a phone call from Collette, of whom he is another ex, and she tells him the same story.

Both men start their search with Russ, Nikki&#x27;s father. Dale and Jack get little help from him, but it does lead to them meeting each other. Mistakenly assuming that they each have a different missing son, they think &quot;both boys&quot; are mixed up with Nikki. They decide to team up.

Jack and Dale visit Nikki&#x27;s mother Shirley, learning that Nikki went on the road to follow rock band Sugar Ray. When she asks to see pictures of their sons, they finally discover that Collette has told them both the same story about being Scott&#x27;s father. They call her, and she confesses that she does not know which man is the father, but she begs them to find Scott.

The two agree, and they head for Sacramento, finding Scott, drunk, lovestruck and dumped by Nikki. They bring him to their hotel room, but when he awakens the next day, he is not pleased by the news that one of them might be his father nor that Nikki is following Sugar Ray. Jack leaves Dale to watch Scott, but he escapes by pouring coffee on Dale&#x27;s lap. Dale finds Jack, and they head to Reno, to Sugar Ray&#x27;s next gig.

In Reno, Scott meets with Nikki and the other groupies. Bumping into two drug dealers who he scammed out of $5,000 to buy a necklace for Nikki, Scott escapes, only to be accidentally run down by Jack and Dale. Now with a broken arm, Scott demands that they leave him alone.

That night, the three finally bond when Scott opens up to Jack and Dale; Nikki is his first love, but his parents disapprove of her, so he ran away. When Scott tells him about the drug dealers, they try to help him. They drive to Nikki&#x27;s hotel, but when Jack and Dale go inside, the drug dealers spot Scott in the car and plan to kidnap and kill him. Scott escapes in Jack&#x27;s rental car.

When the two fathers emerge from the hotel, Jack assumes that Scott had been lying to them the whole time and quits, deciding to go home. However, his wife Carrie appears, following him (and Dale) because she is confused and concerned over Jack&#x27;s odd behavior. He tells her the truth about Scott, that he could be the father.

Dale departs while Jack and Carrie argue about Jack&#x27;s negative feelings for Scott, making her fear how he will react with his own child. Understanding her point, he heads to the Sugar Ray concert, finding Dale, who is also looking for Scott. They find him as he confronts Nikki, who breaks up with him. Heartbroken, Scott is suddenly grabbed by the drug dealers, who Dale and Jack attack, resulting in a huge fight erupting in the concert crowd.

Freed from jail the next day, Jack, Dale and Scott head home, where Collette and his father Bob embrace their son. She tells Scott that neither Jack nor Dale is his dad, but he is touched that his parents wanted him home so badly. Before Jack and Dale go, Scott lies to both, separately and privately, that they are the father. Jack realizes that Scott lied, but is happy because he now has a positive view of having children.

Having borrowed Jack&#x27;s car to get to the airport, Dale spots a woman having car trouble. Discovering that Virginia is single and also heading to San Francisco, Dale offers her a lift by car, to Jack&#x27;s annoyance.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Billy Crystal and Robin Williams had been looking for a feature film to star in together, with their only previous joint film being &quot;Hamlet&quot; (in separate scenes). Crystal was given a copy of the 1983 French comedy &quot;Les Compères&quot; by his agent at Creative Artists Agency. Said Crystal, &quot;I looked at it and thought this would be great for me and Robin. I called Robin and said, &#x27;You gotta look at this thing.&#x27; Robin said, &#x27;I love this too.&#x27; Then I went to a dinner party at Warner Bros. production chief] Bob Daly&#x27;s house and he said, &#x27;We&#x27;re excited about the prospect of you and Robin doing a movie together&#x27;. And Ivan was there and he said, &#x27;What movie? &quot;Les Compères&quot;? I&#x27;m in&#x27;. I got everybody in. I did the producer&#x27;s job. It was weird.&quot;

When asked whether they improvised during filming, Williams said, &quot;We mostly stuck to the script, but of course we had some fun every once in a while.&quot;

==Release==
To promote the film, Crystal and Williams appeared on an episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, a sitcom that was also produced by Warner Bros. Television.

In South Africa, &quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot; was released as What&#x27;s Up Pop&#x27;s?, a title that the distributor decided would be more appropriate for the local market. The name was subsequently changed to What&#x27;s Up Pops? for DVD release when the studio realized that the apostrophe had been used incorrectly.

===Box office===
The film opened on May 9, 1997, finishing at #2, behind &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, with a gross of $8,776,159. Industry observers at Warner Bros. predicted that the film would open with approximately $9 million and would gain more over the weekend. Some folks have speculated that one of the reasons for the film&#x27;s disappointing opening was from releasing the film near Mother&#x27;s Day. In its second week, the film dropped 27% to $6.4 million, totaling $17.5 million. The film ended with a domestic gross of $28,598,376 and a worldwide gross of $35,681,080. Against a budget of $85 million, the film was a box-office bomb.

Of the film&#x27;s disappointing box-office run, an unnamed Warner Bros. executive said, &quot;When [CAA] calls and says, &#x27;We have a package, &quot;Father&#x27;s&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] &quot;Day&quot;, with Williams and Crystal, and Reitman, we say &#x27;great&#x27;. We don&#x27;t scrutinize the production. When we saw the movie, it took the wind out of us. We kept reshooting and enhancing, but you can&#x27;t fix something that&#x27;s bad.&quot;

==Reception==
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

In a one-star (out of four) review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as a &quot;brainless feature-length sitcom with too much sit and no com&quot;, lamenting its predictable plot points and &quot;its use of runaway cliches&quot;. Ebert added that the film &quot;was recycled from the French, by the team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel&quot; ... and &quot;is astonishing, given the superior quality of their collaborations like &quot;Parenthood&quot; and &quot;City Slickers&quot;&quot;.

Among the few positive reviews were Desson Thomson&#x27;s of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Janet Maslin&#x27;s of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; the latter of whom wrote, &quot;Not surprisingly, there are some slow patches and formulaic touches, but that&#x27;s a fair trade for the fun of watching Mr. Williams and Mr. Crystal make an irresistible comic team&quot;. Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot; is a mildly diverting summer family comedy. In general, that&#x27;s not a bad rap, but when you&#x27;ve got an expectant blockbuster that stars Robin Williams and Billy Crystal and has been directed by Ivan Reitman — all of them true kings of comedy — them words &#x27;mildly diverting&#x27; are clearly less than the desired result.&quot;

Julia Louis-Dreyfus was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her work in the film, but she lost to Alicia Silverstone for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. The film was also nominated for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, but barely lost to &quot;8 Heads in a Duffel Bag&quot;.

<text>The concept of &quot;British history&quot; began to emerge in the 1600s, largely thanks to the attempts of King James II to assert that the Union of the Crowns of 1603 had created a Kingdom of Great Britain, which in fact did not come into existence until a century later. The governance of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland remained separate until 1707, and until then in most ways the Scots were excluded from sharing in the English overseas possessions.

This page presents a timeline of events in English and Scottish history from 1600 until 1699.

*1603 – Death of Queen Elizabeth I on 24 March
*1603 England – James VI of Scotland crowned King of England (as James I of England)
*1603 England – Plague
*1605 England and Scotland – on 5 November, the Gunpowder plot is uncovered, in which Guy Fawkes and other catholic associates attempted to blow up the king, James VI and I and the Parliament of England.
*1618 England – Execution of Sir Walter Raleigh
*1625 England and Scotland – Death of James VI and I on 27 March
*1639 England and Scotland – At war until 1644 in what become known as the Bishops&#x27; Wars
*1640 England – The Long Parliament summoned.
*1642 England – English Civil War begins (see Timeline of the English Civil War)
*1652 England – Tea arrives in Britain
*1666 England 1688 England – The Glorious Revolution replaces James II with William III
*1689 England and Scotland – The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Claim of Right Act 1689 are enacted by the Parliament of England and Parliament of Scotland

<text>&quot;Seven Day Mile&quot; is a song by the Irish band The Frames, from their third album &quot;Dance the Devil&quot;.

<doc id="961943" wikidata="Q2505327" url="?curid=961943" title="Romanization of Ukrainian">
<text>The romanization of Ukrainian, or Latinization of Ukrainian, is the representation of the Ukrainian language in Latin letters. Ukrainian is natively written in its own Ukrainian alphabet, which is based on the Cyrillic script. Romanization may be employed to represent Ukrainian text or pronunciation for non-Ukrainian readers, on computer systems that cannot reproduce Cyrillic characters, or for typists who are not familiar with the Ukrainian keyboard layout. Methods of romanization include transliteration (representing written text) and transcription (representing the spoken word).

In contrast to romanization, there have been several historical proposals for a native Ukrainian Latin alphabet, usually based on those used by West Slavic languages, but none have been widely accepted.

==Romanization systems==
===Transliteration===
Transliteration is the letter-for-letter representation of text using another writing system. Rudnyckyj classified transliteration systems into scientific transliteration, used in academic and especially linguistic works, and practical systems, used in administration, journalism, in the postal system, in schools, etc. Scientific transliteration, also called the scholarly system, is used internationally, with very little variation, while the various practical methods of transliteration are adapted to the orthographical conventions of other languages, like English, French, German, etc.

Depending on the purpose of the transliteration it may be necessary to be able to reconstruct the original text, or it may be preferable to have a transliteration which sounds like the original language when read aloud.

====Scientific transliteration====
&quot;Scientific transliteration&quot;, also called the &quot;academic&quot;, &quot;linguistic&quot;, &quot;international&quot;, or &quot;scholarly&quot; system, is most often seen in linguistic publications on Slavic languages. It is purely phonemic, meaning each character represents one meaningful unit of sound, and is based on the Croatian Latin alphabet. Different variations are appropriate to represent the phonology of historical Old Ukrainian (mid 11th–14th centuries) and Middle Ukrainian (15th–18th centuries).

A variation was codified in the 1898 Prussian Instructions for libraries, or &quot;Preußische Instruktionen&quot; (PI), and widely used in bibliographic cataloguing in Central Europe and Scandinavia. With further modifications it was published by the International Organization for Standardization as recommendation ISO/R 9 in 1954, revised in 1968, and again as an international standard in 1986 and 1995.

Representing all of the necessary diacritics on computers requires Unicode, Latin-2, Latin-4, or Latin-7 encoding. Other Slavic based romanizations occasionally seen are those based on the Slovak alphabet or the Polish alphabet, which include symbols for palatalized consonants.

====Library of Congress system====
The &quot;ALA-LC Romanization Tables&quot; were first discussed by the American Library Association in 1885, and published in 1904 and 1908, including rules for romanizing Church Slavic, the pre-reform Russian alphabet, and Serbo-Croatian. Revised tables including Ukrainian were published in 1941, and remain in use virtually unchanged according to the latest 2011 release. This system is used to represent bibliographic information by US and Canadian libraries, by the British Library since 1975, and in North American publications.

In addition to bibliographic cataloguing, simplified versions of the Library of Congress system are widely used for romanization in the text of academic and general publications. For notes or bibliographical references, some publications use a version without ligatures, which offers sufficient precision but simplifies the typesetting burden and easing readability. For specialist audiences or those familiar with Slavic languages, a version without ligatures and diacritical marks is sometimes used. For broader audiences, a &quot;modified Library of Congress system&quot; is employed for personal, organizational, and place names, omitting all ligatures and diacritics, ignoring the soft sign ь (ʹ), with initial Є- (&quot;I͡E-&quot;), Й- (&quot;Ĭ-&quot;), Ю- ( &quot;I͡U-&quot;), and Я- (&quot;I͡A-&quot;) represented by &quot;Ye-&quot;, &quot;Y-&quot;, &quot;Yu-&quot;, and &quot;Ya-&quot;, surnames&#x27; terminal -ий (&quot;-yĭ&quot;) and -ій (&quot;-iĭ&quot;) endings simplified to &quot;-y&quot;, and sometimes with common first names anglicized, for example, Олександр (&quot;Oleksandr&quot;) written as &quot;Alexander&quot;.

Similar principles were systematically described for Russian by J. Thomas Shaw in 1969, and since widely adopted. Their application for Ukrainian and multilingual text were described in the 1984 English translation of Kubiiovych&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Ukraine&quot; and in the 1997 translation of Hrushevskyi&#x27;s &quot;History of Ukraine-Rus&quot;, and other sources have referred to these, for example, historian Serhii Plokhy in several works. However, the details of usage vary, for example, the authors of the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Ukraine&quot; render the soft sign ь before о with an &quot;i&quot;, &quot;thus Khvyliovy, not Khvylovy, as in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ukraine&quot;&quot;.

Requires Unicode for connecting diacritics, but only plain ASCII characters for a simplified version.

==== British Standard ====
&quot;British Standard 2979:1958 &quot;Transliteration of Cyrillic and Greek Characters&quot;&quot;, from BSI, is used by the Oxford University Press. A variation is used by the British Museum and British Library, but since 1975 their new acquisitions have been catalogued using Library of Congress transliteration.

In addition to the &quot;British&quot; system, the standard also includes tables for the &quot;International&quot; system for Cyrillic, corresponding to ISO/R 9:1968 (and ISO&#x27;s recommendation reciprocally has an alternate system corresponding to BSI&#x27;s). It also includes tables for romanization of Greek.

====BGN/PCGN====
&quot;BGN/PCGN romanization&quot; is a series of standards approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names and Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use. Pronunciation is intuitive for English-speakers. For Ukrainian, the former BGN/PCGN system was adopted in 1965, but superseded there by the Ukrainian National System in 2019. A modified version is also mentioned in the Oxford Style Manual.

Requires only ASCII characters if optional separators are not used.

====GOST (1971, 1983)/Derzhstandart (1995, 2021)====
The Soviet Union&#x27;s GOST, COMECON&#x27;s SEV, and Ukraine&#x27;s Derzhstandart are government standards bodies of the former Eurasian communist countries. They published a series of romanization systems for Ukrainian, which were replaced by ISO 9:1995. For details, see GOST 16876-71. 

==== DSTU 9112:2021 ====

On 1 April 2022, the &quot;Cyrillic-Latin transliteration and Latin-Cyrillic retransliteration of Ukrainian texts. Writing rules&quot; (ДСТУ 9112:2021) was approved as State Standard of Ukraine. The standard is based on modified ISO 9:1995 standard and was developed by the Technical Committee 144 &quot;Information and Documentation&quot; of the State Scientific and Technical Library of Ukraine. According to the SSTL, it could be used in future cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine, in which &quot;Ukrainian will soon, along with other European languages, take its rightful place in multilingual natural language processing scenarios, including machine translation.&quot;

The Derzhstandart 1995 system (invented by Maksym Vakulenko) is also mentioned in the DSTU 9112:2021 standard (approved in 2022) as the &quot;B system&quot;; the new standard also includes an &quot;A system&quot; with diacritical marks and some differences from ISO 9:1995: г=ğ, ґ=g, є=je, и=y, і=i, х=x, ь=j, ю=ju, я=ja.

====ISO 9====
ISO 9 is a series of systems from the International Organization for Standardization. The ISO published editions of its &quot;international system&quot; for romanization of Cyrillic as recommendations (ISO/R 9) in 1954 and 1968, and standards (ISO 9) in 1986 and 1995. This was originally derived from scientific transliteration in 1954, and is meant to be usable by readers of most European languages. The 1968 edition also included an alternative system identical to the British Standard.

The 1995 edition supports most national Cyrillic alphabets in a single transliteration table. It is a pure transliteration system, with each Cyrillic character represented by exactly one unique Latin character, making it reliably reversible, but sacrificing readability and adaptation to individual languages. It considers only graphemes and disregards phonemic differences. So, for example, г (Ukrainian He or Russian Ge) is always represented by the transliteration &quot;g&quot;; ґ (Ukrainian letter Ge) is represented by &quot;g̀&quot;.

Representing all of the necessary diacritics on computers requires Unicode, and a few characters are rarely present in computer fonts, for example g-grave: g̀.

====Ukrainian National transliteration====
This is the official system of Ukraine, also employed by the United Nations and many countries&#x27; foreign services. It is currently widely used to represent Ukrainian geographic names, which were almost exclusively romanized from Russian before Ukraine&#x27;s independence in 1991, and for personal names in passports. It is based on English orthography, and requires only ASCII characters with no diacritics. It can be considered a variant of the &quot;modified Library of Congress system&quot;, but does not simplify the -ий and -ій endings.

Its first version was codified in Decision No. 9 of the Ukrainian Committee on Issues of Legal Terminology on April 19, 1996, stating that the system is binding for the transliteration of Ukrainian names in English in legislative and official acts.

A new official system was introduced for transliteration of Ukrainian personal names in Ukrainian passports in 2007.

An updated 2010 version became the system used for transliterating all proper names and was approved as Resolution 55 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, January 27, 2010. This modified earlier laws and brought together a unified system for official documents, publication of cartographic works, signs and indicators of inhabited localities, streets, stops, subway stations, etc.

It has been adopted internationally. The 27th session of the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN) held in New York 30 July and 10 August 2012 after a report by the State Agency of Land Resources of Ukraine (now known as Derzhheokadastr: Ukraine State Service of Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre) experts approved the Ukrainian system of romanization. The BGN/PCGN jointly adopted the system in 2019.

Official geographic names are romanized directly from the original Ukrainian and not translated. For example, &quot;Kyivska oblast&quot; not &quot;Kyiv Oblast&quot;, &quot;Pivnichnokrymskyi kanal&quot; not &quot;North Crimean Canal&quot;.

====Romanization for other languages than English====

Romanization intended for readers of other languages than English is usually transcribed phonetically into the familiar orthography. For example, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;kh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;shch&quot; for anglophones may be transcribed &quot;j&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;tsch&quot;, &quot;sch&quot;, &quot;schtsch&quot; for German readers (for letters й, х, ч, ш, щ), or it may be rendered in Latin letters according to the normal orthography of another Slavic language, such as Polish or Croatian (such as the established system of scientific transliteration, described above).

Czech and Slovak standard transliteration uses letters with diacritics (ž, š, č, ď, ť, ň, ě) and letters i, y, j, h, ch, c in the local meaning. Diphthong letters are transcribed as two letters (ja, je, ji, ju, šč). Czech transliteration was used, for example, on hiking signs in Transcarpathia, which was established according to the methodology of the Czech Tourists Club – the Ukrainian markers replaced that later with the English transcription. However, the fact that Ukraine itself has started to use English transliteration on its documents and boards, also influences the practice in Czech and Slovak, which is also penetrated by English transliteration of Ukrainian.

====Ad hoc romanization====
Users of public-access computers or mobile text messaging services sometimes improvise informal romanization due to limitations in keyboard or character set. These may include both sound-alike and look-alike letter substitutions. Example: &quot;YKPAIHCbKA ABTOPKA&quot; for &quot;УКРАЇНСЬКА АВТОРКА&quot;. See also Volapuk encoding.

This system uses the available character set.

====Ukrainian telegraph code====
For telegraph transmission. Each separate Ukrainian letter had a 1:1 equivalence to a Latin letter. Latin Q, W, V, and X are equivalent to Ukrainian Я (or sometimes Щ), В, Ж, Ь. Other letters are transcribed phonetically. This equivalency is used in building the KOI8-U table.

===Transcription===
Transcription is the representation of the spoken word. Phonological, or phonemic, transcription represents the phonemes, or meaningful sounds of a language, and is useful to describe the general pronunciation of a word. Phonetic transcription represents every single sound, or phone, and can be used to compare different dialects of a language. Both methods can use the same sets of symbols, but linguists usually denote phonemic transcriptions by enclosing them in slashes / ... /, while phonetic transcriptions are enclosed in square brackets [ ... ].

; IPA
The International Phonetic Alphabet precisely represents pronunciation. It requires a special Unicode font.

==Conventional romanization of proper names== 
In many contexts, it is common to use a modified system of transliteration that strives to be read and pronounced naturally by anglophones. Such transcriptions are also used for the surnames of people of Ukrainian ancestry in English-speaking countries (personal names have often been translated to equivalent or similar English names, e.g., &quot;Alexander&quot; for &quot;Oleksandr&quot;, &quot;Terry&quot; for &quot;Taras&quot;).

Typically such a modified transliteration is based on the ALA-LC, or Library of Congress (in North America), or, less commonly, the British Standard system. Such a simplified system usually omits diacritics and ligatures (tie-bars) from, e.g., &quot;i͡e&quot;, &quot;ï&quot; or &quot;ĭ&quot;, often simplifies &quot;-yĭ&quot; and &quot;-iĭ&quot; word endings to &quot;-y&quot;, omits romanizing the Ukrainian soft sign (&quot;ь&quot;) and apostrophe (&quot;&#x27;&quot;), and may substitute &quot;ya, ye, yu, yo&quot; for &quot;ia, ie, iu, io&quot; at the beginnings of words. It may also simplify doubled letters. Unlike in the English language where an apostrophe is punctuation, in the Ukrainian language it is a letter. Therefore sometimes Rus&#x27; is translated with an apostrophe, even when the apostrophe is dropped for most other names and words.

Conventional transliterations can reflect the history of a person or place. Many well-known spellings are based on transcriptions into another Latin alphabet, such as the German or Polish. Others are transcribed from equivalent names in other languages, for example Ukrainian &quot;Pavlo&quot; (&quot;Paul&quot;) may be called by the Russian equivalent &quot;Pavel&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;Kyiv&quot; by the Russian equivalent &quot;Kiev&quot;.

The employment of romanization systems can become complex. For example, the English translation of Kubijovyč&#x27;s &quot;Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopædia&quot; uses a modified Library of Congress (ALA-LC) system as outlined above for Ukrainian and Russian names—with the exceptions for endings or doubled consonants applying variously to personal and geographic names. For technical reasons, maps in the Encyclopedia follow different conventions. Names of persons are anglicized in the encyclopedia&#x27;s text, but also presented in their original form in the index. Various geographic names are presented in their anglicized, Russian, or both Ukrainian and Polish forms, and appear in several forms in the index. Scientific transliteration is used in linguistics articles. The Encyclopedia&#x27;s explanation of its transliteration and naming convention occupies 2-1/2 pages.

<doc id="961947" wikidata="Q1287406" url="?curid=961947" title="James Daly (actor)">
<text>James Firman Daly (October 23, 1918 – July 3, 1978) was an American theater, film, and television actor, who is perhaps best known for his role as Paul Lochner in the hospital drama series &quot;Medical Center&quot;, in which he played Chad Everett&#x27;s superior.

==Early life==
Daly was born in Wisconsin Rapids in Wood County in central Wisconsin, to Dorothy Ethelbert (Hogan) Mullen, who later worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, and Percifer Charles Daly, a fuel merchant. During the 1930s, Daly studied drama and acted in shows before serving in three branches of the armed forces, including six months as an infantryman in the U.S. Army, two months as a cadet in the Army Air Corps, and more than four years in the Navy as an ensign during World War II.

Daly attended the University of Wisconsin, State University of Iowa, and Carroll College before receiving a degree from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Cornell College later presented him with an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree.

==Career==
Daly was an accomplished stage actor, starting out in 1946 as Gary Merrill&#x27;s understudy in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. His starring roles on Broadway included Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;J.B.&quot; and Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Period of Adjustment&quot;.

Between 1953 and 1955, Daly appeared in the TV series &quot;Foreign Intrigue&quot;. He guest-starred on many television series, including &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot; (two episodes), &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shock&quot;), DuPont Cavalcade Theater (&quot;One Day at a Time&quot; 1955) portraying Bill Wilson the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;A Stop at Willoughby&quot;), &quot;The Tenderfoot&quot; (1964) for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot;, &quot;The Road West&quot; (1966 episode &quot;The Gunfighter&quot;), &quot;Custer&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1967 episode &quot;The Favor&quot;), &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. He portrayed Mr. Flint (an apparently immortal human) in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; (1969). He starred in &quot;Medical Center&quot; on CBS from 1969-1975.

In 1958, Daly signed a contract with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to do television commercials for Camel cigarettes. He served as the Camel representative for seven years, being flown by Reynolds throughout the United States to be filmed smoking a Camel cigarette at various locations.

In addition to his acting career, Daly was one of the hosts on NBC Radio&#x27;s weekend &quot;Monitor&quot; program in 1963–1964.

Daly&#x27;s last screen role was as Mr. Boyce in the mini-series &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
According to his son Tim Daly during an interview on &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, James Daly came out to Tim as gay a decade after divorcing his wife Hope. His struggle to come to terms with his sexual orientation nearly put a rift between him and his family. As homosexuality was still considered a mental illness until the early 1970s, he and his wife tried and failed at &quot;curing&quot; him. After their divorce, Daly decided to limit his contact with his children out of fear that they would end up mentally ill themselves.

Two of Daly&#x27;s children, Tyne Daly and Tim Daly, and his grandson, Sam Daly, are actors. Tyne appeared on Daly&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Foreign Intrigue&quot;, as a child. She also played Jennifer Lochner, Paul Lochner&#x27;s adult daughter, on &quot;Medical Center&quot; in the 1970 season 1 episode Moment of Decision. The elder Daly and his daughter both guest-starred separately in the original &quot;&quot; TV series. Tim appeared as a child with his father in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;. Daly had two other children: daughters Mary Glynn and Pegeen Michael.

==Death==
Daly died on July 3, 1978, of heart failure in Nyack, New York, two years after &quot;Medical Center&quot; ended, and while he was preparing to star in the play &quot;Equus&quot; in Tarrytown, New York. His ashes were scattered into the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="961949" wikidata="Q3234777" url="?curid=961949" title="Superstars (British TV programme)">
<text>Superstars is a TV sports competition in which elite athletes from a variety of sports compete against each other in a number of events, resembling a decathlon. The athletes must not compete in the sport for which they practice as their profession. Points are awarded for the position in which the competitor places in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is declared the champion.

On the original ABC version, an athlete was able to compete in a maximum of seven events, but no athlete was permitted to compete in the sport(s) of his or her profession. In the World, International, European, and British versions of the contest, athletes would compete in 8 out of 10 events, with no one allowed to take part in their own sport, although some handicapping rules did apply.

The idea was developed by 1948 and 1952 Olympic figure skating champion Dick Button. He shopped the idea to all three U.S. television networks, and ABC bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first Superstars competition was held in Rotonda West, Florida in February 1973 and was won by pole vaulter Bob Seagren. The BBC covered the competition and aired their own programme, featuring British athletes, on December 31, 1973, which was won by 400-meter hurdles Olympic champion David Hemery. Television broadcasts of the competitions were popular both in Europe and North America in the 1970s and 1980s. Further events featuring European athletes started in 1975, with six World Superstar championships taking place from 1977 to 1982.

Competitors participate in a range of different sporting events, including a 100-yard dash/100m sprint, a half mile (800 m) run, an obstacle course or steeplechase, weightlifting, soccer skills, rowing, tennis, basketball, bicycle racing, shooting and swimming. The sports have varied over time and between the various national and international competitions; in the first competition, there was no obstacle course, but table tennis and baseball hitting were included, while the European versions featured a 600-meter steeplechase, indoor cycling on a highly banked velodrome, and the infamous &quot;Gym Tests&quot;.

Canadian soccer player Brian Budd was unbeaten in Superstars contests, winning the World Championship three times consecutively from 1978 to 1980, making him the most successful Superstar of all time.

==British, European and International Superstars==

===1973===

Originally aired in the US by ABC in February 1973, &quot;S&quot;uperstars was the first broadcast in Britain on December 31, 1973, as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Sporting Superstars&quot;, closely following the American format. David Vine, who was the main presenter of the BBC programme from 1973 to 1985, said, &quot;In 1972, Ron Pickering, myself, Don Revie, Billy Bremner and TV producer Barney Colehan sat in a hotel in Leeds and formulated Superstars, but the BBC dismissed the idea. Then Dick Button started it in the States, and the BBC bought the rights&quot;.

Recorded at Crystal Palace in August and promoted as a challenge between Britain&#x27;s seven best sportsmen, the contest was won by David Hemery, the 1968 Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles, defeating Jackie Stewart, Bobby Moore, Joe Bugner, Roger Taylor, Tony Jacklin and Barry John. Featuring the first ever gym test (devised by Pickering and comprising circuit running, a medicine ball throw, parallel bar dips, and squat thrusts), the event came down to the final steeplechase, where Hemery overcame a 100-meter handicap to pass Barry John with 60 metres left. Shown on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the programme was a major success and was repeated the following year.

===1974===
In the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight Boxing Champion John Conteh comfortably beat an ill Hemery and Colin Bell to win the title, again at Crystal Palace. Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the contest with increasing his abilities as a boxer. The inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country&#x27;s &quot;top sportsman&quot; and also providing an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and Lynn Davies) could extend their careers.

===1975===
Following the success of the first two standalone UK competitions, in 1975 the British national Superstars contest was suspended, and the event was widened to include participants from continental Europe. Five preliminary heats were held, followed by a final at the Ahoy indoor arena in Rotterdam, famous for its banked, wooden cycling track. This proved to make Superstars a major hit, achieving large audiences across the continent and paving the way for the International and World Superstars editions to follow.

Memorable events in the first year of European Superstars included Malcolm Macdonald winning the 100m sprint in a Superstars record time of 10.9 seconds (after being made to run the race twice following the false start of another competitor), David Hemery being beaten by Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize following a fall in the 600m Steeplechase, Swedish discus thrower Ricky Bruch setting records in the weight lifting and medicine ball throw sections of the gym tests, and the first appearance of pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, who dominated the final heat in Sweden, scoring a then record 69 (out of a possible 80) points.

Prior to the final in Rotterdam, Kruize sustained serious injuries in a car accident and was substituted by Hemery, who ultimately secured the second-place position. Kjell Isaksson dominated the event again, winning four of his eight events and finished second or third in three others, winning the title with an event to spare.

The rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in &quot;near specialist&quot; events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery made up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, after again falling badly at the water jump and running the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.

===1976===
In 1976 national competitions were resumed and Hemery again became UK Superstar, beating Conteh and Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt easily. By now Hemery was a &quot;professional Superstar&quot;, competing in Britain, Europe and the US, and devising his own training regime. His performances duly improved, and even though 1976 Olympic Judoka David Starbrook took his parallel bar dips record in the gym tests, Hemery had become Britain&#x27;s top competitor.

 In European Superstars, Isaksson beat Hemery in a heat held in Sweden. Two of the highest-profile heat winners, Björn Borg and Kevin Keegan, were not able to compete in the Rotterdam final due to scheduling conflicts. Keegan&#x27;s victory produced a memorable moment when he crashed during the cycle racing in his heat. With deep cuts and abrasions to his arm, shoulder and back, the Liverpool footballer was expected to withdraw, but with a large crowd present to watch him he said &quot;These people here in the stands have come here to see me make a fool of myself and they&#x27;ve got a right to it!&quot;, got back on his bike and won the re-ride. Keegan then easily won the steeplechase, but like many of the highest-profile performers, his schedule was too full to allow him to compete as regularly as the Superstars format demanded. Partly because of this, less renowned athletes such as Isaksson came to dominate and be recognised outside their specialisms.

In the Ahoy final, Isaksson won five events and finished 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. The top eight finishers were also guaranteed a place at the inaugural World Superstars competition, to be held in the US the following year.

===1977===
1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower Tim Crooks beat shot putter Geoff Capes in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to François Tracanelli in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was Rugby league player Keith Fielding, who finished a close second, matching Hemery&#x27;s best ever performance by a British Superstar.

The winner of 1977 European Superstars was the returning Ties Kruize, who was now fully recovered from his car crash. With just the indoor steeplechase left, Kruize was one point behind Jean-Paul Coche but five ahead of Fielding. With Coche having completed his events Fielding needed to win the final race, with Kruize finishing no better than third. With Fielding already finished (and celebrating) Kruize passed speed skater Hans van Helden on the final straight to win by 2.5 points. An exhausted Fielding then told BBC TV that the loss was &quot;a damn, bloody shame&quot;, but both qualified for the 1978 World Championship.

===1979===
There was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new &quot;Past Masters&quot; event for competitors over 35, which was won by Lynn Davies, the 1964 Olympic Long Jump champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka Brian Jacks, who became Britain&#x27;s most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.

No Briton had ever won this title, but Jacks was a strong favourite against defending champion Ties Kruize. Jack won the gym tests and set a new record time in the cycling. At the start of the final event, the steeplechase, Jacks had a small lead, but was out of events. Kruize accumulated enough points in the steeplechase to join Jacks in a tie for first place. With no tie-breaking system in operation, both men were crowned European Superstar, making Jacks the most successful British Superstar ever. Jacks succumbed to shingles in late 1979 so was unable to travel to The Bahamas for the World Championship.

===1980===
&quot;Superstars&quot; regularly attracted over 10 million TV viewers in the UK and Jacks became a household name, appearing on children&#x27;s TV shows and picking up endorsements usually beyond the reach of a minority sport participant. &quot;Superstars&quot; also expanded again in 1980, adding International Superstars to its list of programmes, though this was as a direct replacement for the European event. Although popular in the UK, US, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia, &quot;Superstars&quot; reached their peak at the turn of the decade, and one by one (starting in Europe) the participating nations fell away.

Against Jacks in 1980 was Daley Thompson, globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the 1980 Olympic Games decathlon competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, Steve Assinder from Basketball, pentathlete Danny Nightingale and the new &quot;Past Master&quot;, former 400m hurdler John Sherwood, who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.

In the gym tests Jacks scored 80 in the dips and 73 in the squat thrusts, and finished 18 points ahead of Sherwood in second place. Thompson finished third. John Sherwood in finishing in second place gained a place in the World Championships and with it the possibility of big prize money. To ensure that he was able to finish second Sherwood had to turn professional part-way through the competition in order to compete in the 100m (as his status as an amateur track and field athlete would normally have barred him from competing in this event). Although many amateur athletes (most notably Kjell Isaksson) had competed in Superstars since its inception, they had never been able to retain any prize money, with this instead of going to their sport. In winning three World Superstar titles, Brian Budd won over $130,000, while Bob Seagren (the first World Champion) won over $200,000.

In International Superstars in Israel Jacks defeated both of the other European Superstars champions Ties Kruize and Kjell Isaksson, as well as 1980 Tour de France winner Joop Zoetemelk to claim the new title.

For Sherwood – a PE teacher from Sheffield at this time, and not a full-time sportsman – the World Championship proved to be a success, but not for Jacks, aiming to become the first European to win the title. In The Bahamas both Britons won events: Jacks in the weightlifting and the gym tests—after an epic struggle against Brian Budd—and Sherwood in the cycle race. However, it was Sherwood&#x27;s two second-places in the football and 800 metres that propelled him into second place, with the cycling coming at Jack&#x27;s expense, and winning him $15,000 in the process. He was officially now Britain&#x27;s best ever Superstar, although he had still finished 26 points behind Budd.

===1981===

To start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off &quot;Challenge of the Champions&quot; programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two &quot;Past Masters&quot; and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.

This was arguably the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and with so many competitive sportsmen present it was no surprise that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his &quot;banker&quot; events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles. His performance in the gym tests was astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds.

The key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others – simple in theory, but hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot than his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks&#x27; strategy by enough to beat him.

Early on Jacks was looking good, beating Fielding in a record time to win the canoeing, but once Fielding had won the cycling Jacks was beaten. Fielding had entered the event hoping to take the Superstars 100m record first and foremost, and then to put up a good showing against Jacks. Now he was the ultimate champion.

The key had been his ability to score well throughout – he was second in the steeplechase for instance – and even losing his &quot;banker&quot; (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.

Here, in a new venue Bath, the Rugby League winger reached his Superstars highpoint, dominating Davies, pentathlete Jim Fox and new challenger Andy Ripley from Rugby Union with a strong all-round performance. He had his share of luck (water skier Mike Hazelwood was tied in first place in the shooting when he misfired the decisive shot, gifting 10 points to Fielding) but he was on top form this season. He had every reason to believe he had a strong chance in both International and World Superstars later that year, but, as so often in Superstars, he could not hold his form; the ever-increasing levels of competition saw him lose, first to a resurgent Ripley in the Second International, then to a motor-oil powered Jody Scheckter in the 1981 World Final. Again, Fielding would never win another Superstars event.

===1982: A British World Champion===
Since 1978, the BBC had also produced an equally popular British Superteams event, which was dominated from the start by the &quot;Athletes&quot; – a team of track and field stars, who won every series but the final one in 1985. From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was Brian Hooper, a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a balance beam in the obstacle course event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.

Leading the 1982 Athletes team to Superteams victory, Hooper was trailed by the BBC as the new challenger to watch in that season&#x27;s UK final. He was a strong swimmer, almost unbeatable in the canoeing and gym tests, and competitive in all his other events. And then he lost in his heat, to Karate fighter Vic Charles, and his promise seemed lost. However, Charles was unable to compete in 1982 final, and Hooper was his replacement. He would go on to win his next five straight Superstars events, becoming two times British Superstar, three-time International Superstar, and the 1982 World Superstar Champion. Only Brian Budd has a better record in the competition.

Hooper&#x27;s victory in the 1982 World Championship came at the expense of defending World Champion Jody Scheckter, and American Footballers James Lofton, Cris Collinsworth and Mark Gastineau. Hooper later stated that he felt pressured by the aggressive nature of the US challengers, which came to a head in the final of the bike race, where he found himself boxed in by several rivals all seemingly working in concert to hold him back. Charging through powerfully and fairly, Hooper finished comfortably in the lead, but was then faced with official protests, claiming he either took a short-cut off the track or otherwise acted illegally. He clearly had not, and was quickly declared the legitimate winner. Victories in the rowing and second place in the gym test and swimming saw him win by just 3/4 of a point from talented runner Lofton. He was however 10 3/4 points clear entering the final event (and thus guaranteed to win the title) and coasted through his obstacle course heat. As only the two fastest heat winners ran in the final, Hooper could not add to his tally. Lofton on the other hand had $10000 to fight for bested Renaldo Nehemiah in the final event, and duly took second place, something again he was virtually guaranteed before the event.

By now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event at age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the kayaking and came second in golf, almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.

===1983 to 1985: End of the first era===

Though Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete Garry Cook. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of Des Drummond in the 100m, with the agile Leigh Rugby League player managing to lower the markdown to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).

In the 1984 final, Garry Cook was pushed very close by professional stunt performer and motorcycle racer Eddie Kidd, but he held on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular &quot;Superteams&quot; series as part of the never-defeated &quot;Athletes&quot; team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now, the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of &quot;freshening up&quot; and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerized scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to Portsmouth and took on a naval theme, adding a field gun competition in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of &quot;Superteams&quot; was duly won by &quot;Watersports&quot; (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer Robin Brew who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.

Continuing this success, Brew reached the final of the 1985 UK national championship where he narrowly beat a strong field, including Rugby league player Joe Lydon, Olympic silver medallist Judoka Neil Adams and then only a one-time Olympic gold medal winning rower, Steve Redgrave. The RAF officer then completed a successful first year in Superstars by becoming the last ever international champion, this time much more comfortably.

A new period of Superstars dominance could have evolved for Brew, but with the UK version being the only surviving national championship outside the United States, and no prospect of World Superstars being revived, once TWI decided to halt production of International Superstars the BBC version was soon cancelled as well. With viewing figures falling, and potential participants ever more disincentive into not entering by scheduling conflicts and insurance demands, the BBC&#x27;s decision to end the show was neither unexpected or mourned, and although David Vine, Ron Pickering and executive producer Peter Hylton Cleaver did fight to keep the show on air, it was all to no avail.

Over the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, Stan Bowles shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;) regularly made use of this footage – and kept the show in the public spotlight – while Sky Sports began to show full-length programmes on its &quot;Sky Sports Classic&quot; channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show, created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 Sport Relief charity event.

=== 2002 to 2004: Sport Relief and a new era ===
In 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual Sport Relief charity telethon. Featuring a field including Sir Steve Redgrave, Martin Offiah, John Regis, Austin Healey and Chris Boardman, the event was a first for a British Superstars event in that it featured both non-British competitors (Dwight Yorke and Gianluca Vialli) and also female participants (Alex Coomber and Stephanie Cook). With only seven events (as opposed to the usual eight or ten) and being only part of a larger event instead of being a stand-alone series, the contest was different from those of the earlier era.

While the participants were no less able, the event was less &quot;competitive&quot;, with no prize money at stake and no European, World or International contest to qualify for. It was dominated by Healey, who won four of his five events, and came runner-up in the other. Stephanie Cook was the other stand-out performer, finishing joint second with Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman, and finishing runner-up in two events.

The event was an overwhelming success, and it inspired the BBC to create a new UK Championship series in 2003. Produced by TWI and held in La Manga Club in Spain, this time it was a full event with heats and a final, something that had not been part of the series since 1983.

===2008: Revival on Five===
On 29 April 2008, it was announced that the show would be returning on Five for the summer of 2008. It was produced by TWI with eight one-hour shows. In a change of format, the competitors were split into four teams, captained by Kelly Holmes, Steve Redgrave, Roger Black and Mike Catt.

===2012: Olympic Superstars===
Following the success of Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics, the BBC revived &quot;Superstars&quot; for a single special edition that aired on Saturday 29 December at 6.45 pm, comprising a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s UK championship. Presented by Gabby Logan, Iwan Thomas and Denise Lewis, the event was held on 24 and 25 November 2012, at the sports facilities of the University of Bath.

The show featured Olympic medallists who were coached for swimming by Rebecca Adlington, and the competitors were: Alistair Brownlee, Jonathan Brownlee, Mo Farah, Robbie Grabarz, Michael Jamieson, Anthony Joshua, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Peter Wilson, Nicola Adams, Lizzie Armitstead, Laura Bechtolsheimer, Gemma Gibbons, Helen Glover, Katherine Grainger, Jade Jones, Christine Ohuruogu.

The Men&#x27;s Championship was won comfortably by Olympic Super-heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, while the Women&#x27;s Championship was won even more convincingly by women&#x27;s coxless pair Olympic champion Helen Glover. Joshua won with an event to spare, while Glover won her final event (the Gym Tests) to win the Women&#x27;s Superstars title by 14 points.

===List of Champions===
====British Men&#x27;s National Superstars====

* In 2002 Stephanie Cook and Chris Boardman finished as joint-runners up of the British Championship.

====British Women&#x27;s National Superstars====

* In 2003 Zoë Baker and Lesley McKenna finished as joint-winners of the British Women&#x27;s Championship.

====European and International Superstars====
* In 1979 Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks finished as joint-winners of the European Championship.

===Miscellany and records===
* Three men each won two European or International Superstars championships: Swedish pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize and British judoka Brian Jacks. Brian Hooper won three, and one World championship.
* One of the European competitors was Ivo Van Damme, a middle-distance runner who was killed in a road accident in 1976.
*For most of the duration of the run of this programme on BBC TV, the programmes&#x27; producer was Peter Hylton Cleaver.
* Brian Jacks had a computer game based on the competition, &quot;Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge&quot;, named after him.
* In 1982, electronic scoring systems were introduced, with pressure pads for the squat thrusts. These originally ran on the VIC-20, and later on the BBC Micro. The programs were developed and the system operated by Simon Taylor.
* In the spin-off called &quot;The Superteams&quot; a memorable moment was when British athlete Garry Cook played goalkeeper in the six-a-side hockey contest without wearing a helmet, running out of the D circle and tackling an opponent.
* The BBC &quot;Superstars&quot; used a musical theme composed by Johnny Pearson titled &quot;Heavy Action&quot;. This piece of music later became familiar to Americans as the theme music for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.
*After each event, the competitor who is ranked first gains 10 points, the next best ranked gets 7, then 4, 2 and then finally 1 point. These points are then totalled up to give a total out of 80 (from a maximum of eight events). Lynn Davies won seven of his eight events in the 1979 UK Past Masters contest and scored 70 points (a record).

==United States Superstars==

&quot;The Superstars&quot; was first broadcast by ABC Sports as a two-hour special in 1973. Bob Seagren, an Olympic pole vault gold medalist, was the first winner. The U.S. version grew to encompass women, entire sporting teams, and celebrities running from 1973 until 2003. It was briefly revived in 2009.

==World Superstars==

===1977 – Callaway Gardens, Georgia, US===
1977 World Superstars Championship Final Result

In 1976, following the success of the &quot;Superstars&quot; programme in the US, Britain and mainland Europe, Dick Button and American host broadcaster ABC decided to organise a World Superstars Final, to be held the following March at Callaway Gardens in Georgia.

The participants in the inaugural &quot;World Superstars Championship&quot; were to be the competitors from across the various national and continental versions of the show with the best records in the previous years, and as such the US was to be represented by its previous national champions Bob Seagren, O. J. Simpson, and three time reigning current champion Kyle Rote, Jr. The rest of the participants were to be drawn from the top six finishers from the 1976 European Superstars final, the top six from the US version in 1977, and the winner of the 1976 Canadian Superstars event. In reality, as was always an issue for Superstars, several competitors withdrew in the weeks before the contest, with Rote and Simpson pulling out just a week before taping, leaving a slightly weakened field headed by Seagren, double European champion Kjell Isaksson, Canadian champion Tony Gabriel and the joint runners-up from the US final Guy Drut and Dave Casper.

Aside from the withdrawals of Rote and Simpson the other major omission from the field was the double British champion and 1975 European runner-up David Hemery who was studying at university in the US, and had failed to qualify for the 1976 European final after finishing a narrow third in his heat. Had he paddled his Kayak 0.4 seconds faster or scored two more points in the pistol shooting he would have made the final, and with other strong European challengers (like Ties Kruize, Kevin Keegan and Björn Borg) also absent, the European challenge was significantly poorer.

The contest started with Rowing, where Peter Snell capitalised on a mistake from fellow athlete Frank Nusse to win the first ten points, then the penalty shoot-out. Here Gareth Edwards was one kick away from winning nearly $5,000, but he fluffed his final shot and had to settle for a five-way tie for second place, while Guy Drut easily won the play-off, and took the money. After this it became a two-way contest between the two pole-vaulters, Isaksson and Seagren.

Controversially, Seagren (by nature of being retired from IAAF competition) was allowed to run in the track and field events, while Isaksson was not. Seagren later admitted that this gave him a major advantage over his younger, Swedish rival, as running was a fundamental part of any pole-vaulter&#x27;s training regime, and thus they had to be favoured in such events. While Seagren was unable to win the 100 yard sprint, he did score two points, and his win in the half-mile race gave him a further ten. Isaksson countered with a win in the gym tests and two second-place finishes in the bike race and weightlifting. Seagren however kept competing strongly and his victory in the swimming and second place in the gym tests saw him take a 33 points to 30 lead over Snell and Isaksson into the final event: the obstacle course.

This event was not held in Europe, and therefore Isaksson was attempting it for the first time. In the heats Isaksson ran a time of 25.81 seconds, while Snell was far behind with 29.2 seconds. Seagren however, with much more experience in the event, ran 0.8 seconds faster than the Swede, finishing in 24.64 seconds. His loss in the final to record holder Lynn Swann was irrelevant; the seven points for second place made him the first World Superstars Champion, and won him $37,000 in the process.

===1978 – Freeport, Bahamas===

1978 World Superstars Championship Final Result

With the Superstars franchise nearing its zenith of popularity, the World Championship returned in 1978 with a 12-man field consisting of the national champions from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the top three finishers from the 1977 European Superstars final, and the top five from the 1978 US National Championship. Completing the line-up was the returning champion, Bob Seagren.

Though the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by Jean-Paul Coche, Keith Fielding and Ties Kruize, while Wayne Grimditch, Greg Pruitt and Dwight Stones (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US. It was the Canadian champion however, Brian Budd, who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.

Budd was a strong all-round athlete, his soccer training covering swimming, running, bike racing and gym work. He also understood that the key to winning Superstars was to win as many points as possible in the events you were good at, and to hold on for as many points as possible in the others. He turned out to be nearly unbeatable in the gym, half-mile race and the swimming, and more than competent in cycling and rowing. In 1978 he won 44 points from these five events alone, ten points more than he needed to become World Champion.

In the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start – according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was &#x27;a flyer&#x27; – and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt&#x27;s shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together. Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding&#x27;s challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from Ron Pickering at track-side.

Fielding eventually battled on bravely to finish fifth (and top European), but it was Bob Seagren who again gave the strongest challenge. His consistent performances won him a clear second place, but he was still 14 points behind Budd. The Canadian had joked and fooled his way through the contest, but it was all a very good act. He was far and away the best multi-disciplined athlete in the field, and he would prove just as unbeatable in the following two years.

===1979 – Freeport, Bahamas===

1979 World Superstars Championship Final Result

The third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of Freeport, Bahamas. Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion. The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane. 

The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury. If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying. Completing the line-up were two invited challengers – not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though. Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septién to &quot;make up the numbers&quot;, even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success. They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America. They would have little impact on the final.

That was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process. He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time. While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd&#x27;s consistency. Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests. In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth.

Budd had set new standards, and most viewers thought him unbeatable. There was only one caveat to this victory. The top Europeans Kruize and Jacks were not present, and with Jacks in particular even more dominant in the gym tests than Budd there were questions asked about what he could have achieved. They would meet a year later.

===1980 – Freeport, Bahamas===

1980 World Superstars Championship Final Result

Brian Budd won by the largest margin ever in the World Championship, winning three of the sports and finishing second in four. Because this was his third consecutive championship, he was not allowed to participate in any more Superstars competitions.

===List of World Superstars Champions===
==Music==
For the British, European and International versions of the show, and in all episodes broadcast in the UK (regardless of where the episode originated) the theme music is &quot;Heavy Action&quot;, written by Johnny Pearson. The strong association of the theme music to Superstars has led to the music being frequently misidentified as &quot;Superstars&quot;, even though it is used in other countries as the theme to other sports events (such as in the United States, where versions of the piece have served as the long-time theme music of the NFL &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts on ABC and later ESPN).

While not necessarily written specifically for the UK version of Superstars (with Heavy Action instead being written by Pearson for the BBC music library in 1970 while he was working on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;), the music has now become synonymous with both Superstars in the UK, and indeed sport in general, still regularly used by the BBC on sports shows, such as during the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The ABC version in the 1970s and 1980s also used an instrumental version of &quot;Superstar&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; as its theme.

<text>Beijing International Studies University (BISU; ; ) is a municipal public college of foreign languages in Chaoyang, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the City of Beijing, and co-funded by the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

==History==
The history of Beijing International Studies University dates back to the 1950s, when People&#x27;s Republic of China started to gain international recognition and the need emerged for proficient foreign language speakers. In the early 1960s, after completing the 14-country state visit, the then-Premier Zhou Enlai initiated the &quot;Seven-Year Plan for Foreign Language Education&quot; and proposed to establish the Beijing Second Foreign Languages Institute, now known as the Beijing International Studies University. The whole founding process was under the supervision of Zhou.

===Origins===
It was proposed by the then Premier Zhou Enlai to the State Council and the establishment of Beijing International Studies University was given the highest priority.
A report for the establishment of BISU was subsequently presented and approved at the State Council in March and later in August, the land where the university has maintained the presence of its main site was granted.
The first 646 students enrolled in September and the Establishment Ceremony was held on 24 October 1964. The university anniversary has been celebrated on that day ever since.

===Development===
The original curriculum framework of the university was built upon its core units in foreign languages, in addition to Chinese literature, arts and philosophy, international/domestic relations, political economy and physical education.
It offered degree programs for 14 foreign languages, including English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German, Japanese, Albanian, Romanian, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, Serbian and Vietnamese.
Affiliated with the Commission for Cultural Relations of Foreign Countries—the predecessor of today&#x27;s Culture Ministry—the university underwent rapid growth until 1966, when the Cultural Revolution started.
The university then changed administration several times over this period, successively administered by the Foreign Ministry (1968), the Beijing Government (1971), the Ministry of Education (1978) and the National Tourism Administration (1983).

In 1981, the report jointly submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the university was approved at the Education Ministry; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was established at BISU.
Concurrently, in the same year, the National Tourism Administration set up the major of tourism management in BISU, making it the earliest shaper of Chinese tourism education.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Beijing International Studies University, also known as the &quot;China Tourism Institute&quot;, prevailed in both teaching and research and was recognized as one of the foremost tertiary institutions for tourism studies.

===2003–present===

Until 2003, BISU was known in English as Beijing Second Foreign Language University;
the name changed to reflect the increasing diversity of programs offered by the university.
Its multi-disciplinary academic structure has been established since the 1990s and 2000s, best known for its business administration programs and foreign languages programs.
The university now offers language courses in English, Japanese, German, Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Korean
and Chinese as a foreign language for international students.
It is one of the first authorized HSK test centers based in Beijing, and has been recognized as one of Beijing&#x27;s best universities for Chinese study.

In 2003, BISU established their school colors and visual identity; this was updated in 2009.

In 2013, the university engaged in a major academic restructuring within its Business and Economics disciplines. In July, the former School of Tourism Management was dissolved, with Departments of Tourism Management and Hotel Management promoted to independent Schools, Departments of Marketing and Financial Management combined to form the School of International Business, and the Department of Event Management merged into the School of Economics and Trade.
The move was part of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the university, intending to endorse greater academic autonomy, take advantage of its heritage in tourism-related subjects and thus to effectively position itself in respond to the changes in the marketplace.

<text>In genetic engineering, a gene gun or biolistic particle delivery system is a device used to deliver exogenous DNA (transgenes), RNA, or protein to cells. By coating particles of a heavy metal with a gene of interest and firing these micro-projectiles into cells using mechanical force, an integration of desired genetic information can be introduced into desired cells. The technique involved with such micro-projectile delivery of DNA is often referred to as biolistics, short for &quot;biological ballistics&quot;.

This device is able to transform almost any type of cell and is not limited to the transformation of the nucleus; it can also transform organelles, including plastids and mitochondria.

==Gene gun design==
The gene gun was originally a Crosman air pistol modified to fire dense tungsten particles. It was invented by John C Sanford, Ed Wolf, and Nelson Allen at Cornell University along with Ted Klein of DuPont between 1983 and 1986. The original target was onions (chosen for their large cell size), and the device was used to deliver particles coated with a marker gene which would relay a signal if proper insertion of the DNA transcript occurred. Genetic transformation was demonstrated upon observed expression of the marker gene within onion cells.

The earliest custom manufactured gene guns (fabricated by Nelson Allen) used a 22 caliber nail gun cartridge to propel a polyethylene cylinder (bullet) down a 22 caliber Douglas barrel. A droplet of the tungsten powder coated with genetic material was placed onto the bullet and shot down into a Petri dish below. The bullet welded to the disk below the Petri plate, and the genetic material blasted into the sample with a doughnut effect involving devastation in the middle of the sample with a ring of good transformation around the periphery. The gun was connected to a vacuum pump and was placed under a vacuum while firing. The early design was put into limited production by a Rumsey-Loomis (a local machine shop then at Mecklenburg Road in Ithaca, NY, USA).

Biolistics, Inc sold Dupont the rights to manufacture and distribute an updated device with improvements including the use of helium as a non-explosive propellant and a multi-disk collision delivery mechanism to minimize damage to sample tissues. Other heavy metals such as gold and silver are also used to deliver genetic material with gold being favored due to lower cytotoxicity in comparison to tungsten projectile carriers.

Biolistic transformation involves the integration of a functional fragment of DNA—known as a DNA construct—into target cells. A gene construct is a DNA cassette containing all required regulatory elements for proper expression within the target organism. While gene constructs may vary in their design depending on the desired outcome of the transformation procedure, all constructs typically contain a combination a promoter sequence, a terminator sequence, the gene of interest, and a reporter gene.

;Promoter:Promoters control the location and magnitude of gene expression and function as “the steering wheel and gas pedal” of a gene. Promoters precede the gene of interest in the DNA construct and can be changed through laboratory design to fine-tune transgene expression. The 35S promoter from Cauliflower mosaic virus is an example of a commonly used promoter that results in robust constitutive gene expression within plants.
;Terminator:Terminator sequences are required for proper gene expression and are placed after the coding region of the gene of interest within the DNA construct. A common terminator for biolistic transformation is the NOS terminator derived from &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;. Due to the high frequency of use of this terminator in genetically engineered plants, strategies have been developed to detect its presence within the food supply to monitor for unauthorized GE crops.
;Reporter gene: A gene encoding a selectable marker is a common element within DNA constructs and is used to select for properly transformed cells. The selectable marker chosen will depend on the species being transformed, but it will typically be a gene granting cells a detoxification capacity for certain herbicides or antibiotics such as kanamycin, hygromycin B, or glyphosate.
;Additional elements: Optional components of a DNA construct include elements such as cre-lox sequences that allow for controlled removal of the construct from the target genome. Such elements are chosen by the construct developer to perform specialized functions alongside the main gene of interest.

==Application==
Gene guns are mostly used with plant cells. However, there is much potential use in humans and other animals as well.

===Plants===
The target of a gene gun is often a callus of undifferentiated plant cells or a group of immature embryos growing on gel medium in a Petri dish. After the DNA-coated gold particles have been delivered to the cells, the DNA is used as a template for transcription (transient expression) and sometimes it integrates into a plant chromosome (&#x27;stable&#x27; transformation)

If the delivered DNA construct contains a selectable marker, then stably transformed cells can be selected and cultured using tissue culture methods. For example, if the delivered DNA construct contains a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic or herbicide, then stably transformed cells may be selected by including that antibiotic or herbicide in the tissue culture media.

Transformed cells can be treated with a series of plant hormones, such as auxins and gibberellins, and each may divide and differentiate into the organized, specialized, tissue cells of an entire plant. This capability of total re-generation is called totipotency. The new plant that originated from a successfully transformed cell may have new traits that are heritable. The use of the gene gun may be contrasted with the use of &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; and its Ti plasmid to insert DNA into plant cells. See transformation for different methods of transformation in different species.

===Humans and other animals===
Gene guns have also been used to deliver DNA vaccines.

The delivery of plasmids into rat neurons through the use of a gene gun, specifically DRG neurons, is also used as a pharmacological precursor in studying the effects of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The gene gun has become a common tool for labeling subsets of cells in cultured tissue. In addition to being able to transfect cells with DNA plasmids coding for fluorescent proteins, the gene gun can be adapted to deliver a wide variety of vital dyes to cells.

Gene gun bombardment has also been used to transform &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, as an alternative to microinjection.

==Advantages==
Biolistics has proven to be a versatile method of genetic modification and it is generally preferred to engineer transformation-resistant crops, such as cereals. Notably, &quot;Bt&quot; maize is a product of biolistics. Plastid transformation has also seen great success with particle bombardment when compared to other current techniques, such as &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; mediated transformation, which have difficulty targeting the vector to and stably expressing in the chloroplast. In addition, there are no reports of a chloroplast silencing a transgene inserted with a gene gun. Additionally, with only one firing of a gene gun, a skilled technician can generate two transformed organisms in certain species. This technology has even allowed for modification of specific tissues &quot;in situ&quot;, although this is likely to damage large numbers of cells and transform only some, rather than all, cells of the tissue.

==Limitations==

Biolistics introduces DNA randomly into the target cells. Thus the DNA may be transformed into whatever genomes are present in the cell, be they nuclear, mitochondrial, plasmid or any others, in any combination, though proper construct design may mitigate this. The delivery and integration of multiple templates of the DNA construct is a distinct possibility, resulting in potential variable expression levels and copy numbers of the inserted gene. This is due to the ability of the constructs to give and take genetic material from other constructs, causing some to carry no transgene and others to carry multiple copies; the number of copies inserted depends on both how many copies of the transgene an inserted construct has, and how many were inserted. Also, because eukaryotic constructs rely on illegitimate recombination—a process by which the transgene is integrated into the genome without similar genetic sequences—and not homologous recombination, they cannot be targeted to specific locations within the genome, unless the transgene is co-delivered with genome editing reagents.

<text>Chester Commodore (August 22, 1914 – April 10, 2004) was an African-American cartoonist who made political cartoons and comic strips. He won numerous awards from 1972 to 1980.

== Early life ==
Born in Racine, Wisconsin, Commodore was a descendant of Peter D. Thomas, a former slave and the first African-American elected official in Wisconsin. His parents and sisters moved to Chicago in 1923, but Chester and his older brother stayed in Racine with his maternal grandmother in her boarding house until he moved to Chicago in 1927. Commodore developed an interest in comics and art at an early age, and was encouraged by his uncle John Prophet. While living with his grandmother, he had the opportunity to meet prominent African-American musicians and entertainers who were turned away from white-owned hotels and restaurants in the Chicago and Milwaukee area.

== Career ==
While studying at Tilden Technical High School, he continued to practice art. After graduation, he worked various odd jobs to support himself, including as a chauffeur and a mechanic, and got a job with the Pullman Company. He was always drawing, and posted his drawings on company bulletin boards. American lawyer and comics writer James Rice was impressed by Commodore&#x27;s work and recommended him as an artist to the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot; in 1938, and the newspaper offered Commodore a job. However, the job offer was rescinded after he arrived, as the staff had been unaware that he was African-American.

In 1948 a national printers&#x27; strike led to a job opening at &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, where he excelled despite having no prior experience as a printer. doing layout, but soon started drawing cartoons for the paper. His first strip, in 1948, was called &quot;The Sparks.&quot; He took over Jay Jackson&#x27;s strip &quot;Bungleton Green&quot; in the early 1950s and contributed to the cartoon features &quot;The Ravings of Professor Doodle&quot; and &quot;So What?&quot;. When Jay Jackson died in 1954, shortly before the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, Commodore took over his role drawing editorial cartoons for the paper.

After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Commodore began to focus more broadly on the social issues facing the African American community, including poverty, and exclusion from politics. From 1974 he drew a weekly full-page caricature for the cover of the &quot;Defender&quot;&#x27;s weekly arts supplement, &quot;Accent&quot;. The series lasted for more than five years. While working at &quot;The Defender&quot;, Commodore took artist Marie Antoinette Merriweather under his wing, and she later went on to found her own company, Teddy Bear Graphics.

==Family==
Commodore was married three times. During the 1930s, he married Marie &quot;Ruby&quot; Bazel, with whom he had two sons; Chesterfield Commodore Jr. and Philip Joseph Commodore. He returned to Chicago in 1940, where he worked as a porter.

In 1955, Commodore married his third wife, Mattye Marcia Buchanan Hutchins Nails, and became stepfather to her daughter Lorin and son William Hutchins. Their marriage lasted until Mattye&#x27;s death in 1990.

== Later life and death ==
Commodore and his wife retired to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1981, but in 1992 he resumed work for the &quot;Defender&quot;, contributing a weekly cartoon until his death in 2004. Commodore also appeared in the 1998 documentary &quot;The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords&quot;, directed by Stanley Nelson Jr.

== Legacy ==
Throughout his career, Commodore portrayed African-Americans in a humanizing dignified way, and his work is widely considered to have been a major step away from racial stereotyping of African-Americans, particularly in comics. Commodore&#x27;s step-daughter Lorin Nails-Smoote donated the Chester Commodore Papers, which included original artwork, letters, photographs and awards to the Chicago Public Library in 2007. The following year, a free public exhibition titled &quot;Chester Commodore, 1914-2004: The Work and Life of a Pioneering Cartoonist of Color&quot; opened at the library.

== Awards and honours ==
Over the course of his career, Commodore won awards for his work as a comic strip artist and editor, and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize 12 times.

<text>The Boy from Oz is an Australian jukebox musical based on the life of singer and songwriter Peter Allen, featuring songs written by him. The book commissioned for the musical is by Nick Enright, based on Stephen MacLean&#x27;s 1996 biography of Allen.
Premiering in Australia in 1998 starring Todd McKenney, a revised version of the musical, written by Martin Sherman, opened on Broadway in 2003, with Hugh Jackman in the title role.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 the cast recording won the ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album.

==Plot==
&quot;This synopsis applies to the North American production.&quot;
;Act I
The musical begins with Australian performer Peter Allen recalling his life story, coming to terms with who he was (&quot;The Lives of Me&quot;). Afterwards, we go back to Allen&#x27;s childhood in Tenterfield, Australia, where a young boy named Peter Woolnough is performing in local bars for money (&quot;When I Get My Name in Lights&quot;). Peter grows up and joins with Chris Bell to become the Allen Brothers, and they perform in Australian Bandstand (&quot;Love Crazy&quot;). After great success in Australia, the Allen Brothers perform in a Hong Kong Hilton hotel to Chinese businessmen. One evening, another person is watching them from the bar: the legendary The Wizard of Oz star Judy Garland. Peter convinces Judy to perform with them (&quot;All I Wanted Was the Dream&quot;), and Judy takes Peter to be the opening act in her concert in New York (&quot;Only an Older Woman&quot;).

While in New York, Peter is introduced to Judy&#x27;s daughter, Liza Minnelli, and they fall in love (&quot;Best That You Can Do&quot;). There are rumors of Peter&#x27;s homosexuality, and Judy warns Liza (&quot;Don&#x27;t Wish Too Hard&quot;). Liza gives no attention to her warning and marries Peter (&quot;Come Save Me&quot;).

Peter makes some mistakes, and at one of his all night parties, Liza walks in on him (&quot;Continental American&quot;), further fueling her suspicions that he is gay. Liza is working hard to get her career going (&quot;She Loves to Hear the Music&quot;), in contrast to Peter&#x27;s excessive lifestyle. Judy dies, and Peter honors her (&quot;Quiet Please, There&#x27;s a Lady on Stage&quot;). Liza&#x27;s world comes crashing down as a result of her mother&#x27;s death.

Liza confronts Peter on his alleged homosexuality, and their marriage ends (&quot;I&#x27;d Rather Leave While I&#x27;m in Love&quot;). Peter returns to Australia but realizes that he is not who people thought he was (&quot;Not the Boy Next Door&quot;).

;Act II
Back in the US, Peter has gone solo and comes to terms with his bisexuality (&quot;Bi-Coastal&quot;). He meets the hardworking fashion model Gregory Connell. Greg does not want to be a part of Peter&#x27;s life in show business, but he falls in love with Peter (&quot;If You Were Wondering&quot;). They soon get discovered by music producer Dee Anthony, and he gets them a gig at the Copacabana in New York (&quot;Sure Thing Baby&quot;). Peter&#x27;s career takes off, and he wins an Oscar for &quot;Best That You Can Do&quot;, in addition to writing songs that were covered by artists Olivia Newton-John and Frank Sinatra. Peter gives his best performance in the Radio City Music Hall with The Rockettes (&quot;Everything Old is New Again&quot;), and is surprised to know his mother is also in love.

Greg becomes stricken with advanced HIV, (then known as AIDS defining illness), and even though Peter tries to help him carry on, he succumbs to his illness (&quot;Love Don&#x27;t Need a Reason&quot;). Peter also becomes sick with advanced HIV, but Greg&#x27;s spirit urges him to carry on (&quot;I Honestly Love You&quot;). Liza offers her support to Peter, and they both realize they had successful lives and careers without each other (&quot;You and Me&quot;).

Peter returns to Australia and tries to tell his mother about his illness, but ultimately can&#x27;t find a way to tell her. He then performs one last magnificent concert for Australia (&quot;I Still Call Australia Home&quot;), and witnesses a last flashback of his mother&#x27;s love for him (&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;). Peter reflects on his life, realizing he has no regrets, before he ultimately succumbs to his disease (&quot;Once Before I Go&quot;), but not before going out in style with a farewell performance (&quot;I Go to Rio&quot;), joined by the entire cast.

==Production history==
===Script===
Stephen MacLean idolised Allen, followed his career all over the world, interviewed him many times, and filmed his Australian solo cabaret debut. After Allen&#x27;s death in 1992, MacLean started work on his biography of Allen, which was published in 1996, entitled &quot;Peter Allen: The Boy from Oz&quot;, (alternative title &quot;The Boy from Oz: The Peter Allen Story&quot;).

While working on the biography, MacLean suggested making a biographical film about Allen to producer Ben Gannon, having previously alerted Gannon to Allen&#x27;s work back in the early 1970s. Gannon, however, thought that a documentary should come first, and produced &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;, written and directed by MacLean. This screened on ABC Television in 1995.

After the biography was published in 1996, Gannon and Robert Fox decided to use the work as the basis for a stage musical. The book to be used for the show was commissioned from Nick Enright, and MacLean acted as consultant on workshopping the musical.

===Original Australian production===
&quot;The Boy from Oz&quot; had its world premiere, directed by Gale Edwards, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney, Sydney on 5 March 1998 and toured Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, playing to over 1.2 million theatre patrons. It ran for a total 766 performances over two years. The production starred Todd McKenney as Allen and Divinyls frontwoman Chrissy Amphlett as Judy Garland, Angela Toohey as Liza Minnelli, and introduced Mathew Waters as Young Peter.

===Broadway===
&quot;The Boy from Oz&quot; began previews on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on 16 September 2003 and opened on 16 October 2003. It closed on 12 September 2004, at the end of Hugh Jackman&#x27;s contract. It was adapted for the American audience by playwright Martin Sherman, who removed some of the Australian terms (such as &quot;jackaroo&quot;) and expanded the role of U.S. characters Garland and Minnelli. The musical played 32 previews and 365 performances. Directed by Philip William McKinley, with choreography by Joey McKneely, it starred Jackman as Allen, Isabel Keating as Garland, Stephanie J. Block as Minnelli, Beth Fowler as Marion, Jarrod Emick as Greg, and John Hill as Mark Herron (Judy&#x27;s husband). Jackman won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical, and Keating won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. The show also received nominations for four other Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the show, calling it an &quot;indisputably bogus show&quot;, but praised Jackman&#x27;s performance. The musical recouped its investment of $8.25 million.

===Australian arena tour===
&quot;The Boy from Oz&quot; returned to Australia from 3 August to 10 September 2006 in a new production especially designed for the arena stage (audiences of over 10,000 people), called &quot;Boy from Oz Arena Spectacular&quot;. Directed by American choreographer Kenny Ortega, Hugh Jackman reprised his New York role as Allen. He was joined by Australian actresses Chrissy Amphlett and Angela Toohey, reprising their roles as Garland and Minnelli. Shardyn Fahey-Leigh played the role of Young Allen with Dylan Speedy. Rarmian Newton and Joshua Waiss Gates, both of whom later starred in &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot;, were understudies in the Australian production. Peter&#x27;s mother, Marion, was played by Colleen Hewett. The show had a support cast of 40 singer-dancers and a 25-piece orchestra.

The show also featured the vocals of Australian girls&#x27; high school choirs from Penrhos College when in Perth, and, while in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, it featured the vocals of 100 girls from the Australian Girls Choir.

===Melbourne revivals===
In 2010, McKenney returned to the title role with The Production Company in a version of the show that climaxed with an Allen recording projected on the stage. In 2018, to celebrate the show&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, The Production Company staged a new production with anachronistic elements such as Aboriginal and rainbow flags. Rohan Browne starred as Allen, with Caroline O’Connor as Garland, Loren Hunter as Minnelli, and Maxwell Simon as Greg.

===Perth production===
In 2021, Platinum Entertainment presented &quot;The Boy From Oz&quot; at Crown Theatre - one of the only venues in the world producing large scale theatre at the time. Directed and choreographed by Drew Anthony, and musically directed by Joe Louis Robinson, the show debuted Ethan Jones in the title role of Allen alongside Lucy Williamson as Garland, Elethea Sartorelli as Minnelli, Casey Edwards as Marion, and Peter Cumins as Greg. An acknowledgement of country was presented by Jones as Allen in the introduction to &quot;I Still Call Australia Home&quot;. The production included a full stage LED screen with integrated audio-visuals throughout, and concluded with a transition from Jones to the late Allen singing &quot;Once Before I Go&quot;.

===International productions===
In Peru, the show premiered in May 2013, starring Marco Zunino as Allen, Érika Villalobos appeared as Liza and Elena Romero as Judy . It was the first Spanish language adaptation.

==Reception==
In his review of the Broadway production for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley wrote, &quot;His limbs twirling like the blades of a windmill, Mr. Jackman channels the energy that was Allen with a rejuvenating life force all his own. And you don’t feel — as you so often do with such interpretations — that your memories of the prototype have been blurred. This is a performance that, against the odds, holds on to its integrity.&quot; However Brantley went on to write: &quot;...this musical settles for a staleness and a hollowness that even Mr. Jackman&#x27;s blazing presence can&#x27;t disguise.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Variety&quot; of the Broadway production, Charles Isherwood praised Jackman but panned the show: &quot;Jackman is giving a vital and engaging performance in this pitifully flimsy musical almost in spite of the material he’s been handed. It’s a sad waste of an exciting talent.&quot;

David Rooney, writing in &quot;Variety&quot; about the Australian arena tour, said, &quot;When he first performed the role on Broadway in 2003, Hugh Jackman’s charisma, vitality and breezy confidence onstage far outshone the narrative or emotional scope of the by-the-numbers biomusical of singer-songwriter Peter Allen. The scales have been tipped even further toward the performer in this pumped-up reconfiguration of the show, playing state capitals in venues of 10,000 seats or more. It’s as much a concert platform for a returning local boy made good in Hollywood as it is a life story of Peter Allen. And that’s no bad thing.&quot;

===In popular culture===
Jackman&#x27;s performance of &quot;Once Before I Go&quot; was featured in a montage dedicated to Alex Trebek in his final episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, which aired on January 8, 2021, exactly two months after Trebek&#x27;s death from stage IV pancreatic cancer on November 8, 2020 at the age of 80.

==Awards and nominations==
===Original Australian production===
The original Australian production was also received six Melbourne Green Room Awards for 1999, including Outstanding Contribution by a Music Theatre Management. It was also nominated for the Green Room Award for Best New Australian Play.

<doc id="961986" wikidata="Q7134597" url="?curid=961986" title="Paragon Oil">
<text>Paragon Oil was an American oil company, founded in 1925 in New York City by the Schwartz family, and sold to Texaco in the late 1950s. It is not related to the Paragon Oil Company operating today in Brooklyn.

== Founding of the company ==
Paragon Oil was founded by brothers Henry, Irving, Robert, Benjamin, and Arnold Schwartz. The brothers, and their sister Bess Schwartz Levy, were first-generation Americans, all born between 1896 and 1909 in Brooklyn, New York.

Their parents were Sam (Sholem) (née Chernofski) Schwartz, born circa June 1866, and Lena (Liba Chasia) Krakofsky, born circa March 1871, who were Jewish immigrants originally from the Mala Berezianka, Kivshovata, Tarascha, and Belaya Tserkov (Bila Tserkva) area, south of Kiev in Kiev oblast, Ukraine, who had immigrated to the United States between 1891 and 1895. The family&#x27;s original surname had been spelled in various Russian Empire records as Chernofski, Cherninsky, Chernuavsky, and/or Chernyansky, derived from the Russian word for &quot;black&quot; and was changed to Schwartz, the German word for &quot;black&quot;, upon emigration. Sam was the oldest or second oldest of seven Chernofski/Schwazrtz siblings, six of whom came to the US, and had originally been a leading blacksmith who owned many horses, wagons, and vast property in and around Belaya Tserkov.

Despite this well-off background, the family was poor upon arrival in New York. Sam worked once again as a blacksmith, but now in eastern Brooklyn. When they were young, elder brothers Henry and Irving went door-to-door in Brooklyn carrying around sacks of coal on their backs, peddling it to the nearby homes and residential buildings to earn extra money for their family. At that time, some large commercial buildings had oil-fired furnaces, but residential buildings did not. A combination of factors, including the equipment available at their father&#x27;s blacksmith shop and the experience of their relatives back in Ukraine who were involved in the whale oil business, led to the brothers experimenting, designing, and finally building the first oil heaters designed for &quot;residential&quot; buildings, which eventually earned the family several patents on the design.

==Growth of the company==
As time went on, Paragon Oil eventually switched its focus from building and selling these new residential oil burners to that of an oil distribution company, to supply the residential buildings that now had their new oil burners installed. They eventually won a major contract with New York City in the early 1930s to supply fuel oil to several city-run buildings. Despite this success, they still primarily remained a local operation in the New York area until the end of World War II. Europe was destroyed, and in desperate need of fuel oil. Because of their location close to the New York docks and their unique five gallon container packaging, Paragon Oil won the U.S. government contract as the only oil company to supply Europe with fuel oil during the post-war reconstruction. This contract catapulted the company into national prominence. Later, during the early days of the Cold War, Paragon supplied the U.S. government with oil for their submarines. The company operated a large fleet of fuel delivery trucks around the Northeastern United States, and eventually had several oil tankers. Toy versions of the fuel delivery trucks were even manufactured by the Corgi company.

==Sale of the company==
The company continued in operation until the late 1950s. At that point, the brothers were getting older and wished to retire. The company was sold to Texaco in the late 1950s, with the sale becoming final in the early 1960s. The estimated sale price was in excess of $75 million, with the family receiving consulting fees of nearly $1 million per year afterward, as well as Texaco stock.

Most of the brothers used the profits from the sale to co-found the Brookdale Foundation, whose research focuses on gerontology and geriatric medicine. They also endowed many other charitable enterprises, primarily centered in the New York metropolitan area. These included the Metropolitan Opera at then-newly built Lincoln Center, several buildings and lecture programs at New York University, several New York City and Long Island hospitals including Mount Sinai Hospital, Fifth Avenue Synagogue, the Maimonides Foundation for Gifted Youth, and at least three graduate schools.

Eldest brother Henry Schwartz was married quite late in life to a former nun named Caroline Di Donato (b. 1896 in Ohio), who was also a former nurse and the former Dean of Women at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. Thus, despite his Orthodox Jewish background, he also donated heavily to many Catholic charities and organizations, including endowing The Caroline Di Donato Schwartz building at Seton Hall, which was completed in 1973.

== Schwartz family history ==
Sam&#x27;s father, Chaim Yael &quot;Hyman&quot; Chernofski, married Gittel Rifka &quot;Gertrude&quot; Bobrutsky, daughter of Mordkho &quot;Max&quot; Bobrutsky and Sarah Fuchs, probably around 1863. Chaim and Sam had started the family into the Whale Oil business during the late 1880s. After the purges in the early 1890s, one part of the family decided to go to America, while others stayed behind in Russia to continue the exporting of Whale Oil. The family immigrated through the port of Bremen, Germany, where their name was changed from &quot;Chernofski&quot;, which had at its root the &quot;Russian&quot; word for black, to &quot;Schwartz&quot;, the &quot;German&quot; word for black. The family traveled to London, England during the early part of 1895 to strengthen contacts they had previously made with the Royal Court of Queen Victoria that would serve them later with Paragon Oil. According to old family documents, the majority of the family finally traveled to America during late 1895 as First Class passengers on the White Star liner Teutonic.

Several of the five brothers&#x27; first cousins, including the sons of Sam&#x27;s youngest sibling Barney Schwartz and the sons one of Lena&#x27;s cousins, also joined the operation. However, some of them chose to adopt different surnames in the workplace, including the surnames &quot;Harvey&quot; and &quot;Lawrence&quot;, so that it would not be immediately obvious that most of the people working in the upper levels of the company had the last name Schwartz, and thus were related. Avoiding public anti-Semitism was also a contributing factor to the cousins&#x27; surname changes; indeed, even some of the five brothers&#x27; first names were different than those on their birth certificates and early census records, changed to sound less overtly Jewish. For example, Arnold&#x27;s real first name was Abraham, and the brother whose birth certificate showed &quot;Benny&quot; Schwartz officially went by the more genteel &quot;B. Davis&quot; Schwartz for most of his later adult life.

== Founders&#x27; deaths ==
Henry Schwartz died in January 1983, Irving died in April 1974, Robert died in November 1971, Ben died in July 1969, and Arnold died in September 1979. Bess Schwartz Levy died around 1958. Their parents Sam and Lena Schwartz died in 1928 and 1941, respectively. The last of the original family members to work at Paragon Oil died in 2009. He was nonagenarian Jack Lawrence (née Jacob Schwartz), a well-known songwriter and former president of ASCAP, and the son of Sam&#x27;s youngest sibling Barney.</text><links>

<text>Comic book superheroes and professional wrestling characters have long been viewed in the same vein of entertainment as colorful characters that are larger than life, and numerous wrestlers have appeared or been referenced in comic books.

Spider-Man&#x27;s first costumed appearance was the result of Peter Parker&#x27;s need for a colorful gimmick, as he planned to enter and win a wrestling challenge.

==Comics in wrestling==
*&quot;Arachnaman&quot; (portrayed by Brad Armstrong) appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the early 1990s wearing a costume resembling that of Spider-Man&#x27;s aside from its yellow coloration instead of red. His gimmick included shooting &#x27;webs&#x27; upon his ring entrance.
*Sting changed from a colorful flamboyant performer to a dark brooding figure after being falsely accused of betrayal in the nWo storyline in late 1996. As a result, he adopted a black and white look and brooded in the rafters of the arenas, mimicking &quot;The Crow&quot; by James O&#x27;Barr in appearance to the point of actual birds appearing as well. Scott Hall suggested the idea to Sting, knowing of the concept but not having seen or read any of the materials himself.
*Tiger Mask was originally a popular Japanese manga character; as a result, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) decided to capitalize on this by employing the young Satoru Sayama to play the character as an actual wrestler. The resultant success led to the character being reassigned, following Sayama&#x27;s retirement, to other wrestlers, namely the now high-profile Mitsuharu Misawa and Koji Kanemoto. The current incarnation is the fourth, played by Yoshihiro Yamazaki.
*Gangrel was a vampire character from the White Wolf brand of comics and role-playing games. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) employed a wrestler previously known as the Vampire Warrior (real name: David Heath) to play the character, as the leader of a cult-like faction called The Brood, which also consisted of the wrestlers Edge and Christian.
*Gregory Helms wrestles as The Hurricane, a superhero gimmick with elements of The Green Lantern.

==Other connections==
*Rob Van Dam is an avid collector, who cites Ghost Rider as his favorite character, and operates his own store, &quot;RVD&#x27;s Five Star Comics&quot;, in California, and plans to write his own series.
*Raven wrote an issue of &quot;Spider-Man: Tangled Web&quot; for Marvel Comics. The issue featured a partial rewrite of Spider-Man&#x27;s history, and focused on Crusher Hogan, the wrestler whom Spider-Man first tested his powers on.
*CM Punk has also been hired as a writer for Marvel Comics.

<doc id="961996" wikidata="Q1341919" url="?curid=961996" title="Virgil Hill">
<text>Virgil Eugene Hill (born January 18, 1964) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 2007, and in 2015. He is a two-weight world champion, having held the WBA light heavyweight title twice, from 1987 to 1997; the IBF and lineal light heavyweight titles from 1996 to 1997; and the WBA cruiserweight title twice, from 2000 to 2002 and 2006 to 2007. As an amateur, Hill won a silver medal in the middleweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 2013, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Amateur career==
At the 1984 Summer Olympics Hill represented the United States as a Middleweight then age 20, and won a silver medal in a close decision loss in the 165-lb final. His results were:
* Defeated Edward Neblett RSC 2
* Defeated Brian Schumacher 5–0
* Defeated Damir Škaro 4–1
* Defeated Mohamed Zaoui 5–0
* Lost to Shin Joon-Sup 2–3

Hill was the 1984 National Golden Gloves champion at Middleweight. Hill ended his amateur career with a record of 288–11.

==Professional career==

===Light-heavyweight===

In September 1987, after going eighteen straight fights without a loss to start his pro career, Hill aka &#x27;Quicksilver&#x27; (his nickname) was a challenger to Leslie Stewart of Trinidad for the latter&#x27;s World Boxing Association light-heavyweight title in Atlantic City. After an even match in the early going, Hill floored the defending title holder twice in the fourth round – first with a left hook and the second time with an uppercut – to take the title on a Knockout win.

A series of ten successful defenses followed, eight of which took place in Bismarck, North Dakota. Hill received offers to fight in Las Vegas and other cities, but chose the place of his &#x27;roots&#x27; and &#x27;hometown fans&#x27; to be the place of the majority of his defenses. Opponents in his first run as champion included Bobby Czyz and James Kinchen. Superstar Thomas Hearns would meet – and defeat – Hill in Las Vegas by decision in June 1991 to end Hill&#x27;s first reign as champion.

In September 1992, it was Hill pitted against 1984 Olympic teammate Frank Tate for the vacant WBA 175-lb. title. It was a &#x27;grudge match&#x27; between the two, and Hill won the title on his home turf of Bismarck. Another string of ten defenses would follow, including a rematch with Tate, a close decision over Lou Del Valle who almost upset Hill.

====Unification matches====
In November 1996 at the Olympiahalle, Munich, Hill won over the undefeated IBF champion Henry Maske to unify the WBA/IBF belts and win the vacant Lineal championship. In June 1997, WBO champion Dariusz Michalczewski scored a unanimous decision over Hill to unify the WBA, IBF, WBO and Lineal light-heavyweight titles at Arena Oberhausen, Oberhausen, Germany.

Hill boxed against Roy Jones Jr. the following year, and was stopped in round four with a body shot.

===Cruiserweight===
The aging Hill won the WBA cruiserweight title at age 36 by knocking down Fabrice Tiozzo three times in Villeurbanne, France, by TKO in the first. He made his first defense, also in France, against Jean-Marc Mormeck, but would lose both match and title on cuts after nine rounds. In July 2003 he decisioned Donny Lalonde in a North Dakota-Manitoba &#x27;border fight&#x27;. He lost a disputed decision to Mormeck in a title rematch in South Africa in May 2004.

On January 27, 2006, Virgil Hill won over previously undefeated Russian cruiserweight Valery Brudov by unanimous decision to win the &#x27;regular&#x27; WBA cruiserweight title, as the WBA had now created a WBA &quot;Super&quot; title beside the standard WBA title. Despite being cut on the face in the sixth round, Hill was able to out hustle and out work his much younger opponent to capture his fifth world title at the age of 42.

He had his next to last fight in Germany on March 31, 2007, facing Henry Maske, whom he had beaten in 1996. Maske had announced his retirement prior to that fight and was frustrated to end his career with a split-decision loss, the only loss in his professional career. When he heard about Hill capturing the world title again at the age of 42, he decided to challenge him for a rematch. Hill lost the Maske rematch by decision in a non-title bout, then lost to Firat Arslan by decision to lose his WBA cruiserweight title.

He retired with a record of 50 wins (23 KOs) and 7 losses.

On July 16, 2011, Hill worked with his wife, Carla Hill, for their first ever boxing card and promotion at Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey,

===Hall of Fame===
On November 12, 2012, he was officially inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Class of 2013.

<text>John McEntire (born April 9, 1970 in Portland, Oregon) is an American recording engineer, producer, drummer and multi-instrumentalist, based in Chicago, Illinois. He is a member of both Tortoise and the Sea and Cake.

McEntire started playing drums at age 10. Throughout high school, he performed in marching bands and studied privately for seven years. He went on to attend Oberlin Conservatory initially as a percussion major, but eventually switched to study in the school&#x27;s then newly created program for Technology in Music and Related Arts.

==Musical career==
McEntire is currently a member of Tortoise, The Sea and Cake, and The Red Krayola. His drumming work as a sideman can be heard on recordings, such as &quot;Since&quot; by Richard Buckner, &quot;Enantiodromia&quot; and &quot;Life on the Fly&quot; by Azita, &quot;Near-Life Experience&quot; by Come, &quot;Kernel&quot; by Seam, &quot;Chicago Wednesday&quot; by Jandek, and &quot;The Spectrum Between&quot; by David Grubbs.

While attending Oberlin, he briefly played with Mark Edwards in My Dad Is Dead in 1988, and then joined Bastro with David Grubbs and Bundy K. Brown in 1989. In 1991, he relocated along with Grubbs and Brown to Chicago where they changed their musical direction and became the first incarnation of Gastr Del Sol. Their debut album, &quot;The Serpentine Similar&quot;, was released in 1993. McEntire and Brown left to play in Tortoise in 1994, yet McEntire continued to make contributions to Gastr Del Sol&#x27;s later recordings and performances.

McEntire had also played in Seam, The Stokastikats, Stereolab, and The Oily Bloodmen. He was a principal musician on Jim O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Terminal Pharmacy and has appeared on many other solo O&#x27;Rourke projects.

==Production/engineering work==
As a producer and engineer, McEntire has mixed and remixed recordings by many artists. He also owns and operates Soma Electronic Music Studios in Nevada City, California, to which he relocated in 2018 after 25 years in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago and then a brief stint in Los Angeles.

He produces and engineers most of the recordings for his own bands, as well as many of the solo efforts by bandmates Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, Jeff Parker, and Doug McCombs. He has also engineered, produced, and/or mixed albums and tracks for many artists including: Bell Orchestre, Stereolab, Bright Eyes, Bobby Conn, Teenage Fanclub, Sylvain Chauveau, Kaki King, Tom Ze, The Ex, Smog, Trans Am, Eleventh Dream Day, Cougar, Antibalas, Innaway, The For Carnation, Dianogah, U.S. Maple, Chicago Underground Duo, Spookey Ruben, Blur, Pivot, The Fiery Furnaces, The Car Is on Fire, Small Sins, Broken Social Scene, Coldcut, Spoon, Jaga Jazzist, Great 3, Yo La Tengo, Radian, Pia Fraus and most recently, La Ciencia Simple.

McEntire is a pioneering user of modern digital audio workstation software, first employing Pro Tools on the 1997 The Sea and Cake album &quot;The Fawn&quot; and then on Stereolab&#x27;s &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;, released later the same year.

<text>Melbourne Zoo is a zoo in Melbourne, Australia. It is located within Royal Park in Parkville, approximately north of the centre of Melbourne. It is the primary zoo serving Melbourne. As of 2021, the zoo contains 3742 animals comprising 243 species, from Australia and around the world. The zoo is accessible via Royal Park station on the Upfield railway line, and is also accessible via tram routes 58 and 19, as well as by bicycle on the Capital City Trail. Bicycles are not allowed inside the zoo itself.

The Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

The zoo is set among flower gardens and picnic areas. Many of the animals are now organised in bioclimatic zones: African rainforest (&#x27;Gorilla Rainforest&#x27;) that include gorillas and lemurs; Asian rainforest that includes orangutans, tigers and otters; and the Australian bush with kangaroos, koalas, wombats, goannas, native birds and many others. Popular exhibits also include the &#x27;Butterfly House&#x27;, the &#x27;Reptile House&#x27;, the &#x27;Great Flight Aviary&#x27;, &#x27;Wild Sea&#x27;, &#x27;Treetop Apes and Monkeys&#x27; and &#x27;Lion Gorge&#x27;. During the summer months they also hold sleep over events at the zoo that allows people to purchase tickets to &quot;camp out&quot; for a night under the stars. 

The zoo includes a large schools section and caters to many school visitors annually, its immensely popular education program encourages young minds to conserve animals.

Visitors can see historical cages including the heritage listed &quot;Elephant House&quot;, which has been renovated and adapted for use for customers paying to sleep overnight in tents at the zoo in popular &quot;Roar and Snore&quot; evenings. These evenings allow the public to see some of the nocturnal animals at the zoo in evening guided tours by experienced camp hosts.

==History==
In October 1857, the Zoological Society of Victoria was formed with the aim of introducing animals and plants from overseas. Its first collections of animals were housed in Richmond Paddock. In 1861 the organisation changed its name to the &quot;Acclimatisation Society of Victoria&quot;.

On 6 October 1862, the organisation opened a new Melbourne Zoo in Royal Park on of land donated by the City of Melbourne. Melbourne Zoo was modelled on London Zoo.

Initially the zoo was important for the acclimatisation of domestic animals recovering from their long trip to Australia. It was only with the appointment of Albert Alexander Cochrane Le Souef in 1870 that more exotic animals were procured for public display, and the gardens and picnic areas were developed. 1870 also saw the Society change its name to the &quot;Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria&quot;, and was granted the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in 1910.
One of the most famous exhibits from the early 1900s to the 1940s was Queenie the elephant.

In the mid-1930s, the Society had financial troubles. In response the &quot;Zoological Gardens Act 1936&quot; was passed, handing the Zoo to a newly appointed Zoological Board of Victoria on behalf of the state government in 1937.
In 1964, the acclaimed Lion Park exhibit opened, with an elevated walkway overlooking and separating two exhibits. It was demolished and replaced by a new lion exhibit in 2014.

Australia&#x27;s first gorilla birth occurred at Melbourne Zoo in 1984. Giant pandas were loaned to the zoo from China for an exhibition to celebrate Australia&#x27;s bicentennial in 1988.

In 1989, a 35-year-old man died when he was partially eaten by a lion after he entered its pen.

The Trail of the Elephants exhibit was unveiled in 2003 and won numerous awards. On 15 January 2010 Melbourne Zoo welcomed its first elephant calf, Mali. This is the second elephant calf born in Australia, the first being in Sydney in July 2009. Mali is the first female calf born in Australia and the first calf born via artificial insemination. The zoo&#x27;s elephant herd were relocated to its &#x27;sibling&#x27; zoo Werribee Open Range Zoo in February 2025 to live in a new 21 hecatre state-of-the-art home. The Trail of the Elephants precinct was renamed &#x27;Forest of Wonder&#x27;.

Melbourne Zoo commemorated 150 years of operation in 2012 and this was celebrated in an Australian Zoos collector&#x27;s edition of stamps released by Australia Post in September 2012.

The Zoo completed construction and opened a new carnivores trail in early 2018.

==Zoos Victoria==

Zoos Victoria administers the Melbourne Zoo, as well as the Werribee Open Range Zoo, which features herbivorous creatures in an open-range setting; and Healesville Sanctuary (formerly the Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary), which exhibits Australian fauna on of bushland.

The three zoos have been collectively trading as Zoos Victoria since 1973, governed by the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board, which operates under the &quot;Zoological Parks and Gardens Act 1995&quot;.

In July 2022, Kyabram Fauna Park joined Zoos Victoria.

Colossal Biosciences and Zoos Victoria began a conservation project in October 2023 to preserve the Victorian Grassland Earless Dragon as well as sequence its genome.

==The Carousel==

The carousel was manufactured in England and then brought to Australia in 1886 by a family that ran a touring carnival, visiting country towns in Victoria. After touring with the carnival for over 60 years, in 1952 the carousel became part of a fun fair at the Melbourne Zoo, but was still owned by the same families. When the fun fair at the zoo was permanently closed in 1997, the carousel was purchased by the zoo. By that time, the carousel was in a deteriorated condition. It was restored off-site in 2004-2005 with funding from Heritage Victoria and re-opened in August 2005. The carousel is listed by Heritage Victoria as a heritage place.

<text>Meet the Fockers (sometimes known as Meet the Parents 2) is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Jay Roach, and the sequel to the 2000 film, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. The film stars Robert De Niro (also one of the film&#x27;s producers), Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, and Teri Polo.

&quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; was released on December 22, 2004 in the United States by Universal Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a box-office success, grossing $522 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2004. The sequel, &quot;Little Fockers&quot;, followed in 2010.

==Plot==
With their wedding date six months away, Greg Focker and his fiancée Pam Byrnes decide to introduce their parents to each other. They fly to Oyster Bay, New York, to pick up Pam&#x27;s father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes, her mother Dina, and her one-year-old nephew, Jack &quot;Little Jack&quot; Banks (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). Jack drives the family in his new RV to Miami, Florida, to meet Greg&#x27;s parents.

They are greeted by Greg&#x27;s eccentric, fun-loving and free-spirited parents, Bernie Focker, a lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad, and Roz, a sex therapist for elderly couples. While Dina bonds with the Fockers, cracks form between Jack and the Fockers due to their contrasting personalities and backgrounds.

A chase between the Fockers&#x27; dog, Moses, and the Byrnes&#x27; cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV&#x27;s toilet. Bernie destroys it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack&#x27;s back during a game of touch football.

Pam informs Greg that she is pregnant, and they decide to keep it a secret until they are married. Bernie tells the guests that Greg lost his virginity to the Fockers&#x27; former housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos, 15 years earlier. Isabel&#x27;s 15-year-old son Jorge, who has never met his father and bears a striking resemblance to Greg, catches Jack&#x27;s attention after he repairs the toilet in the RV. Roz, Bernie and Dina learn that Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack.

Greg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, who Jack has been raising via the Ferber method. Despite Jack&#x27;s strict instructions to leave him to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jack&#x27;s cries, and attempts to cheer him up by hugging him and acting humorously, but inadvertently teaches him the word &quot;asshole&quot;.

When Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, Little Jack is let out of the playpen by Jinx. He turns on the TV to &quot;Scarface&quot; and glues his hands to a bottle of rum, while saying &quot;asshole&quot; repeatedly. This leads to an argument between Jack and the Fockers over each other&#x27;s parenting methods.

Jack begins spying on Greg, sending both Greg and Jorge&#x27;s hair samples for a DNA test. He then invites Jorge to Greg and Pam&#x27;s engagement party in hopes of getting Greg to admit he is Jorge&#x27;s father. When Greg denies having known about Jorge, Jack does not believe him so drugs him with a shot of truth serum. While giving a toast, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son before losing consciousness.

The next morning, Pam questions Greg about Jorge, and he promises that he knew nothing about him before the previous evening. She believes him and is willing to work things out with him. Jack has reached his breaking point, and demands that Pam and Dina leave with him. Dina refuses and reveals that Jack drugged Greg. Everyone turns against Jack and informs him that they were all aware of Pam&#x27;s pregnancy, but didn&#x27;t tell him due to his inability to trust people. Shocked and hurt, Jack leaves with his grandson.

Bernie and Greg pursue Jack, but are tasered and arrested by Officer Vern LeFlore for speeding and not remaining in Bernie&#x27;s car when pulled over. Meanwhile, Jack receives the results of the DNA test; Jorge&#x27;s father is really a baseball player who also resembles Greg. Jack turns back toward the house. When Jack sees Bernie and Greg being arrested, he attempts to defend them, but LeFlore tasers and arrests him as well.

Greg, Jack and Bernie are released from jail by Judge Ira, a client of Roz&#x27;s. Before they leave, Greg asks Jack and Bernie to stop their feud. Jack admits he made a mistake regarding Jorge and explains his career in the CIA to Bernie before apologizing for his actions.

Greg and Pam are married that weekend by her former fiancé Kevin, now an ordained interfaith minister. Jack reviews hidden camera footage to find each of the Fockers jeopardizing the Ferber method.

==Cast==
==Production==
Twins Spencer and Bradley Pickren were cast as Little Jack. The twins&#x27; mother was a pediatric nurse who had taught them sign language from birth, although they had to learn a few additional signs specifically for the movie. As was common in the film industry, the casting of twins in a child role allowed the producers to work within the limitations on how many hours children are allowed to work, and swap in a fresh sibling if one of them unexpectedly became tired or upset. Although the Pickren twins performed exceptionally well on-set most of the time, they were never at ease with actor Ben Stiller after doing the head-butting sequence. Although the head-butt itself was a digitized effect, Stiller had to pretend to be hit by grabbing his face, cursing loudly and smearing fake blood under his nose, all of which was upsetting to the Pickrens.

As part of building the character Roz Focker, the crew consulted sex experts Jennifer and Laura Berman. The Bermans advised them of the difficulty people in their profession face with not exposing their children to too much sexual knowledge too soon, an idea that was worked into the film.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Rotten Tomatoes reports that 39% of 166 sampled critics give &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; positive reviews, with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Talented cast is wasted as the movie is content with recycling jokes from its predecessor, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100, with reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41, based on 34 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

=== Box office ===
The film was a commercial success, and is currently the second highest-grossing film starring Robert De Niro, behind &quot;Joker&quot;. The film grossed $46,120,980 in its opening weekend in North America (5,000 screens at 3,518 theaters, averaging $13,110 per theater, or $9,224 per screen). Overall, it grossed $70.5 million during its first five days of release. The film went on to break &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;″s records for both the highest Christmas Day gross and the biggest Tuesday gross, making a total of $19.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The film would hold the Tuesday record until 2006, when &quot;The Omen&quot; surpassed it. &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; continued to hold the Christmas Day record until it was beaten by both &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 2009. It made $12.1 million on New Year&#x27;s Eve and $18.3 million on New Year&#x27;s Day, surpassing the previous records held by both &quot;Cast Away&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; simultaneously. By the end of the film&#x27;s 149 days of release, it had grossed a total of $279,261,160 in North America, and $243,396,776 in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $522,657,936, with an estimated 44 million tickets sold in the U.S. The film&#x27;s budget was $80 million.

<doc id="962020" wikidata="Q7340806" url="?curid=962020" title="Robbed-bit signaling">
<text>In communications systems, robbed-bit signaling (RBS) is a scheme to provide maintenance and line signaling services on many T1 digital carrier circuits using channel-associated signaling (CAS). The T1 carrier circuit is a type of dedicated circuit currently employed in North America and Japan. 

==Overview==
T1 is a protocol for digital transmission over telephone networks. A T1 circuit combines 24 DS0 channels through time-division multiplexing. Data is transmitted in frames, where each frame contains an 8-bit sample of each of the 24 channels, plus one extra framing bit for a total of 193 bits. Each channel carries 8,000 samples per second. The frames are transmitted either in sequences of 12 frames, known as superframes (SF), or sequences of 24 frames, known as extended superframes (ESF). Robbed-bit signaling is a method to provide signaling information alongside data within a superframe. Robbed-bit signaling uses the least-significant bit of every channel in every sixth frame for signaling instead of data. These bits convey on or off hook, and busy signal status on telephone lines. Since a superframe consists of 12 frames, robbed-bit signaling provides two bits for signaling per channel in a superframe, or four bits per channel in an extended superframe. The first robbed bit in a superframe is called A bit, and the second bit is called the B bit. Extended superframes have two extra robbed bits, called the C and D bits.

Intuitively, 5 out of 6 frames have 8-bit resolution equal to (8 bits × 8,000 samples per second = ) and 1 out of every 6 frames has a 7-bit resolution (7 bits × 8,000 samples per second = ). The distortion effect on voice and data signals is negligible when a modem is used for modulation. However, for a digital signal, the data will render errors when a data signal is transmitted. To remove the errors, data can be transmitted 7 bits at a time instead of 8. Since robbed-bit signaling could impact voice quality and reduce data bandwidth, it was largely replaced by the Primary Rate Interface standard, which reserves one of the 24 voice channels for signaling information instead of using bits in every channel.

<text>Nine Radio (formerly Macquarie Media Limited) is an Australian media company, owned by parent company Nine Entertainment Co. and headquartered in North Sydney, New South Wales. The company operates radio stations nationally in the capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, as well as regional Queensland.

==History==
The company was formerly a publicly-listed company and originally founded in 1938 as the Macquarie Broadcasting Service, adopting the name &quot;Macquarie Media&quot; after being acquired by Fairfax Media in 2015.

=== Origins ===
2 GB, one of Sydney&#x27;s premier commercial radio stations, was founded by Theosophical Broadcasting Station Pty Ltd. in 1926, a division of Theosophical Society Adyar. 
In January 1936, in the depths of the Great Depression, 2 GB and 2UE formed an alliance, Broadcasting Service Association (BSA), to share production facilities for producing radio drama and other locally produced entertainment, which was hugely popular and in better times highly lucrative. The BSA was under joint management of Alfred Edward Bennett and Cecil Vincent Stevenson, managing directors of 2 GB and 2UE respectively.
That same year, the controlling interest in 2 GB was purchased by Denison Estates Ltd. A new board of directors was appointed under chairman Sir Hugh Denison and included A. E. Bennett, who continued as station manager, and Frederick Daniell.

In early February 1937 A. E. Bennett hosted a peak conference of commercial radio interests of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with a view to expanding the organisation into an inter-state network to secure additional outlets for their material. Those present included Sir John Butters, chairman of BSA, R. E. Denison and Frederick Daniell, representing Denison Estates Ltd.; V. F. Mitchell of 4BC Brisbane; George Bennett, George Millar and Charles A. Fletcher of 2 GB Sydney; C. V. Stevenson and Sydney S. E. Baume (brother of Eric Baume) of 2UE Sydney; John T. Taylor of 3AW Melbourne; Gordon Marsh of 5DN Adelaide; Clive Ogilvy (often misspelled Ogilvie) and A. J. &quot;Jack&quot; Ryan of 2CA Canberra; Russell A. Yeldon of 2WL Wollongong; Eric and O. Robinson of 2HR Hunter River; J. J. Armitage and D. R. Armstrong of Broadcasting Service Association Ltd. In November the same year Bennett was sacked by Denison and Butters from both his managerial position with 2 GB and as a director of BSA, though public pronouncements had him resigning voluntarily. Harold Gordon Horner, New South Wales manager for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, was appointed to take his place.

=== Macquarie Broadcasting (1938–2015) ===
In July 1938 Sir Hugh Denison announced a further expansion and reorganisation of the company as the Macquarie Broadcasting Service with a capital of A£250,000. The board consisted of Sir Hugh as chairman, Frederick Daniell as executive director, and George Millar as secretary; other founding directors were R. E. Denison, N. L. Shaw, C. Don Service, and S. S. Crick. H. G. Horner of 2 GB, and C. V. Stevenson of 2UE were appointed advisory directors on broadcasting and technical matters respectively. George Anderson of 2GZ was appointed network sales manager. Affiliated stations in the new network were 2CA Canberra; 2 GB and 2UE Sydney; 2WL South Coast; 2HR Hunter River; 3AW Melbourne; 3HA Hamilton; 3TR Sale; 3SH Swan Hill; 4BH Brisbane; 5DN Adelaide; 5RM Renmark; 6PR Perth; 6KG Kalgoorlie. Head office was at Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney, and the Melbourne office at 37 Queen Street.

The new company purchased the worldwide transcription business of 2 GB and BSA and placed under the direction of Frederick Daniell, with sales managed by Clive Ogilvy and Grace Gibson. The BSA Players were reorganised as the Macquarie Players, with their recording studios &quot;Macquarie Productions&quot; at Pagewood and at 296 Pitt Street and 29 Bligh Street. Contracted actors included James Raglan, Lou Vernon, Peter Finch, Betty Suttor and Harry Dearth. The company became a major shareholder in Australian and New Zealand Theatres, Ltd, which had taken over the entertainment business J. C. Williamson&#x27;s, and in Broadcast Enterprises Ltd, of London. The Radio Theatre Guild was taken over as an organisation for training and developing talent. The record production, cutting and pressing business Featuradio was purchased and reorganised as Australian Record Company under management of Charles H. Gendle.

During the 1950s, the Macquarie Broadcasting Service and 2 GB Radio awarded the Macquarie Awards for theatrical performances.

From inception and until the early 1960s, the network was renowned for its high quality productions of variety programs, quizzes, dramas and serials. Most of these programs originated from Sydney. One of the most important Macquarie drama series was The General Motors Hour, 15 episodes of which can be accessed online.

As well as being heard on all of the network&#x27;s affiliates, right across the country, many Macquarie programs were also syndicated to non-network stations. With the coming of television in 1956, the radio audience for these types of programs dropped. Macquarie stations solved the &quot;problem&quot; by quickly increasing their news, talk, commentary and current affairs content.

In 1973, a significant year because it was the 50th anniversary of broadcasting in Australia, the Macquarie Network had the following affiliates: 2 GB Sydney; 2CA Canberra; 2PK Parkes; 2WL Wollongong; 3AW Melbourne; 4BH Brisbane; 4BU Bundaberg; 4GY Gympie; 5DN Adelaide; 6IX Perth; 6BY Bunbury; 6MD Merredin; 6WB Katanning; 7HO Hobart.

During the 1930s, 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s, there were a number of other commercial radio networks, another key one being the Major Network. Other former radio networks include: Federal Network; Associated Broadcasters of Australia; AWA Broadcasting. There were also a number of State-based networks.

By the late 1980s Macquarie had become Australia&#x27;s only national commercial radio network. However, during the last three decades, a number of new networks have arisen, including the Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, unrelated to the Macquarie Radio Network. In 2007, 13 networks owned or controlled 80 per cent of the 261 Australian commercial radio stations 

In 2010, Macquarie entered a joint venture with Pacific Star Network to relaunch Melbourne radio station 3MP as MTR 1377. On 2 March 2012, MTR ceased operations when Pacific Star was unable to pay any monies owed to Macquarie.

On 31 August 2011, Macquarie acquired the Smart Radio Network which encompasses 4VL, Triple C FM, 4HI, 4ZR, 4LM, 4SB and Hot Country network at a cost of $6 million. These stations are part of Macquarie Regional Radio, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Macquarie Radio Network.

=== Macquarie Media (2015–2019) ===
In December 2014, Macquarie announced that it had agreed to a merger with Fairfax Media. Under the deal, Fairfax gained a 55% share in the Macquarie Radio Network, with Macquarie&#x27;s existing shareholders holding the remaining 45%. To comply with legislation only allowing two radio licences to be held by one party in each market, stations 2CH and 4LM were sold; and the merger was completed in March 2015.

In April 2015 a number of programming changes occurred at Macquarie&#x27;s stations. At 4BC Brisbane, Breakfast presenters Ian Skippen and Loretta Ryan, Mornings host Patrick Condren, Nights host Walter Williams and Weekend Breakfast presenter Murray Shoring were dismissed, as well as sister Magic 882 Nights&#x27; presenter Jo Henderson. In total, 18 positions were cut, and programming replaced by networked shows from 2 GB and 2UE. In Sydney, 2UE&#x27;s afternoon announcer Angela Catterns was dismissed, as was the entire newsroom, and the station&#x27;s news services were replaced by the Macquarie&#x27;s national news service – while in Melbourne all of Magic 1278&#x27;s lineup and most of the production team was cut.

On 30 October 2015 it was announced the company had divested its regional assets, selling eight radio stations to Resonate Broadcasting. On 6 November it was announced that all of Magic 882&#x27;s programming – with the exception of nights – would be networked from Magic 1278 in Melbourne.

On 10 November 2015 the company changed its name to Macquarie Media Limited. Following its merger with Fairfax in 2018, Nine acquired John Singleton&#x27;s share in the company in 2019, increasing its stake in the company to 87%. In October 2019 Nine increased its shareholding to over 90% after purchasing stakes from Mark Carnegie (3.6 percent) and Alan Jones (1.3 percent) to allow Nine to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares. In January 2020, Nine confirmed that the Macquarie Media brand would be phased out.

===Nine Radio (2020–present)===
On 21 January 2020, Nine Radio announced they would close the Macquarie Sports Radio network in February, reverting stations to their pre–2016 brands—2UE, 4BH and Magic 1278—with a classic hits music format. In April, Steve Jacobs was announced as breakfast presenter of the music stations, commencing 27 April.

<text>Seismic refraction is a geophysical principle governed by Snell&#x27;s Law of refraction. The seismic refraction method utilizes the refraction of seismic waves by rock or soil layers to characterize the subsurface geologic conditions and geologic structure.

Seismic refraction is exploited in engineering geology, geotechnical engineering and exploration geophysics. Seismic refraction traverses (seismic lines) are performed using an array of seismographs or geophones and an energy source.

The methods depend on the fact that seismic waves have differing velocities in different types of soil or rock. The waves are refracted when they cross the boundary between different types (or conditions) of soil or rock. The methods enable the general soil types and the approximate depth to strata boundaries, or to bedrock, to be determined.

==P-wave refraction==

P-wave refraction evaluates the compression wave generated by the seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by vertically striking a striker plate with a sledgehammer, shooting a seismic shotgun into the ground, or detonating an explosive charge in the ground. Since the compression wave is the fastest of the seismic waves, it is sometimes referred to as the primary wave and is usually more-readily identifiable within the seismic recording as compared to the other seismic waves.

==S-wave refraction==

S-wave refraction evaluates the shear wave generated by the seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by horizontally striking an object on the ground surface to induce the shear wave. Since the shear wave is the second fastest wave, it is sometimes referred to as the secondary wave. When compared to the compression wave, the shear wave is approximately one-half (but may vary significantly from this estimate) the velocity depending on the medium.

== Two horizontal layers==
ic0 - critical angle
V0 - velocity of the first layer
V1 - velocity of the second layer
h0 - thickness of the first layer
T01 - intercept

==Inversion methods==

* The General Reciprocal method
* The Plus minus method
* Refraction inversion modeling (refraction tomography)
* Monte Carlo simulation

== Applications ==
Seismic refraction has been successfully applied to tailings characterisation through P- and S-wave travel time tomographic inversions.

<doc id="962040" wikidata="Q962919" url="?curid=962040" title="Henry Brown (South Carolina politician)">
<text>Henry Edward Brown Jr. (born December 20, 1935) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. He did not stand for re-election in 2010.

The district is based in Charleston and during Brown&#x27;s tenure in office, took in almost all of the state&#x27;s share of the Atlantic coastline (except for Beaufort and Hilton Head Island, which at that time were in the 2nd district).

==Early life==
Brown was born in Bishopville, South Carolina. After graduating from Berkeley High School of Moncks Corner, South Carolina in 1953, Brown attended college at Charleston Southern University but did not graduate. He instead entered the IBM Management and Technical School. He then worked for the Piggly Wiggly grocery chain, becoming a vice president. Brown also spent 10 years as a member of the United States National Guard.

==Political career==
Brown was elected to the Hanahan city council in 1981 and was later elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1985 as a Republican from Berkeley County. Incumbent Francis Archibald resigned the seat and Brown won handily over opponent Ed Sessions in a June 1985 special election. When the Republicans gained control of the state house in 1994, Brown became chairman of the Ways and Means committee and helped deliver the largest tax cut in state history. He also served as chairman of the state&#x27;s Joint Tax study Committee and was one of the vocal leaders of a massive 1998 tax proposal.

When 1st District Congressman Mark Sanford decided to honor a pledge to serve no more than six years in the House, Brown ran for the seat, passing out &quot;Oh Henry&quot; candy bars during the primary election as a way to increase his name recognition. He won the runoff with 55% over state Transportation Commissioner Harry &quot;Buck&quot; Limehouse and easily won the general election. The Democrats didn&#x27;t even field a challenger in 2002 or 2004. In 2006, he won re-election by over 20 points, but surprisingly did not pass the 60% margin in a race against Democratic Randy Maatta and Green candidate Brian Merrill.

In the 2008 election, Brown faced Democratic nominee Linda Ketner. The district had been considered unwinnable for a Democrat since the 1990s round of redistricting shifted most of Charleston&#x27;s black voters to the majority-black 6th District. However, polls from the summer of 2008 onward showed a closer-than-expected race. Ultimately, Brown barely held onto his seat, winning only 52 percent of the vote to Ketner&#x27;s 48 percent—the closest race in the district in 22 years. Brown lost badly in Charleston County largely due to Barack Obama winning it with 54 percent of the vote—only the second time a Democratic presidential candidate has carried the county since 1956. However, Brown crushed Ketner in Berkeley and Dorchester counties, enabling him to secure a fifth term. He was also likely helped by John McCain carrying the district with 56 percent of the vote; aside from Jimmy Carter in 1976, the district had supported a Republican for president in every election since 1956.

On January 4, 2010, Brown announced that he would retire from the House and not seek re-election.

In June 2023, Brown endorsed Tim Scott in the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Forest fire controversy==
In 2004, Henry Brown set a controlled burn on his own property, but the fire spread to the neighboring Francis Marion National Forest, burning . Although he eventually paid a reduced fine of $4,747 in April 2008, the case cost the government an estimated $100,000 to resolve, and forced the Forest Service to rewrite a criminal code, making it much more difficult to prosecute those who negligently set fire to federal property. Brown commented regarding the affair that, &quot;I was so taken aback that I&#x27;d be treated so impersonal — like I was some kind of crook...Those were criminal charges that were filed against me. I felt like I was the victim.&quot;

<text>Messier 35 or M35, also known as NGC 2168 or the Shoe-Buckle Cluster, is a relatively close open cluster of stars in the west of Gemini, at about the declination of the Sun when the latter is at June solstice. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux around 1745 and independently discovered by John Bevis before 1750. It is scattered over part of the sky almost the size of the full moon and is away. The compact open cluster NGC 2158 lies directly southwest of it.

Leonard &amp; Merritt (1989) computed the mass of M35 using a statistical technique based on proper motion velocities of its stars. The mass within the central was found to be between 1600 and 3200 solar masses, consistent with the mass of a realistic stellar population within the same radius. Bouy et al. in 2015 found a mass of around within the central . There are 305 stars that can be intrinsically shown to be extremely likely to be members, and up to 4,349 averaging the 50% membership probability, from the kinematic (such as parallax and proper motion) and spectral data published before 2015. The cluster&#x27;s metallicity is [Fe/H] = , where −1 would be ten times less metallic than the sun.

Of 418 probable members, Leiner et al. in 2015 found 64 that have variable radial velocities thus are binary star systems. Four probable members are chemically peculiars, while HD 41995, which in the (telescopic angular) cluster field, shows emission lines. Hu et al. in 2005 found 13 variable stars in the field; at least three are suspect as cluster members. To be a member means to have a gravitational tie or, if recently freed, having been created by the same event.

<text>Messier 36 or M36, also known as NGC 1960 or the Pinwheel Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the somewhat northern Auriga constellation. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654, who described it as a nebulous patch. The cluster was independently re-discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749, then Charles Messier observed it in 1764 and added it to his catalogue. It is about 1,330 pc (4,340 light years) away from Earth. The cluster is very similar to the Pleiades cluster (M45), and if as far away it would be of similar apparent magnitude.

This cluster has an angular diameter of and a core radius of . It has a mass of roughly and a linear tidal radius of . Based upon photometry, the age of the cluster has been estimated by Wu et al. (2009) as 25.1 Myr and  Myr by Bell et al. (2013). The luminosity of the stars that have not yet depleted their lithium implies an age of  Myr, in good agreement with these older estimates.

M36 includes ten stars with a visual magnitude brighter than 10, and 178 down to magnitude 14. 38 members display an infrared excess, with one being particularly high. There is one candidate B-type variable star, of 9th magnitude.

A 2020 study of the variable stars in the cluster estimated a new closer distance of 3,800 light years from Earth.

A young stellar object with an outflow, associated with the infrared source IRAS 05327+3404 was discovered in optical observations of M36. The outflow is nicknamed &quot;Holoea&quot;, Hawaiian for &quot;flowing gas&quot;. Despite appearing close to M36 it is probably not a part of M36 .It may be a member of the more distant S235 region. The young star driving the outflow was classified as transitional between class I and class II and appears to be surrounded by large amounts of circumstellar material.

<text>The Aero A.11 was a biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft built in Czechoslovakia between the First and Second World Wars. It formed the basis for many other Czechoslovakian military aircraft of the inter-war period. Around 250 were built, with some remaining in service at the outbreak of World War II.

Designed by Antonin Husnik, it was a development of the Aero A.12 (despite what the numbering of the designs might suggest). A Hispano-Suiza 8Fb-powered version, the A.11H-s was built for the Finnish Air Force, the only foreign operator of the type. The Finns had eight aircraft of this type and used them between 1927 and 1939.

The Aero A.11 was the basis of the later Aero A.25 Aero A.29, Aero A.30, and Aero A.32 aircraft.

Aircraft A-11.105 was modified in 1928 with a 240 hp (176 kw) Walter Castor I engine installed, and first flown in March 1930. After undergoing military trials, 25 planes were produced as the Aero A.211 from 1930-1933. The A.211 featured advanced instrumentation in comparison to the A.11, was lengthened to 8.6m, and the weight was reduced to 880 kg. These planes carried no weapons and stayed in service until around 1939.

After the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Air Force retained 3 Aš.11, 3 AP.32, 1 A.25, and 3 A.211s. The aircraft that remained in the Czech Republic were captured by Germany and A.211s were used by the Luftwaffe for training, with 4 units still on the books as of May 1940.

<text>Messier 37 (also known as M37, [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 2099, or the Salt and Pepper Cluster) is the brightest and richest open cluster in the constellation Auriga. It was discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna before 1654. M37 was missed by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil when he rediscovered M36 and M38 in 1749. French astronomer Charles Messier independently rediscovered M37 in September 1764 but all three of these clusters were recorded by Hodierna. It is classified as Trumpler type I,1,r or I,2,r. 

M37 exists in the antipodal direction, opposite from the Galactic Center as seen from Earth, so is in one of the nearby outer arms. Specifically it is still close enough to be in our own. Estimates of its age range from 347 million to 550 million years. It has 1,500 times the mass of the Sun () and contains over 500 identified stars, with roughly 150 stars brighter than magnitude 12.5. M37 has at least a dozen red giants and its hottest surviving main sequence star is of stellar classification B9 V. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term metallicity, is similar to, if not slightly higher than, the abundance in the Sun. As of 2022, it contains only the third known planetary nebula associated with an open cluster.

At its estimated distance of around from Earth, the cluster&#x27;s angular diameter of 24 arcminutes corresponds to a physical extent of about . The tidal radius of the cluster, where external gravitational perturbations begin to have a significant influence on the orbits of its member stars, is about . This cluster is following an orbit through the Milky Way with a period of 219.3 Ma and an eccentricity of 0.22. This will bring it as close as to, and as distant as from, the Galactic Center. It reaches a peak distance above the galactic plane of and will cross the plane with a period of 31.7 Ma.

<doc id="962085" wikidata="Q29587" url="?curid=962085" title="Kuskovo">
<text>Kuskovo () was the summer country house and estate of the Sheremetev family. Built in the mid-18th century, it was originally situated several miles to the east of Moscow but now is part of the East District of the city. It was one of the first great summer country estates of the Russian nobility, and one of the few near Moscow still preserved. Today the estate is the home of the Russian State Museum of Ceramics, and the park is a favourite place of recreation for Muscovites.

== History ==
In the 17th century, Kuskovo became the property of Boris Petrovich Sheremetev (1652–1719), a Russian field marshal under Czar Peter the Great, who led the Russian Army in the victory over the Swedes at the Battle of Poltava (1707) in the Great Northern War. There was already a wooden church on the site, a house and several ponds.

The palace was constructed by his son Petr Borisovich Sheremetev (1713–1788). Count Sheremetev was one of the richest men in Russia, close to the court and a patron of the arts. He built Kuskovo at approximately the same time that he built a city palace on the banks of the Fontanka River in St. Petersburg. When he decided to build a palace at Kuskovo, he ordered that it be larger and more beautiful than the estates of other nobles, and equal to any residence of the Czars. Since it was less than a day&#x27;s journey from the center of Moscow, it was not designed to accommodate overnight guests, nor for agriculture or any other practical purpose, but purely as a place for entertainment, ceremony and festivities.

The Dutch House was constructed between 1749 and 1751 by architect Y.I. Kologrivov, who then enlarged the pond into a lake and laid out the park and canals. After the death of Kologrivov in 1754, the construction of the palace was begun by the young architect Fiodor I. Argunov, who had designed the grotto and the belvedere by the canal in the eastern part of the park. When Fiodor Argunov became occupied with the construction of the Sheremetev house on the Fontanka in St. Petersburg, the task of designing the palace was given to the famous Moscow architect Karl Blank.

The twenty-six rooms of the palace were designed for entertaining and impressing guests on state occasions. Count Sheremetev entertained in a grand style; his outdoor entertainments in the park attracted as many twenty-five thousand guests. Entertainments included his a famous theater and orchestra with serf actors. The estate was visited by Empress Catherine II in 1775; an obelisk in the park marks the event.

By the end of the 18th century, the estate went into a decline. It was badly damaged during the French invasion in 1812. In the 1830s, the serf theater was torn down. After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, parcels of land were divided up and rented out.

After the 1917 Revolution, the estate was nationalized. In 1919 the palace was turned into a small museum of natural history. Ten years later it became the home of the state museum of porcelain, which had been founded in 1918–20 on Podossensky Street in Moscow. It housed the nationalized collections of Russian art collectors A. Morozov, L. Zoubalov, and Botkine. In 1932 it was renamed the State Museum of Ceramics.

== The Palace of Kuskovo ==
The palace was designed in the new neoclassical style, then becoming popular for state buildings in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The exterior was made of wooden planks, which were plastered and painted in soft pastel colors. The palace looked out onto a court of honor, formed by the palace, the church and the large lake. The six-column portico at the front of the house was designed with a ramp so that carriages with as many as eight horses could come directly to the front door. When the carriage arrived, servants would rush out the front doors and hold the horses while the guests descended.

== The Park of Kuskovo ==
The park of Kuskovo was created between 1750 and 1780 as a formal Garden à la française, with large ornamental parterres of flowers, carefully trimmed hedges, and alleys which met at either right or diagonal angles, and were ornamented with statues, and lined with either rows of trees trimmed into spheres, large vases; orange trees; or myrtle trees trimmed into cones. Eight park alleys converge in a single point, where the circular Hermitage pavilion (1764–77) now stands. Count Sheremetev spent most of his time in the Hermitage, coming to the Palace only for formal occasions and holidays.

==The Grotto==
The grotto was constructed between 1755 and 1761 by the architect F. Argunov, and was intended to represent the palace of the King of the Seas.

==The Dutch House==
A traditional brick Dutch house was constructed in the 1750s on a small pond near the Palace. the house has kitchen on the ground floor decorated from floor to ceiling with tiles from Delft.

== The Orangerie ==
The orangerie (1761–1764) was designed by F. Argounov.

In 1919 the palace was nationalized, and it was declared the State Museum of Ceramics twenty years later.

== The State Museum of Ceramics ==
The museum in the Orangerie contains collections of fine porcelain assembled by Russian merchants and Empress Maria Fedorovna before the Russian Revolution. The major sections are: 
*German porcelain of the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly from the royal porcelain works at Meissen
*English porcelain from Chelsea and Josiah Wedgwood.
*French porcelain from the 18th century from manufacture royale of Sèvres. One highlight of the collection is the Egyptian service, commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 to commemorate his Egyptian campaign, and presented by Napoleon to Czar Alexander I at the Tilsit Conference in 1807.
*Danish porcelain of the 18th and 19th century.
*Russian and Soviet porcelain of the 18th, 19th and 20th century. The collection of porcelain on revolutionary themes from the early Soviet period is particularly notable.

<text>Messier 38 or M38, also known as NGC 1912 or Starfish Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Auriga. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and independently found by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. The open clusters M36 and M37, also discovered by Hodierna, are often grouped together with M38. Distance is about away from Earth. The open cluster NGC 1907 lies nearby on the sky, but the two are most likely just experiencing a fly-by, having originated in different parts of the galaxy.

The cluster&#x27;s brightest stars form a pattern resembling the Greek letter Pi or, according to Webb, an &quot;oblique cross&quot;. Walter Scott Houston described its appearance as follows:
Photographs usually show a departure from circularity, a feature quite evident to visual observers. Older reports almost always mention a cross shape, which seems more pronounced with small instruments. A view with a 24-inch reflector on a fine Arizona night showed the cluster as irregular, and the host of stars made fruitless any effort to find a geometrical figure.

At its distance of 1066 pc., its angular diameter of about 20 arc minutes corresponds to about 4.0 parsecs (13 light years), similar to that of its more distant neighbor M37. It is of intermediate age at about 290 million years. From the population of about 100 stars, this open cluster features a prominent yellow giant with the apparent magnitude +7.9 and spectral type G0 as its brightest member. This corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -1.5, or a luminosity of 900 Suns. For comparison, the Sun would appear as a faint magnitude +15.3 star from the distance of M38.

<text>StreetWise is a street magazine sold by people without homes or those at-risk for homelessness in Chicago. Topics covered depend on what is happening in Chicago at the time.

StreetWise contains art, poetry, and articles by vendors; as well as stories of local and national interest, particularly progressive issues.

== History ==

In 1991 a group of Chicago business people joined the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless to address the growing problem of street homelessness. In 1992, Judd Lofchie created StreetWise. About 200 vendors sell approximately 20,000 magazines weekly. The vendors buy the magazine for 90 cents each and sell for $2, keeping the profit. In 2003, it had the largest readership of any street publication in the United States of America.

Over time, the magazine has fallen victim to a slow economy. Foundation support had made up nearly half of StreetWise&#x27;s $500,000 budget but is down 60 percent as of 2012. Ad revenues also are in decline and street sales have dropped 20 percent.

After publishers and board members announced on April 15, 2009, that declining revenues and foundation support might force a closure with 45 days, donations began pouring in. Before the end of the day, an influx of almost $41,000 helped the ailing publication halfway to its goal. Within a week, over $190,000 in donations were made, far exceeding the needed $75,000 to keep afloat.

During a February 2009 meeting, StreetWise&#x27;s board of directors decided to fire Executive Director Michael Speer and began to discuss potential replacements. Bruce Crane was promoted to turn the company around. Crane reduced operation costs and increased ad sales. The organization went from $200,000 in debt to posting a net income of $1,168 last year under Crane.

Jim LoBianco, the former Commissioner for the Office of Homeless Services in Chicago, succeeded Bruce Crane as the magazine&#x27;s executive director on January 1, 2011.

In 2008, the format changed from the original tabloid-style newspaper to a magazine publication.

<doc id="962100" wikidata="Q7028396" url="?curid=962100" title="Nickelodeon Studios">
<text>Nickelodeon Studios was a production studio and theme park attraction run by the television network Nickelodeon at Universal Studios Florida.

Opening on June 7, 1990, as &quot;The First World Headquarters for Kids&quot;, the studio attracted young tourists as contestants and audience members for Nickelodeon&#x27;s live-action programming. At its peak, the studio employed 400 people and was the largest production studio in Florida, bringing $110 million in business to the state by 1994.

The studio closed permanently on April 30, 2005, after much of Nickelodeon&#x27;s production had moved to Nickelodeon on Sunset in Los Angeles. Nickelodeon Studios produced over 2,000 episodes of original programming.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
In November 1988, Nickelodeon contracted space within the soon to be built Universal Studios Florida for its first production studio. Universal had determined through market research that a working studio was crucial in attracting guests to a movie themed park, and they offered Nickelodeon a sweetheart deal to supply that production. The promise of a custom-built studio at no expense, coupled with rent-free production, lured Nickelodeon away from negotiating with Disney-MGM Studios. The contract stipulated that Nickelodeon promote Universal Studios Florida on-air 1,000 times per year, while also broadcasting the park&#x27;s television commercials.

Turner Construction Company began erecting two soundstages (18 and 19) and an adjacent video production facility (Building 17) within the Production Central area of the park in 1989. 
The exterior of the facility was designed by network production designer Byron Taylor, and the interior was designed by network art director Don St. Mars. Viacom senior vice president Scott Davis would supervise the design and construction of the complex, and he was later named the first general manager of Nickelodeon Studios.

&quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; in April 1989 and &quot;Think Fast&quot; in January 1990 were the first Nickelodeon productions filmed at Universal Studios Florida, and they were shot on the Soundstage 21 while Nickelodeon Studios was still being constructed. Like other Nickelodeon game shows, both programs were previously filmed at WHYY-TV in Philadelphia. Nickelodeon&#x27;s live-action productions had traditionally been shot on rented soundstages in multiple cities, which was not cost-effective and limited the network&#x27;s growth.

Prior to the studio&#x27;s completion, &quot;Double Dare&quot; executive producer Andy Bamberger, &quot;Double Dare&quot; creator Geoffrey Darby, Nickelodeon President Geraldine Laybourne, and Nickelodeon Studios general manager Scott Davis wrote their names in Building 17&#x27;s second story cement floor. Bamberger, who also served as executive producer of &quot;Make the Grade&quot; and &quot;Total Panic&quot;, wrote &quot;I Love TV Production&quot; above his name.

===Opening and reception===
On June 7, 1990, Universal Studios Florida officially opened to the public. &quot;Nickelodeon Studios Opening Day Celebration!&quot; was broadcast live from the studio on Nickelodeon, hosted by Marc Summers of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot;. The event was announced by John Harvey of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; and co-hosted by Greg Lee of &quot;Total Panic&quot;, Skip Lackey of &quot;Think Fast&quot;, Christine Taylor and Kelly Brown of &quot;Hey Dude&quot; (in character as Melody and Brad respectively), and Alie Smith, Matt Brown, Wendy Douglas and Will Friedle of &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Sit There!&quot;. Celebrity appearances were made by Andrea Elson, Bill Cosby, Brooke Theiss, Danny Ponce, Gerard Christopher, Jane Seymour, Jason Hervey, Kellie Martin, Les Lye, Linda Blair, Steven Spielberg and Wil Wheaton. The broadcast included live performances by Kid &#x27;n Play, Perfect Gentlemen and The Cover Girls.

Daily tours were given of the studio, starting with a queue area outside Soundstage 18 that led into Building 17. The 45-minute tours took park guests upstairs through the control room, through a viewing area that allowed glimpses of Soundstages 18 and 19, then downstairs through the wardrobe department and Gak Kitchen, with the tour concluding in Building 17&#x27;s large audition room. While game shows were often shot 5 days a week while in production, sitcoms such as &quot;Welcome Freshmen&quot; would rehearse during the week and only shoot on weekends. This became problematic, as Nickelodeon&#x27;s contract with Universal stipulated that their guests would be able to witness shows being filmed, &quot;seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, during all hours of the tour&#x27;s operation&quot;. To remedy this, the audition room was renamed Soundstage 17 and began hosting Game Lab, a mock game show at the end of every tour that culminated with one of the guests getting slimed.

Nickelodeon unveiled its Slime Geyser (also known as the Gak Geyser) in front of the studio on October 27, 1990. Russell Johnson, famous for playing The Professor on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, appeared at the unveiling ceremony. The 17-foot high fountain would &quot;erupt&quot; with green colored water every 10 minutes. The network subsequently used a recording of the Geyser erupting as the sign-on for their broadcasting day.

On April 30, 1992, the Nickelodeon time capsule was buried near the Slime Geyser. The burial ceremony was broadcast live on Nickelodeon and hosted by Mike O&#x27;Malley of &quot;Get the Picture&quot; and Joey Lawrence of &quot;Blossom&quot;, with an appearance by Dr. Emmett Brown of &quot;Back to the Future: The Ride&quot; (portrayed by the park&#x27;s costumed performer and not Christopher Lloyd). It contains items deemed important to the children of 1992 as voted upon by Nickelodeon viewers. These items included a Barbie doll, baseball, books (comic book, endangered species book, history book, phone book, TV Guide and World Atlas), bubble gum, CDs (MC Hammer and Michael Jackson), hat featuring the catchphrase of Joey Lawrence, news reports (1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS and Operation Desert Storm), Nickelodeon Gak, &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, Nintendo Game Boy, pencils, photos of things too big to fit inside (bicycles, cars, celebrities, planes, politicians and trains), piece of the Berlin Wall, Reebok Pump sneakers, Rollerblades, skateboard, t-shirt featuring the Nicktoons characters &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;, Twinkies, and VHS movies (&quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Home Alone&quot;). The final items put in the capsule were a tape of the event itself and the camcorder used to record it.

&quot;Roundhouse&quot; moved to CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles for the filming of its second season in 1993. The show&#x27;s unionized cast, crew and musicians were unhappy that working in Orlando deprived them of residuals. As a right-to-work state, Florida had attracted producers looking to avoid union costs and regulations that were prevalent in California.

An episode of &quot;Weinerville&quot; shot on February 14, 1994, marked the 1,000th episode of live-action programming filmed at the studio since its opening. Nickelodeon Studios had at that point brought $110 million in business to Florida, and regularly employed between 280 and 330 people on a weekly basis.

===Decline and closure===
Universal Studios Florida trailed Walt Disney World in attendance at the end of 1994, with Universal hosting 7.7 million guests that year compared with Disney&#x27;s 28.9 million. To stay competitive, Universal broke ground on Islands of Adventure in 1995, recommitting itself primarily as a theme park with the $2 billion expansion. Universal by then saw the production studio aspect of the park as secondary to its thrill rides, shortening their marketing slogan from &quot;See the Stars. Ride the Movies&quot; to &quot;Ride the Movies&quot;. The number of new productions began decreasing not only at Nickelodeon Studios, but at Universal Studios Florida proper and the competing Disney-MGM Studios.

&quot;Rugrats&quot; in 1995 had become an unexpected success in reruns, causing Nickelodeon to heavily invest in animation and producing new episodes of the show. Nickelodeon&#x27;s in-house Nicktoons animation at the point was produced at Games Animation in Los Angeles. Albie Hecht, the network&#x27;s President of Film and Entertainment, met with his in-house animators in 1996 to solicit opinions on what a new animation studio should look like. That same year, producers Mike Tollin and Brian Robbins requested Nickelodeon move filming of their hit live-action show &quot;All That&quot; from Orlando to Los Angeles so they wouldn&#x27;t have to leave home for production. The network obliged, and the third season of &quot;All That&quot; was filmed on a rented soundstage at Paramount Pictures while Nickelodeon searched for a permanent Hollywood studio.

Corporate changes also began affecting the future of Nickelodeon Studios. Geraldine Laybourne, longtime champion of the Orlando facility, left her position as President of Nickelodeon in February 1996 and was replaced by executive vice president Herb Scannell. Nickelodeon Studios general manager Scott Davis exited in 1997 and was replaced by &quot;Nickelodeon Guts&quot; creator Scott Fishman.

&quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot; was shut down by a labor strike in August 1997 when the production switched from videotape to film stock. Movies and television shows shot on film stock were regulated by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The show&#x27;s producer, Alan Goodman, would move production of &quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo&quot; to Montreal for the filming of its final season. Canada was attracting American productions at the time with tax incentives and a favorable exchange rate.

Nickelodeon opened two new studios in California, the live-action studio Nickelodeon on Sunset in 1997, and the Nickelodeon Animation Studio in 1998. Nickelodeon Studios partnered with visual effects company Kinetix in August 1998 to upgrade Building 17 with a training center for Kinetix software, attempting to remain viable against Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids launched in 1999, airing reruns of game shows produced by the network with new wraparound segments filmed at Nickelodeon Studios.

The studio began laying off employees in March 2001 since a majority of Nickelodeon&#x27;s closed-set productions had moved to California, game shows were no longer being produced, and the network&#x27;s highest rated programming was animated. The studio auctioned off its remaining props in storage at their offsite scene shop in June 2001. The final program taped at the facility was &quot;Nickelodeon Splat!&quot;, which aired live on August 17, 2004. The studio closed permanently on April 30, 2005.

===Legacy===
Nickelodeon Studios was responsible for producing over 2,000 episodes of original, live-action programming for Nickelodeon. The facility employed 400 people at its peak, at which point it was the largest production studio in Florida.

&quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; won the CableACE Award (1990) for Best Children&#x27;s Series, &quot;Roundhouse&quot; won the CableACE Award (1993) for Best Original Song, &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; won the CableACE Award (1995) for Best Game Show Series, &quot;Taina&quot; won the ALMA Award (2002) for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Television Programming, and Melissa Joan Hart received the Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award (2013) for her title role in &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;.

&quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; received an Emmy nomination (1994) for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program, &quot;Nick News: Space Shuttle, Phone Home&quot; received an Emmy nomination (1995) for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Special, and &quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot; received an Emmy nomination (1997) for Outstanding Preschool Children&#x27;s Series.

===Remnants===

On November 9, 2006, Universal announced that Soundstage 18 would be redesigned to become a 1,000-seat permanent venue for the Blue Man Group&#x27;s self-titled residency show. The new theatre opened on June 1, 2007, and was sponsored by Sharp Aquos until 2012. Their residency ended on February 1, 2021, leaving Soundstage 18 vacant.

The Nickelodeon time capsule buried by the network in 1992 was removed in August 2006 and reburied at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort. Upon the hotel&#x27;s closure in 2016, it was reburied at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio and is set to be opened on April 30, 2042. The time capsule&#x27;s original cover was sold by Heritage Auctions in 2022 for $19,200.

Nickelodeon returned to film &quot;My Family&#x27;s Got Guts&quot; in 2008, using some of the former Nickelodeon Studios facilities including the green room. Training was in Soundstage 19, and the actual production was filmed nearby on Soundstages 23 and 24.

The complex became popular for urban exploration, as Universal left much of the original Nickelodeon branding intact for years after the studio closed. In 2012, YouTube personality adamthewoo gained access to Soundstage 19 and the upper floors of Building 17, documenting vastly untouched murals and decor from the heyday of the studios. A majority of these remnants were removed following a 2018 renovation.
