<text>Goodwood railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction station for the Belair, Seaford and Flinders lines. The Belair line diverges south-east towards Millswood, while the Seaford and Flinders lines diverge south-west towards Clarence Park. The Glenelg tram line crosses over the railway lines at the south end of Goodwood station. The station services the Adelaide inner-southern suburb of Goodwood, and is 5.0 km from Adelaide station.

== History ==
Goodwood railway station opened on 5 March 1883 with the opening of the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Melbourne line. It became a junction station in 1915 when the Willunga railway line (now the Seaford railway line) was constructed. Prior to 1929, what is now the Glenelg tram line was a railway line that crossed the main south line on a level junction. As part of its conversion from a broad gauge railway to a standard gauge tramway, a bridge was built to carry the trams safely over the railway lines.

Pre-1955, the Belair trains typically used Platform 1 for outbound services, and Platform 2 for inbound services, whilst the Willunga trains used Platform 3 for outbound services, and Platform 4 for inbound services. The yard immediately south allowed trains to transfer from any platform to any line. The most common use of this feature was when Inter/Intrastate freight and passenger trains would use the Willunga tracks to Goodwood from Keswick Rail Yards, then change to the Belair tracks through Goodwood Yard.

Prior to the One Nation gauge standardisation project in 1995, all four tracks at Goodwood were broad gauge, and the Belair line was dual broad gauge tracks. In 1995, the western track of the Belair line was converted to standard gauge, and the Belair line is now only a single track of each gauge.

Goodwood station was the main railway station servicing the Royal Adelaide Showgrounds. However between 2005 and 2013 during the Royal Adelaide Show, TransAdelaide closed Platform 1 at Goodwood, and exclusively devoted the easternmost of the four tracks between Adelaide and Goodwood to a non-stop shuttle service between Platform 1 at Adelaide station and a temporary platform at the Showgrounds named Showground Central. During this period, Belair line movements were merged with (the previously) Noarlunga Line movements through Platforms 2 and 3 at Goodwood. In 2014, Showground Central was replaced by the permanent Adelaide Showground station with existing services making additional stops.

=== Renewal ===
In 2013-14 tracks through the station were electrified along with the rest of the Seaford line. Platform 3 which is serviced by Belair trains is only electrified up to the South end of the platform which is where the overhead wires are pulled across to a pole. There is a sign there that states &#x27;EMU do not proceed past this point.&#x27; Platform 3 is serviced by 3000/3100 class DEMU railcars.

The Goodwood Junction Upgrade separated the existing freight and Belair passenger lines from the Seaford line by a grade separation. A rail underpass near Victoria Street lowered the Seaford line below ground level, with the freight and Belair lines above. It was completed in 2014 along with the electrification of the Seaford line. A project to construct a footbridge adjacent to the Goodwood Overpass was announced in May 2016, and would provide a new access point to the station; though as of 2018 work has not commenced.

== Services by platform ==
Goodwood station has three platforms serving the three broad gauge tracks of the three southern metropolitan lines. The fourth and westernmost track, which is part of the standard gauge line to Melbourne, bypasses the no-longer-used fourth platform. From the north of the stations, there are four tracks between Greenhill Road and the station. The westernmost track is standard gauge, and the other three are broad gauge. After the Goodwood underpass construction, Belair trains used Platform 3 for outbound and inbound service, while Seaford and Flinders trains used Platform 1 for outbound service, and Platform 2 for inbound services.

Despite the tram line crossing directly over the station, there is no interchange with the tram here. The nearest tram stops are Stop 4 Forestville and Stop 3 Goodwood Rd.

<doc id="946510" wikidata="Q6935136" url="?curid=946510" title="Multivariate gamma function">
<text>In mathematics, the multivariate gamma function Γ&quot;p&quot; is a generalization of the gamma function. It is useful in multivariate statistics, appearing in the probability density function of the Wishart and inverse Wishart distributions, and the matrix variate beta distribution.

It has two equivalent definitions. One is given as the following integral over the formula_1 positive-definite real matrices:

:formula_2
where formula_3 denotes the determinant of formula_4. The other one, more useful to obtain a numerical result is:

:formula_5
In both definitions, formula_6 is a complex number whose real part satisfies formula_7. Note that formula_8 reduces to the ordinary gamma function. The second of the above definitions allows to directly obtain the recursive relationships for formula_9:
:formula_10

Thus

* formula_11
* formula_12

and so on.

This can also be extended to non-integer values of formula_13 with the expression:

formula_14

Where G is the Barnes G-function, the indefinite product of the Gamma function.

The function is derived by Anderson from first principles who also cites earlier work by Wishart, Mahalanobis and others.

There also exists a version of the multivariate gamma function which instead of a single complex number takes a formula_13-dimensional vector of complex numbers as its argument. It generalizes the above defined multivariate gamma function insofar as the latter is obtained by a particular choice of multivariate argument of the former.

== Derivatives ==

We may define the multivariate digamma function as
:formula_16
and the general polygamma function as
:formula_17

=== Calculation steps ===

* Since
::formula_18
:it follows that 
::formula_19

* By definition of the digamma function, ψ, 
::formula_20

:it follows that
::formula_21

<text>Marino railway station is located on the Seaford line. Situated in the southern Adelaide suburb of Marino, it is 18.3 kilometres from Adelaide station.

In addition to serving the hillside Marino community, the station provides the rest of Adelaide with public transport access to a host of local amenities such as the Marino Community Hall (20M) and the Historic Kingston House (500M). The sporting clubs Seacliff Hockey Club &amp; Seacliff Tennis Club are also within walking distance from the station (800M). Brighton Caravan Park (750M) is a popular beachside Caravan and Campground within 10 minutes walk from the Station.

==History==

Marino was opened in 1913 as the terminus of the Seaford line, until it was extended further south.

The 1974-built station building was built during the duplication of the line between Oaklands and Hallett Cove Beach in 1975. The station did have a ticket office but it had closed by the 1990s, then replaced with a “bus” type shelter in 2011. The station is still operating to this day running short lines with small electric powered locomotives.

[2] On the 26 October 2024 South Australian Premier the Honourable Peter Malinauskas MP, announced the State Government will invest 2 million dollars to upgrade the Marino Train Station, following a House of Assembly Petition and extensive community advocacy from Darren Bailhache, the Marino and Kingston Park Neighbourhood Watch Area Coordinator between 2022 - 2025.
Planning will start immediately with works to commence in 2025, that will include the installation of the latest CCTV camera technology, 24-hour emergency phones, tactile paving installation, a new shelter and platform upgrades. This was announced in addition to $700,000 that had been allocated for improved lighting.

<text>Port Adelaide railway station is a commuter railway station located on the Outer Harbor line. It serves the port-side region of Port Adelaide. It originally opened as Commercial Road, the current name of Port Adelaide was given in 1981. Situated in the north-western Adelaide suburb of Alberton, it is 11.7 kilometres from Adelaide station.

==History==

The line from Adelaide to Port Adelaide was the second railway in South Australia (after the Goolwa-Port Elliot railway began in 1854) and opened in 1856. The original line from Adelaide ran directly to Port Dock station, the site now occupied by the National Railway Museum. Various lines then continued through the Port Adelaide&#x27;s streets to the wharves and, from 1878, along St Vincent Street to the seaside town of Semaphore.

Congestion at Port Dock railway station and the delays involved in operating trains along busy streets in the centre of the Port resulted in construction of a viaduct and a new bridge across the Port River in 1916. This diverted through trains to Semaphore and Outer Harbor via a new station named Commercial Road, the current station. Port Adelaide Commercial Road was quite a substantial building, with long platforms, an overall roof and a signal cabin. This quickly took over from Port Dock as the town&#x27;s principal railway station.

As rail traffic decreased through the 1960s and 70s, facilities at Commercial Road station were gradually reduced. In the early 1970s the roof was removed, platforms shortened and the street level station buildings reconstructed. The ticket office closed in January 1979 and the station has been unstaffed since then. With the closure of Port Dock station in 1981, Commercial Road station was subsequently renamed Port Adelaide. In November 2009, the station and viaduct closed for refurbishment, reopening on 9 May 2010. Currently, Port Adelaide station&#x27;s two elevated platforms are on a viaduct that carries the railway across Commercial Road. The station is unstaffed and has no buildings or other facilities except basic passenger shelters on each platform.

The tracks through Port Adelaide station were dual gauge from 1982, both broad gauge and . This allowed freight traffic from Dry Creek via the Rosewater loop to access industrial facilities on the Lefevre Peninsula and the container terminal at Pelican Point. In August 2008, freight traffic was diverted to operate via the Mary MacKillop Bridge downstream of the Port Adelaide harbour. The disused standard gauge rails have been removed, however the dual gauge sleepers remain in place to allow for the entire Outer Harbor line to be gauge converted in the future.

<text>Woodville railway station is the junction station for the Grange, Outer Harbor and Port Dock lines with the lines diverging immediately north of the station. Situated in the western Adelaide suburb of Woodville, it is 7.5 kilometres from Adelaide station. It has auto pedestrian gates and lights. Platform 3 had a small kiosk, built around 2006, that sells refreshments and tickets, but has not been opened since 2009.

==History==

Woodville station was one of the original stations on the Adelaide to Port Adelaide railway, which opened in April 1856. The only other intermediate stations on the new line were at Bowden and Alberton. In the early days, Adelaide to Port Adelaide was a single-track railway and a passing loop was provided at Woodville. As traffic on the line increased, the single track was duplicated throughout in 1881.

The 1920s and 1930s saw significant development of heavy industry in Woodville and the neighbouring areas. For example, Holdens Motor Body Builders (later General Motors Holden) built a factory in the fork between the Grange and Outer Harbor lines. Sidings were laid to service the factory and Holdens station opened in 1928 a short way along the Grange line. Cars were dispatched by rail from Holdens&#x27; sidings.

The Woodville signal cabin became obsolete after a resignalling project in the late 1980s and has been relocated to the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide. In late 2016, the station was ranked as one of the best stations in the western suburbs based on 5 criteria.

=== Grange Railway ===

The railway line between Woodville and Grange opened in September 1882. It was a private railway, constructed by the Grange Railway and Investment Company. The early railway was not a financial success and was bought out by the South Australian Railways in 1893.

===Branch lines===
In World War II several munitions and armaments factories were opened, which resulted in construction of two new industrial branch lines in the Woodville area. The Finsbury line was opened in September 1940 and departed from the main line at Woodville. It headed in a northerly direction and serviced a wartime munitions works at Cheltenham Park and a Government Supply Depot at Finsbury. The line continued through Pennington to join the Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway at Gillman Junction. The layout at Woodville station was altered in 1942 when a new platform face was constructed on the north-east side of today&#x27;s Platform 3 to serve Finsbury trains. The original 1856 station building on the Port Adelaide-bound platform was demolished and a new signal cabin was provided adjacent to the Woodville Road level crossing.

This industrial line had limited passenger services, designed mainly to cater for workers at factories in the vicinity. After the end of World War II there were no off-peak trains, or weekend services after Saturday lunchtime. The Finsbury line closed on 17 August 1979 and later dismantled and redeveloped. The Islamic Arabic Centre &amp; Al-Khalil Mosque on Torrens Road, Woodville North stands where the extensive Woodville North station platform used to stand until the 1980s.

==Services by platform==
For many years, the Grange line was operated by a shuttle service train at weekends and in the evenings. This terminated at Platform 1 and made connections with Outer Harbor line trains to and from Adelaide. However, since about 1996, all Grange trains have operated through to Adelaide.

<text>Nityananda (, ; c. 1474-c. 1540), also called Nityananda Prabhu and Nitai, was a primary religious figure within the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition of Bengal. Nityananda was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s friend and disciple. Chaitanya and Nityananda are often mentioned together as &quot;Gaura-Nitai&quot; (&quot;Gaura&quot;, referring to Chaitanya) or &quot;Nimai-Nitai&quot; (&quot;Nimai&quot; being a name of Chaitanya). 

According to Gaudiya-Vaishnava tradition, Nityananda is Balarama Himself (so is also called Nityananda Rama, where &quot;Rama&quot; refers to Balarama), with Chaitanya being His eternal brother and friend, Krishna. Chaitanya is considered the &quot;most merciful&quot; incarnation of Krishna as &quot;Svayam bhagavan&quot;.

Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, the early 20th-century Gaudiya-Vaishnava reformer, writes about Nityananda&#x27;s theological position as the embodiment of the mercy of the guru: &quot;Nityananda is the Primary Manifestive Constituent of the Divinity. Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda, the function is embodied. Nityananda is the servant-God.&quot;

==Life==
Nityananda was born to a religious Bengali Brahmin called Pandit Hadai, and his wife, Padmavati, in Ekachakra around 1474. His devotion and great talent for singing Vaishnava hymns (bhajan) were apparent from a very early age. In his youth, he generally played the part of Lakshman, the god Rama&#x27;s younger brother, in dramatic re-enactments of Rama&#x27;s pastimes, along with the other boys of Ekachakra.

At the age of thirteen, Nityananda left home with a travelling renunciate (&quot;sannyasi&quot;) known as Lakshmipati Tirtha. Nityananda&#x27;s father, Hadai, offered Lakshmipati anything he wished as a gift, who replied that he was in need of someone to assist him in his travels to the holy places, and that Nityananda would be perfect for the job. As he had given his word, Hadai agreed, and Nityananda joined Lakshmipati in his travels. Apart from Lakshmipati, who at some point initiated him, Nityananda was also associated with Lakshmipati&#x27;s other disciples: Madhavendra Puri, Advaita Acharya, and Ishvara Puri, the spiritual master of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

He died sometime between the years 1540 and 1544.

===Marriage and descendants===
Nityananda married two daughters of Suryadasa Sarakhela: Vasudha and Jahnava Devi with the help of Uddharan Dutta Thakura of Saptogram. After marriage, he settled in Khardaha, 24 Parganas, West Bengal. He had a son, Virachandra Goswami or Virabhadra (who was later initiated to Vaishnava rites by his co-mother Jahnava Devi) and a daughter, Ganga, by his first wife, Vasudha.

==Legacy==

Chaitanya and Nityananda&#x27;s deeds have deep religious and cultural implications in Bengal. They are credited with the revival of Hinduism in Eastern India. Much of Vaishnava literature, regarded as one of the finest literary heritages of medieval Bengal, came from them or their disciples. Chief among Nityananda&#x27;s disciples were the Twelve Gopalas, who spread the faith throughout the region.

<doc id="946543" wikidata="Q3897539" url="?curid=946543" title="Pat Frank">
<text>Harry Hart &quot;Pat&quot; Frank (May5, 1907October12, 1964) was an American newspaperman, writer, and government consultant. Perhaps the &quot;first of the post-Hiroshima doomsday authors&quot;, his best known work is his post-apocalyptic novel &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; (1959), which depicted the outbreak of a nuclear war and the struggles of its survivors in a small central Florida town.

== Journalism ==
Frank was born in Chicago in 1907. Named after his father who reportedly died of influenza while he was still young, Frank used and wrote under the nickname &quot;Pat&quot; throughout his life. He attended the Peddie School, a private prep school in New Jersey, then moved with his mother to her native northeastern Florida. Frank attended the University of Florida, took journalism courses and worked as a cub reporter for the &quot;Jacksonville Journal&quot; in Atlantic Beach, where his family had a beach house. In a self-told anecdote, because Atlantic Beach was short of news, Frank had reported everything of interest, and the job paid by the word, he invented a local wealthy family, regularly reported on their activities, and even managed to keep his job after the hoax was revealed. Frank went north in the late 1920s and wrote for the &quot;New York World&quot; and &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; before moving on to the &quot;Washington Herald&quot;. But he again got bored by his beat, later describing it as follows:

Frank neglected to mention his reporting on politicians and bureaucrats in the &quot;Herald&quot;, subjects that persisted even as he pursued his new interests in war, diplomacy, and foreign places. When the European war began in 1939, he signed on as the new Washington correspondent for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency news service, then became Washington bureau chief for its new subsidiary, the Overseas News Agency (ONA). In 1941 he joined the predecessor of the Office of War Information and served as an OWI political warfare propagandist in Australia and Turkey. Ever restless, Frank then became a war correspondent for the ONA in Italy and covered postwar events in Austria, Hungary, and Germany.

== Novelist ==
In 1946 Frank published &quot;Mr Adam&quot;, a comic, satirical novel on the response of politicians, bureaucrats, and the media when it is discovered that only one man on Earth has survived sterilization after an accidental nuclear explosion destroys most of Mississippi. Frank&#x27;s light-hearted look at a grim new topic sold more than two million copies and was published in over a dozen countries. On its proceeds Frank soon retired from newspaper reporting, returned to northeast Florida, and began a second career writing novels, short storieshe had had stories published since before the warand freelance magazine pieces.

His second novel, &quot;An Affair of State&quot; (1948), a spy thriller set in Washington and Soviet-occupied Hungary, appeared just four months after the start of the Berlin Airlift that signaled for most Americans the onset of the Cold War. Its protagonist was an ex-serviceman bureaucrat, a junior Foreign Service officer assigned to set up a stay-behind network in Budapest, and the CIA reckoned that it was the first work of fiction to mention the agency. It was followed by &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; (1951), a Korean War novel about a frontline Marine unit in which Frank, perhaps unwisely, applied his World War II experiences to a country and a war he had not yet seen. It nonetheless likely got Frank a stint in Korea to help the U.S. Government with a propaganda documentary and to set up a Korean film unit. He recounted his experiences in Florida and the Far East in an autobiographical travelogue, &quot;The Long Way Round&quot; (1953). For his next book, Frank returned to the thriller with &quot;Forbidden Area&quot; (1956), which featured the landing on a north Florida beach of a group of Soviet agents specially trained to pass as Americans. Their sabotage in preparation for an invasion leads to the brink of nuclear war.

That war arrived in Frank&#x27;s most popular and enduring work, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; (1959). One of several contemporaneous novels treating nuclear war or its aftermath&quot;Tomorrow!&quot;, &quot;On The Beach&quot;, &quot;Red Alert&quot;, &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;, &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;it recounts the war&#x27;s outbreak and subsequent impact on Fort Repose, a small town in north-central Florida modeled on Mount Dora, near where Frank wrote the book. Part countdown-to-war drama, part survivalist tale, the book inspired numerous similar works and remains in print.

A film version of &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; was released in 1956, and one of his short stories, &quot;The Girl Who Almost Got Away&quot;, was the basis for Howard Hawks&#x27; 1964 comedy &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot;. &quot;Forbidden Area&quot; was adapted by Rod Serling for the 1957 debut episode of the television anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Charlton Heston. The penultimate April 3, 1960, episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; featured &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;, starring Don Murray and Dana Andrews. Several efforts to get it onto the big screen were unsuccessful.

Frank wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;We Shall Return&quot; (1963), a drama starring Cesar Romero as the patriarch of a Cuban refugee family newly arrived in Florida and their effort to organize a Bay of Pigs–type overthrow of the recently-installed Castro regime.

== Politics and government ==
After his first two novels, critics were less kind to Frank&#x27;s books. But if his later work got Frank pigeon-holed as a writer of &quot;atomic potboilers&quot;, their popular success and topicality ultimately afforded their author opportunities inside government. A lifelong Democrat, he served as a speechwriter for the Democratic National Committee during the 1960 Kennedy campaign and after. In 1961 he received the American Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Outstanding Citizenship Award in an era when it focused primarily on voter registration and civic participation. In 1961 he was a part-time consultant to the National Aeronautics and Space Council. Frank applied his experience with government and his investigatory and story-telling skills to &quot;How to Survive the H-Bomb... and Why&quot; (1962), a book whose reading suggests a non-fiction version of his research for &quot;Alas! Babylon&quot;. Frank was critical of the Eisenhower civil defense bureaucracy in those books, but in &quot;How to Survive the H-Bomb&quot; he praised the recent changes made by the Kennedy Administration. In 1963 Frank joined the team: he helped organize information operations for the Office of Civil Defense and was later named its public information director, resigning just before his death to work on a new book.

During the 1964 Presidential race, Frank edited &quot;The Goldwater Cartoon Book&quot;, a collection of newspaper clips featuring the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. Posthumously appeared &quot;Rendezvous at Midway: U.S.S. Yorktown and the Japanese carrier fleet&quot; (1967), an account and analysis of the 1942 battle jointly authored with U.S. Navy journalist Joseph D. Harrington.

Apparently a fast-living, fast-spending alcoholic during his second career, Frank died at age 57 of acute pancreatitis on October 12, 1964, in Atlantic Beach. He is buried at Oaklawn Cemetery, Jacksonville.

<doc id="946564" wikidata="Q6928376" url="?curid=946564" title="Mr. Adam">
<text>Mr. Adam (1946) is the first novel written by Pat Frank, dealing with the effects of a nuclear mishap causing worldwide male infertility. Published by J. B. Lippincott Company, it was also released as an Armed Services Edition, a paperback by Pocket Books in 1948, and again in 1959 by Pocket Books with the tag Mr. Adam Was Wanted By Every Woman in the World. All told, it sold over 2 million copies.

==Plot summary==
After a nuclear power plant in Mississippi explodes, it was soon realized that a previously unknown form of radiation was released. The radiation caused all men on Earth to become sterile, even boys who were still inside the mother&#x27;s womb. However, ten months after the explosion in Mississippi, a doctor delivers a perfectly healthy baby girl. It&#x27;s soon discovered that the child&#x27;s father, who has the surname &quot;Adam&quot;, was more than a mile under the surface of Earth inside an old silver and lead mine during the explosion. It would appear that Mr. Adam is humanity&#x27;s only hope to stave off extinction.

==Reception==
One review referred to the comic novel as &quot;a fat prank by Pat Frank.&quot; Eleanor Roosevelt wrote about the novel in her &quot;My Day&quot; column in September 1946, noting that the work is &quot;pure imagination, but there is just enough possibility that it might come true to make one read it with interest.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the book &quot;part fantasy, part lampoon, and is still written with clarity, skill and wit. It makes you chuckle – yes, but it also provides food for thought which a lot of readers should and probably will find quite digestible.&quot;

Though not in the top 10 for the year, the book was a bestseller. The book reportedly sold over two million copies, including its paperback versions. Its success allowed Frank to retire at age 39 and focus on writing.

A stage version of the novel was less successful. The play rights were quickly sold, but it took over two years to reach the stage. One script was rejected, and a new one was written by Jack Kirkland, known for his great success with &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. The original world premiere of the play was set for March 12, 1949 at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, California, but it was banned once designated &quot;in bad taste&quot;. After other trial runs outside New York, the play lasted only a few days on Broadway at the Royale Theatre in May 1949 after getting poor reviews. Its cast included James Dobson, Elisabeth Fraser, Frank Albertson, Howard Freeman, and Emory Parnell.

<doc id="946565" wikidata="Q634180" url="?curid=946565" title="Jerusalem of Gold">
<text>&quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; (, &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;) is an Israeli song written by Naomi Shemer. Often contrasted to Israel&#x27;s national anthem, Hatikva, the original song expressed the deep longing of many Jews to return to Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City and eastern areas. These areas had been inaccessible to Jews after the 1948 Palestine War, when the city was divided and East Jerusalem came under Jordanian control. Following Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War, Shemer added a final verse to commemorate the city&#x27;s reunification under Israeli control and the restored Jewish access to its holy sites.
==History==

The melody of &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; is largely based on the Basque lullaby, &quot;Pello Joxepe&quot;. Naomi Shemer first heard the melody during a visit by Paco Ibáñez to Israel in 1962, where he performed the song to a group that included Shemer and Nehama Hendel. Shemer later acknowledged hearing Hendel perform Pello Joxepe in the 1960s, and had incorporated elements of its melody into &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;. Although Shemer felt regret over the similarity, Ibáñez expressed no ill will, stating that he was pleased the melody had contributed in some way and did not view it as plagiarism.

Naomi Shemer wrote &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; for the Israeli Song Festival, held on May 15, 1967 in West Jerusalem. The song was commissioned by West Jerusalem&#x27;s mayor, Teddy Kollek, as a non-competitive piece. Shemer selected Shuli Natan, an unknown singer at the time, to perform the song.

At the time, the Old City of Jerusalem had been under Jordanian control since the 1948 Palestine War. Jews had been expelled from the Old City and East Jerusalem, losing their homes and possessions. Under Jordanian rule, Jews were barred from returning or entering these areas, and many Jewish holy sites were desecrated or damaged. Three weeks after the song&#x27;s initial public performance, the Six-Day War broke out. The song quickly became a morale-boosting anthem for the Israel Defense Forces. Shemer performed it for Israeli troops before both the war and the song’s official debut at the Israeli Song Festival, making the soldiers among the first to hear it.

On June 7, 1967, the IDF captured East Jerusalem and the Old City from Jordan. Shemer was about to perform for a troop of paratroopers (who were not engaged in combat at the moment) when she received news that the Western Wall and Temple Mount had been taken by Israeli forces. In response, she hastily wrote a new verse, replacing the original second verse, which lamented the inability to visit the Temple Mount, with a triumphant one that celebrated Israel’s return to the Old City—informing the paratroopers through the song that Israel had captured the holy sites. The new verse referenced the sounding of the shofar at the Temple Mount, a tribute to Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who had blown the shofar upon the capture of the Western Wall. Shemer later clarified that the new verse was not intended to replace the original, and that the original three verses should remain the official version of the song.

&quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; was chosen as the &quot;Song of the Year&quot; in Israel in 1967 and &quot;Song of the Jubilee&quot; on Israel&#x27;s 50th Independence Day in 1998.

==Themes==
Many of the lyrics draw from traditional Jewish poetry and themes, particularly those focused on exile and the longing for Jerusalem. The phrase &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; references a piece of jewelry mentioned in a well-known Talmudic legend about Rabbi Akiva. The line &quot;To all your songs, I am a lyre&quot; alludes to Zion ha-lo Tish&#x27;ali, one of the &quot;Songs to Zion&quot; by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, which includes the verse: &quot;I cry out like the jackals when I think of their grief; but, dreaming of the end of their captivity, I am like a harp for your songs.&quot;

The song is interwoven with mournful Biblical references to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish people. איכה (the lament &quot;How?&quot;) is the opening word of the Book of Lamentations, and its traditional Hebrew title; the phrase &quot;the city that sits solitary&quot; appears in the second stanza of the song. The line &quot;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem&quot; is drawn from Psalm 137, which begins with &quot;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.&quot; This sorrowful imagery contrasts with the joyous return from exile depicted in the fourth verse. The phrase &quot;Like the kiss of a Seraph&quot; references Isaiah 6:7.

Talmudic references are also present in the song. The phrase &quot;and to adorn crowns to you&quot; invokes the Talmudic concept of crowning, which the Talmud uses to describe several things, including the Sandalphon&#x27;s service to God.

==Other versions==
According to Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel, there are over 300 versions of the &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;. Along with Natan&#x27;s original recording, notable cover versions have been made by Shemer herself, Yafa Yarkoni, and Ran Eliran. It has been translated into several languages, including by Yafa Yarkoni in Spanish and David Eshet in Yiddish. Osnat Paz&#x27;s recorded a rendition on his children&#x27;s record &quot;My Land of Israel&quot;. 

* Israeli-American singer Queen Ofir recorded a modern version of the song for Jerusalem Day 2020. 
* Daliah Lavi performed the song in 1969 on the UK record &quot;in honour of the 20th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel&quot; with the London Festival Orchestra, conducted by Stanley Black.
* Ofra Haza sang one of the most popular versions of the song at &quot;Pa&#x27;amonei HaYovel&quot; (Bells of the Jubilee), Israel&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration in 1998.
* Chaim Topol sang the song an English translation on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (via satellite from London, where he was then appearing in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;) just days after the end of the Six-Day War. It was likely the first time the song had been heard in the United States. The song was introduced with the title &quot;Jerusalem, Jerusalem&quot;. The words &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; were never used in the lyrics. 
* The song appears in the film &quot;Pour Sacha&quot;.
* The recording from &quot;Pour Sacha&quot; was reused two years later, in 1993, over the final sequence of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. 
* The &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; soundtrack album featured an alternate recording, performed by The Ramat Gan Chamber Choir Tel Aviv, conducted by Hana Tzur.
* Klaus Meine, recorded a cover of the song with Liel Kolet.
* Demis Roussos recorded a version of the song as well, though he changed the verse melody considerably.
* Phish performs the song on tour and recorded a rendition of the song on the 1994 album &quot;Hoist&quot;.
* Roberto Carlos covered a Portuguese version of the song in 2011, singing the verse and the chorus in Hebrew.
* French singer-songwriter Hélène Ségara covered the French version of the song on the 2008 album &quot;Mon Pays C&#x27;est La Terre&quot;, with the verse and the chorus in the original Hebrew.
* Tamar Giladi, Naomi Shemer&#x27;s daughter-in-law, recorded the song with mixed Hebrew and English lyrics.
* Shulem Lemmer covered the song on his 2019 album &quot;The Perfect Dream&quot;. 
* Carola Standertskjöld performed a version written by Sauvo Puhtila, in a 1968 recording.

The song is the corps song of the La Crosse, Wisconsin, Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps. The corps sings it before every competition.

==&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; controversy==
The song is featured in the 1993 American film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the Six-Day War and has no relationship with the subject matter of the movie. In Israeli prints of the film, the song was replaced with Halikha LeKesariya (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;A Walk to Caesarea&quot;), which is universally associated with the Holocaust in Israel and was written by World War II resistance fighter Hannah Szenes in 1942.

<doc id="946566" wikidata="Q430253" url="?curid=946566" title="Backporting">
<text>Backporting is the action of taking parts from a newer version of a software system or software component and porting them to an older version of the same software. It forms part of the maintenance step in a software development process, and it is commonly used for fixing security issues in older versions of the software and also for providing new features to older versions.

==Overview==
The simplest and probably most common situation of backporting is a fixed security hole in a newer version of a piece of software. Consider this simplified example:

* Software v2.0 had a security vulnerability that is fixed by changing the text &#x27;is_unsecured&#x27; to &#x27;is_secured&#x27;.
* The same security hole exists in Software v1.0, from which the codebase for the newer version is derived, but there the text may read &#x27;is_notsecure&#x27;.

By taking the modification that fixes Software v2.0 and changing it so that it applies to Software v1.0, one has effectively backported the fix.

In real-life situations, the modifications that a single aspect of the software has undergone may be simple (only a few lines of code have changed) up to heavy and massive (many modifications spread across multiple files of the code). In the latter case, backporting may become tedious and inefficient and should only be undertaken if the older version of the software is really needed in favour of the newer (if, for example, the newer version still suffers stability problems that prevent its use in mission-critical situations).

==Procedures==
The process of backporting can be roughly divided into these steps:
# identification of the problem in the older version of the software that needs to be fixed by a backport
# finding out which (usually recent) modification of the code fixed the problem
# adapting the modification to the old code situation (the proper backporting)
# one or several levels of quality control testing whether the backported version maintains previous functionality as well as if it properly implements the new functionality.

Usually, multiple such modifications are bundled in a patch set.

Backports can be provided by the core developer group of the software. Since backporting needs access to the source code of a piece of software, this is the only way that backporting is done for closed source software the backports will usually be incorporated in binary upgrades along the old version line of the software. With open-source software, backports are sometimes created by software distributors and later sent upstream (that is, submitted to the core developers of the afflicted software).

==Examples==

* Many features of Windows Vista were backported to Windows XP when Service Pack 3 was released for Windows XP, thereby facilitating compatibility of applications (mostly games) originally with Vista as a minimum requirement to run on XP SP3 as a minimum requirement instead.
* The Debian Project since September 2010 has provided an official backporting service for some Debian Linux software packages, and Ubuntu Linux also supports backports.
* In 2024, a YouTuber named MattKC backported .NET Framework versions 2.0 and 3.5 to Windows 95, which did not officially support the framework.

<doc id="946574" wikidata="Q4347112" url="?curid=946574" title="Strength athletics">
<text>Strength athletics is the collection of strength sports which measure physical strength, based on both: non-standard and historical implements as seen in Strongman and Highland games, and standardized and calibrated equipment as seen in Powerlifting and Weightlifting.

Some of the disciplines have similarities to each other and although it is very difficult to master more than one, some athletes participate in several of them and perform at world class levels. Weightlifting consists of two main lifts (&quot;snatch&quot; and &quot;clean &amp; jerk&quot;) and powerlifting consists of three main lifts (&quot;squat, bench&quot; and &quot;deadlift&quot;) where all test the maximal strength (one rep max output). Highland games consists of up to about ten different disciplines (including &quot;stone put, Scottish hammer throw, weight throw, weight over bar, caber toss, keg toss&quot; and &quot;sheaf toss&quot;) while strongman span across more than thirty different lifts and events (including &quot;deadlift, vehicle pull, log lift, axle press, stonelifting, stone carrying, circus dumbbell press, yoke carry, farmers walk, squat, basque circle, loading medleys&quot; and &quot;grip events&quot;), testing both maximal strength and physical endurance.

At present day, Strongman takes the bulk of the strength athletics domain, owing to involving both standardized and non standardized tests of strength, as well as for its highly diversified nature. 

==History==
===Origins===

Strength competitions pre-date written history. The first Olympics (running, throwing, jumping) were believed to be held in 776 BCE. There are records in many civilizations of feats of strength performed by great heroes, perhaps mythological, such as Heracles, Goliath, Orm Storolfsson and Milo of Croton.
Competitions that modern strongman events are modeled on, Scottish Highland Gatherings, were formalized around 1820 by Sir Walter Scott. In 1848, Queen Victoria attended the Braemar Highland Games.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, circus strongmen lent sensationalism to their acts such as bending iron bars, breaking iron chains worn around their chests, and lifting heavy objects. Famous strongmen from this era included Thomas Topham, Eugen Sandow, Louis Cyr, Thomas Inch, Arthur Saxon, Angus MacAskill, and Alexander Zass.

In the 20th century, strength sports such as weightlifting and powerlifting were popularized through the Olympic Games. However, feats of strength akin to the circus performances also gained in popularity. David Prowse (who played Darth Vader in &quot;Star Wars&quot;) was initially famous in 1964 for his lifting the famed Dinnie Stones, the first man to do so since Donald Dinnie himself a century earlier.

===Television===
Perhaps the most famous event is the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition, still described by a number of highly respected authorities in the sport as the premier event in strength athletics.

The concept behind &#x27;The World&#x27;s Strongest Men&#x27;, as it was originally named, was developed in 1977 for CBS by Langstar Inc. David Webster, a Scot who later received an OBE for his services to sport, was the head coordinator of the competition from its inception. Dr Douglas Edmunds, seven-times Scottish shot and discus champion and twice world caber champion, worked with Webster. When Webster retired from his position, Edmunds took over. These two men were responsible for inviting the competitors and choosing the events. They selected men who had shown prowess in the mainstream fields of strength sports and field athletics events, such as shot put, American football, powerlifters, bodybuilders and wrestlers. The idea was to create a spectacle that would test competitors against one another.

The show was enough of a success that it began to be replicated in other countries, such as Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man (1979). Competitors began shifting from unpaid amateurs to professional strongmen. By the end of the 20th century, and in to the 21st, other strongman programs and events were created such as Strongman Championship hosted by Errol Silverman. Other competitions have been televised, such as the World Muscle Power Championships, World Strongman Challenge, Arnold Strongman Classic, Giants Live, Highlander World Championships, World Strongman Federation, and Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man.

==Common disciplines==

There is no set rule about what specific events will occur in a contest, except that to prevent single-event specialists from gaining an advantage, each event will be different (a single contest will not include two squat events, or two overhead lifting events, for example). Normally, a strongman contest comprises five or six events, though at the top level of competition, seven or eight events may be held. Among the most common events are:

* &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Walk&quot; – competitors race along a course while carrying a heavy weight in each hand. A variation is the Giant Farmer&#x27;s Walk, with a much heavier weight carried over a shorter distance.
* &quot;Hercules Hold&quot; or &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; – contestants stand between two pillars, pivoted to fall outwards. The competitor must simply hold them up for as long as possible.
* &quot;Vehicle pull&quot; – competitors pull a vehicle from a stationary start for a prescribed distance – fastest over the course wins. Trucks are commonly used, but larger spectacles employ trains, boats, and airplanes.
* &quot;Atlas Stones&quot; – a lifting stone event whereby five spherical concrete stones of increasing weight are placed on top of podia of varying height, beginning with the lightest stone lifted to approximately a normal person&#x27;s head height. Alternatively, the stone is lifted over a bar for reps. 
* &quot;Stone Carry&quot; – in Iceland, the original stone carry was performed with the Húsafell Stone, that was to be carried for a stretch to achieve the title fullsterkur (full-strong). This stone was not round but irregular, increasing the difficulty.
* &quot;Refrigerator Carry&quot; – a staple of earlier WSM events that has made a comeback in recent years. The competitors carry two refrigerators, attached to an iron bar they hold on their shoulders, and walk it across the finish line as fast as they can.
* &quot;Carry and Drag&quot; – an object (usually a heavy anchor) is run across half of the course. The competitors then must attach it to a chain of almost equal weight and pull it across the rest of the course.
* &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Fingers&quot; – under a timer, lift and flip a series of progressively heavier, hinged poles from a horizontal starting position.

<doc id="946578" wikidata="Q7360574" url="?curid=946578" title="Rolando Masferrer">
<text>Rolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojas (12 January 1918 – 31 October 1975), better known simply as Rolando Masferrer, was a Cuban henchman, lawyer, congressman, newspaper publisher and a political activist.

Joining the leftist revoluationary movement as a teenager, he fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Masferrer was elected to the Congress of Cuba for the Republican Party in 1948, and later became a supporter of dictator Fulgencio Batista. Masferrer created a guerrilla known as &quot;Tigres de Masferrer&quot;, which was intended to fight against M-26-7. He fled to the U.S. when Fidel Castro took power in Cuba. From there he plotted assassination and invasion attempts against Castro, all of which failed.

He was killed by a car bomb, in Miami in 1975, aged 57.

==Family==
Masferrer was born on 12 July 1918, in Holguín, former Oriente Province, Cuba. He married Lucila Montero and they had two children: Alejandro (Alex) and Liudmila. Rolando had two brothers: Rodolfo and Raimundo. All emigrated to the U.S. with Rolando on 1 January 1959.

==Cuba 1930s==
Masferrer was a member of the leftist revolutionary Joven Cuba organization as a teenager. He participated in a murder plot against Colonel Jose Eleuterio Pedraza, head of Cuban National Police in 1936, and he was arrested. He was a member of Cuba&#x27;s Communist Party (Popular Socialist Party) from 1935, but was expelled in 1945, and later became anti-communist. He was assistant editor of Hoy (Today), the Cuban communist daily between 1939-45. Later he published a socialist weekly called Tiempo en Cuba (Time in Cuba).

==Spanish Civil War==
He formed part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War in 1937. He was wounded in the left foot in Spain, and in Europe is said to have been an for the International Brigades, much feared for the thumping of his wounded gait when he approached his victim. He was lame for the rest of his life.

==1940s Cuba==
He graduated as a lawyer from the University of Havana with honors (Dolz Award) in 1945. Masferrer participated, with Fidel Castro and over 1,000 Cubans, in the aborted Cayo Confites expedition of 1947, which sought to overthrow Rafael Trujillo, the authoritarian leader of the Dominican Republic. He was a rival of Castro in the bloody feuds of the trigger happy action groups in Havana and subject of one failed attempt by Castro and others to kill to him in 1948. Masferrer was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives for the Republican Party in 1948. He was fluent in English, and appointed as an English teacher at Marianao High School in 1946. He was founder and leader of the Movimiento Socialista Revolucionario (MSR), that became a gang.

==1950s Cuba==
Masferrer was a staunch supporter of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista after the latter seized power in 1952. He was a Senator for the Partido Auténtico from 1954 to 1958 in the Batista government and the leading founder of Los Tigres de Masferrer, a paramilitary organization set up to protect Batista from guerrilla groups and support Batista militarily. In this period he published two papers Tiempo in Havana and Libertad in Santiago de Cuba which insulted Francisco Franco, but without positive reaction among other leftwing Spanish Civil War exiles.

During the final years of the last Batista regime to the end of 1958, Masferrer and his Tigres operated in Oriente province; from headquarters in Victoria de las Tunas, or others claim from Santiago, Manzanillo and Bayamo He had an array of weapons including lethal large caliber &quot;air rifles.&quot; His followers penetrated the Sierra Maestra with silence, terrifying local Escopeteros, who without time to react or appropriate weapons, fled before his forces; then the &quot;tigres&quot; fled. In this fashion the Tigres raided and killed in the foothills of the Sierra Maestra. He is known to have threatened Franciscan priests in Manzanillo, Cuba The Cuban government of Fidel Castro accused Masferrer of 2,000 killings - disputed by some - and said the Tigres were careful to remove all evidence.

Masferrer plotted to buy &quot;La Hacienda Sevilla&quot; and divide up the land so as to reward the local guajiros for informing on Fidel Castro in the first months of his operations in the Sierra Maestra. This connection may or may not explain the attempted betrayal of Castro by Agrarian Organizer Eutimio Guerra.

Despite the fact that Masferrer had been a Communist supporter, after Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba on 1 January 1959, Masferrer had to abandon the island. He fled on his yacht Ola Kun II, a former U.S. Coast Guard vessel with his family and over twenty followers on 1 January 1959, arriving in Key West, Florida. He received asylum in the U.S. and settled in Miami. Castro accused to Masferrer of stealing U.S. $17 million (disputed), and requested to the U.S. government the extradition of Rolando, back to Cuba. Castro&#x27;s request was denied.

==U.S. 1960s and 1970s==
In the United States, he befriended Mafia bosses such as Santo Trafficante, as well as union leader Jimmy Hoffa. He established the 30th of November organization, with the purpose of killing Castro. Masferrer was known for mistreating Cubans residing in Florida, extorting money from them for what he said would be &quot;to help Cuba&quot;.

On September 26, 1960, Masferrer sent an expedition of four boats to Cuba. One boat reached the island, three Americans: Allan D. Thompson, Anthony Zarba and Robert O. Fuller were caught and eventually executed In December, 1960, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, reported that Masferrer was leading a group of 53 people, undertaking training for assassination at a ranch owned by multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. In the early 1960s, Masferrer was associated with &quot;El Tiempo&quot;, a Spanish-language newspaper, edited by S. Ross, in New York City. In 1961, Masferrer met with President John F. Kennedy, to discuss Castro and the situation in Cuba. But Kennedy disliked Masferrer&#x27;s radical and fanatical personality, and the two did not have any publicly known conversation after that.

In 1967, Masferrer plotted and accumulated weapons to invade Haiti so as to have a base, free of U.S. law, to attack the Castro government which had foiled direct attempts to land (Project Nassau or Operation Istanbul). Masferrer was imprisoned 2 years for this in the U.S. (1970–72). He owned a security agency in Miami, and published the weekly Libertad (Freedom). The Castro government had sentenced him to the death penalty in 1959. Masferrer was killed by a car bomb (specifically dynamite) on 31 October 1975.

<doc id="946584" wikidata="Q656316" url="?curid=946584" title="Coordination game">
<text>A coordination game is a type of simultaneous game found in game theory. It describes the situation where a player will earn a higher payoff when they select the same course of action as another player. The game is not one of pure conflict, which results in multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria in which players choose matching strategies. Figure 1 shows a 2-player example. 

Both (Up, Left) and (Down, Right) are Nash equilibria. If the players expect (Up, Left) to be played, then player 1 thinks their payoff would fall from 2 to 1 if they deviated to Down, and player 2 thinks their payoff would fall from 4 to 3 if they chose Right. If the players expect (Down, Right), player 1 thinks their payoff would fall from 2 to 1 if they deviated to Up, and player 2 thinks their payoff would fall from 4 to 3 if they chose Left. A player&#x27;s optimal move depends on what they expect the other player to do, and they both do better if they coordinate than if they played an off-equilibrium combination of actions. This setup can be extended to more than two strategies or two players.

== Examples ==

A typical case for a coordination game is choosing the sides of the road upon which to drive, a social standard which can save lives if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 8, and a collision by a payoff of 0. In this case there are two pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the right. In this example, it doesn&#x27;t matter &quot;which&quot; side both players pick, as long as they both pick the same. Both solutions are Pareto efficient. This game is called a &quot;pure coordination game&quot;. This is not true for all coordination games, as the &quot;assurance game&quot; in Fig. 3 shows. 

An assurance game describes the situation where neither player can offer a sufficient amount if they contribute alone, thus player 1 should defect from playing if player 2 defects. However, if Player 2 opts to contribute then player 1 should contribute also. An assurance game is commonly referred to as a “stag hunt” (Fig.5), which represents the following scenario. Two hunters can choose to either hunt a stag together (which provides the most economically efficient outcome) or they can individually hunt a Rabbit. Hunting Stags is challenging and requires cooperation. If the two hunters do not cooperate the chances of success is minimal. Thus, the scenario where both hunters choose to coordinate will provide the most beneficial output for society. A common problem associated with the stag hunt is the amount of trust required to achieve this output. Fig. 5 shows a situation in which both players (hunters) can benefit if they cooperate (hunting a stag). As you can see, cooperation might fail, because each hunter has an alternative which is safer because it does not require cooperation to succeed (hunting a hare). This example of the potential conflict between safety and social cooperation is originally due to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

This is different in another type of coordination game commonly called battle of the sexes (or conflicting interest coordination), as seen in Fig. 4. In this game both players prefer engaging in the same activity over going alone, but their preferences differ over which activity they should engage in. Assume that a couple argues over what to do on the weekend. Both know that they will increase their utility by spending the weekend together, however the man prefers to watch a football game and the woman prefers to go shopping.

Since the couple want to spend time together, they will derive no utility by doing an activity separately. If they go shopping, or to football game one person will derive some utility by being with the other person, but won’t derive utility from the activity itself. Unlike the other forms of coordination games described previously, knowing your opponent’s strategy won’t help you decide on your course of action. Due to this there is a possibility that an equilibrium will not be reached. 

=== Voluntary standards ===

In social sciences, a voluntary standard (when characterized also as &quot;de facto&quot; standard) is a typical solution to a coordination problem. The choice of a voluntary standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an obligation standard (enforced by law as &quot;&quot;de jure&quot; standard&quot;) is a solution to the prisoner&#x27;s problem.

== Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium ==

Coordination games also have mixed strategy Nash equilibria. In the generic coordination game above, a mixed Nash equilibrium is given by probabilities p = (d-b)/(a+d-b-c) to play Up and 1-p to play Down for player 1, and q = (D-C)/(A+D-B-C) to play Left and 1-q to play Right for player 2. Since d &gt; b and d-b &lt; a+d-b-c, p is always between zero and one, so existence is assured (similarly for q).


In the generic coordination game in Fig. 6, a mixed Nash equilibrium is given by the probabilities:

p = (d-b)/(a+d-b-c),

to play Option A and 1-p to play Option B for player 1, and

q = (D-C)/(A+D-B-C),

to play A and 1-q to play B for player 2. If we look at Fig 1. and apply the same probability equations we obtain the following results:

p = (4-3) / (4+4-3-3) = ½ and,

q = (2-1) / (2+2-1-1) = ½ 

The reaction correspondences for 2×2 coordination games are shown in Fig. 7.
The pure Nash equilibria are the points in the bottom left and top right corners of the strategy space, while the mixed Nash equilibrium lies in the middle, at the intersection of the dashed lines.

Unlike the pure Nash equilibria, the mixed equilibrium is not an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). The mixed Nash equilibrium is also Pareto dominated by the two pure Nash equilibria (since the players will fail to coordinate with non-zero probability), a quandary that led Robert Aumann to propose the refinement of a correlated equilibrium.

== Coordination and equilibrium selection ==

Games like the driving example above have illustrated the need for solution to coordination problems. Often we are confronted with circumstances where we must solve coordination problems without the ability to communicate with our partner. Many authors have suggested that particular equilibria are focal for one reason or another. For instance, some equilibria may give higher payoffs, be naturally more salient, , or may be safer. Sometimes these refinements conflict, which makes certain coordination games especially complicated and interesting (e.g. the Stag hunt, in which {Stag,Stag} has higher payoffs, but {Hare,Hare} is safer).

==Experimental results==

Coordination games have been studied in laboratory experiments. One such experiment by Bortolotti, Devetag, and Andreas Ortmann was a weak-link experiment in which groups of individuals were asked to count and sort coins in an effort to measure the difference between individual and group incentives. Players in this experiment received a payoff based on their individual performance as well as a bonus that was weighted by the number of errors accumulated by their worst performing team member. Players also had the option to purchase more time, the cost of doing so was subtracted from their payoff. While groups initially failed to coordinate, researchers observed about 80% of the groups in the experiment coordinated successfully when the game was repeated.

When academics talk about coordination failure, most cases are that subjects achieve risk dominance rather than payoff dominance. Even when payoffs are better when players coordinate on one equilibrium, many times people will choose the less risky option where they are guaranteed some payoff and end up at an equilibrium that has sub-optimal payoff. Players are more likely to fail to coordinate on a riskier option when the difference between taking the risk or the safe option is smaller. The laboratory results suggest that coordination failure is a common phenomenon in the setting of order-statistic games and stag-hunt games.

== Other games with externalities ==

Coordination games are closely linked to the economic concept of externalities, and in particular positive network externalities, the benefit reaped from being in the same network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under negative externalities where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game is the game of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using the payoff matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if B &gt; A and C &gt; D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b &gt; d and c &gt; a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that A &gt; C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2&#x27;s payoff but reduces player 1&#x27;s payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.

The concept of anti-coordination games has been extended to multi-player situation. A crowding game is defined as a game where each player&#x27;s payoff is non-increasing over the number of other players choosing the same strategy (i.e., a game with negative network externalities). For instance, a driver could take U.S. Route 101 or Interstate 280 from San Francisco to San Jose. While 101 is shorter, 280 is considered more scenic, so drivers might have different preferences between the two independent of the traffic flow. But each additional car on either route will slightly increase the drive time on that route, so additional traffic creates negative network externalities, and even scenery-minded drivers might opt to take 101 if 280 becomes too crowded. A congestion game is a crowding game in networks. The minority game is a game where the only objective for all players is to be part of smaller of two groups. A well-known example of the minority game is the El Farol Bar problem proposed by W. Brian Arthur.

A hybrid form of coordination and anti-coordination is the discoordination game, where one player&#x27;s incentive is to coordinate while the other player tries to avoid this. Discoordination games have no pure Nash equilibria. In Figure 1, choosing payoffs so that A &gt; B, C &lt; D, while a &lt; b, c &gt; d, creates a discoordination game. In each of the four possible states either player 1 or player 2 are better off by switching their strategy, so the only Nash equilibrium is mixed. The canonical example of a discoordination game is the matching pennies game.

<text>Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, known in America as Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception, is a teen fantasy novel published in 2005, the 4th book in the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series by the Irish author Eoin Colfer. Preceded by &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot; and followed by &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony&quot;, it is centred on the brilliant pixie Opal Koboi&#x27;s second try at rebellion (after her first attempt was a failure) and Artemis Fowl II and his fairy comrades&#x27; efforts to stop her. Critical reception was mixed, with some reviews praising the book and others deeming its writing poor and confusing.

==Plot==
The pixie Opal Koboi is believed to be in a coma inside an asylum, but is actually faking it to avoid incarceration by the Lower Elements Police after her failed rebellion and attempt of world domination in &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot;. To ensure she is secure in her cell, the LEP has her under 24-hour surveillance, has DNA tests done every 4 hours, plants a tracker and tranquilizer known as a seeker-sleeper in her arm, and keeps her in a net trapped with monitoring pads. Koboi manages to escape regardless with help from the pixie Brill Brothers, filling the cell and fooling the security with a brain dead clone otherwise identical to herself.

Koboi lures Commander Julius Root and Captain Holly Short of the LEP into a lava chute alone. She then kills Commander Root with an explosive attached to his body. The explosive is invisible on camera and she tricks Holly into shooting it in an attempt to defuse it, framing Holly as the murderer. She then launches a bio-bomb at Artemis Fowl, which he narrowly escapes thanks to the quick work of his bodyguard Domovoi Butler.

Artemis Fowl, teenage criminal mastermind, has no memory of fairy society due to being mindwiped in the previous book in the series, &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot;. This has caused his personality and conscience to revert to that of an amoral villain, and with the help of Butler he conducts a clever heist to steal the famed painting &quot;The Fairy Thief&quot; directly before being attacked.

Holly, now a fugitive, rescues Artemis from the scene of the bio-bomb attack. She tells him who she is, but he does not regain his memories as she had hoped. After he agrees to help her for a fee, the two are recaptured by Koboi and thrown into an abandoned, troll-infested fairy theme park known as the &quot;Eleven Wonders of the Human World&quot; (containing scale-models not only of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World but also the additions of Abu Simbel, Borobodur, Rapa Nui and the Throne Hall at Persepolis). After a desperate battle against the troll hordes on a model of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, they are rescued by former criminal Mulch Diggums and Butler. Holly and Artemis become friends &quot;bonded by trauma&quot;, and Artemis rescinds his requirement of a fee.

After being rescued, Mulch gives Artemis a disk of his memories that Artemis had previously prepared and disguised as a gold medallion. Artemis is overcome with guilt for what he had done to the fairies, and for the first time apologizes to Holly for kidnapping her. Now markedly more emotional and friendly with Holly, Butler, and Mulch, Artemis prepares to take on Koboi. The four are the only ones who know she is free, and the LEP are on their tail in pursuit of Holly.

Koboi plans to expose fairy society to humanity, ideally causing an interspecies war and fairy genocide. She uses the fairy &quot;mesmer&quot; to convince Italian billionaire environmentalist Giovanni Zito that she is his pampered adopted daughter Belinda, as well as to convince him to send a probe downwards in millions of tons of molten iron. The group outpaces the probe with a fairy craft ill-fitted for intense life or death scenarios, and manage to divert its path. Koboi crashes into a woman&#x27;s vine field. She attempts the Belinda trick again, but runs out of magic exactly before she is able to &quot;mesmerize&quot; the woman into pampering her, trapping her in a life of manual labor which she abhors.

A week later Koboi is detained by the LEP, and Holly is cleared of all charges over Commander Root&#x27;s murder. However, disillusioned, she resigns and starts a private investigation firm with Mulch Diggums. Artemis anonymously donates &quot;The Fairy Thief&quot; to the Louvre.

==The Tongue==
There is a secret code at the bottom of the book, containing a message from Foaly. This is translatable if one has the Gnommish alphabet, available in &quot;The Artemis Fowl Files&quot; by Eoin Colfer, or the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; website.

The message on the cover of the US publication, barely decipherable, reads &quot;Opal wants revenge&quot;, it is faintly repeated several times on the sides of the tube.

The Gnommish symbols around the molecules on the front cover read &quot;DNA never lies&quot;.
==Critical reception==
The book received generally mixed reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that the characters were &quot;still a blast&quot;, however, the review also said &quot;Colfer seems too dazzled by all the gadgetry and explosives jammed into this tale.&quot; Disney&#x27;s &quot;Family.com&quot; called the book &quot;pretty confusing&quot;, though said it still retained the strengths of the series as a whole. The &quot;School Library Journal&quot; wrote that &quot;the prose is clunky&quot;, however, it continued to say that the &quot;creativity carry the narrative through the tight spots and impossible situations.&quot;

<doc id="946609" wikidata="Q1533624" url="?curid=946609" title="God object">
<text>In object-oriented programming, a god object (sometimes also called an omniscient or all-knowing object) is an object that references a large number of distinct types, has too many unrelated or uncategorized methods, or some combination of both. The god object is an example of an anti-pattern and a code smell.

== Characteristics ==

A common programming technique is to separate a large problem into several smaller problems (a divide and conquer strategy) and create solutions for each of them. Once the smaller problems are solved, the big problem as a whole has been solved. Therefore a given object for a small problem only needs to know about itself. Likewise, there is only one set of problems an object needs to solve: its &quot;own&quot; problems. This also follows the single-responsibility principle.

In contrast, a program that employs a god object does not follow this approach. Most of such a program&#x27;s overall functionality is coded into a single &quot;all-knowing&quot; object, which maintains most of the information about the entire program, and also provides most of the methods for manipulating this data. Because this object holds so much data and requires so many methods, its role in the program becomes god-like (all-knowing and all-encompassing). Instead of program objects communicating among themselves directly, the other objects within the program rely on the single god object for most of their information and interaction. Since this object is tightly coupled to (referenced by) so much of the other code, maintenance becomes more difficult than it would be in a more evenly divided programming design. Changes made to the object for the benefit of one routine can have a ripple effect on other unrelated functions.

A god object is the object-oriented analogue of failing to use subroutines in procedural programming languages, or of using far too many global variables to store state information.

Whereas creating a god object is typically considered bad programming practice, this technique is occasionally used for tight programming environments (such as microcontrollers), where the performance increase and centralization of control are more important than maintainability and programming elegance.

<text>Data Center Markup Language (DCML) is an XML-based markup language which provides a means for describing data center environments such as dependencies between data center components and managerial policies governing those environments with an open, vendor-neutral language.

DCML can be used to, for example, link a server provisioning system with a server monitoring system so that when a new server is provisioned, it is also automatically monitored. The DCML document transmitted to the monitoring system in this instance would include information about the machine&#x27;s IP address and any special ports and services running on the machine that are to be monitored. The DCML document would also contain information about what application the server belongs to and whom to contact, as well as how to contact them, when it goes down. This information is imported into the system that is available to NOC personnel for consultation when an alert occurs.

DCML is being developed by the Data Center Markup Language Interest Group in conjunction with OASIS. In 2004 it was still in its early stages of development in draft form.

<doc id="946619" wikidata="Q2933810" url="?curid=946619" title="Visual pun">
<text>A visual pun is a pun involving an image or images (in addition to or instead of language), often based on a rebus.

Visual puns in which the image is at odds with the inscription are common in cartoons such as &quot;Lost Consonants&quot; or &quot;The Far Side&quot; as well as in Dutch gable stones. For instance, a gable stone in the village of Batenburg puns on the words (‘to profit’) and (‘castle’) by depicting silver coins becoming gold in a castle.

European heraldry contains the technique of canting arms, which can be considered punning.

== In heraldry ==

Visual puns on the bearer&#x27;s name are used extensively as forms of heraldic expression. These are called canting arms. They have been used for centuries across Europe and have also been used recently by members of the British royal family, such as on the arms of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and of Princess Beatrice of York. The arms of US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower are also canting.

==In visual arts==
Surrealist artists such as Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, Marcel Duchamp, and Remedios Varo made extensive use of visual puns, as they played with shifting perceptions and reality. Graphic artists (such as Maurits Cornelis Escher and Noma Bar) and photographers (such as Man Ray and Dora Maar) have used visual puns for a surreal or humorous effect, or to catch the attention of a viewer. Some types of optical illusions also operate within the liminal zones of perception.

<text>The Leeds Inner Ring Road is part-motorway and part-A roads in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, which forms a ring road around the city centre. 

It has six different road numbers that are all sections of longer roads. Clockwise, the roads are the A58(M), a motorway section of the A58 road; the A64(M), part of the A64 road; the A61 between York Road and the M621; the M621 between junctions 4 and 2; and the A643 between the M621 and A58. The motorway section is in total is long and is subject to a speed limit throughout.

==Route==
The motorway section of the ring road forms a semicircle around the north of the city centre. It is classified as a motorway to prohibit certain types of traffic and pedestrians but is not designed to modern motorway standards: it has no hard shoulders and many exits are unsuitable for a true motorway, including a right-side (fast lane) slip road exit. Most of it runs in a concrete-walled cutting, but it goes into a tunnel under the Leeds General Infirmary. The motorway cuts through inner-city neighbourhoods such as Woodhouse, Sheepscar, and Buslingthorpe, forming an important link in the road network by allowing traffic from the A65, A660, A58, A61 and A64 to bypass the city centre.

==History==
Leeds suffered severe traffic congestion as it was on the main route joining Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford and Hull. In 1955 it was decided to build a dual carriageway to remove through traffic. In the final stages before construction began the road was redesignated as a motorway in 1963, without any changes to the design. Construction began with the demolition of 365 homes and 174 other structures.

The motorway was built around the city centre in three stages in the 1960s and 1970s. Stage 1 opened was the route from the exit for the town hall to the A58 exit, stage 2 was the A64(M) section and stage 3 linked the road to the A58. Stages 4 to 6 featured upgrades to the A61 constructed in the 1990s to non-motorway standards featuring traffic light controlled intersections and non-grade separated junctions. When the motorway finally opened, Leeds used the motto &quot;Motorway city of the 70s&quot;.

The final stage of the inner ring road (stage 7) began construction in 2006 and opened in late 2008. Featuring a large elevated viaduct, it links the M621 at junction 4 with the previously-constructed traffic light controlled interchange at Cross Green, Leeds is of a similar standard to stages 4–6.

The remainder of the Inner Ring Road is formed by using the M621 between junctions 2 and 4 and the A643 between Elland Road and the Armley Gyratory. It is not currently signposted as a complete route on the ground other than on the motorway section to the north of the city centre.

<text>The Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall, Bradwell-on-Sea, is a Christian church dating from the years 660–662 and among the oldest largely intact churches in England. It is in regular use by the nearby Othona Community, in addition to Church of England services. It is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
According to Bede (who wrote his history in the early 8th century), a &#x27;city&#x27; named &quot;Ythanceaster&quot; existed on the River &quot;Penta&quot;. The Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall was almost certainly originally built by Bishop Cedd in 654. It was an Anglo-Celtic church for the East Saxons, set astride the ruins of the abandoned Roman fort of Othona. The current structure was most likely built around 654–662, incorporating the Roman bricks and stones. In 653, Cedd travelled south from Lindisfarne to spread Christianity at the behest of Sigeberht the Good, then King of the East Saxons, and, having been ordained as a bishop, returned the next year in order to build the chapel, and probably others, too. Following the death of Cedd in October 664 from plague, the chapel became part of the Diocese of London. No further record exists of the chapel being used until 1442, when the local clergy reported to the Bishop of London that it had been expanded slightly, with a small tower above the porch with a bell in it. However they did not know of its origins and it was unusable, having been burnt. It was repaired and returned to regular use alongside the parish church in Bradwell-on-Sea until at least the Tudor period (16th century) before falling into disuse as a church again and being used as a barn—the position of the wide barn doorway, now filled in, can be seen on the south side of the nave.
In 1920, it was restored and reconsecrated as a chapel. It was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959.

In May 2023, a book entitled &quot;St Peter-on-the Wall Landscape and Heritage on the Essex Coast&quot; was published. It reflected concerns over the planned Bradwell B nuclear power station, which it was feared would damage the local environment and the setting of the Chapel.

==Current use==
The chapel belongs to Chelmsford Cathedral and is looked after by the Chaplain, the Revd Steven Poss, Rector of the parish church of St Thomas Bradwell-on-Sea, and members of the church. Regular public services are held in the chapel each week with a Thursday morning Communion service at 9am. Special services are held at Christmas and Easter. In the summer evening services are held each Sunday in July and August at 6:30pm.

The chapel and adjacent field are the destination of the Bradwell Pilgrimage, held annually on the first Saturday in July. The procession starts at the Parish Church of St Thomas and the pilgrims walk approximately two miles to the Chapel, where services and events are held.

The chapel is also used by the nearby Othona Community. Founded in 1946 by Norman Motley, rector of St Michael, Cornhill, 1956–1980, this Christian-based community is open to people of all faiths and none.

In 2018, the chapel was the location for two music videos by the boys&#x27; choir Libera.

The chapel is the end point of St Peter&#x27;s Way, a footpath starting at Chipping Ongar.

<text>ALGOL N (&quot;N&quot; for &quot;Nippon&quot; – Japan in Japanese) is the name of a successor programming language to ALGOL 60, designed in Japan with the goal of being as simple as ALGOL 60 but as powerful as ALGOL 68. The language was proposed by Nobuo Yoneda. ALGOL N tried to use extensibility to solve the problem that language designers faced when trying to make an inextensible language for all domains, or having to make many domain-specific languages (DSLs), one for each domain. It avoided type conversion (coercion) while not making things more difficult for programmers.

<doc id="946657" wikidata="Q1166056" url="?curid=946657" title="Go-Ahead Group">
<text>Go-Ahead Group Limited is a multi-national transport group based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. While the majority of its operations are within Great Britain, it also operates services in Ireland, Australia, Singapore, and Norway. Go-Ahead was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to being purchased by Kinetic Group and Globalvia by 2022.

The Go-Ahead Group was originally founded in February 1987 as &quot;Go-Ahead Northern Limited&quot; as part of the wider privatisation of the National Bus Company. Early expansion centred around the acquisition of several smaller competing bus operators in North East England and operating as a subcontractor to National Express; during the early 1990s, the Brighton &amp; Hove, Oxford Bus Company, and London Central were all acquired. During May 1994, Go-Ahead was floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In October 1996, Go-Ahead entered the UK railway sector via the operation of the Thames Trains franchise. Via the Govia joint venture, it bid for additional rail franchises in Britain, securing the Thameslink and later the Southeastern and London Midland operations. During mid 2000, the French state-owned enterprise Caisse des Dépts-Développement (C3D) attempted a hostile takeover of Go-Ahead, which was successfully opposed by its management team.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Go-Ahead diversified into ground handling services at various British airports via the acquisition of Gatwick Handling International, British Midland, and Reed Aviation. During 2010, Go-Ahead disposed of its airport-based operations, the majority being sold to Dnata UK and Servisair. During the early 2010s, Go-Ahead acquired numerous other British transport companies, including Thames Travel, Carousel Buses, Hedingham, Anglian Bus, and HC Chambers &amp; Son. During late 2015, it was contracted to operate bus and rail services in Germany and Singapore; in subsequent years, Go-Ahead also expanded into Ireland and Norway. On 28 September 2021, Britain&#x27;s Department for Transport terminated Go-Ahead&#x27;s Southeastern franchise after the discovery of financial misconduct. During August 2022, a consortium of Australia&#x27;s Kinetic Group (51%) and Spain&#x27;s Globalvia (49%) took over Go-Ahead, having valued the company at £669 million. During January 2023, it was announced that Go-Ahead was expanding into the Australian market via the U-Go Mobility joint venture with the engineering company UGL.

==History==
===Incorporation===

The Go-Ahead Group was originally founded as &quot;Go-Ahead Northern Limited&quot; on 17 February 1987 as a consequence of the privatisation of the National Bus Company, during which a partial management buyout led by Martin Ballinger and Chris Moyes purchased its Gateshead-based northern division, known as the Northern General Transport Company. Early expansion of the company involved the acquisition of several smaller competing bus operators in North East England, such as &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Low Fell Coaches&quot; in June 1992. Go-Ahead Northern also became a subcontractor to National Express, operating services to the Midlands, North East, North West and South West England. Around the same time, Go-Ahead Leisure purchased a number of pubs, which were sold on during February 1996.

Despite bidding for a number of other larger bus operators in the intervening period, Go-Ahead&#x27;s first major acquisition was Brighton &amp; Hove in November 1993, followed by the Oxford Bus Company and Wycombe Bus Company in March 1994. In May 1997, the Brighton &amp; Hove operation expanded with the acquisition of the former municipal operator Brighton Transport. During September 1999, Metrobus, a large operator operating in London, Surrey and Sussex was acquired.

====Flotation and into London====
Initially, Go-Ahead was structured as an unlisted public company and was owned 90 percent by its management. In May 1994, it was floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In October 1994, Go-Ahead purchased London Central during the privatisation of London Buses. In March 1995, OK Motor Services was purchased and integrated into the Go North East operation. In June 1996, a second London bus operation, London General, was acquired from the management team that had purchased it when privatised.

==== Airport services====
In October 1998, Go-Ahead diversified with the acquisition of Gatwick Handling International, a provider of ground handling services at UK airports. Go-Ahead acquired the ground handling operations of British Midland and Midland Airport Services in March 2001, followed by Reed Aviation in August 2001. All these operations, including at Gatwick, all were rebranded as Aviance.

In May 2002, Go-Ahead diversified again, acquiring airport-focused &quot;Meteor Parking&quot;. Included in the purchase of Gatwick Handling International in 1998 was a 50% shareholding in Plane Handling, and in August 2004 Go-Ahead purchased the remaining 50% from Virgin Aviation. In December 2006 Gatwick Airport parking operator PAS was purchased and integrated into Meteor Parking, followed by security provider Nikaro in February 2007.

In January 2010, Go-Ahead disposed of most of its airport-based operations via a sale to Dnata UK and Servisair. In September 2010, Meteor Parking was sold to Vinci SA, bringing Go-Ahead&#x27;s involvement in the aviation support industry to a close.

=== 1996 – 2010 ===

==== Entering the railway sector ====
In October 1996, Go-Ahead entered the UK rail market when it commenced operating the Thames Trains franchise, which it ran until March 2004. The franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Victory Rail Holdings; Go-Ahead owned 65% of the shares in Victory Rail Holdings with the remaining 35% held by some ex British Rail managers and employees. Go-Ahead bought the remaining shares it did not own in June 1998.

Also in 1996, Go-Ahead entered into the Govia joint venture with French company VIA-GTI (which later became Keolis), in order to bid for more UK rail franchises. Govia was 65% owned by Go-Ahead. Govia was awarded the Thameslink franchise, which it ran from March 1997 until March 2006.

During August 2001, Govia started running the South Central rail franchise. In October 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority awarded Govia the South Central rail franchise with operations due to commence in May 2003 when the Connex South Central franchise expired. Govia negotiated a deal with Connex to buy out the remainder of its franchise.

====Failed takeover and operations in Sweden====
During July 2000, French government owned Caisse des Dépts-Développement (C3D) submitted a bid to purchase Go-Ahead; this offer, which was valued at £326 million, was promptly rejected by the company. A hostile takeover bid was issued by C3D one month later; it was declared to be &quot;unwelcome&quot; by Go-Ahead chairman Sir Frederick Holliday. Go-Ahead pledged to fight for its independence and promoted its expansion plans to shareholders to persuade them to back the existing management team. C3D sought to integrate Go-Ahead with its Transdev S.A. bus and light rail operator. In October 2000, C3D&#x27;s takeover effort came to nought.

For a short time, Go-Ahead entered into two joint ventures with VIA-GTI and BK Tåg to operate rail services in Sweden. Go-Ahead had a 39% stake in City Pendeln AB which was to operate the Citypendeln commuter rail business in Stockholm. Go-Ahead also had a 29% stake in Sydvasten AB which operated rail services between Gothenburg and Malmö. Go-Ahead decided to exit from both ventures in May 2000.

Wycombe Bus Company was sold to Arriva in December 2000.

==== Expansion into the Midlands and the South ====
In August 2003, the Wilts &amp; Dorset bus business was purchased. In June 2005 Solent Blue Line and Southern Vectis were purchased. In September 2005, the Lewes and Seaford operations of Stagecoach South were acquired and integrated into the Brighton &amp; Hove business.

During December 2005, Go-Ahead purchased The Birmingham Coach Company, which operated express coaches under contract for National Express and local bus services in the West Midlands under the Diamond Bus name. Go-Ahead had been known for some time to be keen to begin operating in the area. In February 2006, another operator in the West Midlands, Probus Management, trading as People&#x27;s Express, was purchased.

In August 2006, the Birmingham Coach Company (trading as Diamond Bus) and Probus operations were regrouped under the Go West Midlands Limited legal entity, with the bus operations branded as Diamond in the West Midlands. In February 2006, the Hants &amp; Dorset Trim bus refurbishment business was purchased. In April 2006, the Govia joint venture commenced operating the South Eastern franchise as Southeastern.

During September 2006, Docklands Buses was acquired and integrated into Go-Ahead London, followed in October 2006 by Marchwood Motorways which was integrated into Go South Coast.

In June 2007, Blue Triangle was acquired and integrated into Go-Ahead London. In September 2007, Northumbria Coaches was purchased and integrated into Go North East, followed by Stanley Buses (the bus service subsidiary of Stanley Taxis) in October 2007, and Redby Buses in January 2008. In November 2007, Govia began operating the London Midland rail franchise. In December 2007, the Orpington services of First London were acquired.

In February 2008, Go-Ahead sold Go West Midlands to Rotala&#x27;s Central Connect, two years after purchasing the company. In June 2008, the Gatwick Express rail service was incorporated into Southern. In October 2009, East Thames Buses was acquired and integrated into Go-Ahead London as well as the Horsham operations of Arriva Southern Counties that were integrated into Metrobus. In December 2009, Plymouth Citybus was purchased from Plymouth City Council. In March 2010, Konectbus in Norfolk was purchased as well as the Hexham operations of Arriva North East and integrated into Go North East.

====American operations====
In August 2010, Go-Ahead America, a joint venture with Cook Illinois in which Go-Ahead held a 50% stake, commenced operating a yellow school bus contract in St Louis, Missouri. In July 2014, Go-Ahead exited the United States following the loss of its yellow bus contract.

=== Since 2011 ===
====Acquisitions====

In May 2011, Go-Ahead acquired Thames Travel in South Oxfordshire. Acquisitions in 2012 were Carousel Buses (March) integrated into Oxford Bus Company, Essex-based Hedingham (March), the Northumberland Park-based operations of First London (March), Anglian Bus (April) in Norfolk and Suffolk, and HC Chambers &amp; Son, Suffolk (June) (immediately operationally merged with Hedingham).

In March 2012, the Department for Transport announced that Go-Ahead, along with Abellio, FirstGroup, MTR, and Stagecoach, had been shortlisted for the newly created Thameslink, Southern &amp; Great Northern franchise. During May 2014, Govia was awarded the new franchise. This franchise is unusual as a management contract where fare income does not go to GTR, which is simply paid a fee for operating the service, so GTR carries less revenue risk. This form of franchise was chosen because of long-term engineering works anticipated around London, which would be a significant challenge to organise within the normal form of franchise.

====Expansion into Europe and Singapore====

During November 2015, Go-Ahead Singapore was awarded a contract to operate 25 bus services in Singapore previously operated by SBS Transit out of Loyang Bus Depot, which commenced on 4 September 2016. In the same month, Go-Ahead Germany were awarded two rail contracts in Stuttgart, Germany. The contracts commenced in 20192020.

In August 2017, Go-Ahead won a tender to run 24 routes in Ireland previously operated by Dublin Bus. Go-Ahead Ireland commenced the contract with the National Transport Authority to operate these routes on 9 September 2018. In June 2018, East Yorkshire Motor Services was purchased with over 300 buses. In January 2019, Go-Ahead Ireland commenced operating a further six routes between Dublin and its outlying commuter towns, previously operated by Bus Éireann. By 2022, the National Transport Authority indicated that it was not satisfied with Go-Ahead&#x27;s performance, but extended the contract to October 2024 on the basis that it would be too disruptive to bus services to re-tender the contract. Go-Ahead has been penalised by the National Transport Authority for failing to meet minimum performance standards in 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.

During October 2018, Go-Ahead won a tender to run the Oslo south package, consisting of three routes previously operated by NSB. Go-Ahead Nordic commenced the contract with the Norwegian Railway Directorate to operate these routes in December 2019.

====Manchester and Cornwall====
In February 2019, Go-Ahead announced it would buy First Greater Manchester&#x27;s Cheetham Hill depot with 163 buses and brand it Go North West.

During March 2020, Go Cornwall Bus partnered with Cornwall Council and local operators to form a new Transport for Cornwall brand, with plans calling for an additional 130 vehicles.

====Termination of Southeastern rail franchise ====
On 28 September 2021, the Department for Transport announced it would terminate the Southeastern franchise the following month after the discovery of financial misconduct. Southeastern had not declared over £25million that should have been repaid to the government in the period since 2014. Go-Ahead&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer resigned over this matter.

On 9 December 2021, the company announced that its auditors needed more time to consider the implications of the misconduct and potential fines from the Department for Transport (DfT). Consequently, the annual results would not be ready at the end of the company&#x27;s financial year on 2 January 2022, which would oblige the company to request suspension of trading in its shares. The share price fell by about 15% on the day of the announcement.

On 24 February 2022, Go-Ahead published their delayed 202021 results, and announced the outcome of investigations into the termination of the franchise. The review found that &quot;serious errors had been made” since 2006, with the expected cost to the company to be over £80million. The amount owed to the DfT was increased to £51.3million, with errors dating back to 2006. Go-Ahead also stated that they expect to have to pay a fine to the DfT, setting aside up to £30million for this. Go-Ahead also stated that they may also owe DfT an additional £21.3million, related to a dispute over profit sharing.

====Takeover====
On 13 June 2022, a consortium of Australia&#x27;s Kinetic Group (51%) and Spain&#x27;s Globalvia (49%) launched a takeover bid of Go-Ahead, initially valuing the company at £647 million. Two months later, the offer was increased to £669 million. Shortly thereafter, 78.6% of Go-Ahead&#x27;s shareholders voted to accept the offer.

====Expansion and changes====
During January 2023, it was announced that Go-Ahead was expanding into the Australian market via the U-Go Mobility joint venture with the engineering company UFL; this venture had been recently awarded a contract by Transport New South Wales to operate buses in Sydney. In June 2023, Go-Ahead bought Pulhams Coaches, expanding its presence into the Cotswolds.

In mid 2023, Go-Ahead Group announced that it was procuring a new fleet of hydrogen fuel cell buses to serve routes around Gatwick Airport, Crawley, and Horley; comprising 54 vehicles, it will be one of the largest hydrogen bus fleets present in the UK.

<text>Sir Michael James Lighthill (23 January 1924 – 17 July 1998) was a British applied mathematician, known for his pioneering work in the field of aeroacoustics and for writing the Lighthill report in 1973, which pessimistically stated that &quot;In no part of the field (of AI) have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised&quot;, contributing to the gloomy climate of AI winter.

==Education and early life==
James Lighthill was born to Ernest Balzar Lichtenberg and Marjorie Holmes: an Alsatian mining engineer who changed his name to Lighthill in 1917, and the daughter of an engineer. The family lived in Paris until 1927, when the father retired and returned to live in England. As a young man, James Lighthill was known as Michael Lighthill.

Lighthill was educated at Winchester College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1943. 

==Career and research==
Lighthill specialised in fluid dynamics, and worked at the National Physical Laboratory at Trinity. Between 1946 and 1959 he was Beyer Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester. Lighthill then moved from Manchester to become director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. There he worked on the development of television and communications satellites, and on the development of crewed spacecraft. This latter work was used in the development of the Concorde supersonic airliner.

In 1955, together with Gerald B. Whitham, Lighthill set out the first comprehensive theory of kinematic waves (an application of the method of characteristics), with a multitude of applications, prime among them fluid flow and traffic flow.

Lighthill&#x27;s early work included two-dimensional aerofoil theory, and supersonic flow around solids of revolution. In addition to the dynamics of gas at high speeds, he studied shock and blast waves and introduced the squirmer model. He is credited with founding the subject of aeroacoustics, a subject vital to the reduction of noise in jet engines. &quot;Lighthill&#x27;s eighth power law&quot; states that the acoustic power radiated by a jet engine is proportional to the eighth power of the jet speed. He also founded non-linear acoustics, and showed that the same non-linear differential equations could model both flood waves in rivers and traffic flow in highways.

In 1964 he became the Royal Society&#x27;s resident professor in Imperial College London, before returning to Trinity College, Cambridge, five years later as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a chair he held until 1979, when he was succeeded by Stephen Hawking. Lighthill then became Provost of University College London (UCL) – a post he held until 1989.

Lighthill founded the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) in 1964, alongside Professor Sir Bryan Thwaites. In 1968, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath. In 1972 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Aquatic Animal Locomotion&quot;.

In the early 1970s, partly in reaction to significant internal discord within that field, the Science Research Council (SRC), as it was then known, asked Lighthill to compile a review of academic research in Artificial Intelligence. Lighthill&#x27;s report, which was published in 1973 and became known as the &quot;Lighthill report,&quot; was highly critical of basic research in foundational areas such as robotics and language processing, and &quot;formed the basis for the decision by the British government to end support for AI research in all but two universities&quot;, starting what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;AI winter&quot;.

In 1982, Lighthill and Alan B. Tayler were jointly awarded the first ever Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in recognition of their &quot;outstanding contributions to mathematics and its applications over a period of years&quot;. In 1983 Lighthill was awarded the Ludwig Prandtl Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot;.

His former students include Gerald B. Whitham and Steve Furber.

===Awards and honours===
Lighthill was elected FRS in 1953 and FRAS in 1961.

He was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1964, and the Copley Medal, also of the Royal Society, posthumously, in 1998.

In 1958, Lightill was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The James Lighthill building at the University of Manchester and James Lighthill House are named in his honour.

Lighthill was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1970.

In 1971 Lighthill was made knight in the New Year&#x27;s Honours.

In 1976, Lighthill was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, one of at least nine such foreign academies to elect him, including the French and Russian.

Lighthill was also made an honorary member of many bodies, and received twenty-four honorary doctorates. He was invited to give, and delivered, many prize and plenary lectures.

==Personal life==
His hobby was open-water swimming. He died in the water in 1998 when the mitral valve in his heart ruptured while he was swimming round the island of Sark, a feat which he had accomplished many times before.

<doc id="946664" wikidata="Q8011942" url="?curid=946664" title="William Henry Clinton">
<text>General Sir William Henry Clinton (23 December 1769 – 15 February 1846) was a British Army officer and politician who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and the Liberal Wars. He was also the grandson of Admiral George Clinton and elder brother of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton.

==Military career==
Born to General Sir Henry Clinton in 1769, Clinton entered the British Army in 1784 as a cornet in the 7th Light Dragoons. Under the Duke of York, Clinton took part in the Flanders and Low Countries campaigns as a captain in the 1st Guards in 1793, winning promotion to Lieutenant Colonel the following year. Serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) for East Retford from 1794 to 1796, he left Parliament to become &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Duke.

In 1799, Clinton travelled to Italy on a diplomatic mission to Russian forces, before returning to take part in the Dutch expedition later that year. In 1801, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and participated in the capture of Madeira. He was then appointed governor of Madeira from July 1801 until March 1802, before becoming Military Secretary in 1803 and Quartermaster-General in Ireland in 1804. He returned to Parliament in 1806 as MP for Boroughbridge, a seat he held until 1818. After another diplomatic mission to Sweden in 1807, Clinton became a major-general the following year.

During 1812, Clinton served in the Mediterranean leading a division at Messina on the Italian island of Sicily, where he commanded a force of 12,000 British and Spanish troops. He commanded the 1st Division of the independent Army on the Tarragona, during the Peninsular War between 1812 and 1813, Clinton won distinction during the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813. In June 1813, Clinton became commander-in-chief of the British Forces in eastern Spain serving until April 1814, however he would see little action for the remainder of the war. After promotion to Lieutenant General, Clinton was knighted Order of the Bath in 1815. In 1814 he was given the Colonelcy of the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot, a position he held until his death.

Returning to his post as a member of Parliament, he would command a division consisting of around 5,000 soldiers during the First Miguelist War where he attempted to support Portuguese forces from December 1826 until April 1828. Promoted a full general, Clinton resigned from Parliament serving as governor of Chelsea Hospital from 1842 until his death on 15 February 1846 on Cockenhatch, near Royston, Herts. There is a memorial plaque to Clinton in St. Mary Magdalene Church, Barkway, Herts.

==Personal==

Clinton was married to Lady Dorothea Louisa Holroyd and had two sons who both served in the British Army.

<text>A rotary evaporator (rotovap) is a device used in chemical laboratories for the efficient and gentle removal of solvents from samples by evaporation. When referenced in the chemistry research literature, description of the use of this technique and equipment may include the phrase &quot;rotary evaporator&quot;, though use is often rather signaled by other language (e.g., &quot;the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure&quot;).

Rotary evaporators are also used in molecular cooking for the preparation of distillates and extracts.

A simple rotary evaporator system was invented by Lyman C. Craig. It was first commercialized by the Swiss company Büchi in 1957. The device separates substances with different boiling points, and greatly simplifies work in chemistry laboratories. In research the most common size accommodates round-bottom flasks of a few liters, whereas large scale (e.g., 20L-50L) versions are used in pilot plants in commercial chemical operations.

==Design==
The main components of a rotary evaporator are: 
# A motor unit that rotates the evaporation flask or vial containing the user&#x27;s sample.
# A vapor duct that is the axis for sample rotation, and is a vacuum-tight conduit for the vapor being drawn off the sample.
# A vacuum system, to substantially reduce the pressure within the evaporator system.
# A heated fluid bath (generally water) to heat the sample. 
# A condenser with either a coil passing coolant, or a &quot;cold finger&quot; into which coolant mixtures such as dry ice and acetone are placed.
# A condensate-collecting flask at the bottom of the condenser, to catch the distilling solvent after it re-condenses.
# A mechanical or motorized mechanism to quickly lift the evaporation flask from the heating bath.

The vacuum system used with rotary evaporators can be as simple as a water aspirator with a trap immersed in a cold bath (for non-toxic solvents), or as complex as a regulated mechanical vacuum pump with refrigerated trap. Glassware used in the vapor stream and condenser can be simple or complex, depending upon the goals of the evaporation, and any propensities the dissolved compounds might give to the mixture (e.g., to foam or &quot;bump&quot;). Commercial instruments are available that include the basic features, and various traps are manufactured to insert between the evaporation flask and the vapor duct. Modern equipment often adds features such as digital control of vacuum, digital display of temperature and rotational speed, and vapor temperature sensing.

==Theory==
Vacuum evaporators as a class function because lowering the pressure above a bulk liquid lowers the boiling points of the component liquids in it. Generally, the component liquids of interest in applications of rotary evaporation are research solvents that one desires to remove from a sample after an extraction, such as following a natural product isolation or a step in an organic synthesis. Liquid solvents can be removed without excessive heating of what are often complex and sensitive solvent-solute combinations.

Rotary evaporation is most often and conveniently applied to separate &quot;low boiling&quot; solvents such a n-hexane or ethyl acetate from compounds which are solid at room temperature and pressure. However, careful application also allows removal of a solvent from a sample containing a liquid compound if there is minimal co-evaporation (azeotropic behavior), and a sufficient difference in boiling points at the chosen temperature and reduced pressure.

Solvents with higher boiling points such as water (100 °C at standard atmospheric pressure, 760 torr or 1 bar), dimethylformamide (DMF, 153 °C at the same), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 189 °C at the same), can also be evaporated if the unit&#x27;s vacuum system is capable of sufficiently low pressure. (For instance, both DMF and DMSO will boil below 50 °C if the vacuum is reduced from 760 torr to 5 torr [from 1 bar to 6.6 mbar]) However, more recent developments are often applied in these cases (e.g., evaporation while centrifuging or vortexing at high speeds). Rotary evaporation for high boiling hydrogen bond-forming solvents such as water is often a last recourse, as other evaporation methods or freeze-drying (lyophilization) are available. This is partly due to the fact that in such solvents, the tendency to &quot;bump&quot; is accentuated. The modern centrifugal evaporation technologies are particularly useful when one has many samples to do in parallel, as in medium- to high-throughput synthesis now expanding in industry and academia.

Evaporation under vacuum can also, in principle, be performed using standard organic distillation glassware — i.e., without rotation of the sample. The key advantages in use of a rotary evaporator are
# That the centrifugal force and the frictional force between the wall of the rotating flask and the liquid sample result in the formation of a thin film of warm solvent being spread over a large surface.
# The forces created by the rotation suppress bumping. The combination of these characteristics and the conveniences built into modern rotary evaporators allow for quick, gentle evaporation of solvents from most samples, even in the hands of relatively inexperienced users. Solvent remaining after rotary evaporation can be removed by exposing the sample to even deeper vacuum, on a more tightly sealed vacuum system, at ambient or higher temperature (e.g., on a Schlenk line or in a vacuum oven).

A key disadvantage in rotary evaporations, besides its single sample nature, is the potential of some sample types to bump, e.g. ethanol and water, which can result in loss of a portion of the material intended to be retained. Even professionals experience periodic mishaps during evaporation, especially bumping, though experienced users become aware of the propensity of some mixtures to bump or foam, and apply precautions that help to avoid most such events. In particular, bumping can often be prevented by taking homogeneous phases into the evaporation, by carefully regulating the strength of the vacuum (or the bath temperature) to provide for an even rate of evaporation, or, in rare cases, through use of added agents such as boiling chips (to make the nucleation step of evaporation more uniform). Rotary evaporators can also be equipped with further special traps and condenser arrays that are best suited to particular difficult sample types, including those with the tendency to foam or bump.

==Safety==
Possible hazards include implosions resulting from use of glassware that contains flaws, such as star-cracks. Explosions may occur from concentrating unstable impurities during evaporation, for example when rotavapping an ethereal solution containing peroxides. This can also occur when taking certain unstable compounds, such as organic azides and acetylides, nitro-containing compounds, molecules with strain energy, etc. to dryness. 

Users of rotary evaporation equipment must take precautions to avoid contact with rotating parts, particularly entanglement of loose clothing, hair, or necklaces. Under these circumstances, the winding action of the rotating parts can draw the users into the apparatus resulting in breakage of glassware, burns, and chemical exposure. Extra caution must also be applied to operations with air reactive materials, especially when under vacuum. A leak can draw air into the apparatus and a violent reaction can occur.

<doc id="946668" wikidata="Q2257289" url="?curid=946668" title="Pork Soda">
<text>Pork Soda is the third studio album by the American rock band Primus. It was released on April 20, 1993, by Interscope Records and Prawn Song Records. The album was certified gold in September 1993 and platinum in May 1997. The 2005 re-issue comes in a digipak and contains a booklet with lyrics printed to nine songs, omitting &quot;Pork Soda&quot; which consists of a series of unintelligible rants. Claypool explained the term &quot;pork soda&quot; was meant to refer to how Primus - a band that, in his eyes, wasn&#x27;t suitable for radio play - was &quot;an acquired taste, like a meat-flavored soda would be&quot;.

The album debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, which some music critics considered surprising considering the group&#x27;s uncommercial sound. It became the group&#x27;s first top ten album, and sold half a million copies. Singles include &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot; and &quot;Mr. Krinkle&quot;. The album was performed in its entirety for the first time at the Fox Oakland Theatre on December 31, 2015.

==Music and lyrics==
The album contains darker content than previous Primus efforts, featuring lyrics dealing with murder (&quot;My Name Is Mud&quot;), suicide (&quot;Bob&quot;), and alienation (&quot;Nature Boy&quot;). The band has commented that prior to recording, they had been touring for nearly two solid years and were thus in a somber mood, although in a 2015 interview frontman Les Claypool described the era surrounding the album as &quot;Good times, happy times. It&#x27;s not like we were reflecting any personal drama or anything.&quot;

Regarding the song &quot;Wounded Knee&quot; drummer Tim Alexander said &quot;I needed a name. I was reading this book called &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. It was something I never really thought about before... I mean how this country came to be. We are taught to be so proud. But a lot of what we have is based on lies and deceit. They only teach you what they want you to know. I hope people will see the title and check it out. Next time you listen to &#x27;Wounded Knee&#x27;, try and put the story and the music together. The rhythm and the pulse, there is an element of it that is angry then peaceful.&quot;

==Reception==

In his review of &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, Neil Perry of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called it &quot;a focused mess&quot; that is driven by the &quot;extraordinary percussive attack&quot; from Alexander and Claypool, with guitarist Larry LaLonde &quot;[hovering] on the edge of the action, throwing out sporadic mutant chords and droning feedback when the fancy takes him.&quot; Reviewing the album for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Deborah Frost notes that &quot;the band is starting to gel&quot;. She describes &quot;Pork Soda&quot; as &quot;goofy&quot; and &quot;Zappa-esque&quot;, predicting that the &quot;alternative-metal-fusion will appeal mostly to folks who like a little fizz with their lard.&quot; In his review for the album, Robert Christgau calls Primus &quot;quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them.&quot; Tom Sinclair, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, describes the album as &quot;an amalgam of elements that have no reason to be joined together in a sane universe&quot;, noting that &quot;the band invokes the circa &#x27;69 Mothers of Invention and &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;-era Captain Beefheart as often as it does George Clinton or Bootsy Collins.&quot; He concludes that &quot;hard-core funk-metal freaks may find it all a bit diffuse, but if you think its high time surrealism entered the mosh pits of America, &quot;Pork Soda&quot; just may be your cup of meat.&quot;

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Steve Huey contends that &quot;Pork Soda&quot; is &quot;one of the strangest records ever to debut in the Top Ten.&quot; He notes that the album &quot;showcases the band&#x27;s ever-increasing level of musicianship&quot; and that &quot;[their] ensemble interplay continues to grow in complexity and musicality&quot;, although &quot;[the] material isn&#x27;t quite as consistent as &quot;Seas of Cheese&quot;&quot;. He concludes that &quot;the band keeps finding novel variations on their signature sound, even if they never step out of it.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; similarly said that &quot;Pork Soda&quot; debuting in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart was &quot;a remarkable achievement for such an idiosyncratic combo.&quot; Despite praising some songs, he felt a &quot;slight predictability&quot; had crept into the band&#x27;s &quot;winning, weirdo ways&quot;, with Claypool&#x27;s melodramatic singing &quot;blurring the shades of black humor in his lyrics,&quot; and that despite Primus&#x27; inventive complexity, &quot;the herky-jerky time and tempo changes don&#x27;t always provide enough variety.&quot; 

Chris Norris of &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) writes that much of the record resembles &quot;a pissed-off octopus flailing around a gymnasium&quot;, with half of the songs &quot;bashed out in the studio&quot;, but because it sold over half a million copies, &quot;the band&#x27;s perversion of astounding chops starts to feel like a genuinely subversive act. Maybe this is what Van Halen looks like post Ren, Stimpy, and Nirvana.&quot; In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (1999), Alex Ogg called it Primus&#x27; breakthrough album and wrote that while they were not original, &quot;you can forgive a band a great deal if they take themselves so (un)seriously and deliver songs and catchy and immediate at these.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Pork Soda&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide&quot; (2000), Robert Christgau highlighted &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;DMV&quot; and called Primus &quot;quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them.&quot; Chris Ott of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;Pork Soda&quot; in a list of albums common in second-hand stores and believed that Primus had largely become &quot;a one-liner&quot; ever since the album&#x27;s release. He stated that while it benefitted from the Lollapalooza tour that Primus played on, the record was less inspired than its predecessors, adding that &quot;apart from the clicking tempo gimmickry of &#x27;My Name is Mud&#x27; and a brief percussion solo from drummer Herb (&#x27;Wounded Knee&#x27;), there isn&#x27;t a single new idea on &quot;Pork Soda&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Trent River is a river in southeastern Ontario which flows from Rice Lake to empty into the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. This river is part of the Trent-Severn Waterway which leads to Georgian Bay. The river is long. The Trent drains a large portion of south-central Ontario, including most of the Kawartha Lakes and their supplying watersheds.

The river is host to numerous species of birds, amphibians and fish. Some species of fish in the river include: Smallmouth bass, Largemouth bass, Pike, Walleye, Freshwater drums, Crappie, as well as other smaller fish such as Sunfish, Rock Bass and Bluegill.

Located in traditional territory of the Mississauga Anishinaabek, Trent River&#x27;s name in Ojibwe is both &quot;zaagidawijiwanaang&quot;, and &quot;Saugechewigewonk&quot;, meaning &quot;Strong Rapids Waters&quot;.

Tributaries of this river include the Crowe River and the Otonabee River, which runs through the city of Peterborough, Ontario.
Trent University, located in Peterborough, is named after the region, and looked to provide university education to the area.

In 2008 water soldier plant was reported found along the shore line. The plant is imported from Europe. It is a common pond plant, purchased in garden stores. It has sharp leaves and is a possible concern as the plant spreads quickly using asexual reproduction.

<doc id="946689" wikidata="Q517432" url="?curid=946689" title="Czech hedgehog">
<text>The Czech hedgehog ( or &quot;&quot;) is a static anti-tank obstacle defense made of metal angle beams or I-beams (that is, lengths with an L- or 𝐈-shaped cross section). It is similar in shape to metal knucklebones, although on a much larger scale. The hedgehog is very effective in keeping light to medium tanks and vehicles from penetrating a line of defense; it maintains its function even when tipped over by a nearby explosion. Although Czech hedgehogs may provide some scant cover for attacking infantry, infantry forces are generally much less effective against fortified defensive positions than mechanized units. The author of the Czechoslovak invention is Major František Kašík.

== History ==
===Origin===
The Czech hedgehog&#x27;s name refers to its origin in Czechoslovakia. The hedgehogs were originally used on the Czech–German border by the Czechoslovak border fortifications – a massive but never-completed fortification system that was turned over to Germany in 1938 after the occupation of the Sudetenland as a consequence of the Munich Agreement.

The first hedgehogs were built of reinforced concrete, with a shape similar to later metal versions. However, the concrete hedgehogs proved ineffective during tests as they could be substantially damaged by machine-gun fire. Once they were fragmented, the debris provided more cover for enemy infantry than did their metal counterparts. Therefore, only the oldest sections of the Czechoslovak defensive line, built in 1935–1936, were equipped with concrete hedgehogs, and usually only in the second line.

===World War II===
The Czech hedgehog was widely used during World War II by the Soviet Union in anti-tank defense. They were produced from any sturdy piece of metal and sometimes wood, like railway sleepers. Czech hedgehogs were especially effective in urban combat, where a single hedgehog could block an entire street. Czech hedgehogs thus became a symbol of &quot;defense at all costs&quot; in the Soviet Union; hence, the memorial to Moscow defenders, built alongside the M-10 highway in 1966, is composed of three giant Czech hedgehogs.

Czech hedgehogs were part of the German defenses of the Atlantic Wall. During the invasion of Normandy, the Allies cut up sizable numbers of intact and wrecked hedgehogs and welded them to the front of their M4 Sherman and M5 Stuart tanks. Known as Rhino tanks, these proved very useful for clearing the hedgerows that made up the bocages across Normandy.

===Cold War===
Postwar tests conducted by the Czechoslovak army proved the low efficiency of the metal hedgehogs against heavy armored vehicles such as the Soviet ISU-152 and T-54 or German Panther. As many as 40% of attempts at breakthrough were successful; therefore, the army developed new anti-tank obstacles for the border fortifications instituted during the Cold War. Nevertheless, the metal hedgehog was still used as a quick road-block against wheeled vehicles.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
In early 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, hedgehogs were used in conjunction with concrete barriers and other techniques to thwart Russian forces. The Ukrainian Railways repurposed new tracks to make hundreds of hedgehogs at 33 of its own shops and some other sites. The railroad estimated they had enough material for some 1,800 hedgehogs. The Ukrainian military in Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv also made hedgehogs to be distributed to strategic locations. In Kyiv, hedgehogs from WWII were brought out of a museum and used at a roadblock.

== Technical details ==
The hedgehog is not generally anchored to prevent movement, as it can be effective even if rolled by a large explosion. Its effectiveness lies in its dimensions, combined with the fact that a vehicle attempting to drive over it will likely become stuck (and possibly damaged) through rolling on top of the lower bar and lifting its treads (or wheels) off the ground.

Industrially manufactured Czech hedgehogs were made of three pieces of metal angle (L 140/140/13 mm, length , weight ; later versions: length , weight joined by gusset plates, rivets and bolts, or welded together into a characteristic spatial three-armed cross with each bar at right angles to the other two, this pattern forming the axes of an octahedron. Two arms of the hedgehog were connected in the factory, while the third arm was connected on-site by M20 bolts. The arms were equipped with square &quot;feet&quot; to prevent sinking into the ground, as well as notches for attaching barbed wire.

<text>László Cseh (; born 3 December 1985) is a retired Hungarian competitive swimmer and six-time Olympic medalist. He is a 33-time European Champion. His father, László Cseh Sr., also represented Hungary at the Olympics in swimming. In 2020, Braden Keith of SwimSwam nominated him as number 1 within top 10 male swimmers who have never won Olympic gold.

Nevertheless, he won a bronze medal in the 400 m individual medley as well as coming in fourth in the 200 m individual medley, and sixth in the 100 m backstroke.

At the 2005 World Championships, Cseh not only improved his national records, he excelled further up in the world rankings, and entered the meet as a serious medal contender in 3 events. After Michael Phelps backed out of the 400 m individual medley, Cseh picked up his first gold medal at the world championships.

Cseh failed to back up his previous performances in the 2007 World Championships, finishing outside the medals in the 400 m individual medley; however he did set a new national record in the 200 m individual medley, along with testing out the 200 m freestyle.

Cseh represented Hungary at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing in three swimming events: the 400 m individual medley, the 200 m butterfly, and the 200 m individual medley. Despite setting the European record in all of them, he won the silver medal in each and came in second behind American Michael Phelps, who won each event with a new world record. In both individual medleys, Cseh came out ahead of the bronze-medal winner Ryan Lochte.

At the 2009 World Championships, Cseh was rushed to hospital on arrival in Rome, suffering from a stomach virus. A source close to the Hungarian team stated: &quot;He has had to have re hydration and electrolyte drinks but is quite sick.&quot; He scratched his first event, the 200 m butterfly, however he did return to competition on day 4 setting a European record in the 200 m individual medley, swimming a touch slower the next night to capture silver, final night of competition saw him take bronze in the 400 m individual medley.

At the 2010 European Championships, Cseh held off Markus Rogan for gold in the 200 m individual medley, winning the event for the third time.

Cseh did add to his Olympic medal count with a bronze in the 200 meter individual medley, touching the wall in a time of 1:56.22, behind Phelps (gold – 1:54.27) and Lochte (silver – 1:54.90).

At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, Cseh finally won another gold, 10 years after his first, by winning the 200m butterfly in 1:53.48, 0.2 seconds ahead of Chad le Clos.

===2016 Olympics===
At the 2016 Olympics, he competed in the 100 m and 200 m butterfly, along with the 4 × 100 m medley relay.

In 100 m butterfly he finished 2nd along with rivals Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos, where Singaporean Joseph Schooling won the race with a new Olympic record. Cseh has now won Olympic silver medals in four different events, and he has also won individual medals in four different Olympics.

<text>Victor Kennedy Copps (March 21, 1919 – October 15, 1988) was a Canadian politician who served as Mayor of Hamilton.

==Life and career==
Copps was born in Haileybury, Ontario. He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, following which, he worked in Timmins, Ontario for a local newspaper. In 1945 he moved to Hamilton to become a sports broadcaster on CHML. He entered local politics in 1960, winning a seat on the Board of Control and becoming deputy Mayor. He ran for Mayor in 1962 defeating the incumbent.

He sparked outrage among Hamilton&#x27;s Protestant community, as one of his first official acts was to abolish the annual Orange Order Parade, a staple of Hamilton for many years. In 1964 he was an unsuccessful candidate at the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership convention.

Copps continued as mayor until 1976 when he was forced to retire following a heart attack while running in the Around the Bay Road Race. He was the city&#x27;s first Roman Catholic mayor and its second-longest serving holder of that office. Under his leadership, the city engaged in a major project of urban renewal. The city&#x27;s sports and entertainment arena, FirstOntario Centre, was previously named Copps Coliseum in his honour.

Copps was the father of Sheila Copps, a former Canadian cabinet minister.

<doc id="946695" wikidata="Q979940" url="?curid=946695" title="Mikoshi">
<text>A is a sacred religious palanquin (also translated as portable Shinto shrine). Shinto followers believe that it serves as the vehicle to transport a deity in Japan while moving between main shrine and temporary shrine during a festival or when moving to a new shrine. Often, the &quot;mikoshi&quot; resembles a miniature building, with pillars, walls, a roof, a veranda and a railing.

Often the Japanese honorific prefix is added, making .
== History ==
The first recorded use of &quot;mikoshi&quot; was during the Nara period. Among the first recorded uses was when in the year 749, the deity Hachiman is said to have been carried from Kyushu to Nara to worship the newly-constructed &quot;Daibutsu&quot; at Tōdai-ji. As the head shrine of all Hachiman shrines in Japan, Usa Jingū in Ōita Prefecture, Kyushu is said to be the birthplace of &quot;mikoshi&quot;.

== Shapes ==

Typical shapes are rectangles, hexagons, and octagons. The body, which stands on two or four poles (for carrying), is usually lavishly decorated, and the roof might hold a carving of a phoenix.

== Festival and flow ==
During a &quot;matsuri&quot; (Japanese festival) involving a &quot;mikoshi&quot;, people bear the &quot;mikoshi&quot; on their shoulders by means of two, four, or (rarely) six poles. They bring the &quot;mikoshi&quot; from the shrine, carry it around the neighborhoods that worship at the shrine, and in many cases leave it in a designated area, resting on blocks called &quot;uma&quot; (horse), for a time before returning it to the shrine. Some shrines have the custom of dipping the &quot;mikoshi&quot; in the water of a nearby lake, river or ocean (this practice is called &quot;o-hamaori&quot;). At some festivals, the people who bear the &quot;mikoshi&quot; wave it wildly from side to side to &quot;amuse&quot; the deity (kami) inside.

== Methods of shouldering ==
The most common method of shouldering in Japan is . Bearers chant and may or may not toss and shake the mikoshi.

Other methods include:

* is one famous way of shouldering observable at the Asakusa Sanja Festival. The shout is &quot;say ya, soi ya, sah, sorya... etc&quot;. The mikoshi is swayed rapidly, up and down and a little to the right and left.
* &quot;Dokkoi | ドッコイ &quot; is seen in Shonan in Kanagawa Prefecture. This shouldering style usually uses two poles. The mikoshi is moved up and down rhythmically, and more slowly than in the &quot;Edomae style&quot;. One shout is &quot;dokkoi dokkoi dokkoi sorya&quot; and there is a song called a &quot;Jink | lively song.&quot;
* Another one is &quot;Odawara style | 小田原担ぎ &quot; observed in Odawara (next to the Hakone). This is a peculiar way of shouldering in which multiple mikoshis meet and run (Holy Dash). The shout is &quot;oisah;korasah/koryasah.&quot; and there is a song called a &quot;Kiyari&quot;, a chant traditionally sung by workmen while pulling a heavy load and also by firemen. The bearers do not sway the mikoshi.
* In this &quot;united&quot; style, the mikoshi uses the full width of the road, moving from side to side and turning corners at full speed.

<text>Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (; 17 July 1831 – 1 May 1896) was the fourth Shah of Qajar Iran from 5 September 1848 to 1 May 1896 when he was assassinated. He was the son of Mohammad Shah Qajar and Malek Jahan Khanom and the third longest reigning monarch in Iranian history after Shapur II of the Sassanid dynasty and Tahmasp I of the Safavid dynasty. Naser al-Din Shah had sovereign power for close to 48 years.

He was the first modern Iranian monarch who formally visited Europe and wrote of his travels in his memoirs. A modernist, he allowed the establishment of newspapers in the country and made use of modern forms of technology such as telegraph, photography and also planned concessions for railways and irrigation works. Despite his modernizing reforms on education, his tax reforms were abused by people in power, and the government was viewed as corrupt and unable to protect commoners from abuse by the upper classes which led to increasing anti-governmental sentiments. He was assassinated when visiting a shrine in Rayy near Tehran.

==Reign==

===Effectiveness of his early rule===
The state under Naser al-Din was the recognized government of Iran, but its authority was undermined by local tribal leaders. The religious and tribal chieftains held quite a bit of autonomy over their communities. Naser al-Din was not effective in implementing his sovereignty over his people. Local groups had their own militias and oftentimes did not obey laws passed by the monarchy, since it did not have the power to enforce them. The people followed the ulama&#x27;s fatwas instead of state-issued law. When Naser al-Din took power, his army barely had 3,000 men which was significantly smaller than the armies under various tribal leaders. When the state needed a proper army, he would hire the local militias. Prior to his reforms, Naser&#x27;s government had very little power over their subjects and even during the reforms, they faced more scrutiny over their ability to implement those reforms successfully.

===Diplomacy and wars===

Naser al-Din was in Tabriz when he heard of his father&#x27;s death in 1848, and he ascended to the Sun Throne with the help of Amir Kabir. During his reign he would have to deal with the Revolt of Hasan Khan Salar, as well as insurrections by Babis.

Naser al-Din had early reformist tendencies, but was dictatorial in his style of government. With his sanction, thousands of Bábis were killed, this was in reaction to an assassination attempt from a small group of Bábis. This treatment continued under his prime minister Amir Kabir, who even ordered the execution of the Báb – regarded as a manifestation of God to Bábí&#x27;s and Baháʼís, and to historians as the founder of the Bábí religion.

Unable to regain the territory in the Caucasus irrevocably lost to Russia in the early 19th century, Naser al-Din sought compensation by seizing Herat, in 1856. Great Britain regarded the move as a threat to British India and declared war on Persia, forcing the return of Herat as well as Iran&#x27;s recognition of the kingdom of Afghanistan.

Naser al-Din was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe in 1873 and then again in 1878 (when he saw a Royal Navy Fleet Review), and finally in 1889 and was reportedly amazed with the technology he saw. During his visit to the United Kingdom in 1873, Naser al-Din Shah was appointed by Queen Victoria a Knight of the Order of the Garter, the highest English order of chivalry. He was the first Iranian monarch to be honoured as such. His travel diary of his 1873 trip has been published in several languages, including Persian, German, French, and Dutch.

In 1890 Naser al-Din met British major Gerald F. Talbot and signed a contract with him giving him the ownership of the Iranian tobacco industry, but he later was forced to cancel the contract after Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi issued a fatwa that made farming, trading, and consuming tobacco haram (forbidden). Consuming tobacco from the newly monopolized &#x27;Talbet&#x27; company represented foreign exploitation, so for that reason it was deemed immoral. It even affected the Shah&#x27;s personal life as his wives did not allow him to smoke.

This was not the end of Naser al-Din&#x27;s attempts to give concessions to Europeans; he later gave the ownership of Iranian customs incomes to Paul Julius Reuter.

===Reforms===
 He defeated various rebels in the Iranian provinces, most notably in Khorasan, balanced the budget by introducing reforms to the tax system, curbed the power of the clergy in the judiciary, built several military factories, improved relations with other powers to curb British and Russian influence, opened the first newspaper called &quot;Vaghaye-Ettefaghieh&quot;, embellished and modernized cities (for example by building the Tehran Bazaar) and most importantly opened the first Iranian school for upper education called the Dar ul-Funun where many Iranian intellectuals received their education. 

The Shah gradually lost interest in reform. However, he took some important measures such as introducing telegraphy and postal services and building roads. He also increased the size of the state&#x27;s military and created a new group called the Persian Cossack Brigade which was trained and armed by the Russians. He was the first Iranian to be photographed and was a patron of photography who had himself photographed hundreds of times. His final prime minister was Ali Asghar Khan, who after the shah&#x27;s assassination aided in securing the transfer of the throne to Mozaffar al-Din.
Although he was successful in introducing those western-based reforms, he was not successful in gaining complete sovereignty over his people or getting them to accept these reforms. The school he opened, Dar al-Funun, had very small enrollment numbers. The restrictions defined by Sh&#x27;ia Islam on the shah&#x27;s collection of the &quot;zakat&quot; led to those funds going straight into the coffers of the ulama. Therefore, the financial autonomy given to the ulama enabled them to remain structurally independent, keeping madrasahs open and supporting the students therein. The ulama also maintained their authority to challenge state law. To fund these new institutions and building projects, Naser al-Din repeatedly used tax farming to increase state revenue. Tax collectors routinely abused their power and the government was viewed as corrupt and unable to protect them from abuse by the upper class. This anti-government sentiment increased the ulama&#x27;s power over the people because they were able to provide them security. Keddie states in her book, &quot;Roots of Revolution: An Interpretive History of Modern Iran&quot;, that at the time &quot;it was still considered a sign of greater status to be admitted to the ranks of the ulama than it was to become a member of the civil service.&quot;

In 1852 Naser al-Din dismissed and executed Amir Kabir, the famous Iranian reformer. With him, many believe, died the prospect of an independent Iran led by meritocracy rather than nepotism.

In the later years of his rule, however, Naser al-Din steadfastly refused to deal with the growing pressures for reforms. He also granted a series of concessionary rights to foreigners in return for large payments. In 1872, popular pressure forced him to withdraw one concession involving permission to construct such complexes as railways and irrigation works throughout Iran. He visited Europe in 1873, 1878 and 1889. In 1890, he granted a 50-year concession on the purchase, sale, and processing of all tobacco in the country, which led to a national boycott of tobacco and the withdrawal of the concession. This last incident is considered by many authorities to be the origin of modern Iranian nationalism.

==Assassination==

Naser al-Din Shah was assassinated by Mirza Reza Kermani, a follower of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, when he was visiting and praying in the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine on 1 May 1896. It is said that the revolver used to assassinate him was old and rusty, and had he worn a thicker overcoat, or been shot from a longer range, he would have survived the attempt on his life. Shortly before his death, he is reported to have said &quot;I will rule you differently if I survive!&quot; The assassin was prosecuted by the defence minister, Nazm ol-Dowleh.

Nasser-al-Din Shah&#x27;s assassination and the subsequent execution of Kermani marked a turning point in Iranian political thought that would ultimately lead to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution during his successor Mozzafar-al-Din Shah&#x27;s turbulent reign.
Naser al-Din was buried in the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine, in Rayy near Tehran, where he was assassinated. His funeral took place six months after his death. A British diplomat who spoke with some who had been present, Charles Hardinge, commented &quot;... the corpse was conveyed on a very high funeral car and was &#x27;high&#x27; in more ways than one&quot;. His one-piece marble tombstone, bearing his full effigy, is now kept in the Golestan Palace Museum in Tehran.

==Artistic and literary interests==
Naser al-Din Shah was very interested in painting and photography. He was a talented painter and, even though he had not been trained, was an expert in pen and ink drawing. Several of his pen and ink drawings survive. He was one of the first photographers in Persia and was a patron of the art. He established a photography studio in Golestan Palace.

Naser al-Din was also a poet. 200 couplets of his were recorded in the preface of &quot;Majma&#x27;ul Fusahā&quot;, a work by Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat about poets of the Qajar period. He was interested in history and geography and had many books on these topics in his library. He also knew French and English, but was not fluent in either language.

&quot;Hekāyāt Pir o Javān&quot; (; &quot;The Tale of the Old and the Young&quot;) was attributed to him by many; it was one of the first Persian stories written in modern European style.

He also wrote the book &quot;Diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia during his tour through Europe in A.D. 1873&quot;.

<text>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park is a combination national recreation area and state park situated among the islands of Boston Harbor. The park is made up of 34 islands and peninsulas and is managed by the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership. Twenty-one of the islands are also included in the Boston Harbor Islands Archeological District.

The park is significant for a wide range of natural and cultural resources, including three national historic landmarks, unique geological features, archaeological resources resulting from thousands of years of occupation of the islands by indigenous people of Massachusetts, and complex natural communities.

Attractions include hiking trails, beaches, the Civil War-era Fort Warren, and Boston Light, the oldest lighthouse station in the United States. Georges Island and Spectacle Island are served seasonally by ferries to and from Boston, and Peddocks Island is served by a ferry from Hingham.

==List of islands and peninsulas==

The Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area is made up of islands and peninsulas on and around Boston Harbor. These include:

Though they are located in Boston Harbor, neither Castle Island nor Spinnaker Island belong to Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. Other former islands (Apple Island, Governors Island and Noddle&#x27;s Island) were obliterated by the formation of East Boston and the expansion of Logan International Airport before the creation of the national recreation area.

== History ==

=== Indigenous history ===
The islands have been places of significance to indigenous Native Americans for many thousands of years. Extensive archaeological evidence of indigenous activity in the area motivated the designation of 21 islands in an archaeological district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Indigenous tribes connected with the Boston Harbor Islands include the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), the Nipmuc Nation, and the Narragansett Indian Tribe.

People began using various sites among the islands on a seasonal basis starting in the Middle Archaic period and intensified this occupation throughout the Late Archaic and Woodland periods. The islands’ rich variety of resources, including shellfish, migratory birds, nut-bearing trees, fish, seals, and mammals like deer and raccoon, made them ideal places for temporary settlements. Prehistoric people also practiced controlled burning, woodcutting, and plant collecting, using traditional subsistence methods that made minimal impacts on natural resources. Beyond subsistence, the islands have also served as sites for ceremony and burial grounds.

During King Philip&#x27;s War, English colonists distrusted indigenous people, even those that had converted to Christianity and moved to “praying towns.” Colonists forcefully removed hundreds of Native American people, mostly women and children, from their homes in these towns (along with non-Christian Native Americans) and placed them in internment camps on Deer Island, Long Island, Peddocks Island, and Great Brewster Island. With inadequate shelter and food, about half of them died due to starvation or exposure while others were sold into enslavement in the West Indies. Women and children made up the majority of people interned on Deer Island. Today, descendants of the Tribal Nations involved in King Philip&#x27;s War meet yearly on Deer Island to commemorate their ancestors’ suffering.

=== Post-colonization ===
With the arrival of European colonists came heavy use of the islands. They became hubs for resource extraction, coastal defense, industry, and maritime navigation, amid other activities.  

The islands’ proximity to Boston, a major port city, has made them strategic locations for coastal defense facilities, and many of the islands saw activity during the Revolutionary War, Civil War, and the two world wars. Many of the harbor&#x27;s structures that are associated with military history still stand today, including Fort Warren.  

Since the 17th century the islands have been locations for many institutions, including quarantine hospitals, almshouses, reform schools, military prisons, and internment facilities. Businesses and recreation facilities, from resorts to waste processing plants, were also operated on several islands.

Several navigation aids of historic significance, including Boston Light, are also located in the park. The park boundaries also include sites of former lighthouses and range lights that are no longer standing, some of which have been replaced by modern structures.

=== National Register of Historic Places ===
The park is home to six sites that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including three National Historic Landmarks. These also include mainland access points, such as Long Wharf, that were named in the park&#x27;s establishing legislation.

=== National Historic Landmarks ===

* Boston Light
* Fort Warren (Massachusetts)
* Long Wharf (Boston) and Custom House Block

== Ecology ==
The park contains an extensive array of habitats. Among the park&#x27;s 35+ miles of coasts and shoreline are intertidal and subtidal zones, rocky beaches, and coastal bluffs. Forests, grassy meadows, salt marshes, and other habitats can be found on some islands.

These marine and terrestrial habitats are homes to many different species of animal. Land animals include coyote, common raccoon, and white-tailed deer. More than 200 species of bird have been documented on the islands. Humpback, fin, minke, and North Atlantic right whales are occasional visitors to the harbor along with other marine mammals like porpoises and dolphins. The islands are rich with mollusks, including many species of mussel, snail, clam, oyster, and more. Marine arthropods like crab and lobster can be found here as well as many terrestrial arthropods, such as insects and arachnids.

Plant life on the islands is also extensive, with native, non-native, and invasive species present depending on the history of the island in question. Native trees include eastern cottonwood, quaking aspen, northern red oak, bitternut hickory, and sassafras, among many others. Herbaceous plants and shrubs inhabit many of the islands’ meadows, forests, and coasts.

Various species of protist and fungus have also been documented on the islands.  

Because of the park&#x27;s abundance of healthy habitat for shorebirds, the park was designated a Massachusetts Important Bird Area. The park surveys bird species as indicators for the ecological health of the park.

Six species in the park are listed through the Massachusetts Natural Heritage Program. These include the following bird species: barn owl, common tern, least tern, Northern harrier; and the plant species sea beach dock and American sea blite.

==Management==
The Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area is managed by the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership, a statutory body established as a federal operating committee by the park enabling legislation. The partnership consists of individual members who represent a range of federal, state, city, and nonprofit agencies, including:

* National Park Service
* U.S. Coast Guard
* Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation
* Massachusetts Port Authority
* Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
* City of Boston
* City of Boston Planning Department
* Boston Harbor Now
* Cathleen Stone Island Outward Bound Education Center
* The Trustees of Reservations
* Boston Harbor Islands Advisory Council

Apart from the representative for the Coast Guard, who is appointed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, all the members of the partnership are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior after consultation with the appropriate agency or other body.

In practice, day-to-day management of each individual island or other site is the responsibility of one of the partner agencies or other bodies. The partnership provides a consistency and coordination across the whole park.

==Access==
Boston Harbor City Cruises offers ferry service from Long Wharf to Georges and Spectacle Islands. Ferry service from Hingham to Peddocks Island is also available.

Deer Island, Nut Island, Worlds End, and Webb Memorial are accessible by road from the mainland. Moon Island and Long Island are closed to the public.

== In popular culture ==
Bostonian Dennis Lehane drew inspiration from the harbor islands when writing his novel &quot;Shutter Island,&quot; citing a childhood visit to Long Island. The harbor islands are also featured in the film adaptation, as portions of the movie were shot at Peddocks Island.

Spectacle Island is featured in Fallout 4 as an explorable location and settlement.

<doc id="946726" wikidata="Q5161793" url="?curid=946726" title="Connex Melbourne">
<text>Connex Melbourne was a train operator in Melbourne, Australia. Formed in July 1998 as Hillside Trains, a business unit of the Public Transport Corporation, it was privatised in August 1999 becoming a subsidiary of Connex.

In April 2004, it became the sole operator of Melbourne suburban rail services, taking over the services of M&gt;Train. When the franchise was re-tendered, it was awarded to Metro Trains Melbourne from November 2009.

==History==

In October 1997, in preparation for privatisation, it was announced the Public Transport Corporation&#x27;s suburban rail operations would be split into two business units, Bayside Trains and Hillside Trains. PTC&#x27;s tram operations was also split in preparation for privatisation. The Melbourne Transport Enterprises consortium, consisting of CGEA Transport Asia Pacific Holdings (CTAP) (a subsidiary of CGEA, later known as Connex), GEC Alsthom Australia Ltd (later known as Alstom) and Banque Nationale de Paris, was formed following the announcement to bid on PTC&#x27;s rail and tram operations.

Hillside Trains, formed on 1 July 1998, took over operation of the Lilydale, Belgrave, Alamein, Glen Waverley, Epping (now Mernda) and Hurstbridge line services. Melbourne Transport Enterprises successfully bid to take over the Hillside Trains services from 29 August 1999 beating competition from GB Railways and National Express. As a partner of the consortium, Alstom would supply and deliver new trains, later known as X&#x27;Trapolis 100, to the Hillside Trains network. Alstom would also maintain the existing train fleet. Connex would be in charge of train operations, with Hillside Trains rebranded as Connex Melbourne in July 2000.

In December 2002, National Express withdrew from its operations in Victoria, and the State Government took control of the M&gt;Train franchise. Early in 2003, the government began negotiations with Connex to assume responsibility for all Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan train network. An agreement was reached in February 2004 that awarded Connex the exclusive right to operate the entire metropolitan train network from 18 April 2004.

In August 2007, Connex&#x27;s contract was extended until 29 November 2009. Veolia Transport was short listed to bid for the new franchise but lost to Metro Trains Melbourne and ceased operations on 29 November 2009.

As at August 2009, Connex Melbourne operated 15 train lines, 331 trains, 12,909 weekly services, and carried about 720,000 passengers each weekday. In 2008/09, 214 million passenger trips were made.

==Branding==
After initially retaining the Hillside Trains name, in July 2000, the Connex Melbourne name was introduced. Following Veolia&#x27;s rebranding of its transport operations from Connex to Veolia Transport on all other transport systems worldwide in late 2005 and early 2006, Connex Melbourne was one of the very few Veolia Transport operations to retain the Connex name. It was not until May 2008 that Connex Melbourne began to publicly acknowledge its connection with the parent company, using the &quot;Connex: A Veolia Transport Company&quot; phrase in publicity material and using the Veolia Transport and Connex brands together. Branding on staff uniforms, trains and station signage was not altered.

==Operations==
When the Public Transport Corporation fleet was split, Hillside Trains were allocated 58 three-car Hitachi and 91 three-car Comeng sets, as well as the single prototype 4-car 4D.

To replace the Hitachis, 58 three-car X&#x27;Trapolis were ordered with the first entering service in December 2002. The Comengs were refurbished between 2000 and 2003 by Alstom at Ballarat North Workshops.

When Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train franchise in April 2004, it took over all of its rolling stock including the remaining Hitachi and Comeng sets as well as the Siemens Nexas fleet. A class locomotives and MTH carriages were hired from V/Line for services on the unelectrified Stony Point line. These were replaced in April 2008 by Sprinters.

Because the modifications made by both operators had made the Comeng fleets incompatible with each other, Innovonics Limited modified the sets from both operators to enable them on the entire system again, along with a CCTV upgrade.

The majority of rolling stock was owned by the Victorian Government business enterprise VicTrack.

Maintenance of the Hitachi and Comeng sets was outsourced to United Group, while Siemens maintained the Siemens Nexas fleet. In October 2004, Alstom were contracted maintain the Hitachi, Comeng and X&#x27;Trapolis fleets. The maintenance contract was included in the sale of Alstom&#x27;s Australian operations to United Group.

Connex was also responsible for the maintenance of the electrified metro network, which was contracted out to Mainco, a subsidiary of the United Group. The Department of Transport also had input into infrastructure related issues and major rail projects.

==2009 heatwave issues==

During January 2009, Melbourne experienced several days of extreme heat with temperatures in excess of 43 °C – the hottest heatwave since records were kept from the mid-1880s – with a maximum temperature reached of in the Melbourne central business district. Prior to this, the ambient temperature was between . Connex was unable to guarantee services across the network. This was highly controversial as, in previous years, &#x27;heatwaves&#x27; did not cause train cancellations. The heat-distortion of tracks has been attributed to the lack of expansion joints within newly replaced rail. Figures based on Connex media releases for the same period show the numbers of cancelled services exceeded one third of total services.

On 29 January 2009, over 500 services were cancelled. Next day services on eight lines were cancelled and the City Loop closed in the afternoon owing to the extreme weather (at the height of the heatwave) and knock-on effects, and the loss of power at the South Morang transmission station. By Connex&#x27;s own estimates in the Melbourne media, over 750 services were cancelled out of 2,400. In response to the loss of services, the State Government made 30 January a day of free travel on trains, trams and buses.

==Government subsidy==
Between 2004 and 2009, Connex Melbourne was paid an average of $345 million per annum by the Victorian government to operate the metro network. At the end of the 2004–2009 franchise agreement, Connex was paid well over $2 billion by the state government. In addition to the base contract payments, other payments from the state government to Connex included farebox, concession top-ups, maintenance, rollingstock adjustments, incentives and capital projects.

==Reliability benchmarks==
Under the terms of its contract with the state government, Connex Melbourne was required to deliver on-time (no more than 59 seconds early, and no more than 4:59 minutes late, formerly 5:59 minutes) performance, system-wide, of no less than 92%. It was also required to deliver not less than 98% of scheduled train services, and significantly reduce any time spent by passengers waiting due to a delay, over a 1998 benchmark.

Fines for failure to meet service obligations were deducted from contract fees paid by the government to Connex. As of July 2006, the most recent fine imposed on Connex by the government was $5.1 million. Connex paid almost $70 million in penalty payments for poor performance over the life of the franchise. Connex released performance data on a monthly basis, usually put on view at railway stations. Fines and customer satisfaction levels are detailed in the quarterly &#x27;Track Record&#x27; report released by the Department of Transport.

For every month that Connex failed to meet the performance benchmarks, a free daily Metcard was offered to holders of monthly or yearly tickets valid during that month. No compensation was offered to passengers using weekly, daily or other tickets.

==Marketing==
Despite the formation of Metlink to deliver co-ordinated marketing initiatives across the entire Melbourne public transport network, Connex undertook its own marketing campaigns.

In July 2000, an advertising campaign featuring Harry Connick Jr publicised the name change from Hillside Trains to Connex. The campaign produced by Melbourne advertising agency Cummins &amp; Partners played on the similar sound of Connex and Connick&#x27;s name. A television commercial aired with Harry explaining; &quot;I heard Hillside Trains was going to change its name and I was honoured to hear they were going to name it after me. Connicks. Well they could have consulted me on the spelling.&quot; Billboards on station platforms had Connick stating in a voice bubble; &quot;Welcome to my train company – Connick&#x27;s. That&#x27;s OK, they&#x27;ll fix the spelling...&quot;

Television advertisements featuring Sheena Easton and a trainload of passengers singing her 1980 hit &quot;Morning Train (9 to 5)&quot; screened during April and May 2004.

Its most recent campaigns generally focused on commuter behaviour and etiquette. In mid-2005, Connex launched a print and TV advertising campaign featuring Humpty Dumpty and focusing on safety initiatives; the Don&#x27;t Hold Others Back campaign of 2006 featured imagery of commuters struggling to board a train; and a &#x27;train etiquette&#x27; campaign featuring fictitious character Martin Merton PhD, &quot;the worlds No. 1 expert on train etiquette&quot; offered advice to passengers on such topics as mobile phone use, flatulence and other low-level behavioural annoyances of train travel.

==Controversies==
On 23 February 2007, a computer hacker broke into the gateway used by the SMS system and sent threatening messages to over 10,000 commuters who had subscribed to the service.

A Connex spokesman said this was a hoax and that the hackers were able only to send the message and could not get access to the customer database.

Melbourne artist Van Thanh Rudd made an artwork attacking Connex&#x27;s parent company Veolia Environnement&#x27;s building of a light rail system in Jerusalem, including in East Jerusalem which is considered to be occupied by Israel.

<doc id="946729" wikidata="Q4356165" url="?curid=946729" title="Daryl Gates">
<text>Daryl Francis Gates (born Darrel Francis Gates; August 30, 1926 – April 16, 2010) was an American police officer who served as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1978 to 1992. His length of tenure in this position was second only to that of William H. Parker. Gates is credited with the creation of SWAT teams alongside fellow Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer John Nelson, who others claim was the originator of SWAT in 1965. Gates also co-founded the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program.

After the arrest of Rodney King and the subsequent riots, Gates retired from the LAPD. Much of the blame for the riots was attributed to him. According to one study, &quot;scandalous racist violence... marked the LAPD under Gates&#x27;s tempestuous leadership.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Gates was born in Glendale, California, to a Mormon mother and a Catholic father on August 30, 1926; he was raised in his mother&#x27;s faith. He grew up in Glendale and Highland Park, in the northeastern part of Los Angeles. The Great Depression affected his early life: his father was an alcoholic, and frequently ended up in the custody of the Glendale police. (Later in life, Gates often remarked on the taunts and harassment he received from schoolmates because of his father&#x27;s behavior.) Gates later wrote that he had a low opinion of the police due to their rough treatment of his father, and at age 16 Gates himself was arrested after punching an officer who manhandled his brother during a parking dispute (Gates apologized and the charges were dropped).

Gates graduated from Franklin High School in Highland Park and joined the U.S. Navy in time to see action in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After leaving the U.S. Navy, he attended Pasadena City College and married his first wife, Wanda Hawkins. He went on to take pre-law classes at the University of Southern California. After his wife became pregnant, a friend suggested that he join the LAPD, which was conducting a recruitment drive among former servicemen; Gates initially declined, then decided it was a good opportunity. Gates later finished his degree at USC.

==Career==

Gates joined the LAPD on September 16, 1949. Among his roles as an officer, he was picked to be the chauffeur for Chief William H. Parker. Gates often remarked that he gained many administrative and professional insights from Parker during the hours they spent together each day.

Gates worked hard to prepare for his promotional exams, scoring first in the sergeant&#x27;s exam and in every promotional exam thereafter. On his promotion to lieutenant, he rejoined Chief Parker as Parker&#x27;s executive officer. He was promoted to captain, responsible for intelligence. By the time of the Watts riots in 1965 he was an inspector (overseeing the investigations of, among other crimes, the Manson Family murders and the Hillside Strangler case). By the time of the 1975 special investigation into the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy he was Assistant Chief of the department. On March 28, 1978, Gates became the 49th chief of the department.

Gates established the specialized unit that became known as SWAT (originally, &quot;Special Weapons Attack Team&quot; but changed to &quot;...And Tactics&quot; for optics) in order to deal with hostage rescue and extreme situations involving armed and dangerous suspects. Ordinary street officers, with light armament, limited weapons training and little instruction on group fighting techniques, had shown to be ineffective in dealing with snipers, bank robberies carried out by heavily armed persons, and other high-intensity situations. In 1965, Officer John Nelson came up with an idea to form a specially trained and equipped unit to respond to and manage critical situations while minimizing police casualties.

As an inspector, Gates approved this idea. He formed a small select group of volunteer officers. His first team was born LAPD SWAT, D-Platoon of the Metro Division. This unit initially comprised fifteen teams of four men each, for a total staff of sixty. These officers were given special status and benefits, but in return they had to attend monthly trainings and serve as security for police facilities during episodes of civil unrest. SWAT was copied almost immediately by many US police departments and is now used by law enforcement agencies throughout the world.

In Gates&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Chief: My Life in the LAPD&quot; (Bantam Books, 1992), he explained that he developed neither SWAT tactics nor its distinctive equipment. He wrote that he supported the concept, tried to empower his people to develop the concept, and lent them moral support.

===PDID===
Gates made substantial use of the LAPD&#x27;s Public Disorder Intelligence Division (PDID) squad, even developing an international spying operation. The lawsuit &quot;CAPA v. Gates&quot;, with the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA) as one of two dozen or so plaintiffs, later sued the LAPD on First Amendment grounds that exposed the unlawful harassment, surveillance, and infiltration of the progressive movement in Los Angeles by LAPD agents. The lawsuit against Gates and the LAPD proved successful. The PDID was ordered to disband and did so in January 1983. In February 1984, an out-of-court settlement awarded $1.8 million to the named plaintiffs, individuals, and organizations who had sued the City of Los Angeles.

===D.A.R.E.===
In collaboration with the Rotary Club of Los Angeles, Gates founded DARE, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, designed to educate students and children about the dangers of drug abuse. DARE has become a worldwide organization, with programs in schools across the globe. However, despite the program&#x27;s wide use, peer-reviewed government-sponsored scientific research has discredited DARE&#x27;s claimed effectiveness in reducing alcohol or drug use, and the program has seen a 73% reduction in taxpayer funding as a result.

===CRASH===
Gates&#x27;s appointment as chief roughly coincided with the intensification of the War on Drugs. A drug-related issue that had also come to the forefront at the time was gang violence, which paralyzed many of the neighborhoods (primarily impoverished and black or Hispanic) in which gangs held sway. In response, the LAPD set up specialist gang units which gathered intelligence on and ran operations against gangs. These units were called Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH), depicted in the 1988 film &quot;Colors&quot;. Allegations of false arrest and a general LAPD disdain for young black and Latino men were made.

Gates himself became a byword among some for excessive use of force by anti-gang units and became a favorite lyrical target for gang-connected urban black rappers, notably Ice Cube. Nevertheless, CRASH&#x27;s approach appeared successful and remained in widespread use until the Rampart Division scandal of 1999 drew attention to abuses that threatened to undo hundreds of criminal convictions.

===Force enlargement===
Gates became LAPD chief a little over two months before the enactment of California&#x27;s Proposition 13, during a time of tremendous change in California politics. While the LAPD traditionally had been a &quot;lean and mean&quot; department compared with other American police forces (a point of pride for Parker), traffic congestion and continually decreasing officer-to-resident ratios (approximately 7,000 police officers for 3 million residents in 1978) diminished the effectiveness of LAPD&#x27;s prized mobility. Gates was eager to take more recruits, particularly for CRASH units, when the city made funds available.

Gates later claimed that many officers recruited in the 1980s—a period in which the LAPD was subject to a consent decree which set minimum quotas for hiring of women and minorities—were substandard, remarking:

... [I]f you don&#x27;t have all of those quotas, you can&#x27;t hire all the people you need. So, you&#x27;ve got to make all of those quotas. And when that happens, you get somebody who is on the borderline, you&#x27;d say &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s black, or he&#x27;s Hispanic, or it&#x27;s a female, but we want to bring in these additional people when we have the opportunity. So, we&#x27;ll err on the side of, &#x27;We&#x27;ll take them and hope it works out. And we made some mistakes. No question about it, we have made some mistakes.

===Special Order 40===

In 1979 Gates helped craft and implement Special Order 40, a mandate that prohibits police officers from stopping people for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration status. The mandate was created in an effort to encourage residents to report crimes without the fear of intimidation or deportation.

===Administrative style and personality===

Like his mentor Parker, Gates publicly questioned the effectiveness of community policing, usually electing not to work with community activists and prominent persons in communities in which the LAPD was conducting major anti-gang operations. At the time of the Rodney King beating, Gates was at a community policing conference. This tendency, a logical extension of the policies implemented by Parker that discouraged LAPD officers from becoming too enmeshed in the communities in which they served, did not serve him well politically: allegations of arrogance and racism plagued the department throughout his tenure, surfacing most strongly in the Christopher Commission report.

===Operation Hammer===
Many commentators criticized Gates for Operation Hammer, a policing operation conducted by the LAPD in South Los Angeles. After eight people were murdered at a birthday party in a drive-by shooting in 1987, Gates responded with an extremely aggressive sweep of South Los Angeles that involved 1,000 officers at any given time.

The operation lasted several years, with multiple sweeps, and resulted in over 25,000 arrests. This was not unprecedented: during the run-up to the 1984 Olympic Games, Mayor Tom Bradley empowered Gates to take all of the city&#x27;s gang members—known and suspected—into custody, where they remained until shortly after the Games&#x27; conclusion. In the years after the Olympic games Gates, Mayor Bradley and city council officials found a way to continue the sweeping policies initially meant for the duration of the Olympic games by reviving old, anti-syndicalist laws, to jail predominantly black and Latino youth, even though the overwhelming numbers of people arrested were never charged.

As a vast majority of those arrested were never charged, Operation Hammer was roundly criticized as a harassment operation whose chief goal was to intimidate young black and Hispanic men. In a PBS interview, when asked whether the local people in the minority areas expressed thanks to the police for their actions, Gates responded:

A similar operation was conducted in 1988 after a drive-by shooting took the life of a civilian in Westwood Village.

===Rodney King and the Los Angeles riots===
On March 3, 1991, Rodney King was arrested, repeatedly struck with batons and kicked, and taken into custody by LAPD officers after a car chase. A bystander, George Holliday, recorded the event on videotape. Gates and his department faced strong criticism in the aftermath of the arrest; Mayor Tom Bradley also called for Gates to resign, but he refused, leading to a stand-off between Gates and the mayor. The Christopher Commission report, issued July 10, 1991, identified a police culture of excessive force and poor supervision, and recommended numerous reforms, as well as Gates&#x27;s removal. Gates announced his intention to resign on July 13, 1991.

The 1992 Los Angeles riots on April 29, 1992, began when a Ventura County jury in Simi Valley acquitted three white and one Hispanic Los Angeles Police Department officers accused in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King following a high-speed pursuit.

Despite the announcement that the jury was preparing to deliver the verdict in the case, the LAPD day shift was sent home. After the riots broke out, Gates told reporters that the situation would soon be under control and left Parker Center to attend a previously scheduled political fundraising dinner. The fundraising event was part of an effort to fight a city charter amendment on the June 2 ballot that would limit the power and term of the police chief. These actions led to charges that Gates was out of touch. General command-and-control failings in the entire LAPD hierarchy during the riots led to criticisms that he was incapable of managing the force. It took the arrival of 10,000 California Army National Guard forces, 3,500 federal troops, and 1,000 federal law enforcement officers to end the unrest over the next six days.

In the aftermath of the riots, local and national media printed and aired dozens of reports deeply critical of the LAPD under Gates, painting it as an army of racist beat cops accountable only to an arrogant leadership. The paramilitary approach that Gates represented resulted in criticism and calls for the LAPD to shift to a community policing strategy.

Gates left the LAPD on June 28, 1992, and was replaced by Willie L. Williams, who had been named Gates&#x27;s successor on April 16, 1992. A second commission, the Webster Commission, headed by former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster, was formed in the wake of the riots. Its report, released on October 21, 1992, was generally considered to be scathingly critical of the department (as well as other government agencies) and was especially critical of Gates&#x27; management of it.

=== Ig Nobel ===
In 1992, the satiric Ig Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Daryl Gates &quot;for his uniquely compelling methods of bringing people together.&quot;

===Controversial rhetoric===
Gates earned notoriety for his controversial rhetoric on many occasions. Some of the most notable examples of this were:

* His testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that infrequent or casual drug users &quot;ought to be taken out and shot&quot; because &quot;we&#x27;re in a war&quot; and even casual drug use is &quot;treason&quot;. He later said the testimony was calculated hyperbole.
* In 1982, Gates said that &quot;blacks might be more likely to die from chokeholds because their arteries do not open as fast as they do in &#x27;normal people. This comment led to calls by the Urban League for his suspension. Gates apologized but refused to retract the comment. In his autobiography, Gates said that he had been misinterpreted and meant that black people were more predisposed to vascular conditions and therefore less likely to have normally functioning arteries.

==Later work==
Gates remained professionally active after leaving the LAPD, working with Sierra to create the computer game &quot;Police Quest: Open Season&quot;, an adventure game set in Los Angeles where gamers play the role of a Robbery/Homicide detective trying to solve a series of brutal murders. He appears in the game as Chief of Police and can be found on one of the top floors of Parker Center. In addition, Gates had been the principal consultant for Sierra&#x27;s &quot;SWAT&quot; series, appearing in them as well. In 1993, Gates was a talk show host on KFI, replacing Tom Leykis. His tenure was short lived, but he remained a frequent guest on talk radio, especially in regard to policing issues.

=== Businessman ===
Gates was President/CEO of Global ePoint, a security and homeland defense company dealing primarily in digital surveillance and security technology. He also served on the Advisory Board of PropertyRoom.com, a website for police auctions.

=== Autobiography ===
In 1992 he published &quot;Chief: My Life in the LAPD&quot;, an autobiography, written with the assistance of Diane K. Shah (Bantam Books). The book has details about Gates&#x27;s career and high-profile cases; the book went to press before the L.A. riots.

=== Later years ===
After Bernard Parks was denied a second term as Chief of Police by Mayor James K. Hahn in 2002, Gates, aged 75, told CNN that he intended to apply for his old job as LAPD chief. Hahn ultimately appointed William J. Bratton, a former police commissioner of Boston and New York City, to head the department.

==Death==
On April 16, 2010, Gates died at his home in Dana Point, California, at the age of 83 due to complications from bladder cancer.

==In popular culture==

Gates appeared as himself in season 7, episode 13 (&quot;Fatal Obsession, Part 2&quot;) of the television show &quot;Hunter&quot;.

Gates appears in an uncredited role at the end of the 1997 film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; as a police officer congratulating Ed Exley, the main character.

In the 1998 film &quot;American History X&quot;, he is mentioned in relation to the application of police brutality to Rodney King.

Gene Hackman based his portrayal of Sheriff Daggett on Gates in the 1992 film &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. Clint Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel, who was on the set, wrote that Hackman referred to Daggett overseeing Ned Logan&#x27;s torture as &quot;my Rodney King scene&quot;.

In 2004, he appeared in the second season of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; in the episode &quot;Respek&quot;.

Gates is portrayed by actor Josh Pence in the 2013 film &quot;Gangster Squad&quot;. In the film, Gates is in his younger years, still a chauffeur for LAPD Police Chief Bill Parker (played by Nick Nolte).

Gates was mentioned in a large number of rap and metal songs in the aftermath of the LA riots. Some of the more notable include Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Nigga to Fuck With&quot;, which includes a verse that imagines that Gates is decapitated and fried like a chicken, and Body Count&#x27;s &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, which caused widespread controversy.

Gates appears as a major character in James Ellroy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Enchanters&quot;.

<text>Ankou (Breton: &quot;an Ankoù&quot;) is a servant of death in Breton, Cornish (&quot;an Ankow&quot; in Cornish), and Welsh (&quot;yr Angau&quot; in Welsh).

==Background==
Ankou appears as a man or skeleton wearing a black robe and a large hat that conceals his face, or, on occasion, simply as a shadow. He wields a scythe and is said to sit atop a cart for collecting the dead, or to drive a large, black coach pulled by four black horses and accompanied by two ghostly figures on foot.

According to one legend, he was the first child of Adam and Eve. Other versions depict Ankou as the first dead person of the year (though he is always depicted as a male adult), charged with collecting others&#x27; souls before he can go to the afterlife. In an alternate origin, he was a cruel prince who met Death during a hunting trip and challenged him to see who could kill a black stag first. Death won the contest and the prince was cursed to roam the Earth as a ghoul for all eternity. Sometimes he is depicted as the king of the dead whose subjects have their own particular paths, along which their sacred processions move.

Ankou is mentioned by Anatole Le Braz, a writer and collector of legends, in &quot;The Legend of Death&quot;:

:The Ankou is the henchman of Death (&quot;oberour ar maro&quot;) and he is also known as the grave yard watcher, they said that he protects the graveyard and the souls around it for some unknown reason and he collects the lost souls on his land. The last dead of the year, in each parish, becomes the Ankou of his parish for all of the following year. When there has been, in a year, more deaths than usual, one says about the Ankou:
:– &quot;War ma fé, heman zo eun Anko drouk&quot;. (&quot;On my faith, this one is a nasty Ankou.&quot;)

==Appearance in subcultures==
Every parish in Brittany is said to have its own Ankou. In Breton tradition, the squealing of railway wheels outside one&#x27;s home is supposed to be &quot;Karrigell an Ankou&quot; (&quot;The Wheelbarrow of Ankou&quot;). Similarly, the cry of the owl is referred to as &quot;Labous an Ankou&quot; (&quot;The Death Bird&quot;). The Ankou is also found on the baptismal font at La Martyre where he is shown holding a human head.

== In Media ==
In Touhou 4: Lotus Land Story the character of Elly is more than likely based on Ankou

&quot;L&#x27;Ankou&quot;, the twenty-seventh album of the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; series, written and drawn by Fournier, serialised in 1976 in the &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, published as a hardcover album in 1977.

In the first season of Black Snow l&#x27;Ankou is referenced in a letter sealed away in a time capsule.

<text>Harold Park is a place in the London Borough of Havering.

==History==
Harold Park is north-eastern part of Harold Wood, occupying an isthmus of land between the A12 and the Ingrebourne River (The River Ingrebourne at Harold Park and Hornchurch).

In 1868 a wealthy Brentwood solicitor built himself a mansion to the south of the river and railway line, named Harold Court. After the owner&#x27;s bankruptcy the house served as a children&#x27;s home, then a lunatic asylum and then a sanatorium. In 1959 it became a teacher training college and has now been converted into private flats.
Horse Block Farm lay to the north-east of Harold Court Road. After the First World War the Essex builders Iles and Company laid out a bungalow estate here that it called Sunnytown. The company also created Sunnymede at Billericay.
When Harold Court primary school opened in 1929 the area still retained a rural character, but this was slowly eroded as further development plugged the gaps, including some industry beside the Ingrebourne River.

===Local government===
Harold Park was located in the northeastern protrusion of the Hornchurch civil parish. It was part of Romford Rural District until 1926 and was then formed part of Hornchurch Urban District.

Harold Park sits in the Parliamentary Constituency of Hornchurch and Upminster.

===Urban development===
Maylands Golf club, Harold Park was founded in 1937

==Geography==
Harold Park sits on the London/Essex border. The boundary goes down the Weald Brook. This has since changed to go down the M25 to junction 11 and then turn west along the A12 to Putwell Bridge where it joins the Ingrebourne. The River Ingrebourne and the Weald Brook meet in the area of Putwell Bridge. The Ingrebourne then flows south west.

<doc id="946746" wikidata="Q629425" url="?curid=946746" title="Bristol F.2 Fighter">
<text>The Bristol F.2 Fighter is a British First World War two-seat biplane fighter and reconnaissance aircraft developed by Frank Barnwell at the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company later known as the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It is often simply called the Bristol Fighter, &quot;Brisfit&quot; or &quot;Biff&quot;.

Although the type was intended initially as a replacement for the pre-war Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c reconnaissance aircraft, the new Rolls-Royce Falcon V12 engine gave it the performance of a fighter.

Despite a disastrous start to its career, the definitive F.2B version proved to be a manoeuvrable aircraft that was able to hold its own against single-seat fighters while its robust design ensured that it remained in military service into the early 1930s. Some war-surplus aircraft were registered for civilian use and versions with passenger cabins were converted.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the Autumn of 1915, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) needed a new aerial reconnaissance and artillery spotting aircraft to replace the pre-war Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. Among other attributes and performance requirements, emphasis was placed upon the ability to defend itself in aerial combat.

Several new types were developed; the Royal Aircraft Factory offered its R.E.8 design and Armstrong Whitworth produced the design that eventually emerged as the F.K.8. In March 1916, Frank Barnwell of the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company (later the Bristol Aeroplane Company), commenced work on a replacement for the B.E.2. This initially took two forms, the Type 9 R.2A, to be powered by the 120 hp Beardmore engine and the similar Type 9A R.2B, powered by the 150 hp Hispano-Suiza. Both designs had the fuselage mounted between the wings, with a gap between the lower longerons and the wing, along with a substantial part of the fin beneath the fuselage. These features were intended to improve the field of fire for the observer; the positioning of the fuselage also resulted in the upper wing obscuring less of the pilot&#x27;s field of view. The crew positions were placed as close together as possible, to help communication between the pilot and observer.

Before either the R.2A or R.2B could be built, the new 190 hp (142 kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon inline engine became available. Barnwell drafted a third revision of his design around the new engine, with its decidedly superior power/weight ratio. The anticipated improvement in performance changed the emphasis in its intended operational use; it was now seen as a replacement for the F.E.2d and Sopwith 1½ Strutter two-seat fighters, rather than a competitor with the pedestrian reconnaissance designs that were to replace the B.E.2. The resulting Type 12 F.2A, was a two-bay equal-span biplane, closely based on the R.2A and R.2B designs.

===Prototypes===

In July 1916, work commenced on the construction of a pair of prototypes; on 28 August 1916, an initial contract was awarded for fifty production aircraft. On 9 September 1916, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, powered by a Falcon I engine. It was fitted with B.E.2d wings (Bristol were major contractors for the type) to save time; its lower wings were attached to an open wing-anchorage frame and had end-plates at the wing roots. On 25 October 1916, the second prototype was completed, powered by a Hispano-Suiza engine and differing from the first prototype in its tail-skid, which was integrated into the base of the rudder.

It was found that the prototype&#x27;s radiator arrangement obscured the pilot&#x27;s field of view and the nose was redesigned around a new circular-shaped frontal radiator in the cowling. Other changes made to the first prototype during flight testing included the elimination of the end-plates from the lower wing roots and the addition of a shallow coaming around the cockpits. Between 16 and 18 October 1916, the type underwent its official trials at the Central Flying School, Upavon, during which it was tested with a four-bladed 9 ft 2 in propeller and a two-bladed 9 ft 8 in propeller. By the time of its arrival at the experimental armament station at Orfordness it had also been fitted with a Scarff ring mounting over the rear cockpit and an Aldis optical sight.

Only 52 F.2A aircraft were manufactured before production began of the definitive model, the F.2B (retrospectively named Bristol Type 14), which first flew on 25 October 1916. The first 150 or so F.2Bs were powered by either the Falcon I or Falcon II engine but the remainder were equipped with the 275 hp (205 kW) Falcon III. The additional power gave the F.2B a advantage in level speed over the F.2A, while it was three minutes faster in a climb to .

===Armament===
The Bristol F.2 Fighter was armed in what had by then become standard for a British two-seater military aircraft: one synchronised fixed, forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun (in this case mounted under the cowling to avoid freezing) and a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun on a Scarff ring over the observer&#x27;s rear cockpit. The F.2B often carried a second Lewis gun on the rear cockpit mounting, although observers found the weight of the twin Lewis gun mounting difficult to handle in the high altitudes at which combat increasingly took place in the last year of the war, many preferring one gun. Attempts were made to add a forward-firing Lewis gun on a Foster mounting or similar on the upper wing either instead of (or with) the Vickers gun. Among other problems this caused interference with the pilot&#x27;s compass, which was mounted on the trailing edge of the upper wing: to minimise this effect the Lewis gun was offset to starboard.

===Alternative engines===
Rolls-Royce aero engines of all types were in short supply, which frustrated plans to increase production to enable the F.2B to become the standard British two-seater, replacing the R.E.8 and F.K.8. Efforts were made to find an available alternative powerplant that was both reliable and sufficiently powerful. The Type 15 was fitted with a 200 hp (150 kW) Sunbeam Arab engine. In expectation of a reduction in performance with the less powerful engine, it was planned to supply the Arab-powered Fighters to the &quot;corps&quot; reconnaissance squadrons, reserving Falcon-powered examples for fighter–reconnaissance operations. The Arab engine was to be fitted to Fighters produced by subcontractors under licence, while Bristol-built Fighters would continue to use the Falcon.

In the event the Arab engine was not a success; it was found to suffer from serious weaknesses in cylinder and crank-chamber design that led, among other faults, to chronic and severe vibration, while the cooling system also required repeated modification. The &quot;Arab Bristol&quot; was never to become a viable combination, in spite of prolonged development. A few Arab-engined Bristols were at the front late in the war but the British reconnaissance squadrons had to soldier on with the R.E.8 and F.K.8 until the end of hostilities. The Type 16 was fitted with a 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine. This worked better than the Arab but there was already a severe shortage of Hispano-Suizas for other types, such as the S.E.5a and the Sopwith Dolphin. The 300 hp (220 kW) version of the Hispano-Suiza, suggested for the Type 17, was not available in quantity before the end of the war.

Other engines tried or suggested for the F.2B were the 200 hp (150 kW) RAF 4d, the 180 hp (130 kW) Wolseley Viper and the 230 hp (170 kW) Siddeley Puma. Trials of the Puma engine were carried out in February 1918; it was found to confer marginally better performance than the Hispano-Suiza and Arab engines but was difficult to install and unreliable. In September 1918, trials of a high-compression model of the Puma were carried out but it was found to have no significant performance benefit and this avenue was not pursued. The Type 22 was a proposed version adapted for a radial or rotary engine, either a 200 hp (150 kW) Salmson radial, a 300 hp (220 kW) ABC Dragonfly radial (Type 22A) or a 230 hp (170 kW) Bentley B.R.2 rotary (Type 22B). The type number was eventually used for the Bristol F.2C Badger, a completely new design.

===The &quot;All-Metal Bristol Fighter&quot;===
The Bristol M.R.1 is often described as an all-metal version of the F.2B but was a new design, although its fuselage was positioned between the upper and lower wing as with the F.2B. Two prototypes were built; the first flew on 23 October 1917, but the M.R.1 never entered mass production.

===American versions===

When the US entered the war, the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps of the United States Army lacked any competitive combat aircraft either in inventory or under construction. On 1 August 1917, General John Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front, issued his personal recommendation for the Bristol Fighter to be built in the United States, leading to plans for the development and production of an American version of the Fighter by the United States Army Engineering Division.

Original proposals for American production had the Hispano-Suiza engine. On 5 September 1917, a F.2B Fighter was delivered to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, United States. Attempts to begin production in the United States floundered due to the decision by Colonel V. E. Clark of the Bolling Commission to redesign the Fighter to be powered by the Liberty L-12 engine. The Liberty was unsuitable for the Bristol, as it was far too heavy and bulky, so that the aircraft was chronically nose-heavy.

A contract for 1,000 aircraft was placed initially with the Fisher Body Corporation then cancelled and reallocated to the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. On 7 December 1917, the order was doubled to 2,000 aircraft. On 25 January 1918, the first aircraft, which was given the name &quot;U.S.A 0-1&quot;, was completed, despite the misgivings of Barnwell, who was not satisfied with some of the modifications made, particularly in the use of the Liberty L-12 engine. According to Bruce, misdirections attributed to Major E. J. Hall of the U.S. Signals Corps had led to roughly 1,400 production drawings produced by Curtiss being rendered obsolete. The reputation of the type was also tarnished by three early crashes, although one had been attributed to pilot error and the other two to faulty workmanship. Only 27 O-1s were completed.

Efforts to change the engine of American-built Bristol Fighters to the more suitable Liberty 8 or the Wright-Hisso came up against political as well as technical problems. By July 1918, the only specimen of the American-built Hispano-Suiza engine had been installed in a Fighter; the combination soon gained the favour of the U.S. Air Board, which suggested to Curtiss that all work on the 400 hp Liberty L-12 version of the aircraft be abandoned in favour of the Hispano-Suiza version. In spite of protests by Curtiss, the contracts for the U.S.A. 0-1 were terminated, leading to only a pair of prototypes and 25 production aircraft out of the planned 2,000 aircraft being constructed.
W. C. Potter, Assistant Director of Aircraft Production, suggested that the original Bristol Fighter should be produced exactly as per Barnwell&#x27;s original design, save for the use of either the Liberty 8 or Hispano-Suiza engine. Potter&#x27;s proposal was overlooked; instead it was decided to produce eight aircraft, four being fitted with the Hispano-Suiza engine, as the Engineering Division USB-1A and four being powered by the Liberty L-8 engine, as the Engineering Division USB-1B; only one each were built.

In 1918, the Dayton-Wright Company designed a modified version, designated as the B-1A or XB-1A which used a 330 hp Wright-Hispano engine in a &quot;new fuselage of wood-veneer monocoque construction&quot;. A later version was designated as the XB-1B and was equipped with the same engine. The XB-1A was armed with a pair of Marlin machine guns at the pilot&#x27;s position while the XB-1B was armed with a pair of Browning machine guns. These aircraft were reportedly intended for use as night observation aircraft. Three prototypes were built by the Engineering division at McCook Field, with a further 44 aircraft built by the Dayton-Wright Company. According to Bruce, despite substantial efforts to differentiate and modify the aircraft&#x27;s design, none of the American-built Fighters performed any better than the original Bristol. While some of the modified versions of the F.2 were used in the US, no American-built Bristol Fighters reached the American Expeditionary Forces in France.

===Postwar developments===
Postwar developments of the F.2B included the F.2B Mk II, a two-seat army co-operation biplane, fitted with desert equipment and a tropical cooling system, which first flew in December 1919, of which 435 were built. The Type 96 Fighter Mk III and Type 96A Fighter Mk VI were structurally strengthened aircraft, of which 50 were built in 1926–1927. Surplus F.2Bs were modified for civilian use. The Bristol Tourer was an F.2B fitted with a Siddeley Puma engine in place of the Falcon and with canopies over the cockpits; The Tourer had a maximum speed of .

==Operational history==

Days prior to Christmas 1916, the first deliveries of production F.2A Fighters were completed, 48 Squadron at Rendcomb being the first operational unit of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to receive the type. On 8 March 1917, 48 Squadron was transferred to France in preparation for action on the Western Front; Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard was keen to get the F.2A Fighter and other new aircraft ready for the Second Battle of Arras, aiming to surprise German forces with a new type, and this led to restriction on its deployment prior to the battle to avoid alerting the Germans.

The first offensive action that involved the F.2A Fighter crossing the frontline occurred on 5 April 1917, which had been timed to coincide with the British offensive at Arras. The very first F.2A patrol of six aircraft from 48 Squadron RFC, led by William Leefe Robinson VC, ran into five Albatros D.IIIs from &quot;Jasta&quot; 11 led by Manfred von Richthofen. Four out of the six F.2As were shot down – including that of Robinson, who was captured – and a fifth was badly damaged.

Other early experiences with the F.2A Fighter contributed to doubts over its effectiveness. The month in which the type had been introduced to offensive operations became known as Bloody April; casualties were high throughout the RFC and the Bristol fighter proved to be no exception. Contemporary two-seater aircraft were far less nimble than fighter aircraft, and many types lacked the structural strength to carry out the aggressive manoeuvres needed for dogfighting. The first &quot;Brisfit&quot; aircrews were accustomed to the standard doctrine of maintaining formation and using the crossfire of the observers&#x27; guns to counter enemy fighter aircraft.


From May 1917 onwards, the definitive F.2B Fighter quickly supplanted the earlier F.2A model. In July 1917, the War Office decided to adopt the F.2B Fighter as the equipment of all fighter-reconnaissance squadrons, leading to a significant increase in production. Despite the issuing of contracts for further large batches of aircraft, it was apparent that the rate of production could not keep up with demand for the type.

Perhaps one of the best known flying aces to use the type was Canadian Andrew McKeever, and his regular observer L. F. Powell. By the end of 1917 McKeever had accumulated 30 victories and Powell had achieved eight, while operating the Fighter. McKeever later became a flying instructor stationed in England before becoming the commanding officer of 1 Squadron of the new Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), where he continued to use the Fighter as his personal aircraft, which was later transferred to Canada.
Near the end of the war, the Bristol Fighter was used in a pioneering new capability in the form of radio communications; 11 Squadron was the first such squadron to be equipped. Only the flight commander&#x27;s Fighter would be equipped with a transmitter while others were outfitted with receivers, allowing for one-way communication of orders; as the trailing aerials employed needed to be wound in prior to aerial combat, this requirement reduced the usefulness of the system. The Fighter also participated in experiments held by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) into the use of parachutes, resulting in several aircraft being modified to carry static-line parachutes within the underside of the fuselage; these trials continued following the signing of the Armistice.

In September and October 1917, orders for 1,600 F.2B Fighters were placed; by the end of the First World War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had a total of 1,583 F.2Bs in squadron service; it was in service with six reconnaissance squadrons stationed in France and five Home Defence squadrons, while further squadrons operated the type in the Middle East and Italy. In total, 5,329 aircraft were eventually constructed, mostly by Bristol but also by Standard Motors, Armstrong Whitworth and even the Cunard Steamship Company. According to Bruce, by the time of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the &quot;Bristol Fighter ended the war supreme in its class&quot;.

===Postwar===
Following the end of the war, the F.2B Fighter was soon adopted by the RAF as its standard army cooperation machine. The type continued to operate in army cooperation and light bombing roles in the British Empire, in particular the Middle East and India. In line with this role, which led to its use in a hot climate, Bristol introduced models of the Fighter equipped with &#x27;tropical&#x27; radiators and provision for desert equipment. There had also been considerations made into deploying the Fighter as a carrier-based aircraft, which led to an engineless airframe participating in immersion trials in November 1918 and an aircraft being used in deck landing tests, reportedly on board .

It was not until 1932 that the F.2B was withdrawn from RAF service, the last &quot;Brisfit&quot; unit being 20 Squadron stationed in India. The type lasted a further three years in New Zealand. Surplus aircraft were allocated to ADC Aircraft, a British company established to act as a seller for wartime aircraft, which passed on large quantities of Fighters to other nations, normally to military operators. Bristol also continued to manufacture and refurbish the type for some time. During the 1920s Bristol proceeded to develop and introduce numerous variants and derivatives of the Fighter, typically capable of carrying higher loads, with revised tail units and strengthened undercarriages.

The F.2B Fighter was adopted by the New Zealand Permanent Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as well as by the air forces of Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Greece, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Spain and Sweden. According to Bruce, relatively few Fighters entered service with the air forces of the various Commonwealth nations, greater quantities having been sold to other nations. Belgium purchased several from ADC Aircraft, and later arranged to produce the Fighter under licence at Sociétés Anonyme Belge de Constructions Aéronautiques (SABCA).

In 1920 Poland bought 106 Bristol Fighters (104 with Hispano-Suiza 300 hp/220 kW engines, two with Falcon IIIs) (other sources claim 107). Thus it became the second largest user of this type. It was also one of the most numerous Polish aircraft at that time. Forty Fighters were used during the Polish-Soviet War from July 1920, among others in the Battle of Warsaw, performing reconnaissance and close air support. The rest of the order became operational only after the end of hostilities. During the war, a pair were shot down by ground fire, while another was captured by the Soviets and several more were lost in crashes. Survivors of the conflict continued in Polish service in the reconnaissance and training roles until 1932.

==Survivors==
There were three airworthy Bristol Fighters in 2007 (and several replicas):
* The Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden, Biggleswade, Beds., UK owns F.2B Fighter, serial number &quot;D8096&quot;, that still flies during the British summer.
* The Canada Aviation and Space Museum, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, owns a second example, &quot;D7889&quot;.
* The New Zealand film director Peter Jackson owns &quot;D8084&quot;, which flies from the Hood Aerodrome, in Masterson. The Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre, at Omaka Aerodrome, Blenheim holds a second, original fuselage.
Substantially original aircraft are on static display at the:
* Royal Air Force Museum London, UK - serial number &quot;E2466&quot; (BAPC.165)
* Imperial War Museum Duxford, UK - serial number &quot;E2581&quot; 
* Museo del Aire, Madrid, Spain - serial number &quot;B.21&quot;
* Musée Royal de l&#x27;Armée, Brussels, Belgium - Type 17, &quot;66&quot;
* Polish Aviation Museum, Kraków - serial number &quot;H1279&quot; / 20.48

Restorations of original airframes include:
* A fuselage being rebuilt into a flyable aircraft by the Ross Walton Family Collection, Bardstown, Kentucky, USA.
* In 2016, Aerospace Bristol, Filton Airfield, Bristol, UK, purchased an airframe (BAPC.386) from a private collection in the US for restoration and display in its new museum. This sale was erroneously reported to be from Ross Walton.

In addition, various replicas are operated or displayed in locations around the world, including a full-scale replica F.2B serialled &quot;A7288&quot; (BAPC.387) built by engineers at Rolls-Royce, Airbus and GKN Aerospace-Filton in 2010 in celebration of 100 years of aircraft manufacture at Filton, Bristol, where the original Fighters were designed and built.

<text>Sayyid Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī (Pashto/), also known as Sayyid Jamāl ad-Dīn Asadābādī () and commonly known as Al-Afghani (1838/1839 – 9 March 1897), was a political activist and Islamic ideologist who travelled throughout the Muslim world during the late 19th century. He is one of the founders of Islamic Modernism as well as an advocate of Pan-Islamic unity in India against the British. He has been described as having been less interested in minor differences in Islamic jurisprudence than he was in organizing a united response to Western pressure. He is also known for his involvement with his follower Mirza Reza Kermani in the successful plot to assassinate Shah Naser-al-Din, whom Afghani considered to be making too many concessions to foreign powers, especially the British Empire.

==Early life and origin==
As indicated by his nisba, al-Afghani claimed to be of Afghan origin. His true national and sectarian background has been a subject of controversy. According to one theory and his own account, he was born in Asadabad, Afghanistan, near Kabul. Another theory, championed by Nikki Keddie and accepted by several modern scholars, holds that he was born and raised in a Shia family in Asadabad, Iran near Hamadan. Supporters of the latter theory view his claim to an Afghan origin as motivated by a desire to gain influence among Sunni Muslims or escape oppression by the Iranian emperor Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. One of his main rivals, was Shaykh Yusuf al-Nabhani and another was Shaykh Abu al-Huda al-Sayyadi, who called him &quot;Mutaʾafghin&quot; (&quot;the one who claims to be Afghan&quot;) and tried to expose his Twelver Shi&#x27;a roots. Keddie also asserts that al-Afghani practiced taqiyya, which was more prevalent in the Twelver world.

He was educated first at home and then taken by his father for further education to Qazvin, to Tehran, and finally, while he was still a youth, to the Twelver shrine cities in Ottoman Iraq. It is thought that followers of the Twelver revivalist Shaykh Ahmad influenced him. Other names adopted by al-Afghani were &quot;al-Kābulī&quot; (&quot;[the one] from Kabul&quot;) &quot;Asadābādī&quot;, &quot;Sadat-e Kunar&quot; (&quot;Sayyids of Kunar&quot;) and &quot;Hussain&quot;. Especially in writings published in Afghanistan, he also used the pseudonym &quot;al-Rūmī&quot; &quot;the Anatolian&quot;.

==Political activism==
At the age of 17 or 18 in 1856–57, Al-Afghani traveled to British India and spent several years there studying religions. In 1859, a British spy reported that Al-Afghani was possible Russian agent. The British representatives reported that he wore the traditional clothes of the Nogais of Central Asia and spoke Persian, Arabic and Turkish fluently.

After this first Indian tour, he decided to perform the Hajj. His first documents are dated from Fall 1865, where he mentions leaving the &quot;revered place&quot; (&quot;makān-i Musharraf&quot;) and arriving in Tehran around mid-December of the same year. In the spring of 1866, he left Iran for Afghanistan, passing through Mashhad and Herat.
 He was spotted in Afghanistan in 1866 and spent time in Kandahar, Ghazni, and Kabul.

Reports from the colonial British Indian and Afghan government stated that he was a stranger in Afghanistan and spoke Iranian Persian, following a European lifestyle and not observing Muslim practices, including Ramadan. He became counselor to Mohammad Afzal Khan, the eldest son of the former emir, Dost Mohammad Khan, during his war against his half-brother Sher Ali Khan. He encouraged Muhammad Afzal to turn away from his father&#x27;s British-aligned policy and turn to the Russian Empire for support. In 1868, Sher Ali Khan prevailed against Muhammad Afzal and expelled al-Afghani from the country.

Al-Afghani traveled to Istanbul, passing through India and Cairo on his way there. He stayed in Cairo long enough to meet a young student who would become a devoted disciple of his, Muhammad Abduh. Once in Istanbul, he met with Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha and secured an appointment to the Council of Education. He spoke at the opening of Istanbul University, giving a speech typifying the Modernist spirit animating the ongoing Tanzimat.

However, conservative clerics found his views too radical. The university was closed in 1871 and al-Afghani was expelled. He then moved to the Khedivate of Egypt and began preaching his ideas of political reform. The Egyptian government originally gave him a stipend, but due to his public attacks on France and England, he was exiled to India in August 1879, where he stayed in Hyderabad and Calcutta. He then traveled to Istanbul, London, Paris, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Munich.

While in Egypt, Afghani sought the removal of the ruling regime of Isma&#x27;il Pasha of Egypt, which he viewed as pro-British, and used Freemasonry as an organizational base for his political activities. During this period, Afghani had also considered assassinating Khedive Isma&#x27;il. He perceived Freemasonry as a means of advancing his anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, pan-Islamic causes. Afghani&#x27;s political activities would play a decisive role in overthrowing Isma&#x27;il from the throne and bringing Tewfik Pasha as khedive.

However, local Masons asserted that they were not interested in politics and sought reconciliation with the British Empire. When Afghani was warned that the lodge was not a political platform, he replied, &quot;I have seen a lot of odd things in this country [Egypt], but I would never have thought that cowardice would infiltrate the ranks of masonry to such an extent.&quot; Around 1875 or 1876, an incident wherein Masons lavishly praised a British imperial visitor was a major reason for Afghani&#x27;s quitting of Freemasonry. After realizing the indifference of the Masons and their political subservience to the British Empire, Afghani eventually left Freemasonry.

In 1884, he began publishing an Arabic newspaper in Paris entitled &quot;al-Urwah al-Wuthqa&quot; () with Muhammad Abduh; the title is taken from Quran 2:256. The newspaper called for a return to the original principles and ideals of Islam, and greater unity among Islamic peoples. He argued that this would allow the Islamic community to regain its former strength against European powers.

When al-Afgani was visiting Bushehr in southern Iran in the spring of 1886, planning to pick up books he had shipped there and carry on to Russia, he fell ill. He was invited by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar&#x27;s Minister of Press and Publications to come to Tehran, but fell from favor quite quickly. The Emperor ordered him to be taken to Russia, where al-Afghani spent 1887 to 1889.

From Russia, he traveled to Munich, returning to Iran in late 1889. Due to his political activities, the Shah planned to expel him from Iran, but al-Afghani found out and took sanctuary in the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine near Tehran. After seven months of preaching to admirers from the shrine, he was arrested in 1891, transported to the border with Ottoman Iraq and expelled from Iran. Although Al-Afghani quarreled with most of his patrons, it is said he &quot;reserved his strongest hatred for the Shah,&quot; whom he accused of weakening Islam by granting concessions to Europeans and squandering the money earned thereby. His agitation against the Shah is thought to have been one of the &quot;fountain-heads&quot; of the successful 1891 Tobacco Protest against the grant of a tobacco monopoly to a British company, and the later 1905 Constitutional Revolution.

After Iraq, he went to England in 1891 and 1892. He was later invited by a member of Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s court in 1892 to Istanbul. He traveled there with diplomatic immunity from the British Embassy, which raised many eyebrows, but was granted a house and salary by the Sultan. Abdul Hamid II aimed to use al-Afghani for Pan-Islamist propagation.

While in Istanbul in 1895, al-Afghani was visited by a Persian ex-prisoner, Mirza Reza Kermani, who had been his servant and disciple, and together they planned the assassination of Emperor Naser al-Din of Iran. They both collaborated with Mirza Malkam Khan, the former Qajar envoy to London, in his London-based paper &quot;Qanun&quot; to attack Qajar rule. Kermani later returned to Iran and shot and killed Emperor Naser al-Din on 1 May 1896 while the Emperor was visiting the same shrine al-Afghani had once taken refuge in. Kermani was executed by public hanging in August 1897, but the Iranian government was not successful in extraditing al-Afghani from Turkey. Al-Afghani himself died of cancer the same year a few months before Kermani&#x27;s hanging.

==Political and religious views==
Al-Afghani&#x27;s ideology has been described as a welding of &quot;traditional&quot; religious antipathy toward non-Muslims &quot;to a modern critique of Western imperialism and an appeal for the unity of Islam&quot;, urging the adoption of Western sciences and institutions that might strengthen Islam. According to Muhammad Abduh, Al-Afghani&#x27;s main struggle in life was to decrease British domination of eastern nations and to minimize its power over Muslims.

Al-Afghani&#x27;s friend, the British poet, and Arabophile Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, considered him a liberal, and in some of his writings he equates the parliamentary system to the shura (consultation) system mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. However, his attitude to the constitutional government was ambiguous because he doubted that it was viable in the Islamic world. According to his biographer, he envisioned instead &quot;the overthrow of individual rulers who were lax or subservient to foreigners and their replacement by strong and patriotic men.&quot;

Blunt, Jane Digby and Richard Francis Burton, were close with Emir Abdelkader (1808–1883), an Algerian Islamic scholar, Sufi, and military leader. In 1864, the Lodge &quot;Henry IV&quot; extended an invitation to him to join Freemasonry, which he accepted, being initiated at the Lodge of the Pyramids in Alexandria, Egypt. Blunt had supposedly become a convert to Islam under the influence of al-Afghani and shared his hopes of establishing an Arab Caliphate based in Mecca to replace the Ottoman Sultan in Istanbul. When Blunt visited Abdelkader in 1881, he decided that he was the most promising candidate for caliph, an opinion shared by Afghani and his disciple, Muhammad Abduh.

According to another source Al-Afghani was greatly disappointed by the failure of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and came to three principal conclusions from it:
* that European imperialism, having conquered India, now threatened the Middle East.
* that Asia, including the Middle East, could prevent the onslaught of Western powers only by immediately adopting modern technology like the West.
* that Islam, despite its traditionalism, was an effective creed for mobilizing the public against the imperialists.

Al-Afghani held that Hindus and Muslims should work together to overthrow British rule in India, a view rehashed by Hussain Ahmed Madani in &quot;Composite Nationalism and Islam&quot; five decades later.

He believed that Islam and its revealed law were compatible with rationality and, thus, Muslims could become politically unified while still maintaining their faith based on religious social morality. These beliefs had a profound effect on Muhammad Abduh, who went on to expand on the notion of Mu&#x27;amalat, using rationality in the human relations aspect of Islam.

In 1881 he published a collection of polemics titled &quot;Al-Radd ʻalā al-dahrīyīn&quot; &quot;Refutation of the Materialists&quot;, agitating for pan-Islamic unity against Western imperialism. It included one of the earliest pieces of Islamic thought arguing against Charles Darwin&#x27;s then-recent &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;; however, his arguments allegedly incorrectly caricatured evolutionary biology, provoking criticism that he had not read Darwin&#x27;s writings. In his later work &quot;Khatirat Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani&quot; &quot;The memoir of Al-Afghani&quot;, he accepted the validity of evolution, asserting that the Islamic world had already known and used it. Although he accepted abiogenesis and the evolution of animals, he rejected the theory that the human species is the product of evolution, arguing that humans have souls.

Among the reasons why Al-Afghani was thought to have had a less than deep religious faith was his lack of interest in finding theological common ground between the Shia and the Sunni despite his interest in political unity between the two groups. For example, when he moved to Istanbul he disguised his Twelver Shi&#x27;i background by labeling himself &quot;the Afghan&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Al-Afghani died of cancer of the jaw on 9 March 1897 in Istanbul and was buried there. In late 1944, at the request of the Afghan government, his remains were taken to Afghanistan via British India. His funeral was offered in Peshawar&#x27;s Qissa Khwani Bazaar in front of the Afghan Consulate building. Thereafter, his remains were laid in Kabul inside the Kabul University; a mausoleum was also erected there in his memory. In October 2002, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, Robert Finn, pledged a donation of $25,000 to restore the mausoleum from damage sustained during the civil war. The repairs were completed in 2010.

In Afghanistan, a university is named after him (&quot;Syed Jamaluddin Afghan University&quot;) in Kabul. There is also a street in the center of Kabul which is called by the name Afghani. In other parts of Afghanistan, there are many places like hospitals, schools, Madrasas, Parks, and roads named after Jamaluddin Afghan.

In Peshawar, Pakistan there is a road named after him as well.

In Tehran, the capital of Iran, there is a square and a street named after him (&quot;Asad Abadi Square&quot; and &quot;Asad Abadi Avenue&quot; in Yusef Abad)

===Theosophy===

According to K. Paul Johnson, in &quot;The Masters Revealed&quot;, H.P. Blavatsky&#x27;s masters were real people, and &quot;Serapis Bey&quot; was Jamal Afghani, as a purported leader of an order named the &quot;Brotherhood of Luxor&quot;. Afghani was introduced to the Star of the East Lodge, of which he became the leader, by its founder Raphael Borg, the British consul in Cairo, who was in communication with Blavatsky. Afghani&#x27;s friend, a Jewish-Italian actor from Cairo named James Sanua, who with his girlfriend Lydia Pashkov and their friend Lady Jane Digby were travel companions of Blavatsky. As concluded by Joscelyn Godwin in &quot;The Theosophical Enlightenment&quot;, &quot;If we interpret the &#x27;Brotherhood of Luxor&#x27; to refer to the coterie of esotericists and magicians that Blavatsky knew and worked with in Egypt, then we should probably count Sanua and Jamal ad-Din as members.&quot;

In the early 1860s, he was in Central Asia and the Caucasus when Blavatsky was in Tbilisi. In the late 1860s, he was in Afghanistan until he was expelled and returned to India. He went to Istanbul and was again expelled in 1871 when he proceeded to Cairo, where his circle of disciples was similar to Blavatsky&#x27;s Brotherhood of Luxor. Afghani was forced to leave Egypt and settled in Hyderabad, India, in 1879, the year the Theosophical Society&#x27;s founders arrived in Bombay. He then left India and spent a short time in Egypt before arriving in Paris in 1884. The following year he proceeded to London, and then on to Russia where he collaborated with Blavatsky&#x27;s publisher, Mikhail Katkov.

A photo published by Joscelyn Godwin in &quot;The Kingdom of Agarttha&quot;, shows Afghani posing in the persona of Haji Sharif, who inspired Saint-Yves d&#x27;Alveydre in the legend of Agarttha and synarchy.

==Notes==
:. Some Western academics point out that the term &quot;Pan-Islamism&quot; never existed before al-Afghani. The Arabic term Ummah, which is found in the Quran, however, was historically used to denote the Muslim nation altogether, surpassing race, ethnicity, etc. and this term has been used in a political sense by classical Islamic scholars e.g. such as al-Mawardi in Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah, where he discusses the contract of Imamate of the Ummah, &quot;prescribed to succeed Prophethood&quot; in the protection of the religion and of managing the affairs of the world.

<doc id="946767" wikidata="Q1779749" url="?curid=946767" title="Little Gransden">
<text>Little Gransden is a civil parish and village in South Cambridgeshire, England. In 2001 the population was 262 people, including Waresley and increasing to 296 at the 2011 Census. It is 11 miles (18 km) from Cambridge, on the border with the district of Huntingdonshire. Little Gransden has two airfields, one of which was used in World War II.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name is derived from &#x27;valley of a man named Granta or Grante&#x27;. It was spelled &quot;Grantandene&quot; in 973 and &quot;Grante(s)dene&quot; in the 1086 Domesday book.

Woodland was important in the settlement&#x27;s early history; there was enough to support 60 pigs in 1086. By 1251, a large area of woodland in the south-east of the parish had been split into Hayley Wood and Littlehound Wood (the latter no longer exists, but the shape can still be seen in field boundaries).

Little Gransden village evolved as an offshoot of Great Gransden. The church and manor house of the abbey of Ely face Great Gransden across the low-lying land along Home Dole Brook; the village grew southwards from a street alongside the brook. There were 56 inhabited houses in 1666, but the number had dropped to 38 by 1801. By 1961 there were 84 houses.

Due to its isolated location, there were no inns in the village until 1800, though by the 1840s there were four (the Sun in Church Lane, the Chequers, the Double Chequers at Mill Hill and the Hardwicke Arms). In 1834, the overseer of the poor considered that an excess of beer-houses may have been partly responsible for recent problems. Only the Chequers was left after 1967.

Despite the heaviness of the soil, most of the parish land has been used mainly for arable farming. It was cultivated in three open fields until parliamentary inclosure in 1814. High, flat land in the east of the parish was hard to drain before mechanisation and was usually used for pasture and as the village common. In 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, the area was made into an airfield, called Gransden Lodge Airfield. It was in operational use from 1941 to 1946 but was unoccupied after 1948 and then sold off. Since October 1991 it has been the home of the Cambridge Gliding Centre.

==Governance==
Little Gransden is represented on South Cambridgeshire District Council by one councillor for the Caldecote ward and on Cambridgeshire County Council by one councillor for the Gamlingay electoral division. It is in the parliamentary constituency of South Cambridgeshire, represented at the House of Commons by Anthony Browne.

==Geography==
Little Gransden is 11 miles (18 km) from the county town of Cambridgeshire, 10 miles (16 km) south-east of Huntingdon and 47 miles (76 km) north of London. The village stands on the B1046 road between Abbotsley, to the west, and Longstowe, to the east. A minor road runs south-west to Gamlingay. The district council boundary, marked by the Home Dole Brook, separates Little from Great Gransden. The parish&#x27;s northern boundary follows the line of a stopped-up road between Great Gransden and Longstowe, formerly called Deadwomen&#x27;s Way after Deadwomen&#x27;s Cross at the north-east corner of the parish.

The parish has an area of 1,920 acres (777 hectares) and ranges from 45 metres, along the Home Dole Brook, to more than 80 metres above sea level in the eastern part of Hayley Wood. The soil is light sand and heavy clay, with a subsoil of beds of stone and sand.

==Demography==
At the time of the 2001 census, Little Gransden parish had 262 residents living in 99 households. 98.5% described themselves as White and 1.5% Asian or British Asian. 79.9% said they were Christian, 1.1% followed another religion and 18.9% had no religion or did not state one.

==Landmarks==
The parish has two airfields: Little Gransden Airfield, located at Fuller&#x27;s Hill Farm, which holds an air and car show every summer; and Gransden Lodge, a former Royal Air Force station which saw active service in World War II, but is now a gliding site, its three paved runways having been removed.

A cross in the churchyard commemorates Little Gransden men who were killed in World Wars I and II. There are 16 listed buildings in the village, including the Old Rectory, the parish church and various houses.

==Religious sites==
The parish church, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was built from stone in the 13th Century and comprises a chancel, a nave of four bays, and an embattled western tower containing three bells. In 1858 the chancel was restored and its east end rebuilt; a stained window was put in by the Rev. Alfred Newby, a former rector, in 1875. The church was restored between 1885 and 1888 at a cost of £700.

The parish had its own rector until 1928 when the living was merged with neighbouring Great Gransden. In 1999 the two parishes were merged with those Abbotsley and Waresley to form a united benefice that is now known as the Bluebell Benefice.

<text>Paul H. Cress (1939–2004) was a Canadian computer scientist.

He was a young lecturer in computer science at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) when, starting in 1966, he and his colleague Paul Dirksen led a team of programmers developing a fast Fortran programming language compiler called WATFOR (WATerloo FORtran), for the IBM System/360 family of computers. The /360 WATFOR project was initiated by Professor J. Wesley Graham, following the successful implementation in 1965 of a WATFOR compiler for the IBM 7040 computer. An enhanced version of the /360 WATFOR compiler was called WATFIV, variously interpreted to mean &quot;WATerloo Fortran IV&quot; or &quot;WATFOR-plus-one&quot;.

WATFOR and WATFIV made Fortran programming accessible to university students and researchers and even high schoolers, and largely established Waterloo&#x27;s early reputation as a centre for software and Computer Science research. In 1972, Cress and Dirksen were joint winners of the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery, &quot;For the creation of the WATFOR Compiler, the first member of a powerful new family of diagnostic and educational programming tools.&quot; 
Cress died August 20, 2004, aged 65.

<text>Lee Quincy Calhoun (February 23, 1933 – June 21, 1989) was an American athlete, a double winner of 110 m hurdles at the Olympic Games.

==Biography==
Born in Laurel, Mississippi, Lee Calhoun graduated from Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana before representing North Carolina Central University, won the NCAA 120 yd hurdles in 1956 and 1957. He also won the AAU championships in 110 m hurdles in 1956 and 1959 and in 120 yd hurdles in 1957.

At the 1956 Summer Olympics Calhoun surprisingly improved his personal best in 110 m by almost a full second in a final. He ran 13.5 to win the gold medal, edging teammate Jack Davis with a lunge that just got his shoulder across the line in front. He had learned the maneuver from Davis.

Calhoun was suspended in 1958 for receiving gifts on &quot;Bride and Groom&quot;, a television game show, and seemed to be past his prime for the 1960 Summer Olympics. But shortly before the Rome Olympics, he tied the world record of 13.2 and went to the Olympic Games as a main favourite. In the final, he won in 13.98, beating teammate Willie May by 0.01 seconds.

After retiring from competition, he became a college track coach, first at Grambling State University, then at Yale, and finally at Western Illinois University. He was an assistant Olympic coach at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

He was elected to the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1974.

Lee Calhoun died in Erie, Pennsylvania, aged 56.

<doc id="946793" wikidata="Q120477" url="?curid=946793" title="John Scolvus">
<text>John Scolvus or John of Kolno may have been a navigator of the late 15th century. According to some sources he was among a group of early Europeans to reach the shores of the Americas prior to Columbus, arriving in 1476 as steersman of Didrik Pining, although this view is not supported by contemporary evidence; as he is not mentioned contemporaneously, his identity and even existence have been disputed.

==Pining expedition==
It has been claimed that in the 1470s, a fleet of several Danish ships sponsored by Christian I of Denmark set sail from Norway westwards to Greenland. There was such a fleet in 1473 or 1476, commanded by John of Kolno, supposedly a Polish navigator at the service of the king of Denmark. According to speculations lacking surviving written evidence, the fleet was commanded by two Baltic sailors and pirate hunters, Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst and possibly also included the Portuguese João Vaz Corte-Real on one of the journeys. It has been claimed that from the Western coast of Greenland they may have reached the North American mainland. The story cannot be verified today, since the only surviving records tell us that Pothorst and Pining saw a &quot;rocky island called Hvitsark, halfway between Iceland and Greenland&quot; in 1494, as described by Samuel Eliot Morison in his &quot;The European Discovery of America, The Northern Voyages&quot;. John of Kolno (&quot;Jan z Kolna&quot; in Polish, eventually &quot;Jan Scolvo&quot;) by contrast, was a navigator who led a Danish fleet to the coast of Labrador in 1476, or even 1473, according to one source, at the command of Christian I of Denmark.

==Sources for his alleged existence==
It is not certain if John Scolvus really existed and whether he reached America aboard these ships. All sources mentioning him were written long afterwards. Some evidence may suggest that Scolvus did exist and sailed to some location in the North Atlantic. Primarily, a 1536 globe of cartographer Gemma Frisius depicts an area within the Arctic Circle, north of a strait dividing &quot;Terra Corterealis&quot; and &quot;Baccalearum Regio&quot; from the westward projection of Greenland. Within this area is the inscription, &quot;Quij, the people to whom Joes Scoluss, a Dane, penetrated about the year 1476.&quot; According to the Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador &quot;Based on study of toponymy and cartography, most scholars have concluded that Scolvus visited Greenland and not Labrador.&quot; (Friseus’ knowledge of Labrador may have come from Portuguese sources). DCB /. acb

Spanish author Francisco López de Gómara wrote in his &quot;Historia de las Indias&quot; (1553) about la Tierra de Labrador; &quot;Hither also came men from Norway with the pilot [navigator] Joan Scoluo, and Englishmen with Sebastian [should be John] Gaboto.&quot; (In the sixteenth century, Greenland is known to have been referred to as &quot;Labrador&quot; by south European sources). Gómara had supposedly met Olaus Magnus in Bologna and Venice, perhaps in 1548. This suggests that the source of the statement about &quot;Joan Scoluo&quot; may have been him.

Another possible reference to John Scolvus visiting Labrador is a document prepared in about 1575 for the first voyage of Martin Frobisher. After stating that Sebastian (should be John) &quot;Cabotte&quot; was sent out by King Henry VII in 1496 (should be 1497) to find the passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and that &quot;one Caspar Cortesreales, a pilot of Portingale&quot;, had visited these islands on the north coast of North America in 1500, the document continues:
&quot;But to find oute the passage oute of the North Sea into the Southe we must sayle to the 60 degree, that is, from 66 unto 68. And this passage is called the Narowe Sea or Streicte of the three Brethren [i.e., the three brothers Corte-Real]; in which passage, at no tyme in the yere, is ise wonte to be found. The cause is the swifte ronnyng downe of sea into sea. In the north side of this passage, John Scolus, a pilot of Denmerke, was in anno 1476.&quot; While further containing complete impossibilities, the text also contain statements that have a sure historical foundation, like the voyage of Gaspar Corte-Real.

On an English map from 1582 by Michael Lok, there is a country to the north-west of Greenland, on which is written: &quot;Jac. Scolvus Croetland&quot;. The corresponding country on Mercator&#x27;s map of 1569 is &quot;Croclant, island whose inhabitants are Swedes by descent&quot;.

In 1597, the Brabanter Cornelius Wytfliet wrote in his &quot;Continens Indica&quot; that the northern parts of America were first discovered by &quot;Frislandish&quot; fishermen, and later were further explored about 1390 by the Zeno brothers. He further writes; &quot;but the honour of its second discovery fell to the Pole Johannes Scoluus (&quot;Johannes Scoluus Polonus&quot;), who in the year 1476 — eighty-six years after its first discovery — sailed beyond Norway, Greenland, Frisland, penetrated the Northern Strait, under the very Arctic Circle, and arrived at the country of Labrador and Estotiland&quot;. It has been suggested that &quot;Polonus&quot; was a misreading of &quot;piloto&quot; from the earlier account by Gomara which Wytfliet&#x27;s writings is thought to have relied on.

On the L&#x27;Ecuy globe, of the sixteenth century, it is written in Latin that between 70° and 80° N. lat. and in long. &quot;These are the people to whom the Dane Johannes Scowus penetrated in the year 1476.&quot; The description of Scolvus as a Dane may indicate the same source as the English mention of him in 1576.

Generally, the later sources about Scolvus are less reliable, since the writers probably read the earlier accounts and more or less copied from them.

==Speculations==
Some historians have variously described Scolvus as a Norwegian pilot, Catalan corsair, Welsh shipmaster and Polish navigator. Such claims have been criticised as being opportunistic in nature. Some writers (initially Peruvian librarian Louis Ulloa in 1934) have even speculated that &quot;Johannes Scolvus&quot; may have been the young Christopher Columbus, and others that he is identical with Hans Pothorst or João Vaz Corte-Real.

Polish historian and cartographer Joachim Lelewel (1786 - 1861) was the first to gather all available mentions of Johannes Scolnus. He quoted a source from 1570 by François de Belleforest, a source from 1599 by Wytfliet, and another from 1671 which claimed that Scolvus was Polish. Lelewel claimed that his name was really &quot;Jan z Kolna&quot; (), and was the navigator of the Danish fleet. He also found mentions of a &quot;Joannis de Colno&quot; who studied at the Krakow Academy in 1455, and a Colno or Cholno family of merchants and sailors living in Danzig.

====Criticisms====
Bolesław Olszewicz, a modern historian who has criticized Lelewel, argues there is not enough evidence to prove that Scolvus was actually Polish. Most of the works that mention Johannes Scolvus were published more than a century after the voyage and no contemporary evidence has been found.

As early as 1911, Fridtjof Nansen had speculated in his study &quot;Northern Mist&quot; that &quot;Pilotus&quot; (pilot) had been misread as &quot;Polonus&quot; (Polish).

<text>Nayland is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Nayland-with-Wissington, in the Babergh district, in the county of Suffolk, England. It is in the Stour Valley on the Suffolk side of the border between Suffolk and Essex. In 2011 the built-up area had a population of 938.

==History==

&quot;From an article by Rosemary Knox, Wissington&quot;

Nayland village and the adjoining rural hamlet of Wissington (these days usually called &#x27;Wiston&#x27;), were originally two separate parishes; on 25 March 1884 they were united into one civil parish, Nayland-with-Wissington, although the two ecclesiastical parishes remain separate. In 1881 the civil parish had a population of 901.

Nayland and Wiston lie on the northern bank of the River Stour, which divides Essex and Suffolk. Originally they were two different parishes with different histories. The name Nayland means an island, and the village developed on the higher ground amidst the lower river flood plain. It provided a good place for both a safe crossing of the river and an early manorial centre, probably a wooden castle. These advantages brought a market by 1227 and, by the late Middle Ages, it was a successful small town. The owners of the manor moved away and the little town was ruled by its cloth merchants, many of whom were very well off by the standards of the day. They were surpassed in wealth only by the merchants of Lavenham and Long Melford. They built fine Tudor houses and a fine church and the prosperity continued into the beginning of the seventeenth century. From then on the cloth trade began to move away, and although other trades like leather and soap manufacture developed, Nayland came to rely mainly on being a centre of commerce for the surrounding countryside. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the village drifted gently on, a relative backwater. The navigation on the river opened up but it did not bring a large increase in trade and the Navigation Company struggled to survive. The good result of this period of partial stagnation was that relative poverty prevented the beautiful old houses being knocked down to provide smart new homes and thus Nayland still possesses its Tudor and Stuart streets.

Nayland did have a small agricultural area but most of it lay out in the middle of the parish of Wiston and is nowadays considered to be part of Wiston. Although the official name for Wiston is Wissington, early documents suggest that Wiston is the original name, and it is certainly the one the local people always use. It had been a part of the manor of Nayland in 1066 but by 1087 had been given to a separate Norman family who lived across the river in Essex at Little Horkesley. From then on the history of the two places diverged. Wiston was administered from over the river and its links were with Little Horkesley rather than Nayland. The Lords of the Manor built the little Norman church, which still survives as a separate parish church, and they ran their estates in Wiston in conjunction with their land in Essex. The early wills and the taxation lists which still exist show only farmers in Wiston, and it remained purely an agricultural parish until the end of the nineteenth century. The manor was sold to more distant owners and the old manorial tenements became copyholds and then freehold farms.

The village and the surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, was a hotbed of Puritan sentiment during much of the 17th century. At least as early as 1629, parishioners such as Gregory Stone were censured for not kneeling at communion. By the mid-1630s, the Stone family and others had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the wave of emigration that occurred during the Great Migration.

In 1883 the new West Suffolk county council decided that the two strangely divided civil parishes should be joined as Nayland with Wissington, a process which Wiston resented but could not prevent. The needs of the two parts of parish, part semi urban, part agricultural, still make a slightly uneasy union. The Nayland with Wissington Parish Council was created in 1894 as a result of the Local Government Act of that year.

But Wiston had not disappeared. In 1896 Dr Jane Walker bought two farms (both technically in Nayland) and founded the East Anglian Sanatorium. This opened in 1901 for private patients and soon a lower block for free patients was added. A children&#x27;s block was also built. The writer George Gissing found himself as a patient here for a couple of months in 1901 and the Canadian artist Emily Carr was a patient for over a year in 1903–1904. The Sanatorium continued to treat TB until that disease was conquered in the 1950s, when it closed. The lower block was sold off for housing and the upper block became a hospital for the mentally handicapped. While they functioned, the Sanatorium and the hospital were the centre of Wiston, as they provided most of the local employment. In 1991 the hospital itself closed under &#x27;Care in the Community&#x27;. The original &#x27;arts and crafts&#x27; Sanatorium, designed by Smith and Brewer, became a listed building and was converted into eight houses, while the rest was knocked down and replaced by another eight houses. Wiston still has seven working farms, six being old Wiston farms and one an old Nayland holding, while the other small farms and smallholdings have been absorbed into the bigger ones, leaving it still predominantly agricultural. The mechanisation of farming has, however, cut the need for workers dramatically, so that most of the residents of Wiston now work either at home or elsewhere.

==Nayland today==
The parish of Nayland-with-Wissington is in the district of Babergh and the parliamentary constituency of South Suffolk. It has a population of 938 and is situated in the Dedham Vale, an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the River Stour, the boundary between Suffolk and Essex. It was bypassed in 1969 by the A134 road which links Colchester, six miles south of Nayland, to Sudbury, to its north.

There are 15th-century buildings in the village, Alston Court being one of these (see image) which also contains a 13th-century section.

The parish church of St James is a Grade I listed building. It contains a famous painting, &quot;Christ Blessing the Bread and Wine&quot; (1809), by John Constable.

Littlegarth School has been located at Horkesley Park, Nayland, since 1994.

There is also a small airfield with grass runways suitable for landing small planes. The runways, number of takeoffs and landings, and plane types are limited, however, by planning restrictions.

<text>Entity integrity is concerned with ensuring that each row of a table has a unique and non-null primary key value; this is the same as saying that each row in a table represents a single instance of the entity type modelled by the table. A requirement of E. F. Codd in his seminal paper is that a primary key of an entity, or any part of it, can never take a null value.
The relational model states that every relation (or table) must have an identifier, called the primary key (abbreviated PK), in such a way that every row of the same relation be identifiable by its content, that is, by a unique and minimal value. The PK is a not empty set of attributes (or columns). The same format applies to the foreign key (abbreviated FK) because each FK matches a preexistent PK. Each of attributes being part of a PK (or of a FK) must have data values (such as numbers, letters or typographic symbols) but not data marks (also known as NULL marks in SQL world). 
Morphologically, a composite primary key is in a &quot;steady state&quot;: If it is reduced, PK will lose its property of identifying every row of its relation but if it is extended, PK will be redundant.

<doc id="946812" wikidata="Q1975416" url="?curid=946812" title="Systematic risk">
<text>In finance and economics, systematic risk (in economics often called aggregate risk or undiversifiable risk) is vulnerability to events which affect aggregate outcomes such as broad market returns, total economy-wide resource holdings, or aggregate income. In many contexts, events like earthquakes, epidemics and major weather catastrophes pose aggregate risks that affect not only the distribution but also the total amount of resources. That is why it is also known as contingent risk, unplanned risk or risk events. If every possible outcome of a stochastic economic process is characterized by the same aggregate result (but potentially different distributional outcomes), the process then has no aggregate risk.

==Properties==

Systematic or aggregate risk arises from market structure or dynamics which produce shocks or uncertainty faced by all agents in the market; such shocks could arise from government policy, international economic forces, or acts of nature. In contrast, specific risk (sometimes called residual risk, unsystematic risk, or idiosyncratic risk) is risk to which only specific agents or industries are vulnerable (and is uncorrelated with broad market returns). Due to the idiosyncratic nature of unsystematic risk, it can be reduced or eliminated through diversification; but since all market actors are vulnerable to systematic risk, it cannot be limited through diversification (but it may be insurable). As a result, assets whose returns are negatively correlated with broader market returns command higher prices than assets not possessing this property.

In some cases, aggregate risk exists due to institutional or other constraints on market completeness. For countries or regions lacking access to broad hedging markets, events like earthquakes and adverse weather shocks can also act as costly aggregate risks. Robert Shiller has found that, despite the globalization progress of recent decades, country-level aggregate income risks are still significant and could potentially be reduced through the creation of better global hedging markets (thereby potentially becoming idiosyncratic, rather than aggregate, risks). Specifically, Shiller advocated for the creation of macro futures markets. The benefits of such a mechanism would depend on the degree to which macro conditions are correlated across countries.

==In finance==

Systematic risk plays an important role in portfolio allocation. Risk which cannot be eliminated through diversification commands returns in excess of the risk-free rate (while idiosyncratic risk does not command such returns since it can be diversified). Over the long run, a well-diversified portfolio provides returns which correspond with its exposure to systematic risk; investors face a trade-off between expected returns and systematic risk. Therefore, an investor&#x27;s desired returns correspond with their desired exposure to systematic risk and corresponding asset selection. Investors can only reduce a portfolio&#x27;s exposure to systematic risk by sacrificing expected returns.

An important concept for evaluating an asset&#x27;s exposure to systematic risk is beta. Since beta indicates the degree to which an asset&#x27;s return is correlated with broader market outcomes, it is simply an indicator of an asset&#x27;s vulnerability to systematic risk. Hence, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) directly ties an asset&#x27;s equilibrium price to its exposure to systematic risk.

===A simple example===

Consider an investor who purchases stock in many firms from most global industries. This investor is vulnerable to systematic risk but has diversified away the effects of idiosyncratic risks on his portfolio value; further reduction in risk would require him to acquire risk-free assets with lower returns (such as U.S. Treasury securities). On the other hand, an investor who invests all of his money in one industry whose returns are typically uncorrelated with broad market outcomes (beta close to zero) has limited his exposure to systematic risk but, due to lack of diversification, is highly vulnerable to idiosyncratic risk.

==In economics==

Aggregate risk can be generated by a variety of sources. Fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policy can all be sources of aggregate risk. In some cases, shocks from phenomena like weather and natural disaster can pose aggregate risks. Small economies can also be subject to aggregate risks generated by international conditions such as terms of trade shocks.

Aggregate risk has potentially large implications for economic growth. For example, in the presence of credit rationing, aggregate risk can cause bank failures and hinder capital accumulation. Banks may respond to increases in profitability-threatening aggregate risk by raising standards for quality and quantity credit rationing to reduce monitoring costs; but the practice of lending to small numbers of borrowers reduces the diversification of bank portfolios (concentration risk) while also denying credit to some potentially productive firms or industries. As a result, capital accumulation and the overall productivity level of the economy can decline.

In economic modeling, model outcomes depend heavily on the nature of risk. Modelers often incorporate aggregate risk through shocks to endowments (budget constraints), productivity, monetary policy, or external factors like terms of trade. Idiosyncratic risks can be introduced through mechanisms like individual labor productivity shocks; if agents possess the ability to trade assets and lack borrowing constraints, the welfare effects of idiosyncratic risks are minor. The welfare costs of aggregate risk, though, can be significant.

Under some conditions, aggregate risk can arise from the aggregation of micro shocks to individual agents. This can be the case in models with many agents and strategic complementarities; situations with such characteristics include: innovation, search and trading, production in the presence of input complementarities, and information sharing. Such situations can generate aggregate data which are empirically indistinguishable from a data-generating process with aggregate shocks.

===Example: Arrow–Debreu equilibrium===

The following example is from Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995). Consider a simple exchange economy with two identical agents, one (divisible) good, and two potential states of the world (which occur with some probability). Each agent has expected utility in the form formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3 are the probabilities of states 1 and 2 occurring, respectively. In state 1, agent 1 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 2 is endowed with nothing. In state 2, agent 2 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 1 is endowed with nothing. That is, denoting the vector of endowments in state &quot;i&quot; as formula_4 we have formula_5, formula_6. Then the aggregate endowment of this economy is one good regardless of which state is realized; that is, the economy has no aggregate risk. It can be shown that, if agents are allowed to make trades, the ratio of the price of a claim on the good in state 1 to the price of a claim on the good in state 2 is equal to the ratios of their respective probabilities of occurrence (and, hence, the marginal rates of substitution of each agent are also equal to this ratio). That is, formula_7. If allowed to do so, agents make trades such that their consumption is equal in either state of the world.

Now consider an example with aggregate risk. The economy is the same as that described above except for endowments: in state 1, agent 1 is endowed two units of the good while agent 2 still receives zero units; and in state 2, agent 2 still receives one unit of the good while agent 1 receives nothing. That is, formula_8, formula_6. Now, if state 1 is realized, the aggregate endowment is 2 units; but if state 2 is realized, the aggregate endowment is only 1 unit; this economy is subject to aggregate risk. Agents cannot fully insure and guarantee the same consumption in either state. It can be shown that, in this case, the price ratio will be less than the ratio of probabilities of the two states: formula_10, so formula_11. Thus, for example, if the two states occur with equal probabilities, then formula_12. This is the well-known finance result that the contingent claim that delivers more resources in the state of low market returns has a higher price.

===In heterogeneous agent models===

While the inclusion of aggregate risk is common in macroeconomic models, considerable challenges arise when researchers attempt to incorporate aggregate uncertainty into models with heterogeneous agents. In this case, the entire distribution of allocational outcomes is a state variable which must be carried across periods. This gives rise to the well-known curse of dimensionality. One approach to the dilemma is to let agents ignore attributes of the aggregate distribution, justifying this assumption by referring to bounded rationality. Den Haan (2010) evaluates several algorithms which have been applied to solving the Krusell and Smith (1998) model, showing that solution accuracy can depend heavily on solution method. Researchers should carefully consider the results of accuracy tests while choosing solution methods and pay particular attention to grid selection.

==In projects==

Systematic risk exists in projects and is called the overall project risk bred by the combined effect of uncertainty in external environmental factors such as PESTLE, VUCA, etc. It is also called contingent or unplanned risk or simply uncertainty because it is of unknown likelihood and unknown impact. In contrast, systemic risk is known as the individual project risk, caused by internal factors or attributes of the project system or culture. This is also known as inherent, planned, event or condition risk caused by known unknowns such as variability or ambiguity of impact but 100% probability of occurrence. Both systemic and systematic risks are residual risk.

<text>The IJ (; sometimes shown on old maps as &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;Ye&quot;) is a body of water, formerly a bay, in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is known for being Amsterdam&#x27;s waterfront.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;IJ&quot; is derived from the West Frisian word &quot;ie&quot;, alternatively spelled &quot;ije&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27; and cognate with the English word &quot;&quot;. The name consists of the digraph &quot;ij&quot; which is capitalized as &quot;IJ&quot;.

==Geography==

Today, the IJ is divided into two parts: 
* To the west of the Oranjesluizen (Oranje Locks), the Binnen-IJ (inner IJ), or Afgesloten-IJ (closed IJ), is directly connected to the North Sea Canal, where the port of IJmuiden and the North Sea can be reached.
* To the east of the Oranjesluizen, the Buiten-IJ (outer IJ) is an extension of the IJmeer which is itself an extension of the Markermeer.
The IJ is connected to the North Sea to the west and the IJmeer to the east by a set of locks.

==History==


There are several theories about the origins of the IJ. Perhaps it began as a stream, following a breakthrough in the dunes of Castricum.
More likely, the IJ is a remnant of a northern arm of the Rhine delta.
Finally, the IJ could also come from the lake Almere or Flevo.
During the Roman period the IJ connected on one side with lake Flevo and the Vecht (Utrecht) and the other with the North Sea. Connection with the North Sea has subsequently disappeared, while the IJ in the Middle Ages has expanded. This is due to the emergence of the Zuiderzee, itself a bay of the North Sea resulting from a number of storms.

At the end of the Middle Ages, the IJ was a long and narrow brackish bay that connected to the Zuiderzee and stretched from Amsterdam in the east to Velsen in the west. At its west end, only the natural dune ridge across the Dutch North Sea coast prevented the IJ, which grew ever larger through the centuries, from directly connecting to the North Sea and so making the North Holland peninsula nearly an island. By the seventeenth century, however, access to the IJ became difficult due to sand bars across its mouth, and ships becoming bigger, and it was nearly impossible for seafaring vessels to reach the city of Amsterdam. At the same time, the bay gnawed away at the surrounding farmlands, almost connecting with the Haarlemmermeer (Lake Haarlem) and seriously threatening the cities of Haarlem and Amsterdam.

Plans were put forth to reclaim both the Haarlemmermeer and the IJ and turn them into polders. The Haarlemmermeer was first, falling dry in 1852, and the largest part of the IJ followed suit between 1865 and 1876, with only a small lake remaining at Amsterdam that was closed off from the Zuiderzee by the Oranje locks. At the same time, the North Sea Canal was constructed in the former IJ basin to provide Amsterdam with access to the sea again and revive its ailing port. It cut through the isthmus to connect to the North Sea near the town of Velsen; a new port, IJmuiden (&quot;IJ&#x27;s mouth&quot;) was built at its west end. The east end of the IJ polders near Amsterdam was given over to industry, and a large new seaport area was constructed.

The Buiten-IJ hosted the mixed dinghy sailing events for the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighboring Amsterdam. It also hosted two events for the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.

In 2018 a German Luftmine (Wohnblockknacker) was found in the river and safely detonated by the Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie (EOD).

The nautical event SAIL Amsterdam takes place on and around the IJ.

<text>ActRaiser 2 is a side-scrolling platform game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Quintet and published by Enix in 1993.

The game is a sequel to the original &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, but the storyline is not directly connected to its predecessor. Otherwise, the given story draws concepts from the famous religious epics &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

Unlike the original game, which alternately combined platform game sequences and god game sequences, &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot; is only a platform game.

== Gameplay ==

Gameplay for &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot; consists primarily of side-scrolling platform action, similar to the &quot;Professional!&quot;/&quot;Action&quot; mode from the original game, while completely removing the city building simulation. The player, assuming the role of the &quot;Master&quot; (still referred to as &quot;God&quot; in the Japanese version), controls a floating palace to inspect the people of the world below. After hearing their plight, the Master descends to the world below to fight the monsters and rid the land of evil. Like the original, each area contains two &quot;acts&quot;; the first act of an area consists of monsters spawned from a lesser demon named after an unfavorable condition, while the second act consists of monsters spawned from the primary evil, named after one of the seven deadly sins, with heightened challenge and peril.

The side-scrolling action for &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot; is more advanced than its predecessor. Controlling the Master, who now has a full set of functional wings, the player must navigate through dungeons and avoid certain perils by jumping, flying, falling, and floating to platforms. Armed only with a sword, and a shield which can deflect some attacks, the Master becomes heavily dependent upon magic. Magic is executed by holding down the designated button to &quot;charge up&quot; and is then released, consuming a magic scroll which is limited when the Master enters an area. When released, the magic may take various forms depending on the position of the Master. This is different from the first &quot;ActRaiser&quot; in which the player had to select a particular magic before descending down to the world to fight monsters and was limited to only that magic for the duration of battle. In &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot;, each magic is designed for particular situations and some magic is more powerful than others. By increasing the difficulty level at the options screen, the time it takes to &quot;charge up&quot; magic is increased, adding more difficulty to the game. The game&#x27;s difficulty is also increased in that monsters require much more damage to be destroyed. Death Heim cannot be accessed through easy mode.

== Synopsis ==
The game begins with the Master battling with Tanzra (still &quot;Satan&quot; in the Japanese version). In this game, a backstory is given as to why Tanzra hates the Master so vehemently. Tanzra, who was once the Master&#x27;s servant, led a rebellion against him, but lost and was banished from Heaven.

Ripped and torn, the slain body of Tanzra fell to the underworld. Feeding on the intense hatred each held for the Master, Tanzra&#x27;s seven deadly sins and their minions combined their power to raise the spirit of their mighty leader. Tanzra, now vowing revenge for his defeat by the Master, unleashed these demons upon the world. The player in this game assumes the role of the Master, aided by his angelic associates, known as Crystallis.

Some of the stages in the game are meant to be ironic regarding the blighting nature of Tanzra&#x27;s demons. The townsmen in the city of Leon are sent to the underground prison of Gratis (meaning &quot;free without charge&quot;, or referring to &quot;nadie entra gratis&quot;, &quot;no one enters for free&quot;) for not paying their taxes by a newly-appointed king named Kolunikus, who is afflicted by Doom.

After the player slays the first six deadly sins, the Tower of Babel (renamed &quot;Tower of Souls&quot; in the western versions), the final staged level of the game, appears, in which the Master fights the final sin, Destruction, a mechanically engineered god representing Pride. Defeating the false god, the player then descends into Death Heim, where he fights again against the seven sins, as well as Tanzra himself, a beast frozen waist-deep in a lake of ice (just as Satan was in the &quot;Inferno&quot; in &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;).

During the game&#x27;s ending, it is declared that &quot;The Master will live forever&quot; and, as the credits roll, an image of the statue of the Master is shown slowly eroding over time. The statue&#x27;s sword and right wing fall off, suggesting the growth of civilization and the increase of mankind&#x27;s self-sufficiency. This reflects the ending of the original &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, where the angel speculates that someday the world may be so independent that it will forget about the Master.

== Development and release ==
According to developer Quintet, &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot; was made at the request of Enix of America, and designed according to their specifications.

== Reception ==
&quot;ActRaiser 2&quot; was seen by some game writers as not as good as the original. The game sold about 180,000 copies worldwide, with 40,000 copies sold in Japan and Europe respectively and 100,000 sold in the US.

Levi Buchanan of IGN wrote that while not as good as the original game, &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot;″s allusions to Medieval religious texts and apocryphal storytelling is &quot;more than welcome&quot;. In 2018, Complex rated &quot;Actraiser 2&quot; 81st on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; list. They commented that the game is great despite being strictly a platformer and not having the god elements from the first game. In 1995, Total! ranked the game 38th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot; list.

== Legacy ==
In 1996, Sega announced that they would be publishing a Quintet-developed remake of &quot;ActRaiser 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;Act Remix&quot;, for the Sega Saturn, but roughly halfway through development Quintet concluded that the &quot;ActRaiser&quot; series was outmoded, and they drastically reworked the game, which was ultimately titled &quot;Solo Crisis&quot;. Quintet started coding a third game in the &quot;ActRaiser&quot; series, for the Nintendo 64, but never finished it. In May 2008, Fumiaki Shiraishi, the lead programmer for &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King&quot;, noted in an interview that he would like to make an &quot;ActRaiser&quot; sequel.

<text>Kilmainham (, meaning &quot;St Maighneann&#x27;s church&quot;) is a south inner suburb of Dublin, Ireland, south of the River Liffey and west of the city centre. It is in the city&#x27;s Dublin 8 postal district.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Kilmainham&#x27;s foundation dates to the early Christian period, with the monastery of Cell Maignenn (Cill Mhaighneann in modern Irish) established by the year 606. By 795, the ecclesiastical site, located on the ridge of land at the confluence of the Liffey and the Camac, may still have been the only substantial structure along the Liffey&#x27;s banks.

The Kilmainham Brooch, a late 8th- or early 9th-century Celtic brooch of the &quot;penannular&quot; type (i.e. its ring does not fully close or is incomplete) was unearthed in the area.

In the wake of the Viking settlement of nearby Dublin from 841, Vikings were present in Kilmainham too, one of a number of villages that stretched up the river bank to Clondalkin.

Viking cemeteries at the site of the monastery and at nearby Islandbridge were discovered during gravel quarrying, railroad works and the preparation of the War Memorial Gardens. Dozens of pagan burials with grave goods, dating to the 9th century, have been recorded. The burial sites taken together constitute the largest known Viking cemetery in western Europe outside Scandinavia.

The Battle of Islandbridge took place in the area in 919, with Viking forces under Sitric Cáech defeating Gaelic Irish forces under high king Niall Glúndub. In 1013, Murchad, the son of Brian Boru, is recorded by the annals as having raided into Leinster as far as Kilmainham.

In the 12th century, in the wake of the Norman invasion of Ireland, the lands on the banks of the Liffey were granted to the Knights Hospitaller. Strongbow erected for them a castle about 2 kilometres or 1 mile distant from the Danish wall of old Dublin; and Hugh Tyrrel, first Baron Castleknock, granted them part of the lands which now form the Phoenix Park. The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem remained in possession of the land until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.

Until the time of Queen Elizabeth, when Dublin Castle became the centre of English power, the Lord Lieutenants often held court at the manor of Kilmainham. In 1559, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, on being again appointed Lord Lieutenant, found that the building at Kilmainham had been damaged by a storm, and had to hold court at the palace of St. Sepulchre. The following year Elizabeth ordered that Dublin Castle be upgraded to enable the Lord Lieutenant to reside there, and Kilmainham fell out of favour.

The Manor of Kilmainham formed a liberty outside the jurisdiction of the city of Dublin, with its own rights and privileges. The manor took in parts of James&#x27;s Street and side streets and stretched as far as Lucan and Chapelizod. After the Reformation, former lords (or chairmen, as they were later called) of this manor included Lord Cloncurry and Sir Edward Newenham. John &quot;Bully&quot; Egan, from Charleville, County Cork, was chairman from 1790 to 1800. These manorial rights were abolished after the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, and much of the area was included within the city.

 The portion still outside the city in the latter part of the nineteenth century was within the township of New Kilmainham, a municipality governed by town commissioners, first under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854 and then under a local act, the New Kilmainham Township Act 1868. From 1868, New Kilmainham comprised the townlands of Kilmainham, Goldenbridge North, Inchicore North, Inchicore South, and Butchers Arms. Its total area was and the population was 5,391 in 1881 and 6,519 in 1891. It became an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. In 1900, the urban district was abolished and the area was transferred from the county into the jurisdiction of the city of Dublin as the New Kilmainham ward.

== Places of interest ==

The area is best known for Royal Hospital Kilmainham, constructed on the site where the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem had their priory in Dublin. It now houses the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The Richmond Tower marks the junction between the formal pedestrianised avenue leading to the Royal Hospital, and the South Circular Road.

Nearby is Kilmainham Gaol, where the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising took place.

Kilmainham is home to an important Viking Age burial site, part of a complex of cemeteries which also includes finds at the War Memorial Gardens. The artefacts, mostly discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, during industrial, transport and park works, are now part of the collection at the National Museum of Ireland.

The River Camac runs through Kilmainham and is crossed by bridges at the South Circular Road, Rowserstown Lane and Bow Lane.

== Railway station ==
The Dublin Heuston railway station, one of Dublin&#x27;s three main railway stations, is nearby.

== Notable people ==
Former or current residents of the town have included:
* Maeve Higgins, comedian.
* Brian Kennedy, singer.
* Gina Moxley, playwright.
* Kathryn Thomas, television personality.

<text>Hayes Wendell Jones (born August 4, 1938) is an American former athlete, winner of the 110 m hurdles event at the 1964 Summer Olympics. He was born in Starkville, Mississippi.

Jones first major title was the hurdles at the 1958 AAU championships. He won four more AAU titles: 1960 and 1964 in 110 m hurdles and 1961 and 1963 in hurdles.

In 1959, Jones, as an Eastern Michigan University representative, won the NCAA titles in and hurdles, following his first major international experience, when he won the 110 m hurdles at the Pan American Games.

A year later, at the Rome Olympics he was third behind teammates Lee Calhoun and Willie May, after which many observers believed he had reached his peak performance. But he returned to the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he won the gold medal and his teammate Blaine Lindgren won the silver. Jones also ran on a 4 × 100 m relay team that set a world record in 1961.

After retiring from competition, Jones became New York City&#x27;s director of recreation in 1967. He has worked for American Airlines and owned his own baggage check-in service at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

== Politics==
From January 2005 through March 2006, Jones served as the director of the Oakland County Department of Economic Development &amp; Community Affairs. In 2006 he left Oakland County to run for State Representative in Pontiac, Michigan to finish the term vacated by newly elected Pontiac Mayor Clarence Phillips and to win a full two-year term starting in January 2007. Jones was on the primary ballot twice; the first to finish the term left vacant by Phillips, and second, to be the Democratic candidate for the full two-year term in the general election. Oddly Jones won the right to be the Democratic candidate for the remainder of the two months left on Phillips&#x27; term while Tim Melton will be the Democratic candidate for the full two-year term.

On July 1, 2007, Jones assumed the position of General Manager of SMART (Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation), the public transit operator serving suburban Detroit, Michigan.

==Personal life==
In 2003 Jones married Rhonda, they live in Pontiac. Jones has two children and three grandchildren.

<text>Cassino, sometimes spelt Casino, is an English card game for two to four players using a standard, 52-card, French-suited pack. It is the only fishing game to have penetrated the English-speaking world. It is similar to the later Italian game of Scopa and is often said, without substantiation, to be of Italian origin. Cassino is still played today in Madeira, probably due to English influence.

== History ==
Although Cassino is often claimed to be of Italian origin, detailed research by Franco Pratesi has shown that there is no evidence of it ever being played in Italy and the earliest references to its Italian cousins, Scopa and Scopone, post-date those of Cassino. The spelling &quot;Cassino&quot; is used in the earliest rules of 1792 and is the most persistent spelling since, although German sources invariably use the spelling &quot;Casino&quot; along with some English sources.

Likewise an origin in gambling dens appears unlikely since a &quot;casino&quot; in the late 18th century was a summer house or country villa; the name was not transferred to gambling establishments until later.

In fact, as &quot;Cassino&quot;, the game is first recorded in 1792 in England where it appears to have become something of a fashionable craze, and certainly well known enough for Mrs. Scatter to declare &quot;I do long for a game of Cassino&quot; in Frederic Reynolds&#x27; 1797 comedy, &quot;Cheap Living&quot;. At that stage, the court cards had no numerical value and could only be paired, and there was no building; that did not appear in English rules until the second half of the century. The counting cards were the Aces and two special cards known as the &#x27;Great Cassino&#x27; (10) and &#x27;Little Cassino&#x27; (2). As the game developed, further counters were added.

One country to follow hard on English heels was Austria-Hungary where, as early as 1795 in Vienna and Prague, rules were published that incorporated English terminology such as &quot;sweep&quot; and &quot;lurch.&quot; Initially the rules followed those in English sources, but as early as 1810, a markedly different variant appeared in which the court cards, Aces and Cassinos became far more potent. The courts were given values of 11, 12 and 13 respectively, the Aces could be valued at 14 as well as 1, the Great Cassino at 10 or 16 and the Little Cassino at 2 or 15. This elaboration of the Cassino went unnoticed in its country of origin and across the Atlantic, apart from a fleeting observation in 1846 by Lady Sarah Nicolas in 1846 who recounts that &quot;the game of Cassino is thus played in some parts of Germany:- Great Cassino takes sixteen. Little Cassino – fifteen. Every Ace – fourteen. King – thirteen. Queen – twelve. Knave – eleven.&quot;

Rules continued to be published in German until at least 1975, but the game seems to have waned in Germany and Austria towards the end of the 19th century.

However, while the game began to fade away in England, it was in America that Cassino gained its second wind in the second half of the 19th century, initially due to new moves such as building and calling and, later, through several interesting new variants that emerged, including what became Royal Cassino, in which court cards were given a numerical value as in German Cassino such that they could capture two or more cards, and Spade Cassino, in which players scored for the most Spades, and Diamond Cassino, in which three cards are dealt instead of four. Royal Cassino is mentioned as early as 1894 when we learn that a passenger on a line from New York to London played the game with a doctor and his wife but its rules first appear in English &quot;Foster&#x27;s Complete Hoyle&quot; of 1897. Cassino was eventually eclipsed by Gin Rummy. 

By the early 20th century, Cassino itself was obsolete everywhere, but two successors were emerging. Zwickern, a north German variant, introduced up to 6 Jokers as special cards and grew so popular that bespoke packs were made for it. Today the game is still played in a few villages in Schleswig. Tablanette, another apparent variant in which the Kings, Queens, Knaves and Tens are also counters, appeared in the late 19th in a German source and later featured in one of Hubert Phillips&#x27; games compendia in 1939. It does not seem to have caught on, although it may have gained more traction in its various eastern European forms.

== English Cassino ==
These classic rules emerged in 1792 and remained largely unchanged until the mid-19th century. The following are based on Long:

The game is for two players using a standard pack. The dealer deals four cards each and four to the table, placing the rest face down as the stock. Non-dealer plays the first card and aims to capture as many cards from the table as possible that match the card played. For example, if the table cards are 6–9–3–9–J, by playing a 9, a player may capture the 6 and 3 in combination as well as two 9s. If a player is able to clear the table (later called a &quot;sweep&quot;) this scores 1 point. Captured cards are placed in a trick pile, face up, by the player who took them. A player unable to capture anything must trail (add) a card to the table.

The players play cards alternately and when the first hand of four is exhausted, the dealer deals four more cards each from the stock, but none to the table this time. Play continues in this way until the stock is exhausted and the players have played their last hand of four. Any cards left on the table are claimed by the last player to take a trick, unless the last card played is a court card in which case its holder claims any remaining cards. In neither case does this score a point.

At the end of the hand, score as follows:

Thus there are 11 points in the game plus the bonus points for sweeps. If players tie on cards or spades, no point is awarded. The lower score is deducted from the higher and the winner scores the difference. Game is 11 points; if the loser has less than 6, he or she is lurched and loses double.

=== Three-Handed Cassino ===
Only the scoring differs. After totalling their points the two lower scores are combined and deducted from the highest score e.g. if A score 8, B 2 and C 1, A scores 8 - (2 + 1) = 5 game points; but if A has 5, B 4 and C 2, A scores nothing.

=== Four-Handed Cassino ===
There are two teams of two and they follow Whist rules for cutting for places, dealing and scoring the games singly or double. They play a rubber i.e. the best of 3 games.

== American Cassino ==
In 1864, William Brisbane Dick, alias &quot;Trumps&quot;, published the first rules that included the feature of &quot;building up&quot;, whereby players were allowed to place a card on an existing table card and, by announcing their combined value, fix the build at that value. In 1867, however, Dick published an even more elaborate set of rules that included &quot;calling&quot; for the first time. The rules were based on research that included testing and approval by &quot;the best players in this city&quot;. The following is a summary of those rules:

=== Overview ===
The game is played by two, three, four or six players with a 52-card pack. Four play as two pairs.

=== Deal ===
Players cut for deal and the player with the lowest card deals first. Ties &#x27;cut over&#x27; and Aces are low. Dealer gives each player four cards, singly, eldest hand first. Four cards are dealt to the table either regularly as he deals or in packets of two, three or all four. After the first four hand cards are played, the dealer deals another four each, singly, but none to the table, and this continues until all cards have been played out.

=== Play ===
Eldest hand leads a card and then each player in turn plays one card which may be used for:
* Capturing. The played card may capture all table cards either by pairing – taking cards of the same rank – or by combining – taking cards that, in combination, add up to the value of the played card.
* Sweeping. If a player captures all the table cards, this is a sweep and scores 1 point. The next player must trail a card.
* Calling. A player with 2 or more cards in hand of the same rank as one or more table cards, may play one of them and call their rank e.g. &quot;Fives&quot;. An opponent may only capture the card by pairing, but may not build on that card or capture it as part of a combination.
* Building. 
** Simple Build. A player may build by placing a hand card on a table card and announcing the total, thus fixing the value of the build, e.g. Andrew holds 5 and 3, and there is a 2 on the table; he places the 3 on the 2 and calls &quot;Five&quot;. The cards of the build cannot now be taken separately but must be capturing by pairing with a 5 or as part of a combination where the build counts as 5. 
** Multiple Build. A player may build on an opponent&#x27;s build provided that player has a hand card matching the new total. Players may not build on their own build in succession, but only alternately on the same build. 
** Second Build. Players may make a second build on a different card or make any other legal play before taking up the first build.
** Build and Call. A player with more than one card that matches a build may play it onto the build and call their values e.g. &quot;Eights&quot;. This then counts as a call and fixes the value of both build and played card. The player must then capture both by playing the remaining card on a later turn.
* Trailing. A player unwilling or unable to do any of the above must trail a card i.e. add it to the existing table cards, face up.

=== Scoring ===
Points are scored at the end of each hand as in classic English Cassino, but instead of game being 11 points, each deal is a complete game and the player or team with the most points wins.

==Variants==

===Twenty-one Point Cassino===
Twenty-one Point Cassino appears for the first time in print in Dick&#x27;s 1880 &quot;Modern Pocket Hoyle&quot; where he says that &quot;Cassino is now very generally played for a fixed number of points (usually twenty-one)&quot;. The first player to the target score wins and the points are scored as soon as made. Sweeps are not turned down &quot;as in the single deal game&quot; but scored as they are taken. A player who erroneously claims to have won loses the game.

===Royal Cassino===
Royal Cassino appears for the first time in &quot;Foster&#x27;s Complete Hoyle&quot; (1897); however, the concept of giving values to the court cards was a Austro-German invention of the early 19th century. The only difference from standard American Cassino is that Jacks are now worth 11, Queens 12 and Kings 13, so that, for example, a Queen can capture and Ace and a Jack or a 7 and a 5.
In a variation recorded by David Parlett, the Ace is worth 1 or 14 as desired.

===Spade Cassino===
Also making its first appearance in 1897 was the &quot;interesting variation&quot; of Spade Cassino in which every spade scored a point except for the J which scored 2. This replaced the usual score for &quot;most spades&quot; and gave 24 points per hand, excluding sweeps. Game is 61 and hence it is scored on a cribbage board, all points being pegged as they are made apart from &quot;most cards&quot; which is pegged at the end.

===Diamond Cassino===
Diamond Cassino is a recent variant that has been described as a &quot;cross between Cassino and Scopa&quot;. Only 40 cards are used, the face cards being removed. Players are dealt three cards each, and four cards are dealt to the table. Game is 11 up and players get 1 for most cards, 1 for most diamonds, 1 for the 7, 2 for all four 7s, 6s or As, and 1 for each sweep.

===Draw Cassino===
In Draw Cassino, first called Royal Draw Cassino, players draw a replacement card each time they make a play, so that they always have four cards in hand (until the end), rather than being dealt cards in discrete rounds of four. It is a two-player game.

== Related games==
There are a number of other European fishing games in the same family as Cassino.

===Callabra===
In this &quot;fast and simple forerunner of Cassino&quot;, each player is dealt three cards, and five are dealt to the table. Players may trail or take cards from the table, if they have cards which match the cards on the table, or if they have two cards which add up to a card on the table and equal the table card&#x27;s value. In this game, Jacks are worth eleven points, Queens are worth twelve points and Kings are worth thirteen points. Game ends when a player finally clears all the cards from the table.

===Tablanette===

Tablanette is said to be of Russian provenance. In this game, each player has six cards, and a player with a jack may use it to clear the whole table. At the end of a round, players score points for holding the most cards, and extra points if they are holding picture
cards.

===Diloti===
In this Greek fishing game, players are dealt 6 cards. Matching face cards must be captured, so that no two face cards of the same value can ever be together in the pool. The scoring differs most notably in that there is no special suit, and sweeps are very valuable:

* Higher number of cards: 4
* 10 of diamonds: 2
* 2 of spades: 1
* Each ace: 1
* Each sweep (&quot;Xeri&quot;): 10 (!) extra points

<text>St. Helena Island is a Sea Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States. The island is connected to Beaufort by U.S. Highway 21. The island has a land area of about and a population of 8,763 as of the 2010 census. It is included as part of the Hilton Head Island-Beaufort Micropolitan Area. The island is renowned for its rural Lowcountry character and being a major center of African-American Gullah culture and language. It is considered to be the geographic influence behind the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot;.

==History==
The first European to explore St. Helena was most likely Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón around 1520, as part of the Spanish exploration and colonization of the sea islands. The general area was later colonized by the French, who built Charlesfort on nearby Parris Island, and then recolonized by the Spanish, who on the same site founded Santa Elena, which served as the capital of the entire Spanish colony of La Florida. The area finally fell into English hands, who occupied it until the American Revolution. In the War of 1812, Saint Helena saw some British naval presence.

The area was noted to be similar to the rice growing region of West Africa and soon captured slaves were brought to the Sea Islands, many from what is today Sierra Leone. Rice, indigo, cotton and spices were grown by these slaves, as well as Native Americans, and indentured servants from Europe. The mix of cultures, somewhat isolated from the mainland, produced the Gullah culture.

The Civil War began when South Carolina fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. After a number of setbacks for the Union, the Battle of Port Royal became an important victory on November 7, 1861. Lincoln had called for a blockade of Confederate ports and Port Royal was considered one of the most important. A flotilla of Union ships commanded by Samuel F. Du Pont launched a furious assault on the forts which defended Beaufort. After several hours, the islands fell into Union hands and were held throughout the war.

Slaves were liberated and immediate steps were taken to help improve their lot. One of the most important was the establishment of the Penn School to educate them. Another was grants of land to heads of households, from whence came the belief among the slaves that upon emancipation, all would be given &quot;forty acres (16 hectares) and a mule&quot;.

The Negro spiritual &quot;Michael Row the Boat Ashore&quot; originated on Saint Helena Island in the 1860s. Leigh Richmond Miner photographed the island. A book of his photographs of the island was published in 1970.

St. Helena Island was significantly impacted by the Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893, killing hundreds of residents on the island. The economic destruction of the hurricane lingered for decades after the event, causing St. Helena Island to be one of the poorest locations in the United States for many years.

In the last decades of the 20th century, the improving economy in Beaufort coupled with resort development on nearby Fripp Island, Harbor Island and Dataw Island began to improve economic prospects for the island but also introduced development pressures that threatened the island&#x27;s rural character. In order to stem the tide of gentrification, significant planning efforts have led to restrictive development regulations to ensure the island retains its rural character and preserves its cultural and historic resources. Condominium communities and gated communities are not allowed on St. Helena Island. Some rural land has been preserved through conservation easements and much of the island is still owned by African-Americans, much of it through heirs property arrangements.

The Indian Hill Site and Knights of Wise Men Lodge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
St. Helena Island is considered an inland Sea Island and does not have actual frontage on the Atlantic Ocean. The island is surrounded by expansive marshes, particularly along the southeastern side of the island. It is the largest Sea Island in the Beaufort area and is the largest island between Edisto Island and Hilton Head Island along the South Carolina coast. The island is informally divided into several different communities, each with its own distinct identity. The two most established communities on the island are Frogmore and Lands End.

* Frogmore is considered to be the commercial center of island activity and is located in the north central portion of the island. For many years, Frogmore was the official name for the entirety of St. Helena Island by the U.S. Postal Service, and many on the island still refer to it as such. However, it is no longer the official U.S. Postal Service location name. It is officially Saint (St.) Helena, Island, S.C.
* Lands End (sometimes referred to as Fort Fremont) is a small community at the southern tip of the island which is home to Fort Fremont, a former military battery which helped guard the entrance to the Beaufort River. The community is popular for its access to open water, thus making it a hub for fishing and recreational opportunities.

Other communities on the island are typically referred to by the road, point, or smaller island on which they are situated, including Dulamo Road, Cedar Grove, Eddings Point, Coffin Point, Fripp Point, Folly Road, Warsaw Island, and Pollawana Road, to name a few. Three main roads provide arterial access for much of the island: Sea Islands Parkway (U.S. Highway 21), Seaside Road, and Lands End Road.

<text>Geoff Thompson (born 26 January 1960) is a BAFTA-winning writer, film-maker, spiritual teacher, and martial artist. He has written prolifically in a wide range of genres, including books on spirituality, self-help, self defence, and martial arts, and scripts for film and stage.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Geoff Thompson was born on 26 January 1960 in Coventry, United Kingdom.

===Martial artist (1990s)===
Thompson became a martial artist specialising in &#x27;reality&#x27; martial arts and self defence, based on his experience at the night club door, and co-founded the British Combat Association with Peter Consterdine. Thompson became a self defence instructor and promoted his concept of &quot;The Wall&quot;. He taught seminars in the US for Chuck Norris.

===Film writing and BAFTA award===
Thompson began writing for film with his script for the short film &quot;Bouncer&quot; in 2003, which went on to star Ray Winstone and was nominated for a BAFTA award. He wrote the script for a short film &quot;Brown Paper Bag&quot;, based on his own brother&#x27;s problems with alcoholism that eventually led to his death in 1999, and this won Thompson a BAFTA award in 2004 for Best Short Film.

Geoff went on to write the film script for the feature film &quot;Clubbed&quot; (2008), based on his autobiography &quot;Watch My Back&quot;, starring Colin Salmon.

He wrote the screenplay for the feature film &quot;The Pyramid Texts&quot; (2015), starring James Cosmo. Thompson made his directorial debut in 2015 with the short film &quot;The 20 Minute Film Pitch&quot;.

His work &quot;Romans 12:20&quot;, directed by the Shammasian Brothers and starring Craig Conway, (2008), has been adapted into a feature film, &quot;Romans&quot; (2017), starring Orlando Bloom.

===Writing for stage===
Thompson has written for stage, including the play &quot;Fragile&quot; which is semi-autobiographical and showed in Coventry.

===Spiritual teacher, podcast, TED talk===
Alongside writing, for many years Thompson was a spiritual teacher and coach, drawing upon his own experiences as a martial artist and of personal problems that he had contended with, which inspired his self-help books.

Thompson produced a popular podcast on spiritual guidance and self-help for a number of years, and in 2016 he presented a TED talk entitled &quot;Conquering Fear&quot;.

===Recent years===
In 2020 he released an autobiography, &quot;Notes from a Factory Floor&quot; and the spiritual self-help text &quot;The Divine CEO&quot;.

==Martial arts==
Thompson began his martial arts training in the Eastern arts including karate, aikido and kung-fu. However, during his time as a nightclub doorman, he found that what he had learned was inadequate for the reality of violence. Thompson came to realise that the techniques encouraged and practiced in touch-contact and semi-contact martial arts were not always suitable for self-defence. Though he utilises a small core of these techniques as part of his teachings, Thompson prefers full-contact martial arts and combat sports such as boxing, Muay Thai, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Greco-Roman- and freestyle wrestling.

He holds the ABA Boxing Instructor certificate and high-level coaching awards for wrestling, a 1st Dan in Judo (1997) under world champion Neil Adams, and an 8th dan in Shotokan Karate. Geoff is a Joint Chief Instructor of the British Combat Association.

Geoff Thompson was also the first instructor to name and extensively teach &quot;the fence&quot;, a technique in real-life defence involving keeping your hands in front of you in a non-threatening manner so as to protect yourself in case a situation escalates but without provoking violence.

In the 1990s, Thompson wrote and presented a wide range of martial arts and self-defence DVDs. In 1995, he and his self-defence school featured in the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Passengers&quot;.

<text>Melinda Culea (born May 5, 1955) is an American actress.

== Early life ==
Culea was born on May 5, 1955, in Western Springs, Illinois. She worked as a model before acting.

== Career ==
=== &quot;The A-Team&quot; ===

Culea is best known for playing Amy (Amanda) Allen in the 1980s hit TV series &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Her role was as a newspaper reporter who joined the team for the first season and half of the second season.

Introduced in the feature-length pilot episode &quot;Mexican Slayride&quot;, her character was presented as feisty. However, Culea soon started to realize that her character had very little to do. Reportedly, star George Peppard did not like a female lead being part of the show, and made his feelings clear. Culea asked for her character to be involved in the team&#x27;s fights, suggesting that Amy try to help, but she gets in the way – adding some comic relief. The producers resisted.
Culea was ultimately dropped from the series in 1983, and her final appearance was in Season 2 Episode 12, &quot;The White Ballot&quot;, although her character continued to be mentioned by the team during the show shortly thereafter. She could still be glimpsed briefly on one of the shots in the show&#x27;s opening titles sequence. This scene was used for most of the show&#x27;s run.

=== Other television roles ===
Culea acted in a number of other TV roles, mainly during the 1980s and 1990s.

Shortly after leaving &quot;The A-Team&quot;, Culea gained a leading role as Terry Randolph in the short-lived series &quot;Glitter&quot;. Another substantial role was playing the recurring character Paula Vertosick on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; for two seasons from 1988 to 1990. She also co-starred as Joey Lawrence&#x27;s step-mother for two seasons on &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; from 1995 to 1997 on NBC and the WB.

She also made appearances on many other notable television series including &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;; &quot;Family Ties&quot;; &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;The X-Files&quot;; &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;; &quot;Brotherly Love&quot;; &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

=== Movie roles ===
Culea played the role of Constance Taylor in the movie &quot;Wagons East!&quot; (1994), directed by her future husband Peter Markle, and played Anna in &quot;Dying on the Edge&quot; (2001). She was an executive producer of Peter Markle&#x27;s film &quot;Odds Are...&quot; (2018).

=== Other ===
, she is working as an author and artist. Her first book &quot;Wondago&quot; is an illustrated mystery novel published in January 2016 by Griffith Moon Publishing.

<text>Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli (; 27 April 1910 – 21 April 1975) was a Brazilian politician who served as Federal Deputy from 1951 to 1967 and President of the Chamber of Deputies (speaker of the house) from 1958 to 1965. During his term as speaker of the house, he served twice as interim president of Brazil for a few weeks, first in 1961, after the resignation of Jânio Quadros (as vice-president João Goulart was outside the country), and again in 1964, after Goulart, who had then succeeded him as president, was deposed in the military coup d&#x27;état of that year.

==Life and career==

Mazzilli was born at Caconde. His father was Domingos Mazzilli (born Domenico Mazzilli), an Italian from Montemurro, Basilicata, who immigrated to Brazil in 1892, at the age of 15; his mother, Angela Liuzzi, was also from Montemurro and emigrated to Brazil in 1889 at the age of 2. As the son of poor immigrants Mazzilli had a modest childhood and began to work at an early age.

Mazzilli entered the Faculty of Law of São Paulo in 1930 but did not complete his studies, working briefly as a tax collector in Taubaté. He fought in the Revolution of 1932, in São Paulo&#x27;s side as a first lieutenant, soon promoted to captain in the Battalion Seven September, participating in the battle &quot;Tunnel Front&quot;. After, in 1932, he began working as a journalist, specializing in financial matters. In 1940 he decided to continue his education, graduating in 1940 from the School of Law of Niterói (Fluminense Federal University). Mazzilli was the president of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil between 1958 and 1965. He assumed the Presidency for two weeks in August 1961 after the resignation of Jânio Quadros because the vice-president João Goulart was on an official visit in China. Goulart was also prevented by the military from assuming the presidency, being later allowed to take over under parliamentary regime.

As the historian Hélio Vianna noted, &quot;It was Mr. Paschoal Ranieri Mazzilli the first child of non-Portuguese immigrants to occupy the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil&quot;.

The 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état removed Goulart from power permanently. On 1 April 1964, after the deposition of Goulart, Mazzilli assumed the presidency for a further two weeks before Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco took power through indirect elections.

Due to the transitory nature of both administrations and the emergency situation that accompanied his two presidential terms, Mazzilli never played a relevant role in the Brazilian government, except in his conciliatory position, avoiding bloodshed in the 1964 military coup.

According to Ranieri&#x27;s nephew, Brazilian lawyer and law professor Hugo Nigro Mazzilli, his government was important to avoid &quot;bloodshed&quot; in the transition between democracy and dictatorship, and his uncle did not support the coup and faced his presidential moments as a constitutional imposition.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<doc id="946886" wikidata="Q4349546" url="?curid=946886" title="CMX (band)">
<text>CMX, originally Cloaca Maxima, is a Finnish rock band. They originally played hardcore punk, but soon expanded to play a wide variety of rock formats, including progressive rock, heavy metal, and mainstream rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Throughout their career, they have been influenced by progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, Tool and King Crimson. The progressive influence is most evident on their albums &quot;Dinosaurus Stereophonicus&quot; (2000) and &quot;Talvikuningas&quot; (2007).

CMX have gradually gained large-scale mainstream following in Finland. They are especially known for the poetic lyrics of A. W. Yrjänä that often contain references to mythology and religion. Finnish rock magazines, particularly &quot;Rumba&quot;, have named them Best Band of the Year multiple times, and even Best Band of All Time on one occasion.

== History ==
=== Early years 1985–1990 ===
CMX was founded on Good Friday 1985 in Tornio, Finland by A. W. Yrjänä (18 at the time) and Pekka Kanniainen. The band&#x27;s original name, Cloaca Maxima, Latin for the &quot;Greatest Sewer&quot;, was taken from a footnote of H. P. Blavatsky&#x27;s book Isis Unveiled. Over the next six months Kanniainen became the drummer, Yrjänä the bassist and singer, and Kimmo Suomalainen the guitarist. The band played mainly fast hardcore punk with the vocals sung in English; the language, however, soon changed into Finnish. The band shortened its name to CMX in 1986.

The first EP &quot;Johannes Kastaja&quot; was recorded 1987 in Kemi and released in 1988. The same year CMX performed for the first time outside of Tornio and its neighbouring areas, at Lieto punk rock festival. In 1989 the EP &quot;Raivo&quot; was released on a small label Bad Vugum. The band&#x27;s first appearance at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki followed.

The first full-length album &quot;Kolmikärki&quot; was released in January 1990. The album received practically no radio airplay and sold less than 2,000 copies during the first year. During the spring Pasi Isometsä was brought on as a second guitarist, however he would only stay in the band for less than a year. As the band moved south to Helsinki in late 1990, guitarists Isometsä and Suomalainen weren&#x27;t willing to leave Tornio and eventually quit the band. They were replaced by Janne Halmkrona and, in early 1991, Timo Rasio. This lineup would remain the same for the following six years. In early 1991 they recorded another EP, &quot;Tanssitauti&quot;, and later that year the band&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Veljeskunta&quot;. The aggressive hardcore approach of the album was generally well received by the press.

=== Mainstream success ===
1992&#x27;s &quot;Aurinko&quot;, released by the international EMI record label, won CMX both the Album of the Year and Band of the Year awards in a poll by Finnish &quot;Rumba&quot; music magazine. The album saw CMX largely abandon the hardcore style in favor of more accessible mainstream rock songs.

In 1994, &quot;Aura&quot; was released. The album continued the trend towards mainstream audiences, which was criticized by the band&#x27;s early hardcore fan base. Aura contained some of the band&#x27;s best known songs to date, including the etheric ballad &quot;Ruoste&quot; and the radio-friendly (though lyrically hardly traditional) love song &quot;Kultanaamio&quot;.

The trend continued with &quot;Rautakantele&quot;, released in 1995 and produced by Yrjänä. Essi Wuorela appeared as a guest artist. &quot;Pelasta maailma&quot;, the only single from the album, received some radio airplay and would later be covered by both Antti Tuisku and Vesa-Matti Loiri.

=== Changes ===
For their next album, the band changed radically their approach to recording. &quot;Discopolis&quot; (1996) was engineered with Pro Tools in the studio and made heavy use of sampling to edit the songs together from a set of short guitar riffs. The album received mixed reviews: Allmusic wrote that &quot;friends of the modern music will find &quot;Discopolis&quot; very attractive&quot;, while Tero Valkonen, on his analysis of &quot;Kultanaamio&quot;, expressed his dislike for the album, and called the song &quot;Paha&quot; a &quot;rotten bad joke&quot;. &quot;Discopolis&quot; was the first CMX album to enter the Finnish album charts, peaking at No 3. In 1997, drummer Kanniainen left CMX saying that the band had become too professional for him. Tuomas Peippo was hired to replace him. The same year CMX released a three-CD compilation album, &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot;.

=== 1998–2003 ===
The first album with new drummer Tuomas Peippo, &quot;Vainajala&quot; (1998), was recorded in a cabin in Lapland and produced by Faith No More bassist Billy Gould. According to the band the deliberately minimalistic sound of the album was largely thanks to Gould. &quot;Vainajala&quot; was the first CMX album to top the Finnish album charts. At the Provinssirock festival 1999, CMX announced that they intended to stop playing live in order to concentrate on their studio work.

&quot;Dinosaurus Stereophonicus&quot; (2000) was CMX&#x27;s nod toward 1970s progressive rock bands, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Yes. A two-hour double album, it contains progressive elements not before associated with CMX: Three instrumental pieces, an emphasis on keyboards, long solos, and song lengths exceeding 10 minutes. CMX&#x27;s first number 1 single, the peaceful and melodic &quot;Myrskyn ratsut&quot; was released before the album and featured strings and steel guitar.

By the time &quot;Isohaara&quot; (2002) was released, CMX had already abandoned the idea of becoming a full-time studio band and started touring again. The album was considered slightly heavier than its predecessor, and the guitar riffs of &quot;Minne paha haudattiin&quot; were compared to the music of Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus and Kotiteollisuus. The album&#x27;s lyrics concentrated less on mythology and religion and were closer to traditional rock lyrics, albeit keeping a dark, melancholy tone. Although less present than on &quot;Dinosaurus Stereophonicus&quot; (2000), progressive influences hadn&#x27;t been totally abandoned: The band uses a child choir on the title track and the uptempo rocker &quot;Pohjoista leveyttä&quot; contains a harmonica solo.

Bad Vugum re-released the first two CMX albums in 2002 as &quot;Gold&quot; versions that also included their early EPs. &quot;Kolmikärki Gold&quot; included EPs &quot;Johannes Kastaja&quot; (1987) and &quot;Raivo&quot; (1989), and &quot;Veljeskunta Gold&quot; contained EPs &quot;Tanssitauti&quot; (1990) and &quot;Musiikin ystävälliset kasvot&quot; (1998).

A year after &quot;Isohaara&quot;, &quot;Aion&quot; (2003) followed. The album was put together around a common theme of the essence and symbolism of evil. It was both a critical and commercial success and was described as a highly experimental album for such an established band. Guitarist Halmkrona plays trumpet on the first track of the album, and violins and synthesizers are heard on several songs. Both &quot;Melankolia&quot; and, four months later, &quot;Palvelemaan konetta&quot; peaked the singles chart.

=== 2004–present ===

The band&#x27;s second three-CD compilation Cloaca Maxima II, released in 2004, followed the format of the 1997 &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot; closely. Both consisted of 44 songs on three CDs, the first one concentrating on faster rock songs, the second on ballads and the third on B-sides. The compilation covered four albums from &quot;Vainajala&quot; (1998) to &quot;Aion&quot; (2003) and also featured three previously unreleased songs. The band had originally intended the compilation to only include the B-sides, and indeed the third disc was the one that received some praise from the press.

&quot;Pedot&quot; (2005) showed some influences from contemporary rock bands such as Tool, A Perfect Circle and System of a Down, and combined straight rock songs with heavier and lighter elements, such as the minimalistic ballad &quot;Eteläisen tähtitaivaan kartoitus&quot; and the aggressive double bass drum sound of the title track. &quot;Uusi ihmiskunta&quot; was a number one hit, the sixth one for CMX in just over five years.

On the Tuuliajolla 2006 tour on lake Saimaa, CMX recorded a song in collaboration with fellow rock bands Kotiteollisuus and 51Koodia. Ambiguosly named &quot;Vapaus johtaa kansaa&quot; (&quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;) was written by Yrjänä and released in 2006. It reached number one on the Finnish singles chart.

CMX&#x27;s following album, &quot;Talvikuningas&quot; (2007), was a space-themed rock opera and contains only one song, divided onto 12 tracks without pauses. Originally, the story about the power and fall of the Winter King (Talvikuningas in Finnish) was going to be the story of a novel by Yrjänä. The first edition of the album was soon sold out despite being much more expensive than a regular album. The press reviews were largely positive. &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; newspaper called the album CMX&#x27;s &quot;third bullseye&quot; after &quot;Aura&quot; and &quot;Aion&quot;, while &quot;Soundi&quot; music magazine argued that the album will probably be a mere curiosity in the CMX saga.

CMX&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;Iäti&quot;, was released by EMI on 29 September 2010. The singles released before the album were called &quot;Sateenkaaren pää&quot; and &quot;Linnunrata&quot;.

Drummer Tuomas Peippo left the band in 2012 due to his job as a dentist. The fourteenth studio album, &quot;Seitsentahokas&quot;, was released in February 2013. The drummer for the album was Olli-Matti Wahlström, known for bands Kumikameli and 51koodia, who later in the spring became the official member of the band. The first single released from the album was &quot;Kusimyrsky&quot; in November 2012, followed by &quot;Rikkisuudeltu&quot; in February 2013.

Fifteenth studio album Mesmeria was released in 2015. It was produced by Arto Tuunela and first without producer Rauli Eskolin since Isohaara released in 2002.

== Popularity ==
CMX are practically unknown outside Finland. However, Billy Gould of Faith No More produced their 1998 album &quot;Vainajala&quot;. In Finland, CMX has won the &quot;Rumba&quot; magazine &quot;Band of the Year&quot; reader poll ten times. In 2005, the band was even voted the &quot;Best Band of All Time&quot; by the magazine&#x27;s readers, in favour of such bands as The Beatles, Metallica, Led Zeppelin and Iron Maiden. In a &quot;City&quot; magazine poll, they were voted the best Finnish band of all time. In a &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; newspaper reader poll in 2007, the readers voted both &quot;Ruoste&quot; and &quot;Kultanaamio&quot; into the top 10 of Finnish rock songs. CMX were the only band to have two songs in the top 10.

Ten CMX albums, including their both compilations, have been certified gold, each having sold approximately 20,000 copies. &quot;CMX DVD&quot; has also reached the gold record threshold for DVDs, which is 5,000 copies. The platinum record threshold for albums in Finland, which none of the band&#x27;s albums have achieved, is 30,000 copies sold.

== Musical style ==
Early CMX was influenced by heavy metal, punk rock and progressive rock. During their career, they have explored several different genres of rock music. Their early EPs and albums up until &quot;Veljeskunta&quot; (1991) have been mainly hardcore, although combining a variety of styles. From &quot;Aurinko&quot; (1992) onwards, hardcore has been merely an ephemeral element in their varied expression. Progressive rock elements are always present in the band&#x27;s music, most evidently on &quot;Dinosaurus Stereophonicus&quot; (2000) and &quot;Talvikuningas&quot; (2008). Many of the band&#x27;s best known songs are ballads, such as &quot;Ruoste&quot; and &quot;Pelasta maailma&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===

All the band&#x27;s lyrics are written by vocalist Yrjänä. His texts are often poetic, symbolic and intertextual, and contain themes of mythology, religion and philosophy. Many CMX fans are attracted to the band particularly for Yrjänä&#x27;s texts, although there are also people who can&#x27;t stand the band because of them.

== Band members ==
During the early years of the band, the lineup changed several times. A. W. Yrjänä is the only remaining original member.

=== Current lineup ===
* A. W. Yrjänä – vocals, bass (1985–)

<doc id="946890" wikidata="Q57221" url="?curid=946890" title="Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine">
<text>&quot;Madame&quot; Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans (born Princess Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, ; 27 May 1652 – 8 December 1722), also known as Liselotte von der Pfalz, was a German member of the House of Wittelsbach who married into the French royal family. She was the second wife of &quot;Monsieur&quot; Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (younger brother of Louis XIV of France). By Philippe, Liselotte was the mother of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, and Élisabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Lorraine. Philippe II was France&#x27;s ruler during the Regency. Liselotte gained literary and historical importance primarily through preservation of her correspondence, which is of great cultural and historical value due to her sometimes very blunt descriptions of French court life and is today one of the best-known German-language texts of the Baroque period.

Liselotte not only became the ancestress of the House of Orléans, which came to the French throne with Louis Philippe I, the so-called &quot;Citizen King&quot; from 1830 to 1848, but also became the ancestress of numerous European royal families, so she was also called the &quot;Grandmother of Europe&quot;. Through her daughter she was the grandmother of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, the husband of Maria Theresa, and great-grandmother of Joseph II and Leopold II (both Holy Roman Emperors) and Marie Antoinette, the last Queen of France before the French Revolution.

==Life==
===Early years===
Elizabeth Charlotte was born on 27 May 1652 in the castle of Heidelberg as the second child and only daughter of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, and his wife Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel. Named after her paternal grandmother Elizabeth Stuart and her own mother, from a young age she was nicknamed &quot;Liselotte&quot;, a portmanteau of both her names. An emergency baptism was performed shortly after her birth due to her being very weak and thin. She was raised in the Reformed Protestant faith, the most widespread denomination in the Electoral Palatinate at that time.

Liselotte was a lively child who liked to run around and climb trees to nibble on cherries. She sometimes claimed that she would have preferred to be a boy, and referred to herself in her letters as a &quot;wild child&quot; (&quot;rauschenplattenknechtgen&quot;).

The marriage of Liselotte&#x27;s parents soon turned into a disaster, and Liselotte was frequently witness to acts of domestic violence. In 1657, Elector Charles I Louis separated from his wife Charlotte in order to marry morganatically with Marie Luise von Degenfeld, who thus became Liselotte&#x27;s stepmother. Liselotte likely perceived her as an intruder, but had good relationships with many of her 13 half-siblings, the &quot;&quot;Raugrafen&quot;&quot;. With two of her half-sisters, Louise (1661–1733) and Amalie Elisabeth, called &quot;Amelise&quot; (1663–1709), she kept a lifelong correspondence. Her half-brother Charles Louis (1658–1688), called &quot;Karllutz&quot;, was a particular favorite of hers; she also called him &quot;Black Head&quot; (&quot;Schwarzkopfel&quot;) because of his hair color and was ecstatic when he later visited her (1673) in Paris. His early death in battle deeply saddened her.
The most important caregiver in Liselotte&#x27;s life was her aunt Sophia of the Palatinate, her father&#x27;s youngest sister, who also lived in Heidelberg Castle with Charles I Louis until her marriage in 1658 with Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1659, Liselotte&#x27;s father sent her to her aunt&#x27;s court in Hanover in an attempt to separate her from his estranged wife Charlotte. Liselotte later remembered this time as the happiest of her life. Sophia became an important motherly figure for her niece, and remained her most important confidante and correspondent throughout her life. During this time she also underwent a total of three trips to The Hague, where Liselotte met her paternal grandmother Elizabeth Stuart, the &quot;Winter Queen&quot; of Bohemia, who was still living in exile. Elizabeth wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of children, but she became very fond of her granddaughter, whom she found similar to her own family, the Stuarts: &quot;She is not like the House of Hesse...she is like ours&quot;. Her relatives in The Hague also included the slightly older William of Orange-Nassau, who was her playmate and was later to become King of England. She later also remembered the birth of Sophia&#x27;s son George Louis, who also became King of Great Britain. Liselotte was fluent in French as early as 1661, when a French woman named Madame Trelon, who did not understand German, was appointed as her governess. When Duke Ernest Augustus of Brunswick took office as Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück in September 1662, Liselotte moved with Sophia to Iburg Castle.

In 1663 Elector Charles I Louis granted Liselotte&#x27;s mother Charlotte monetary compensation in exchange for her vacating the Heidelberg residence. Immediately afterwards the Elector brought his daughter back to the court in Heidelberg. Liselotte now received a courtly education customary for princely houses at the time, consisting of lessons in French, dancing, playing the spinet, singing, handicrafts and history. In addition, she was regularly read to from the Bible &quot;in two languages, German and French&quot;. Her new governess, Maria Ursula Kolb von Wartenberg, called &quot;the Kolbin&quot;, instructed her against &quot;any hatred or prejudice against someone because they belong to a different religion&quot;. This religious tolerance was quite unusual in its time and stemmed from the relatively relaxed attitude of her father Charles I Louis, who was a Calvinist himself, but had a built in Mannheim a Concordia church (&quot;Konkordienkirche&quot;), where the followers of the Calvinist (or Reformed), Lutheran and Catholic denominations could celebrate their rituals. Liselotte benefited from this relatively open religious attitude throughout her life; she had learned about the Lutheran denomination at court in Hanover and, decades later, she still knew how to sing Lutheran chorals by heart. Before her marriage, she was required to convert to the Catholic faith for dynastic reasons, though she remained skeptical of dogmatism throughout her life, and was often critical of &quot;the priests&quot;, even while attending mass on a daily basis. She remained convinced of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and was critical of the Catholic veneration of the saints.

Etienne Polier, her first stable master and steward, became a lifelong confidante, whom she took with her to France after her marriage and who remained in her service for life.

===Marriage===

Liselotte was married in 1671 to the brother of King Louis XIV of France, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, known as &quot;Monsieur&quot;, the title given to the eldest brother of the King under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. As wife of the Duke of Orléans, Liselotte assumed the style of &quot;Madame&quot;. This political union was conceived by Anna Gonzaga, Liselotte&#x27;s aunt (as widow of Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern, Charles I Louis&#x27; younger brother) and an old friend of the Duke of Orléans; she negotiated the marriage contract, including the terms surrounding Liselotte&#x27;s required conversion to Catholicism. Anna escorted Liselotte from Heidelberg to Paris. The wedding &quot;per procurationem&quot; took place on 16 November 1671 at the Cathedral of Saint Stephen in Metz by Bishop Georges d&#x27;Aubusson de La Feuillade; in representation of the groom was the Duke of Plessis-Praslin. The day before, she solemnly renounced her old Reformed faith and converted to the Catholic faith. She met her husband, who was 12 years her senior, for the first time on 20 November 1671 in Châlons.

Until her husband&#x27;s death in 1701, she resided in her own apartments in her husband&#x27;s residences, the Palais Royal in Paris, and the Château de Saint-Cloud. The couple lived mostly at the royal court, where they had to be present for about three-quarters of the year, first in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and, after its completion in 1682, in the Palace of Versailles, where they had two adjacent apartments in the main wing. They also had apartments in the Palace of Fontainebleau, where the court went in autumn for the hunting season. Liselotte (unlike her husband) took part in this tradition with enthusiasm. She often rode with the King through the woods and fields all day long, from morning to night, without being deterred by occasional falls or sunburn. From Fontainebleau, the couple made regular visits to Montargis Castle, which belonged to Monsieur and which, according to their marriage contract, would later fall to Madame as a widow&#x27;s seat. Liselotte maintained her own court of 250 people, which cost 250,000 livres annually, while her husband maintained an even larger one.

This was the Duke of Orléans&#x27; second marriage, his first wife and cousin Henrietta of England died suddenly and under mysterious circumstances in 1670. He brought two daughters into his new marriage, 9-year-old Marie-Louise (with whom Liselotte was able to build a warm, sisterly relationship) and 2-year-old Anne Marie (who had no memory of her birth mother and whom Liselotte loved like her own child).

Liselotte and Philippe&#x27;s marriage was difficult, as he was bisexual and lived quite openly as such. He led a largely independent life, together with and influenced by his long-time lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine. He had many other favorites and numerous affairs with younger men, including Antoine Morel de Volonne (whom Monsieur made Liselotte&#x27;s &quot;Hofmarschall&quot; during 1673–1683). Morel had a very poor reputation even by the standards of the time: &quot;He stole, he lied, he swore, was atheist and sodomite and sold boys like horses.&quot;

Liselotte had no choice but to come to terms with these conditions, and she ultimately became an unusually enlightened woman for her time, albeit in a somewhat resigned way:

Her most important biographer, the historian and Antwerp professor of French baroque literature Dirk Van der Cruysse, judges: &quot;She was providentially placed between two completely dissimilar brothers, of whom the older made up for the fundamental inability of his younger brother through his appreciation and friendship: to love anyone other than herself. She showed her affection to both of them, wholeheartedly and without any ulterior motives, and accepted the overwhelming power of the one as well as the Italian inclinations of the other without complaint, as destined by fate.&quot;

Philippe fulfilled his marital duties rather reluctantly; he didn&#x27;t want to be hugged by Liselotte if possible and even scolded her when she accidentally touched him in his sleep. After fathering three children with his new wife, in 1676 he finally ended their sexual relationship, to Liselotte&#x27;s own relief.

===At the court of Louis XIV===

Liselotte became very close to her brother-in-law Louis XIV. He was &quot;...enchanted by the fact that this was an extremely witty and lovely woman, that she danced well...&quot;. He was often quite amused by her open, humorous and refreshingly uncomplicated nature. They often went hunting together—a rather unusual occupation for a noble lady of the time. Her habit of going for long walks was also noticed by the French court and was initially mocked (she even went for a walk in the park at night) but the King was delighted: &quot;The King used to say: &quot;il n’y a que Vous qui jouissés des beautés de Versailles&quot; (you are the only one who enjoys the beauties of Versailles)&quot;.

Despite the fact that she was not particularly beautiful (considered an important asset at French court) and was somewhat unconventional in manners, Liselotte made a good impression on the courtiers. Originally they expected a &#x27;rough&#x27; and &#x27;uncultivated&#x27; foreigner. Madame de Sévigné remarked &quot;What a delight to have a woman again who can&#x27;t speak French!&quot;, in reference to Queen Maria Theresa, who had never really learned to speak French and was sensitive to the teasing and jokes of the &quot;Précieuses&quot;. Later, however, the marquise praised Liselotte&#x27;s &quot;charming directness&quot; and said: &quot;I was amazed at her jokes, not at her lovable jokes, but of her common sense (&quot;esprit de bon sens&quot;)...I assure you that it cannot be expressed better. She is a very idiosyncratic person, very determined and certainly has taste.&quot; Madame de La Fayette was also surprised by and made similar comments about Liselotte&#x27;s &quot;esprit de bon sens&quot;. When the Electress Sophia and her daughter visited Liselotte in Paris and Versailles in 1679, she stated: &quot;Liselotte...lives very freely, and with more innocence: her cheerfulness cheers up the King. I have not noticed that her power goes further than making him laugh, nor that she tries to carry it further.&quot;

In France, Liselotte only had two German relatives, two older aunts, with whom she had regular contact: Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate (a sister of her father and Abbess of Maubuisson since 1664) and Emilie of Hesse-Kassel (a sister of her mother, who had married the Huguenot general Henri Charles de La Trémoille, Prince of Taranto and Talmont).

===Difficulties and tragedies===

From around 1680 massive problems arose in the Orléans marriage, as the Chevalier de Lorraine, the Marquis d&#x27;Effiat and other favorites of her husband intrigued against Liselotte in order to eliminate her influence on the Duke. Among other things, her enemies conspired to have her confidantes, including her beloved lady-in-waiting Lydie de Théobon-Beuvron and her husband, the Chamberlain Count de Beuvron, dismissed from court. After these departures she was defenseless against the intrigues of the favorites and the arbitrary whims of her husband. To make matters worse, her personal relationship with the King had cooled as his mistress Madame de Maintenon gained influence, leading Louis XIV to be less and less inclined to intervene in Liselotte&#x27;s quarrels with his brother. Liselotte became isolated, withdrawing more and more into her writing room.

Simultaneously, Liselotte was drawn into a larger court scandal through her wardship of Comte of Vermandois, whose mother had left court to become a nun. The young comte had become embroiled in a secret homosexual &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; of French nobles and courtiers, which required members to &quot;swear an oath to renounce all women.&quot; Several incidents were reported in which women were sadistically tortured, and also was reported that a poor waffle seller was raped, castrated and killed by courtiers. Though the Duke of Orléans didn&#x27;t belong to this brotherhood himself, many of his favorites did. In June 1682, it became known that the &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; included the Prince of la Roche-sur-Yon and the young Comte of Vermandois, among other notable figures at court. Louis XIV punished his own son severely and sent him to war, where he died shortly afterwards at the age of 16. Liselotte later recalled: &quot;The Comte de Vermandois was very good-natured. The poor person loved me as if I were his birth mother...He told me his whole story. He had been horribly seduced.&quot; One of his &#x27;seducers&#x27; is said to have been the Chevalier de Lorraine—her husband&#x27;s lover and her avowed enemy.

Other problems arose in the following years due to quarrels with Madame de Maintenon, the last important mistress and, from the end of 1683, the secret wife of Louis XIV. Liselotte regarded the marquise with contempt due to her low social rank and her perceived lust for power. She described her in numerous letters with epithets like &quot;the King&#x27;s old drab&quot;, &quot;old whore&quot;, &quot;old witch&quot;, &quot;Megaera&quot;, &quot;Pantocrat&quot; or as &quot;mouse filth mixed with the peppercorns&quot;. At the instigation of the increasingly powerful Maintenon, contact between Liselotte and her brother-in-law was restricted to formal occasions, and if the King retired to his private apartments with some chosen relatives after dinner, she was no longer admitted. In 1686, she wrote to her aunt Sophia: &quot;Where the devil can&#x27;t get there, he sends an old woman, whom we all want to find out, being part of the royal family...&quot; Since Liselotte&#x27;s correspondence was secretly monitored, the King and the Maintenon were privy to her insults, which further degraded her relationship with the King.

In addition, since 1680 —after the Affair of the Poisons, in which the previous &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; Madame de Montespan was involved— Louis XIV, under the influence of the bigoted Madame de Maintenon, underwent a transformation from a philanderer who was primarily interested in his pleasure and not infrequently crept into the apartments of Liselotte&#x27;s maid of honor, into a man obsessed with morality, piety and religion. In 1685, he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which ended the religious tolerance of the Edict of Nantes and renewed persecution of Protestants, in France known as Huguenots. Many French Protestants emigrated to Holland and Germany, including Liselotte&#x27;s aunt, Emilie of Hesse-Kassel. The emigrants were supported by the Brandenburg ambassador, Ezekiel Spanheim, to whom Liselotte was very close because he had once been the tutor of both her father and brother. Since Liselotte herself was originally a Protestant and (in contrast to the half-Huguenot Maintenon) had only become a half-hearted Catholic, this became an important part of her problematic situation. She blamed the situation on the influence of Madame de Maintenon, who she regarded as hypocritically bigoted, corrupt and greedy for power:

At the royal court, however, the topic was taboo:

Liselotte, however, also saw the opportunities that the Huguenots brought to Protestant countries after emigrating:

When the Wittelsbach line of Palatinate-Simmern ended in 1685 with the death of Liselotte&#x27;s brother, Charles II, Elector Palatine, Louis XIV raised a claim to the Electoral Palatinate on behalf of Liselotte, contrary to her marriage contract, and began the Palatinate War of Succession. Heidelberg (including the electoral palace) and Mannheim, were systematically destroyed. The experience was extremely traumatic for Liselotte: the death of her beloved half-brother &quot;Karllutz&quot; and the devastation of her homeland by her brother-in-law in her own name.

This situation inevitably brought her into serious conflict with the King and his inner circle. Her husband Philippe generously distributed the spoils of war that befell him (the so-called Orléans money) to his favorites, in particular to the Chevalier de Lorraine.

In 1692, Liselotte learned that her powerlessness extended even to her own children when Louis XIV married her son Philippe, Duke of Chartres, to Françoise Marie de Bourbon, legitimized daughter of the King and his mistress Madame de Montespan. The King&#x27;s other &quot;bastards from double adultery&quot; also married within the extended royal family, as their status as illegitimate barred them from marrying into foreign courts and even into other noble families in France, yet the King refused to have them marry below their &quot;station&quot;. Liselotte and the courtiers viewed this marriage as a &quot;mésalliance&quot; and a humiliation, and she reacted with indignation and anger. Various chroniclers report that she was no longer in control of her emotions, and burst into tears of desperation in front of the whole court.Saint-Simon writes that she slapped her son in front of the whole court for consenting to the marriage. The wedding took place on 18 February 1692. The King gave his daughter a pension of 50,000 écus and jewelry worth 200,000 écus, and a two million dowry was promised in the marriage contract, which, in the end, was never paid. The marriage was not a happy one, and Philippe would have affairs throughout his entire life.

In 1693, Elisabeth Charlotte fell ill with life-threatening smallpox. She defied the instructions of contemporary doctors and managed to survive the disease, but ended up with a pockmarked face. She did not concern herself with this, since she had always considered herself ugly (in excessive exaggeration, as earlier portraits by Mignard and Largillière, among others, prove) and had no interest in make-up. Possibly as a further consequence of the disease, from 1694 onwards she gained so much weight, that it began to interfere with her walks. Even so, she continued to hunt, but only with horses that were big and strong enough to support her weight. The external change in her appearance is clearly documented in the surviving portraits from this period.

In September 1700 she complained to her aunt Sophia: &quot;Being a Madame is a great craft, I would have sold it like the batches here in the country, I would have long since carried it for sale&quot;. Sophia, who grew up in relatively modest circumstances in exile in Holland, commented on her niece&#x27;s lamentations in a letter to her (rather poor) half-brother &quot;Karllutz&quot;:

When Sophia was declared heir to the British throne in the spring of 1701 by the Act of Settlement, Liselotte (who would have had a better claim had she not become Catholic) commented on 15 May in a letter to her half-sister Raugräfin Luise: &quot;I would rather be elector than king in England. The English humor and their parliament are not my business, my aunt is better than me; she will also know how to deal with them better than I would have done&quot;.

===Widowhood===

On 9 June 1701, the Duke of Orléans died of a stroke at the Château de Saint-Cloud. Earlier, he had a heated argument with his brother at the Château de Marly about the conduct of his son—who was also Louis XIV&#x27;s son-in-law. He left only debts, and Liselotte wisely renounced their common property. In his will, which was published publicly in the &quot;Mercure galant&quot; and the &quot;Gazette d’Amsterdam&quot;, he did not mention his wife. Liselotte personally burned the love letters he had exchanged with his lovers so that they would not fall into the hands of the notaries: &quot;...in the boxes I locked up all the letters the boys wrote to him, and then spent them unread so that it might not come into contact with others&quot;. She wrote to her aunt Sophia: &quot;I must confess that I was much more saddened than I am if Monsieur had not done so &quot;böße officien&quot; (that is, &#x27;bad services&#x27;) to the King&quot;. Her attitude towards the deceased&#x27;s &quot;mignons&quot; was no longer prudish, but rather serene: when she was reported in 1702 that the Earl of Albemarle, lover of the recently deceased King William III of England, almost died of heartache, she remarked dryly: &quot;We have not seen such friends here with my lord...&quot;.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Liselotte feared that the King would send her to a convent (as stipulated in her marriage contract), leading her to attempt a reconciliation with Madame de Maintenon. To the King, she explained frankly and freely: &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t loved you, then I would not have hated Madame de Maintenon so much, precisely because I believed she was robbing me of your favor&quot;. Madame de Maintenon confronted Liselotte with secretly-made copies of Liselotte&#x27;s candid letters to correspondents abroad, which were bursting with abuse against Maintenon, and were read with relish in foreign courts. Liselotte was warned to change her attitude towards Madame de Maintenon, but the peace between the two women was fleeting, and Liselotte was &quot;more tolerated than loved.&quot; Except on official occasions, she was rarely admitted to the King&#x27;s inner circle. She was punished with contempt above all by Marie Adélaïde of Savoy, Monsieur&#x27;s granddaughter from his first marriage and granddaughter-in-law of Louis XIV, who was a spoiled child, but an outspoken favorite of both the monarch and his mistress.

After Monsieur&#x27;s death, Liselotte lived in his former apartment in Versailles and took part in visits to the court in Marly or Fontainebleau. She was still allowed to take part in the court hunts, in which she and the King no longer rode on horseback, but sat and shot together from a calash. Liselotte avoided the Palais Royal and Saint Cloud until 1715 in order not to be a burden to her son and his wife. She rarely went to her remote widow&#x27;s residence, Montargis Castle; but she refrained from selling it in case the King should grow tired of her presence at Versailles, which Maintenon endeavored to work towards:

===The &quot;Régence&quot; and Death===

Louis XIV died on 1 September 1715 after a reign of 72 years and 110 days; one of the last people he summoned to his deathbed was Liselotte, saying goodbye to her with noble compliments. In his will, the deceased monarch divided the regnal prerogatives among relatives and courtiers, allocating to his legitimized son, the Duke of Maine, guardianship of the new monarch, Louis XV, who was just 5 years old. The Parlement of Paris overturned the will&#x27;s provisions at the request of Liselotte&#x27;s son, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, who, being the only legitimate agnate of the royal family in France, became Regent for the underage sovereign, beginning the time known as the &quot;Régence&quot;. Liselotte became the first lady of the court; as she had been at least officially once before, between the death of Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, Dauphine of France (20 April 1690) and the marriage of Marie Adélaïde of Savoy with Louis, Duke of Burgundy (7 December 1697).

The court at Versailles dissolved until the new King came of age, as the late Louis XIV had ordered, and Liselotte was soon able to return to her beloved Saint-Cloud, where she spent seven months of the year from then on, with her old ladies-in-waiting keeping her company: the &quot;Marschallin&quot; Louise-Françoise de Clérambault and the German Eleonore von Venningen (by marriage von Rathsamshausen). She didn&#x27;t like to spend the winter in the Palais Royal (the official residence of her son and his family) because of the bad Parisian air from the smoke from the many chimneys (and &quot;because in the morning you can only smell empty night chairs and chamber pot&quot;) and the bad memories of her marriage:

Although she had not made it a habit to interfere in politics, only one month after the Louis XIV&#x27;s death, Liselotte successfully campaigned for the release of Huguenots who had been sent to the galleys for many years because of their beliefs. 184 people, including many preachers, were released; two years later she managed to release a further 30.

Despite her elevation in status, Liselotte did not share in the country&#x27;s relief after the long rule of Louis XIV; she &quot;was unable to decipher the signs of the times; she saw nothing but the decline and decline of morality, where in reality a new society was born, lively, disrespectful, eager to move and live freely, curious about the joys of the senses and the adventures of the spirit&quot;. For example, she strictly refused to receive visitors who were not properly dressed in courtly regalia:

Most of all, Liselotte was worried about the many intrigues and conspiracies against her son. She loathed the foreign minister and later prime minister, Father Guillaume Dubois (cardinal from 1721) and mistrusted the economist and chief financial controller John Law, who caused a currency devaluation and speculative bubble (the so-called &quot;Mississippi bubble&quot;):

As a clergy advisor, she valued two staunch supporters of the Age of Enlightenment: Archbishop François Fénelon (who fell from grace under Louis XIV) as well as her intermittent confessor Abbé de Saint-Pierre. Etienne de Polier de Bottens, a Huguenot who had followed her from Heidelberg to France, also played a special role as confidante and spiritual advisor. Liselotte, long a marginal figure at court, as the Regent&#x27;s mother, was suddenly a point of contact for many. However, she by no means appreciated this role change:

Liselotte was interested in opera and theatre and followed their development over decades, and was also able to recite long passages by heart. She was well read, as evidenced by many of her letters, and had a library of more than 3,000 volumes, including all the popular French and German novels and plays of her time (Voltaire dedicated his tragedy Oedipe to her), as well as most of the classical Greek and Latin authors (in German and French translation), Luther Bibles, maps with copperplate engravings, travelogues from all over the world as well as the tomes of natural history, medicine and mathematics. She amassed an extensive coin collection, primarily of antique gold coins (it was not her father who inherited the 12,000 copies her father had inherited in Kassel, but her mother), she owned 30 books on coin science and corresponded with Spanheim and other numismatists. She also bought three of the recently invented microscopes, with which she examined insects and other things. She spent her days at court gatherings, writing letters, reading and researching. 

In June 1722, she visited Versailles for the last time, when the 12-year-old Louis XV received his 4-year-old bride Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain. Upon seeing the room in which Louis XIV died, she came to tears:

Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Duchess of Orléans, died on 8 December 1722 at 3:30 a.m. at the Château de Saint-Cloud, aged 70. She was buried in the royal necropolis at the Basilica of Saint-Denis, next to her husband and his first wife. Her son mourned her deeply (only a year later he followed her to the grave), and did not take part in the memorial mass on 18 March 1723. In the funeral sermon she was described as follows:

In his memoirs, Saint-Simon describes her:

==Correspondence==
Liselotte is said to have written an estimated 60,000 letters throughout her life, 2/3 in German and 1/3 in French, of which about 5,000 have survived, and about 850 of these are in French. With this, she surpasses the second great letter writer and contemporary witness of her epoch, Madame de Sévigné with her approximately 1,200 letters.

The letters deal with all aspects of life. They contain vivid and often satirical descriptions of court life, memories of her childhood and youth in Germany, the latest court gossip from all over Europe, reflections on literature and theatre, and thoughts about God and the world. Liselotte sought relief by writing long letters to her relatives in Germany, and the constant exchange became a cure for her inner melancholy and sadness. The letters were also a way of maintaining her German, the language being an important link to her home and cultural identity.

Her German letters were mixed with numerous words and passages in French, especially when she was relaying conversations with Louis XIV, with her husband Philippe or other French members of court. Johannes Kramer describes her letters as &quot;the best studied example of the use of the German language in private letters between members of the high nobility&quot;. Liselotte tended to use coarse formulations, which was not uncommon in letters from princely persons of the 16th and 17th centuries, but in Helmuth Kiesel&#x27;s view she had gone extraordinarily far in this, being psychological in disposition and frivolous in tone. Perhaps her previously reformed faith had contributed to the polemics known to her; in any case, their tone differed greatly from the &quot;Précieuses&quot; of the Parisian salons of their time, and also from the naturalness of the German bourgeois lettering style of the 18th century, as shaped by Christian Fürchtegott Gellert. She liked to draw striking comparisons and often incorporated proverbs or appropriate excerpts from plays. Her favorite saying (and personal motto) is often quoted as: &quot;What cannot be changed, let go as it goes&quot; (&quot;Was nicht zu ändern stehet, laß gehen wie es gehet&quot;)

Unlike Madame de Sévigné, she did not write for the public, but only as direct communication to her correspondents. This may explain the almost unbridled spontaneity and unrestricted intimacy of her style. The letters often appear to have no pretensions and are subject to spontaneous ideas, whereby they make the reader a living companion (W. L. Holland).

Most of the letters are addressed to her aunt Sophia of the Palatinate, Electress of Hanover, whom she wrote twice a week. Sophia&#x27;s strong personality offered her support in difficult life situations; Liselotte had also shaped the atmosphere of the Hanoverian court with her scientific and literary interest, her religious tolerance and her thoughts on morality and virtue in consideration of human inadequacies. After Sophia&#x27;s death in 1714 she complains:

Sophia, however, who had been of a cooler and more calculating nature than her emotional niece, had commented on her letters:

Liselotte&#x27;s half-sister Raugräfin Luise (1661–1733) subsequently became an inadequate replacement for the revered and admired aunt. She had also written regularly to another half-sister, Raugräfin Amalie Elisabeth (&quot;Ameliese&quot;; 1663–1709). She kept a lifelong contact with her Hanoverian educator Anna Katharina von Offen, the governess of the Electress Sophia&#x27;s children, and with her husband, the chief stable master Christian Friedrich von Harling.

Her weekly [French] letters to her daughter, the Duchess of Lorraine were destroyed in a fire on 4 January 1719 at the Château de Lunéville, the country residence of the Dukes of Lorraine. In later years, the wife of the British heir to the throne and later King George II, Caroline of Ansbach, also became an important correspondent, although they never met. Caroline was an orphan who had become a ward of Electress Sophia&#x27;s daughter Sophia Charlotte of Hanover and was married by Sophia to her grandson George in 1705. From her, Liselotte learned all the details about the family quarrels at the English court. She also wrote regularly with the sister of George II and granddaughter of the Electress Sophia, the Prussian Queen Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. Numerous letters to other relatives and acquaintances have also been found, including to Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his librarian Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who had previously been in the service of Sophia and her husband.

She knew that the &quot;Cabinet noir&quot; opened her letters to copy critical passages and translate them; hence, she sometimes even incorporated derisive remarks addressed directly to the government, particularly to her favorite enemy, Foreign Secretary Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquess of Torcy. Her most frank letters are those which she did not send by post, but gave to travellers en route to Germany. In these letters she was able to freely express her frustrations with Monsieur&#x27;s favorites in the Palais Royal and her hatred for Madame de Maintenon.

She describes her stylistic principles in a letter to her half-sister Ameliese:

In her letters, Liselotte also mentioned her dislike for the pompous Baroque style that had become fashionable:

To characterize the nature of her correspondence, she uses the term &quot;chat&quot;. The letters usually consisted of 15 to 30 folded sheets of paper with gilt edging, which she inscribed with large, energetic handwriting. Her biographer Dirk Van der Cruysse says: &quot;Had Madame lived in our time, she would have spent her days on the phone&quot;. Her letters provide us with a unique perspective on court life in the Baroque period and a vivid picture of her personality. Her descriptions of other members of court are often less precise, but much more colorful and humorous than those of Marquis de Dangeau, whose court diary and memoirs made him the official chronicler of the reign of Louis XIV. Nevertheless, she wrote without literary ambitions and not for posterity either: &quot;I write as I speak; because I am too natural to think before I write.&quot; After answering a letter, she burned the letter she had received herself, and probably assumed that the same thing happened to her letters after being read. Fortunately, just under a tenth escaped this fate.

==Nature and appearance==
Liselotte was described as solid and mannish. She possessed the stamina to hunt all day, refusing to wear the mask that Frenchwomen were accustomed to wearing to protect their skin while outdoors. As a result, her face developed a ruddy and weather-beaten look. She walked rapidly, and most courtiers were unable to keep up, save for the King. She had a &quot;no-nonsense&quot; attitude. Her hearty appetite caused her to gain weight as the years went on, and when describing herself she once commented that she would be as good to eat as a roasted suckling pig. Raised as a Protestant, she was not fond of lengthy Latin masses. She remained faithful and was at times outraged by the open infidelity practised by the aristocracy. Her views were frequently the opposite of those prevalent at the French court.

She is known by different names and styles in different languages, either by variations of her given names, such as Charlotte Elisabeth, Elisabeth Charlotte and Liselotte von der Pfalz or variations of her titles and territorial designations, such as &quot;Electoral Princess&quot;, &quot;Princess Palatine&quot;, &quot;of the Palatinate&quot;, &quot;of the Rhine&quot;, &quot;the Palatine&quot;, etc.

The dynastic titles to which she was entitled were &quot;Countess Palatine of the Rhine at Simmern&quot; and &quot;Duchess of Bavaria&quot;. At the royal court of France she was known as the &quot;Princess Palatine Elisabeth Charlotte&quot; prior to her marriage, and afterwards her official title became &quot;Her Royal Highness, Madame, Duchess of Orléans,&quot; though she was more widely known simply as &quot;Madame&quot;, a unique designation she was entitled to as wife of the King&#x27;s younger brother.

==Legacy==
In 1788, some longer excerpts from Liselotte&#x27;s letters appeared for the first time in a French translation, then a few years later in the German original, under the title &quot;Anecdotes from the French Court, especially from the times of Louis XIV and the Duke Regent&quot;. During the French Revolution, it was believed that Liselotte was a key witness to the depravity and frivolity of the Ancien Régime. This &quot;Chronique scandaleuse&quot; became popular in Germany when the editors of the letters succeeded in identifying the author as a moral and honest German princess in the midst of the depraved and frivolous French court life. In her aversion to the French way of life and her enthusiasm for everything German (and especially Palatinate), her published letters followed the pattern of anti-French sentiment in German literature of the 17th century.

In 1791, a new, anonymously edited selection of letters appeared under the title &quot;Confessions of Princess Elisabeth Charlotte of Orléans&quot;. In this publication, she was portrayed as &quot;The good, honest, German woman–without all the pampered and creeping court sensibilities, without all the crookedness and ambiguity of the heart–&quot;, representative of &quot;the more honest times of earlier centuries&quot;, to which the German courts had to return in order to prevent revolution. The Duchess of Orléans thus became a figure of considerable cultural importance in Germany.

Friedrich Karl Julius Schütz published a new selection of the letters in 1820, also emphasizing the &quot;strong contrast between the old, truly German simplicity, loyalty, honesty and efficiency...to the glamour, opulence, etiquette and gallantry, such as the unlimited intriguing spirit and the whole, systematically developed frivolity and hypocrisy of this court, for a full half of a century.&quot;

&quot;In the further course of the 19th century, the letters lost their immediate political relevance, but because of their cultural and historical significance and their German usability, they found equally committed editors and a broad public.&quot; Wolfgang Menzel, who in 1843 edited a volume of letters addressed to her half-sister Raugräfin Luise, saw in the Duchess of Orléans the &quot;simple German woman and the most open soul in the world&quot;, who &quot;only had to watch too much moral corruption... understandable that she sometimes expresses herself about it in the crudest words&quot;. From then on, the letters were widely used as anti-French propaganda by a growing German nationalist movement. Liselotte was stylized as a martyr of the French court and elevated into a national cult figure, by figures such as Paul Heyse, Theodor Schott and Eduard Bodemann.

== Children ==
Liselotte and Philippe I of Orléans had three children together:
* Alexandre Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Valois (2 July 1673 – 16 March 1676). Born at the Château de Saint-Cloud and died at the Palais-Royal before his third birthday. His death has been attributed to bloodletting by the Orléans family&#x27;s doctors; last person to carry the title Duke of Valois.
* Philippe d&#x27;Orléans (2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723). Born at the Château de Saint-Cloud, he was titled Duke of Chartres from birth until becoming Duke of Orléans in 1701; married his first cousin Françoise Marie de Bourbon and had issue; died at the Palace of Versailles; Regent of France and Navarre during the minority of Louis XV of France—the era was known as la Régence.
* Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans (13 September 1676 – 23 December 1744). Born at the Château de Saint-Cloud and married Leopold, Duke of Lorraine in 1698 and had issue; became the Sovereign Princess of Commercy 1737; she died at Commercy; known as &quot;Mademoiselle de Chartres&quot;, a title given her at birth; grandmother of Queen Marie Antoinette.

Liselotte had a warm relationship with her children. She was devastated by the untimely death of her eldest son Alexandre Louis at the age of two. She mourned him for six months before the birth of her daughter, who apparently helped her over the terrible loss.

Her younger son Philippe resembled her in appearance, and also shared her literary, artistic and scientific interests. During his father&#x27;s lifetime and shortly thereafter, his relationship with his mother was distant under the influence of his father and his favorites, and his mother often criticized his debauchery. Later, however, their relationship improved.

==Fashion==
The so-called &quot;palatine&quot; is named after Liselotte; it is a short cape or turned-down collar trimmed with fur, which women use to protect the cleavage and neck from the cold in winter. Originally, she was mocked by the French court because of her &quot;old&quot; furs that she wore when she arrived from Heidelberg, but since she was very popular with the king in the 1670s, the ladies began to imitate this trend during the unusually cold winter of 1676. The result was a womenswear item valued for centuries. When Liselotte wanted to put on her old fur again in November 1718 to see a performance of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus&quot;, to which she was dedicated, she found that it had been eaten by clothes moths. But she took the opportunity to examine the moths under the microscope the next day.

<text>Robert Grandison Leavitt (September 20, 1883 – February 2, 1954) was an American track and field athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1906 Intercalated Games.

Robert Leavitt was a native of Boston, Massachusetts, and attended Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from Williams College in 1907. He never won any major tournament except the Olympic Games.

At Athens, American Hugo Friend was favored to win the gold medal in high hurdles. But Friend stumbled against the first hurdle and was out. Leavitt and Alfred Healey from Great Britain leaped over the hurdles in one rhythm and finished in the same time. After protracted discussion, Olympic officials decided that Leavitt had won by one foot.

<doc id="946918" wikidata="Q3415743" url="?curid=946918" title="RTKL Associates">
<text>RTKL was a global architecture, planning and design firm. The firm was founded in 1946 by Archibald C. Rogers and Francis T. Taliaferro in Rogers’ grandmother’s basement in Annapolis and grew to be one of the largest architectural firms in the world prior to its acquisition by Arcadis NV in 2007. In October 2015, RTKL was formally merged with another Arcadis subsidiary, Seattle-based Callison, to form CallisonRTKL headquartered in Baltimore.

The firm&#x27;s name, RTKL, originated from the initials of its initial members, Rogers, Taliaferro, Kostritsky, and Lamb.

==History==
===20th century===
The firm was founded by Archibald C. Rogers in his grandmother’s basement in Annapolis, Maryland. Francis T. Taliaferro joined shortly afterwards. In 1949, the pair hired Charles E. Lamb, whose design for the Anne Arundel County Girl Scouts Teepee Lodge gained the firm national attention by winning an award from the American Institute of Architects.

Rogers and Taliaferro&#x27;s reputation grew when, in 1954, internationally renowned architect Pietro Belluschi selected the firm as his associate architect for the design of the Church of the Redeemer in Baltimore. The project received an AIA Award of Merit and, in 1986, a special 25-Year Award from the AIA&#x27;s Baltimore Chapter. In 1956, Lamb was made a partner in the firm, which changed its name to Rogers, Taliaferro and Lamb.

The addition of urban design specialist George Kostritsky in 1961 completed the foursome, and the “Rogers, Taliaferro, Kostritsky and Lamb” name was condensed to “RTKL”. In that same year RTKL was commissioned to design the public spaces for the Charles Center, which contributed to Baltimore’s urban renewal movement. Largely because of the success of this involvement, the firm was commissioned to develop downtown plans for Cincinnati, Ohio, Hartford, Connecticut, and Charlotte, North Carolina, among other U.S. cities. The firm continued to expand in the next decades, opening offices across the company and overseas. RTKL also grew through acquisitions. 

===21st century===
In 2000, RTKL acquired Dallas-based FDS International, a health practice ranked among the top ten in the country. Later RTKL bought the Miami-based Howard Snoweiss Design Group, a design company, with an eye towards expanding its business in Latin America and the Caribbean.

In 2007, RTKL became a wholly owned subsidiary of Arcadis NV, an international company that delivers consulting, design, engineering, urban planning, architectural and project management services for infrastructure, environment and buildings.

In August 2010, the firm purchased Beijing-based AHS International, a practice that specialized in healthcare and medical-facility architecture.

In 2011, &quot;Building Design&quot; ranked RTKL’s retail sector first in the world, its planning services third, and its urban design services fifth.

<text>Edmund Germer (August 24, 1901 – August 10, 1987) was a German inventor, recognized as the father of the fluorescent lamp. His father was an accountant. He obtained a doctorate from the University of Berlin in lighting technology.

He applied for a patent for a fluorescent lamp with Friedrich Meyer and Hans J. Spanner on December 10, 1926, which led to . The patent was later purchased by the General Electric Company, which also licensed his patent on the high-pressure mercury-vapor lamp.

The idea of coating the tube of an arc lamp emitting in the ultraviolet with fluorescing powder to transform UV into visible light led to the realization of arc discharge emitters with spectral quality competing with incandescent emitters. Prior to that, the unpleasant color of the emitted light made these lamps unfit for daily use, despite their much higher efficiency.

He co-founded a company that worked on developing inert gas-glowing cathode rectifiers, and subsequently in the 1930s worked as an independent inventor for companies such as Osram and Philips.

After World War II, he was invited by Engelhard Industries, Newark to continue his research.

He and Hans Spanner were each awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Frank P. Brown Medal in 1954.

<text>Reverse sexism is a controversial term for discrimination against men and boys, or for anti-male prejudice.

Reverse sexism has been compared by sociologists to reverse racism and &quot;reverse ethnocentrism&quot; in that both are a form of backlash by members of dominant groups (e.g., men, whites, or Anglos). Reverse sexism is rebutted by analogy with the criticism of reverse racism as a response to affirmative action policies that are designed to combat institutionalized sexism and racism. In more rigid forms, this stance assumes that the historic power imbalance in favor of men has been reversed, and that women are now viewed as the superior gender or sex.

Feminist theorist Florence Rush characterizes the idea of reverse sexism specifically as a misogynist reaction to feminism; men&#x27;s rights activists such as Warren Farrell promote the idea of reverse sexism to argue that the feminist movement has rearranged society in such a way that it now benefits women and harms men.
In the preamble to a study on internalized sexism, Steve Bearman, Neill Korobov and Avril Thorne describe reverse sexism as a &quot;misinformed notion&quot;, stating that &quot;while individual women or women as a whole may enact prejudicial biases towards specific men or toward men as a group, this is done without the backing of a societal system of institutional power&quot;.

<text>Bionics or biologically inspired engineering is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology.

The word &quot;bionic&quot;, coined by Jack E. Steele in August 1958, is a portmanteau from [[biology]] and electronics which was popularized by the 1970s U.S. television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, both based on the novel &quot;Cyborg&quot; by Martin Caidin. All three stories feature humans given various superhuman powers by their electromechanical implants.

According to proponents of bionic technology, the transfer of technology between lifeforms and manufactured objects is desirable because evolutionary pressure typically forces living organisms—fauna and flora—to become optimized and efficient. For example, dirt- and water-repellent paint (coating) was inspired by the hydrophobic properties of the lotus flower plant (the lotus effect).

The term &quot;biomimetic&quot; is preferred for references to chemical reactions, such as reactions that, in nature, involve biological macromolecules (e.g., enzymes or nucleic acids) whose chemistry can be replicated &quot;in vitro&quot; using much smaller molecules. 

Examples of bionics in engineering include the hulls of boats imitating the thick skin of dolphins or sonar, radar, and medical ultrasound imaging imitating animal echolocation.

In the field of computer science, the study of bionics has produced artificial neurons, artificial neural networks, and swarm intelligence. Bionics also influenced Evolutionary computation but took the idea further by simulating evolution in silico and producing optimized solutions that had never appeared in nature.

A 2006 research article estimated that &quot;at present there is only a 12% overlap between biology and technology in terms of the mechanisms used&quot;.

==History==
The name &quot;biomimetics&quot; was coined by Otto Schmitt in the 1950s. The term &quot;bionics&quot; was later introduced by Jack E. Steele in August 1958 while working at the &quot;Aeronautics Division House&quot; at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. However, terms like biomimicry or biomimetics are preferred in order to avoid confusion with the medical term &quot;bionics.&quot; Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel &quot;Cyborg&quot;, which was adapted into the television film and subsequent series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.

== Methods ==

The study of bionics often emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, cybernetics models the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while artificial intelligence models the intelligent function regardless of the particular way it can be achieved.

The conscious copying of examples and mechanisms from natural organisms and ecologies is a form of applied case-based reasoning, treating nature itself as a database of solutions that already work. Proponents argue that the selective pressure placed on all natural life forms minimizes and removes failures.

Although almost all engineering could be said to be a form of biomimicry, the modern origins of this field are usually attributed to Buckminster Fuller and its later codification as a house or field of study to Janine Benyus.

There are generally three biological levels in the fauna or flora after which technology can be modeled:
*Mimicking natural methods of manufacture
*Imitating mechanisms found in nature (e.g. velcro)
*Studying organizational principles from the social behavior of organisms, such as the flocking behavior of birds, optimization of ant foraging and bee foraging, and the swarm intelligence (SI)-based behavior of a school of fish.

== Examples ==
* In robotics, bionics and biomimetics are used to apply the way animals move to the design of robots. BionicKangaroo was based on the movements and physiology of kangaroos.
*Velcro is the most famous example of biomimetics. In 1948, the Swiss engineer George de Mestral was cleaning his dog of burrs picked up on a walk when he realized how the hooks of the burrs clung to the fur.
*The horn-shaped, saw-tooth design for lumberjack blades used at the turn of the 19th century to cut down trees when it was still done by hand was modeled after observations of a wood-burrowing beetle. The blades were significantly more efficient and thus revolutionized the timber industry.
*Cat&#x27;s eye reflectors were invented by Percy Shaw in 1935 after studying the mechanism of cat eyes. He had found that cats had a system of reflecting cells, known as tapetum lucidum, which was capable of reflecting the tiniest bit of light.
*Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s flying machines and ships are early examples of drawing from nature in engineering.
*Resilin is a replacement for rubber that has been created by studying the material also found in arthropods.
*Julian Vincent drew from the study of pinecones when he developed in 2004 &quot;smart&quot; clothing that adapts to changing temperatures. &quot;I wanted a nonliving system which would respond to changes in moisture by changing shape,&quot; he said. &quot;There are several such systems in plants, but most are very small—the pinecone is the largest and therefore the easiest to work on.&quot; Pinecones respond to higher humidity by opening their scales (to disperse their seeds). The &quot;smart&quot; fabric does the same thing, opening up when the wearer is warm and sweating and shutting tight when cold.
*&quot;Morphing aircraft wings&quot; that change shape according to the speed and duration of flight were designed in 2004 by biomimetic scientists from Penn State University. The morphing wings were inspired by different bird species that have differently shaped wings according to the speed at which they fly. In order to change the shape and underlying structure of the aircraft wings, the researchers needed to make the overlying skin also be able to change, which their design does by covering the wings with fish-inspired scales that could slide over each other. In some respects this is a refinement of the swing-wing design.
*Some paints and roof tiles have been engineered to be self-cleaning by copying the mechanism from the Nelumbo lotus.
* Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are the thin-film material often used to fabricate fish tank thermometers or mood rings that change color with temperature changes. They change color because their molecules are arranged in a helical or chiral arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different wavelengths of light. Chiral Photonics, Inc. has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted glass fiber.
*Nanostructures and physical mechanisms that produce the shining color of butterfly wings were reproduced in silico by Greg Parker, professor of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and research student Luca Plattner in the field of photonics, which is electronics using photons as the information carrier instead of electrons.
* The wing structure of the blue morpho butterfly was studied and the way it reflects light was mimicked to create an RFID tag that can be read through water and on metal.
* The wing structure of butterflies has also inspired the creation of new nanosensors to detect explosives.
*Neuromorphic chips and silicon retinae have wiring that is modeled after real neural networks. 
* Techno Ecosystems or &#x27;Eco Cyborg&#x27; systems involve the coupling of natural ecological processes to technological ones which mimic ecological functions. This results in the creation of a self-regulating hybrid system. Research into this field was initiated by Howard T. Odum, who perceived the structure and energy dynamics of ecosystems as being analogous to energy flow between components of an electrical circuit.
* Medical adhesives involving glue and tiny nano-hairs are being developed based on the physical structures found in the feet of geckos.
* Computer viruses also show similarities with biological viruses, attacking program-oriented information towards self-reproduction and dissemination.
* The cooling system of the Eastgate Centre building in Harare was modeled after a termite mound to achieve very efficient passive cooling.
* Adhesive which allows mussels to stick to rocks, piers, and boat hulls inspired bioadhesive gel for blood vessels.
*The field of bionics has inspired new aircraft designs which offer greater agility along with other advantages. This has been described by Geoff Spedding, Måns Rosén, and Anders Hedenström in an article in &quot;Journal of Experimental Biology&quot;. Similar statements were also made by John Videler and Eize Stamhuis in their book &quot;Avian Flight,&quot; and in the article they present in &quot;Science&quot; about LEVs. This research in bionics may also be used to create more efficient helicopters or miniature UAVs, as stated by Bret Tobalske in an article in &quot;Science&quot; about Hummingbirds. UC Berkeley as well as ESA have been working in a similar direction and created the Robofly (a miniature UAV) and the Entomopter (a UAV which can walk, crawl and fly).
*A bio-inspired mechanical device can generate plasma in water via cavitation using the morphological accurate snapping shrimp claw. This was described in detail by Xin Tang and David Staack in an article published in &quot;Science Advances&quot;.

== Specific uses of the term ==
=== In medicine ===
Bionics refers to the flow of concepts from biology to engineering and vice versa. Hence, there are two slightly different points of view regarding the meaning of the word.

In medicine, bionics means the replacement or enhancement of organs or other body parts by mechanical versions. Bionic implants differ from mere prostheses by mimicking the original function very closely, or even surpassing it.

The German equivalent of bionics, &quot;Bionik&quot;, always adheres to the broader meaning, in that it tries to develop engineering solutions from biological models. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological solutions will usually be optimized by evolutionary forces.

While the technologies that make bionic implants possible are developing gradually, a few successful bionic devices already exist, a well known one being the Australian-invented multi-channel cochlear implant (bionic ear), a device for deaf people. Since the bionic ear, many bionic devices have emerged and work is progressing on bionics solutions for other sensory disorders (e.g. vision and balance). Bionic research has recently provided treatments for medical problems such as neurological and psychiatric conditions, for example Parkinson&#x27;s disease and epilepsy.

In 1997, Colombian researcher Alvaro Rios Poveda developed an upper limb and hand prosthesis with sensory feedback. This technology allows amputee patients to handle prosthetic hand systems in a more natural way.

By 2004 fully functional artificial hearts were developed. Significant progress is expected with the advent of nanotechnology. A well-known example of a proposed nanodevice is a respirocyte, an artificial red cell designed (though not yet built) by Robert Freitas.

During his eight years in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, Kwabena Boahen developed a silicon retina that was able to process images in the same manner as a living retina. He confirmed the results by comparing the electrical signals from his silicon retina to the electrical signals produced by a salamander eye while the two retinas were looking at the same image.

On July 21, 2015, the BBC&#x27;s medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reported, &quot;surgeons in Manchester have performed the first bionic eye implant in a patient with the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. Ray Flynn, 80, has dry age-related macular degeneration which has led to the total loss of his central vision. He is using a retinal implant that converts video images from a miniature video camera worn on his glasses. He can now make out the direction of white lines on a computer screen using the retinal implant.&quot; The implant, known as the Argus II and manufactured in the US by the company Second Sight Medical Products, had been used previously in patients who were blind as the result of the rare inherited degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa.

In 2016,Tilly Lockey (born October 7, 2005) was fitted with a pair of bionic &quot;Hero Arms&quot; manufactured by OpenBionics, a UK bionics enterprise. The Hero Arm is a lightweight myoelectric prosthesis for below-elbow amputee adults and children aged eight and above. Tilly Lockey, who at 15 months had both her arms amputated after being diagnosed with meningococcal sepsis strain B, describes the Hero Arms as “really realistic, to the point where it was quite creepy how realistic they were.” 

On February 17, 2020, Darren Fuller, a military veteran, became the first person to receive a bionic arm under a public healthcare system. Fuller lost the lower section of his right arm while serving term in Afghanistan during an incident that involved mortar ammunition in 2008.

=== Other uses ===

Business biomimetics is the latest development in the application of biomimetics. Specifically it applies principles and practice from biological systems to business strategy, process, organization design, and strategic thinking. It has been successfully used by a range of industries in FMCG, defense, central government, packaging, and business services. Based on the work by Phil Richardson at the University of Bath the approach was launched at the House of Lords in May 2009.

Generally, biometrics is used as a creativity technique that studies biological prototypes to get ideas for engineering solutions. 

In chemistry, a biomimetic synthesis is a chemical synthesis inspired by biochemical processes.

Another, more recent meaning of the term bionics refers to merging organism and machine. This approach results in a hybrid system combining biological and engineering parts, which can also be referred as a cybernetic organism (cyborg). Practical realization of this was demonstrated in Kevin Warwick&#x27;s implant experiments bringing about ultrasound input via his own nervous system.

<doc id="946946" wikidata="Q918815" url="?curid=946946" title="Radimichs">
<text>The Radimichs (also Radimichi) (, , and ) were an East Slavic tribe of the last several centuries of the 1st millennium, which inhabited upper east parts of the Dnieper down the Sozh and its tributaries. The name probably derives from the name of the forefather of the tribe - Radim. According to Russian chronicle tradition, &quot;... but there were Radimichs from the Lechites family, who came and settled here and paid tribute to Rus, and the wagon was carried to the present day&quot; (a &quot;wagon&quot; is a type of tax for the right to have one&#x27;s own prince). However, in the scientific literature, there is no consensus on the ethnicity of the Radimichs. Archaeological evidence indicates that this tribal association had a mixed Slavic-Baltic origin.

The Radimichs lived in the interfluve of the upper Dnieper and Desna rivers along the Sozh and its tributaries (the south of Vitebsk, the east of the Mogilev and Gomel regions of modern Belarus, the west of the Bryansk and south-west of the Smolensk regions of modern Russia. Written evidence on Radimichi falls on the period from 885 to 1169.

==History==
The lands of the Radimichs were conveniently connected with the central regions of the Kievan Rus by waterway. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Radimichs had a few known cities: Gomey (today&#x27;s Homel) and Chechersk on the Sozh river, Vshchizh on the Desna River, Vorobyin, Ropeysk, Starodub, and others. Seven-beam temporal jewelry made of bronze or silver represent a specific ethnic trait of the Radimichs of the 9th - 11th centuries.

There is little information on the Radimichs. According to Nestor the Chronicler, the tribe of Radimichs &quot;sprang from the &quot;Lyakhs&quot;&quot; or after the conquest by Vladimir the Great became part of the race of &quot;Lyakhs&quot; (Lendians) and used to live in areas of Sozh river. According to tradition recorded by Nestor, their name derives from the name of the forefather of the tribe, Radim, who was one of the Lyakh brothers, other being Vyatko from whom emerged Vyatichi.

Historians know that in the middle of the 9th century they were paying tribute to the Khazars. In 885, the Radimichs were conquered by Prince Oleg of Novgorod and became part of Kievan Rus. In 907, the Radimichs are mentioned as a part of Oleg&#x27;s army in his military campaign against Byzantine empire. In 984, the Radimichs tried to break away from the Kievan Rus, but were defeated on the Pischan River by Vladimir the Great&#x27;s commander Volchiy Khvost (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Tail&quot;). Since then, there had been no mentioning of the tribe in the chronicles. They continued living on their land, gradually assimilating with neighboring tribes and peoples and forming the Belarusian nationality. Subsequently, the lands of the Radimichs became a part of the Chernihiv and Smolensk principalities.

In the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, it is recorded that the Radimichs, Vyatichi, and Severians &quot;had the same customs&quot;, all lived violent lifestyles, &quot;burned their dead and preserved the ashes in urns set upon posts beside the highways&quot;, and they did not enter monogamous marriages but practiced polygamy, specifically polygyny, instead.

The Radimichs were last mentioned in a chronicle in 1169.

== Origin ==
The Tale of Bygone Years tells about the Lechites origin of the Radimichi: “…radimichi bo… from the Lechites” and “The former Radimichi from the Lechites family; before that, you are all-powerful, and pay tribute to Russia ”. These words of the chronicler had a great influence on many researchers. Medieval Polish chroniclers - Jan Długosz, Maciej Stryjkowski and others, as well as historians of the 18th and 19th centuries unconditionally recognized the Polish origin of the Radimichi.

Aleksey Shakhmatov tried to support the annalistic report about the Lechites origin of the Radimichi with linguistic data, referring to the fact that the Radimichi region now belongs to the territory of Belarusian language, in which there are many coincidences with the Polish.

However Yefim Karsky spoke out against the theory of the Lechites origin of the Radimichi, showing the independent development of those features of the Belarusian language that bring it closer to the Polish. According to Karsky, the chronicle of the Lyash origin of the Radimichi does not indicate that they were a Lyash tribe, but that they moved to Sozh from more western regions, where they neighbored with the Lyash tribes. This opinion was also supported by Lubor Niederle, who considered the basins of Bug and Nareva.

Repeated attempts were made to determine the area from which the Radimichi came to Sozh by mapping toponyms with the base &quot;rad-&quot;. However, such toponyms, apparently, come from anthroponym &quot;Radim&quot;, distributed over a much larger territory than the defined regions.

On the basis of hydronymics data, it was possible to establish some similarity between the hydronyms of Sozh area and the hydronyms of a small section of the Upper Dniester region that, according to some historians, is the area from which the Radimichi moved to the Sozh basin.

The connection between the Radimichi and the pre-Radimichi population of Sozh area, observed both in objects of material culture and in rites, suggests that the newcomer Slavs felt the influence of the Baltic population here. It is also possible to make an assumption about the small number of alien Slavs.

Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared the basis of the ethnonym &quot;Radimichi&quot; with the Iranian Scythian stem &quot;radam-&quot; from the Iranian &quot;fratama-&quot; &lt; &quot;*pratama-&quot; &quot;first&quot;, used in the Scythian royal names (&#x27; &quot;Radam-furt-&quot;, &quot;Radam-sad-&quot;, &quot;Radam-as-&quot;, &quot;Radam-mizda-&quot;, etc.). Georgy Vernadsky derived the name &quot;radimichi&quot; from - &quot;order&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, - &quot;to subdue&quot;, &quot;to conquer&quot;. believed that the term &quot;radimichi&quot; was formed from the historically earlier name of the Baltic ethnic community, which was Slavicized by the 9th-10th centuries.

The chronicle tells about the origin of the Radimichi from the legendary person Radima: “... Radimichi Bo and Vyatichi from the Poles. For 2 brothers in laces, Radim, and the other Vyatko, and the gray-haired Radim came to Szhya, and was called Radimichi ... ”. Some modern authors believe that this legend reflects the biblical worldview of the author rather than a real historical fact.

<text>Augusto Hamann Rademaker Grünewald (11 May 1905 – 13 September 1985) was a Brazilian admiral. Rademaker was one of the leaders of the Military Junta (30 August 1969 – 30 October 1969) that ruled Brazil between the illness of Artur da Costa e Silva in August 1969 and the investiture ceremony of Emílio Garrastazu Médici in October of that same year, elected by fellow officer generals and confirmed by the Congress. In the same occasions Rademaker was picked and &quot;elected&quot; as vice president for the same term as Medici&#x27;s (1969–1974).

During his tenure as vice president he was awarded one of Portugal&#x27;s highest honors, the Grand-Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword on 26 July 1972. Before, in his capacity as Minister of the Navy, he was awarded the Grand-Cross of the Order of Aviz, Portugal&#x27;s sole order reserved for military officials.

<text>A telephone line or telephone circuit (or just line or circuit industrywide) is a single-user circuit on a telephone communication system. It is designed to reproduce speech of a quality that is understandable. It is the physical wire or other signaling medium connecting the user&#x27;s telephone apparatus to the telecommunications network, and usually also implies a single telephone number for billing purposes reserved for that user. 

Telephone lines are used to deliver consistent landline telephone service and digital subscriber line (DSL) phone cable service to the premises. Telephone overhead lines are connected to the public switched telephone network. The voltage at a subscriber&#x27;s network interface is typically 48 V between the ring and tip wires, with tip near ground and ring at –48 V.

== In the United States ==
In 1878, the Bell Telephone Company began using two-wire circuits, called the local loop, from each user&#x27;s telephone to end offices, which performed any necessary electrical switching to allow voice signals to be transmitted to more distant telephones.

These wires were typically copper, although aluminium has also been used, and were carried in balanced pairs of open wire, separated by about 25 cm (10″) on poles above the ground, and later as twisted pair cables. Modern lines may run underground and may carry analog or digital signals to the exchange. They may also have a device that converts the analog signal to digital for transmission on a carrier system. Often, the customer end of that wire pair is connected to a data access arrangement,
and the telephone company end of that wire pair is connected to a telephone hybrid.

In most cases, two copper wires (tip and ring) for each telephone line run from a home or other small building to a local telephone exchange. There is a central junction box for the building where the wires that go to telephone jacks throughout the building and wires that go to the exchange meet and can be connected in different configurations depending upon the subscribed telephone service. The wires between the junction box and the exchange are known as the local loop, and the network of wires going to an exchange is known as the access network.

The vast majority of houses in the U.S. are wired with 6-position modular jacks with four conductors (6P4C) wired to the house&#x27;s junction box with copper wires. Those copper wires may be connected back to two telephone overhead lines at the local telephone exchange, thus making those jacks RJ14 jacks. More often, only two of the wires are connected to the exchange as one telephone line, and the others are unconnected. In that case, the jacks in the house are RJ11.

Older houses often have 4-conductor telephone station cable in the walls color coded with Bell System colors: red, green, yellow, and black as 2-pairs of 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper; &quot;line 1&quot; uses the red/green pair and &quot;line 2&quot; uses the yellow/black pair.
Inside the walls of the house—between the house&#x27;s outside junction box and the interior wall jacks—the most common telephone cable in new houses is Category 5 cable—4 pairs of 24 AWG (0.205 mm2) solid copper.

Inside large buildings, and in the outdoor cables that run to the telephone company POP, many telephone lines are bundled together in a single cable using the 25-pair color code. Outside plant cables can have up to 3,600 or 3,800 pairs, used at the entrances of telephone exchanges.

<text>Challenge is a British free-to-air television channel owned by Sky Group&#x27;s Sky UK subsidiary, themselves owned by American conglomerate Comcast. The channel is dedicated to game shows from the UK, including acquired classic and contemporary shows.

Challenge is currently available on terrestrial television and FAST platforms, such as Samsung TV Plus, along with sister channel Sky Mix. An Irish feed has been available since November 2013 on cable and satellite. It later launched on DTT (Saorview) on 1 February 2023; joining sister channel Sky News on the service.

==History==
===As The Family Channel===
The Family Channel was a domestic version of the American cable network of the same name (now known as Freeform), then-owned by U.S. firm International Family Entertainment; which was the spin-off of the Christian Broadcasting Network that operated the channel. Prior to its launch, IFE sold a 39% stake in the channel to the UK-based Flextech (later to be known as Virgin Media Television, and the Living TV Group) in June 1993. The Family Channel was then launched on 1 September 1993.

In April 1996, IFE sold its remaining 61% share to Flextech, giving them full ownership of the venture and production studio in Maidstone.

=== Relaunch as Challenge TV ===
Flextech planned to relaunch The Family Channel as &quot;The Challenge Channel&quot; during the autumn of 1996, with daytime targeted towards housewives, and evening and weekend programming focused on game shows. However, Flextech decided to delay the relaunch so it would not compete with the October 1996 launch of Granada Sky Broadcasting&#x27;s suite of channels; which included the potential competitor Granada Good Life. Instead, The Family Channel began transitioning to the new brand by introducing a weekend game show strand known as &quot;Family Challenge Weekend&quot;. On 3 February 1997, The Family Channel rebranded as Challenge TV, devoting the majority of its lineup to game shows.

On 28 March 2002, Flextech announced that they would rebrand Challenge TV as Challenge? on 20 May. In addition, Sky Digital (now known as Sky UK) customers could play some shows from home to earn a spot on the Challenge? leaderboard, with the highest scorers earning prizes. Flextech also announced that these interactive services would come to digital cable later in 2002. A year later, on 30 June 2003, the question mark was dropped from the channel&#x27;s name, subsequently rebranding it as simply Challenge.

On 13 December 2004, a one-hour timeshift of Challenge, known as Challenge +1, launched on Sky Digital.

In May 2005, with the success of its recently-added gambling-related programmes, Challenge launched a dedicated strand titled Player. The block would air from 10:00pm every night, and feature live poker, as well as scripted series and films.

On 2 March 2006, Player was spun-off to its own channel, which became a sister channel to Bravo. On 28 September, Player was rebranded as Bravo 2. 

On 1 July 2008, a new sister channel called Challenge Jackpot was launched as a joint-venture between parent company Virgin Media Television and Two Way Media.

===Under Sky UK===
On 7 April 2009, Virgin Media formally began the sale of its content operation. On 13 July 2010, Sky UK and Virgin Media announced that the former had completed its acquisition of Virgin Media Television following regulatory approval in the Republic of Ireland.

In March 2010, NetPlay TV, who acquired Two-Way Media in April 2009, terminated their agreement with to run Challenge Jackpot; the venture would be fully sold to NetPlay.

On 15 September, Sky announced the closure of Bravo, Bravo 2 and Channel One. On Tuesday 1 February 2011, Challenge replaced Channel One&#x27;s Freeview space on the Freeview multiplex; expanding the viewership of the channel by making it free-to-air around the United Kingdom.

On 25 January 2011, it was announced that professional wrestling programming from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) would start broadcasting on Challenge from 3 February 2011. In addition to airing &quot;Impact&quot; and &quot;Xplosion&quot;, Challenge aired reality series &quot;TNA British Boot Camp&quot;, and delayed broadcasts of TNA pay-per-view events. On 30 January 2014, for the first time, &quot;Impact&quot; was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Challenge before it aired in the United States.

On Monday 3 December 2012, Challenge launched on the free-to-air satellite platform Freesat.

On 7 October 2013, the channel went through a revamp, which included a new logo, and a set of animated characters, named the &quot;Challengers&quot;, as idents to represent each type of show; such as Les Play for classics, Ellie for lighter physical shows or Cecil the Geek for science shows.

By 2017, Challenge would drop all wrestling programming. 

On 1 June 2020, Challenge +1 was closed on all platforms.

On 12 November 2020, Challenge broadcast football for the first time, when it showed the Northern Ireland v Slovakia UEFA Euro 2020 playoff final match.

==Programming==

Current programming seen on Challenge, as of November 2024, includes &quot;The Chase&quot; (presently, the most frequently aired show on the channel), &quot;Bullseye&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, and &quot;Bruce&#x27;s Price is Right&quot; &amp; &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;. The channel has also produced its own original programmes, including revivals of &quot;Bullseye&quot; and &quot;Blockbusters&quot;.

Challenge has previously broadcast general interest programming (including the BBC blooper show &quot;Auntie&#x27;s Bloomers&quot; from 2009 to 2011), and was the former UK rights holder for U.S professional wrestling company TNA.

<doc id="946972" wikidata="Q2352316" url="?curid=946972" title="M-10 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-10 is a state trunkline highway in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan in the United States. Nominally labeled north-south, the route follows a northwest-southeast alignment. The southernmost portion follows Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit, and the southern terminus is at the intersection of Jefferson and M-3 (Randolph Street) next to the entrance to the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel. The northern terminus is in West Bloomfield Township at the intersection with Orchard Lake Road. The highway has several names as it runs through residential and commercial areas of the west side of Detroit and into the suburb of Southfield. It is called the John C. Lodge Freeway (The Lodge), James Couzens Highway, and Northwestern Highway. One segment has also been named the Aretha Franklin Memorial Highway.

M-10 was built in segments through the late 1950s and early 1960s. It carried several different names before the entire route was finally officially named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987. The freeway has carried a few other highway designations. The southern segment was part of US Highway 12 (US 12) and the whole road was later renumbered Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696). From 1970 until 1986, it was part of US 10, and the freeway has been M-10 since. The non-freeway segment that runs between I-696 in Southfield and Orchard Lake Road was previously numbered M-4. M-10 was named after John C. Lodge, an influential Detroiter and Mayor of Detroit from 1927–28.

==Route description==
Running about in the Metro Detroit area, M-10 runs roughly northwest–southeast from Downtown Detroit into the northern suburbs in Oakland County. The entire length of the highway is listed as a part of the National Highway System, a system of roads importance to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense and mobility. As a state trunkline highway, the roadway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), and it includes approximately of freeway. M-10 has six lanes from Detroit to Inkster Road in Farmington Hills, where it drops to four; a few segments have eight lanes for short distances between interchanges. According to the department, 28,964 vehicles use M-10 on average near on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, and 139,800 vehicles do so between US 24 (Telegraph Road) and Lahser Road in Southfield, the lowest and highest traffic counts along the highway in 2013, respectively.

===Detroit===

M-10 starts at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Randolph Street in Downtown Detroit, an intersection that also marks the southern end of M-3 and the western end of Business Spur I-375. This intersection is also the access to the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel between the Renaissance Center and the Old Mariners&#x27; Church. From here, M-10 runs west-southwesterly parallel to the Detroit River on Jefferson Avenue past Hart Plaza. At the intersection with Woodward Avenue, M-10 transitions onto the John C. Lodge Freeway, which runs under Huntington Place, home of the North American International Auto Show each January. The freeway turns north-northwesterly and away from the Detroit River next to the former site of Joe Louis Arena. North of this curve, M-10 forms the boundary between Downtown Detroit to the east and the Corktown neighborhood to the west. The freeway has a pair of service drives as it leaves the commercial areas near the MGM Grand Detroit and the interchange with I-75 (Fisher Freeway).

North of I-75, M-10 forms the border between North Corktown (west) and Midtown Detroit (east). The freeway passes the MotorCity Casino at the interchange with Grand River Avenue. The rest of its route in this part of the city passes through residential zones. Near the interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway), M-10 passes the campus of Wayne State University. M-10 intersects I-94 at the first freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States. North of I-94, the Lodge Freeway is the border between the West Side and New Center. This area is residential on either side of the freeway north of the campus of the Henry Ford Hospital. North of Clairmount Avenue, M-10 curves to the northwest before resuming its north-northwesterly course near Chicago Boulevard. North of Webb Avenue, the freeway follows the western city limits of Highland Park, an enclave within the city of Detroit. M-10 intersects M-8 where it transitions between Davison Avenue and the Davison Freeway on the western edge of Highland Park before the Lodge Freeway curves around to run due west.

M-10 runs for about on this due westward course before it intersects Wyoming Avenue and turns northwest. The frontage roads change names from John C. Lodge Service Drive to James Couzens Freeway at the Wyoming Avenue interchange. The freeway continues for another with interchanges for local streets in this part of Detroit, including 7 Mile Road. At the interchange with M-102 (8 Mile Road), the freeway crosses out of Detroit and Wayne County into Southfield in Oakland County.

===Oakland County===

The service drives change names again to Northwestern Highway upon crossing into Oakland County. The east side of M-10 is flanked by the former Northland Shopping Center and a campus of Oakland Community College; the west side is residential. About into Southfield, M-10 intersects the northern end of M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and 9 Mile Road. The adjacent properties are mostly residential, but there are some commercial areas centered around the various Mile Roads, such as the campus of Lawrence Technological University at 10 Mile Road. Near Lahser and 11 Mile roads, M-10 meets I-696 (Reuther Freeway) and US 24 (Telegraph Road) in a complex interchange called the Mixing Bowl. This interchange spans over near the American Center. The carriageways for I-696 run in the median of M-10 while partial interchanges connect to Lahser and Franklin roads on either end of the various ramps that connect to I-696 and US 24.

Northwest of this interchange, M-10 transitions to a boulevard with Michigan lefts. Called just Northwestern Highway, M-10 runs through suburban residential areas of Southfield. At the intersection with Inkster Road, the highway clips the southwest corner of the city of Franklin and enters the northeastern corner of Farmington Hills. The roadway is lined with commercial properties while just behind them are residential subdivisions and two golf courses. At the intersection with 14 Mile Road, Northwestern Highway crosses into West Bloomfield Township, and further on, the highway ends at Orchard Lake Road.

==History==

===Previous designations===

In 1919, the state numbered its highways for the first time. In the initial allocation of numbers, M-10 was assigned to a highway that started at the Ohio state line south of Monroe, ran northeasterly along Telegraph Road into Dearborn and turned easterly into Detroit. From there, the highway turned north along Woodward Avenue through Pontiac and Dixie Highway through Flint and Saginaw to Bay City. Then M-10 ran along the Saginaw Bay to Standish and turned to follow the Lake Huron shoreline, with some substantial deviations inland. The highway generally followed the lakeshore as far north as Alpena and Rogers City, and from there, M-10 ran due west through Onaway before turning north into Cheboygan. The last section of M-10 followed the Lake Huron shoreline to Mackinaw City, where it terminated. This designation lasted until November 11, 1926, when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. In Michigan&#x27;s initial allocation of highways, four new designations replaced M-10: US 24 from the state line north to Dearborn, US 112 between Dearborn and Detroit, US 10 from Detroit to Saginaw, and US 23 from Saginaw to Mackinaw City. At the time, no M-10 designation was reassigned to any other roads.
The second iteration of M-10 was designated in 1929 on a much shorter segment of the original M-10 through the Flint area, serving as a business connection for the city as the through route, US 10, bypassed it on the east. It was later redesignated as Business US 10 (Bus. US 10) in 1941, and then as Bus. M-54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974.
===Current designation===
During the 1950s, the Lodge Freeway was proposed to run from Detroit as far as the Fenton–Clio Expressway (US 23) at Fenton and was to play a significant role in the city’s greater plan for urban renewal. Ardent supporters of freeway construction, such as Mayor Albert Cobo, argued that improved access to the city&#x27;s downtown from the suburbs and outer residential areas would allow for the easy transportation of goods, services, and workers, ultimately bolstering the city&#x27;s economy. The Lodge Freeway portion carved through mostly white, upper middle class neighborhoods of central and northwestern Detroit as well as economically distressed white areas closer to downtown and the western edge of Detroit&#x27;s Chinese neighborhood. Although Detroit city planners were careful to not disrupt middle-class White residential areas in construction, they showed little concern for Black neighborhoods, especially those that stood in the way of the main thoroughfare into downtown, which were small. In fact, the destruction of Black communities in many cases was seen to be positive, &quot;a handy device for razing slums&quot;. The first stretch of the Lodge Freeway leveled large portions of the densely populated Lower West Side, the increasingly Black area bordering Twelfth Street, and a 15-block area of mixed Black and Jewish bordering Highland Park. The construction of the freeway partitioned communities in half and by 1950, 423 single family residences, 109 businesses, 22 manufacturing plants, and 93 vacant lots had been condemned. By 1958, from its terminus in downtown Detroit to Wyoming Ave (about ), 2,222 more buildings had been destroyed.

The interchange with the Edsel Ford Freeway, next to Wayne State University, occasionally called the Ford–Lodge interchange, was built in 1953; it was the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange built in the United States. Engineers at the time rejected the conventional design to connect two freeways, the cloverleaf as too hazardous, instead initially preferring a rotary interchange. Such a design would only accommodate 3,000 vehicles per hour, far less than what the Michigan engineers anticipated, so the design was changed to a full interchange, with ramps on both the right and left sides of the roadways. This &quot;right-to-go-right-left-to-go-left&quot; design was considered progressive for its time. The interchange, which cost $15.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build and used 14 bridges to complete its connections, was heralded as an engineering marvel. The interchange opened in stages during 1955. At the time, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that the rush of traffic created &quot;a haze of concrete dust&quot; as traffic passed through, but by the next day, the interchange was the site of traffic jams and head-on collisions because of bad design, according to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

The freeway was dedicated on November 7, 1957, and opened without any state trunkline designation between downtown and the Wyoming Curve. The section from the Edsel Ford Freeway (now I-94) into downtown Detroit was designated as US 12 by the middle of 1960.

Between September 5 and December 5, 1961, the Lodge Freeway&#x27;s partial interchange with Greenlawn Avenue was closed on a 90-day trial basis, due to concerns from local citizens over an exit leading directly into a residential area. When the trial basis expired, the Detroit Streets and Traffic Commission ruled to keep the ramps permanently closed.

The freeway was then redesignated Business Spur I-696 (BS I-696) in 1962, and the next year the freeway was extended northwesterly along James Couzens Highway and Northwestern Highway into Southfield, connecting with the completed first phase of I-696 that opened in 1963-64. That designation remained until 1970 when US 10 was shifted off Woodward Avenue to follow the Lodge Freeway between downtown Detroit and Telegraph Road, replacing the BS I-696 designation.
An extension to the Northwestern Highway was again proposed in 1966 to connect with the proposed I-275 extension. The I-275 project was then cancelled in 1977. The section of Northwestern Highway under state control between the West Bloomfield Township–Farmington Hills border into Southfield was numbered M-4 in 1979.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the mid-1980s to truncate US 10 to Bay City. The request was approved on October 11, 1985, and the signage was changed the next year. After the change, the Lodge Freeway was redesignated M-10. The non-freeway Northwestern Highway, until then designated M-4, was also renumbered as M-10. The southernmost portion of the Lodge Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I-375 from I-75 south. By the next year however, the southern end of M-10 was moved to the corner of Jefferson and Randolph, placing all of the Lodge Freeway as part of M-10.

From 2006 to 2007, the Lodge underwent major reconstruction to ease traffic congestion in the metro area, temporarily closing down much of the freeway. The $133 million project (equivalent to $ in ) included concrete pavement reconstruction and rehabilitation, new barrier walls, repairs or replacements to 50 bridges, upgrades to 22 ramps, utility upgrades, and replacement of freeway signs between Lahser Road in Southfield and Jefferson Avenue in Detroit.

==Memorial highway names==
Starting in 1924, officials in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from Detroit to run northwesterly across the state to Ludington, bisecting the angle created by Woodward and Grand River avenues. This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when it was built in 1929 to an endpoint at 14 Mile Road. Further construction on Northwestern Highway was halted by the Great Depression.

The freeway segment northwest of Wyoming Avenue to the county line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. That street was named after the death of James J. Couzens. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit&#x27;s Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is said not to have accepted a salary, giving it all to charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.

John C. Lodge was a member of the constitutional convention which drafted the Michigan Constitution of 1908, a former member of the Michigan Legislature and Detroit alderman and councilman. He later served as Mayor of Detroit in 1918–1919 before returned to the City Common Council from 1932 to 1947. He was then elected to the Wayne County Board of Supervisors from 1948 until 1950. In total, he held elective office longer than anyone in city history. He died on February 6, 1950, and the future Lodge Freeway was named in his honor on January 20, 1953. The entire freeway, including segments previously named for James Couzens and the Northwestern Highway was named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987, although the service drives retained their original names.

In 2019, the section between Livernois and I-94 was named the Aretha Franklin Memorial Highway after Detroit native Aretha Franklin. The singer, who died the previous year, got her start in Detroit singing at a local church before embarking on a six-decade career that earned her 18 Grammy awards. She was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and received the National Medal of Arts (1999), the Kennedy Center Honors (1994) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2005). Franklin was also an activist in the Civil Rights Movement.

<doc id="946975" wikidata="Q37105" url="?curid=946975" title="Line (geometry)">
<text>In geometry, a straight line, usually abbreviated line, is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or curvature, an idealization of such physical objects as a straightedge, a taut string, or a ray of light. Lines are spaces of dimension one, which may be embedded in spaces of dimension two, three, or higher. The word &quot;line&quot; may also refer, in everyday life, to a line segment, which is a part of a line delimited by two points (its &quot;endpoints&quot;).

Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; defines a straight line as a &quot;breadthless length&quot; that &quot;lies evenly with respect to the points on itself&quot;, and introduced several postulates as basic unprovable properties on which the rest of geometry was established. Euclidean line and &quot;Euclidean geometry&quot; are terms introduced to avoid confusion with generalizations introduced since the end of the 19th century, such as non-Euclidean, projective, and affine geometry.

== Properties ==
In the Greek deductive geometry of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, a general &quot;line&quot; (now called a &quot;curve&quot;) is defined as a &quot;breadthless length&quot;, and a &quot;straight line&quot; (now called a line segment) was defined as a line &quot;which lies evenly with the points on itself&quot;. These definitions appeal to readers&#x27; physical experience, relying on terms that are not themselves defined, and the definitions are never explicitly referenced in the remainder of the text. In modern geometry, a line is usually either taken as a primitive notion with properties given by axioms, or else defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship, for instance when real numbers are taken to be primitive and geometry is established analytically in terms of numerical coordinates.

In an axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of Hilbert (modern mathematicians added to Euclid&#x27;s original axioms to fill perceived logical gaps), a line is stated to have certain properties that relate it to other lines and points. For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect at most at one point. In two dimensions (i.e., the Euclidean plane), two lines that do not intersect are called parallel. In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a plane, or skew if they are not.

On a Euclidean plane, a line can be represented as a boundary between two regions. Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into convex polygons (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an arrangement of lines.

===In higher dimensions===
In three-dimensional space, a first degree equation in the variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space &quot;n&quot;−1 first-degree equations in the &quot;n&quot; coordinate variables define a line under suitable conditions.

In more general Euclidean space, R&quot;n&quot; (and analogously in every other affine space), the line &quot;L&quot; passing through two different points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is the subset
formula_1
The direction of the line is from a reference point &quot;a&quot; (&quot;t&quot; = 0) to another point &quot;b&quot; (&quot;t&quot; = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector &quot;b&quot; − &quot;a&quot;. Different choices of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can yield the same line.

====Collinear points====
Three or more points are said to be &quot;collinear&quot; if they lie on the same line. If three points are not collinear, there is exactly one plane that contains them.

In affine coordinates, in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space the points &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;), &quot;Y&quot; = (&quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;), and &quot;Z&quot; = (&quot;z&quot;1, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot;) are collinear if the matrix
formula_2
has a rank less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (&quot;n&quot; = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its determinant is zero.

Equivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, &quot;k&quot; points in a plane are collinear if and only if any (&quot;k&quot;–1) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.

In Euclidean geometry, the Euclidean distance &quot;d&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) between two points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:
:The points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are collinear if and only if &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) and &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) implies &quot;x&quot; = &quot;c&quot;.
However, there are other notions of distance (such as the Manhattan distance) for which this property is not true.

In the geometries where the concept of a line is a primitive notion, as may be the case in some synthetic geometries, other methods of determining collinearity are needed.

=== Relationship with other figures===

In Euclidean geometry, all lines are congruent, meaning that every line can be obtained by moving a specific line. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other geometric objects and can be classified according to that relationship. 

For instance, with respect to a conic (a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola), lines can be:
* tangent lines, which touch the conic at a single point;
* secant lines, which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;
* exterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or
* a directrix, whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.
* a coordinate line, a linear coordinate dimension

In the context of determining parallelism in Euclidean geometry, a transversal is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.

For more general algebraic curves, lines could also be:
* &quot;i&quot;-secant lines, meeting the curve in &quot;i&quot; points counted without multiplicity, or
* asymptotes, which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.
With respect to triangles we have:
* the Euler line,
* the Simson lines, and
* central lines.

For a convex quadrilateral with at most two parallel sides, the Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals.

For a hexagon with vertices lying on a conic we have the Pascal line and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the Pappus line.

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that never cross. Intersecting lines share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other—every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.

Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at right angles.

In three-dimensional space, skew lines are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.

=== In axiomatic systems ===
In synthetic geometry, the concept of a line is often considered as a primitive notion, meaning it is not being defined by using other concepts, but it is defined by the properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy. 

However, the axiomatic definition of a line does not explain the relevance of the concept and is often too abstract for beginners. So, the definition is often replaced or completed by a &quot;mental image&quot; or &quot;intuitive description&quot; that allows understanding what is a line. Such descriptions are sometimes referred to as definitions, but are not true definitions since they cannot used in mathematical proofs. The &quot;definition&quot; of line in Euclid&#x27;s Elements falls into this category; and is never used in proofs of theorems.

== Definition ==
=== Linear equation ===
Lines in a Cartesian plane or, more generally, in affine coordinates, are characterized by linear equations. More precisely, every line formula_3 (including vertical lines) is the set of all points whose coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) satisfy a linear equation; that is,
formula_4
where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are fixed real numbers (called coefficients) such that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to equations with &quot;b&quot; = 0.

One can further suppose either or , by dividing everything by if it is not zero.

There are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. The above form is sometimes called the &quot;standard form&quot;. If the constant term is put on the left, the equation becomes
formula_5
and this is sometimes called the &quot;general form&quot; of the equation. However, this terminology is not universally accepted, and many authors do not distinguish these two forms.

These forms are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, x-intercept, known points on the line and y-intercept.

The equation of the line passing through two different points formula_6 and formula_7 may be written as
formula_8
If , this equation may be rewritten as
formula_9
or
formula_10In two dimensions, the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the &quot;slope–intercept form&quot;:

formula_11
where:
* &quot;m&quot; is the slope or gradient of the line.
* &quot;b&quot; is the y-intercept of the line.
* &quot;x&quot; is the independent variable of the function .

The slope of the line through points formula_12 and formula_13, when formula_14, is given by formula_15 and the equation of this line can be written formula_16.

As a note, lines in three dimensions may also be described as the simultaneous solutions of two linear equations
formula_17
formula_18
such that formula_19 and formula_20 are not proportional (the relations formula_21 imply formula_22). This follows since in three dimensions a single linear equation typically describes a plane and a line is what is common to two distinct intersecting planes.

=== Parametric equation ===

Parametric equations are also used to specify lines, particularly in those in three dimensions or more because in more than two dimensions lines &quot;cannot&quot; be described by a single linear equation.

In three dimensions lines are frequently described by parametric equations:
formula_23
where:
* &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are all functions of the independent variable &quot;t&quot; which ranges over the real numbers.
* (&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;0, &quot;z&quot;0) is any point on the line.
* &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are related to the slope of the line, such that the direction vector (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) is parallel to the line.

Parametric equations for lines in higher dimensions are similar in that they are based on the specification of one point on the line and a direction vector.

=== Hesse normal form ===
The &quot;normal form&quot; (also called the &quot;Hesse normal form&quot;, after the German mathematician Ludwig Otto Hesse), is based on the &quot;normal segment&quot; for a given line, which is defined to be the line segment drawn from the origin perpendicular to the line. This segment joins the origin with the closest point on the line to the origin. The normal form of the equation of a straight line on the plane is given by:
formula_24
where formula_25 is the angle of inclination of the normal segment (the oriented angle from the unit vector of the -axis to this segment), and is the (positive) length of the normal segment. The normal form can be derived from the standard form formula_26 by dividing all of the coefficients by
formula_27
and also multiplying through by formula_28 if formula_29

Unlike the slope-intercept and intercept forms, this form can represent any line but also requires only two finite parameters, formula_25 and , to be specified. If , then formula_25 is uniquely defined modulo . On the other hand, if the line is through the origin (), one drops the term to compute formula_32 and formula_33, and it follows that formula_25 is only defined modulo .

== Other representations ==

===Vectors===
The vector equation of the line through points A and B is given by formula_35 (where λ is a scalar).

If a is vector OA and b is vector OB, then the equation of the line can be written: formula_36.

A ray starting at point &quot;A&quot; is described by limiting λ. One ray is obtained if λ ≥ 0, and the opposite ray comes from λ ≤ 0.

===Polar coordinates===

In a Cartesian plane, polar coordinates are related to Cartesian coordinates by the parametric equations:formula_37

In polar coordinates, the equation of a line not passing through the origin—the point with coordinates —can be written
formula_38
with and formula_39 Here, is the (positive) length of the line segment perpendicular to the line and delimited by the origin and the line, and formula_25 is the (oriented) angle from the -axis to this segment.

It may be useful to express the equation in terms of the angle formula_41 between the -axis and the line. In this case, the equation becomes
formula_42
with and formula_43

These equations can be derived from the normal form of the line equation by setting formula_44 and formula_45 and then applying the angle difference identity for sine or cosine.

These equations can also be proven geometrically by applying right triangle definitions of sine and cosine to the right triangle that has a point of the line and the origin as vertices, and the line and its perpendicular through the origin as sides.

The previous forms do not apply for a line passing through the origin, but a simpler formula can be written: the polar coordinates formula_46 of the points of a line passing through the origin and making an angle of formula_47 with the -axis, are the pairs formula_46 such that 
formula_49

==Generalizations ==
In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.

When a geometry is described by a set of axioms, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called primitive object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry. Thus in differential geometry, a line may be interpreted as a geodesic (shortest path between points), while in some projective geometries, a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.

=== Projective geometry ===
In many models of projective geometry, the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the &quot;straight curve&quot; as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry. In elliptic geometry we see a typical example of this. In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by great circles of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean planes passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.

The &quot;shortness&quot; and &quot;straightness&quot; of a line, interpreted as the property that the distance along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see triangle inequality), can be generalized and leads to the concept of geodesics in metric spaces.

==Related concepts==

=== Ray ===

Given a line and any point &quot;A&quot; on it, we may consider &quot;A&quot; as decomposing this line into two parts.
Each such part is called a ray and the point &quot;A&quot; is called its &quot;initial point&quot;. It is also known as half-line (sometimes, a half-axis if it plays a distinct role, e.g., as part of a coordinate axis). It is a one-dimensional half-space. The point A is considered to be a member of the ray. Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through &quot;A&quot; and proceeding indefinitely, starting at &quot;A&quot;, in one direction only along the line. However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, they determine a unique ray with initial point &quot;A&quot;. As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (including &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) and all the points &quot;C&quot; on the line through &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;B&quot; is between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points &quot;C&quot; on the line determined by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; is not between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. A point &quot;D&quot;, on the line determined by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; but not in the ray with initial point &quot;A&quot; determined by &quot;B&quot;, will determine another ray with initial point &quot;A&quot;. With respect to the &quot;AB&quot; ray, the &quot;AD&quot; ray is called the &quot;opposite ray&quot;.

Thus, we would say that two different points, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, define a line and a decomposition of this line into the disjoint union of an open segment and two rays, &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot; (the point &quot;D&quot; is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of &quot;A&quot; on the line &quot;AB&quot;). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

In Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an angle.

The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically Euclidean geometry or affine geometry over an ordered field. On the other hand, rays do not exist in projective geometry nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the complex numbers or any finite field.

===Line segment===
A line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points. Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment. Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are coplanar and either do not intersect or are collinear.

=== Number line ===
A point on number line corresponds to a real number and vice versa. Usually, integers are evenly spaced on the line, with positive numbers are on the right, negative numbers on the left. As an extension to the concept, an imaginary line representing imaginary numbers can be drawn perpendicular to the number line at zero. The two lines forms the complex plane, a geometrical representation of the set of complex numbers.

<text>Russell David Johnson (November 10, 1924 – January 16, 2014) was an American actor. He played Professor Roy Hinkley in &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and Marshal Gib Scott in &quot;Black Saddle&quot;.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Ashley, Pennsylvania, on November 10, 1924, to Russell Kennedy Johnson (1901–1932) and Marion Wenonah Smink Johnson (1902–1976).

Johnson was the eldest of seven siblings: Kenneth Walter Johnson (1925–2012), David Reed Johnson (1926–1976), Lois Marion Johnson (1927–1928), Lorraine Johnson Crosby (1928-2015), Marion Joan Johnson Reeves (1930–2010), and Paul Wesley Johnson (1932–1933). His father Russell died of lobar pneumonia and influenza on December 13, 1932, and his brother Paul also died of lobar pneumonia on January 5 the following year. His mother Minnie remarried after 10 years
to Thomas S. Lewis.

As a teenager, Johnson attended Girard College, a private boarding school for fatherless boys, located in Philadelphia.

==Military career==
After graduating from high school, Johnson enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces as an aviation cadet. On completing his training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He flew 44 combat missions in the Pacific Theater during World War II as a bombardier in B-25 twin-engined medium bombers.

On March 4, 1945, while flying as a navigator in a B-25 with the 100th Bombardment Squadron, 42nd Bombardment Group, 13th Air Force, Johnson&#x27;s B-25 and two others were shot down during a low-level bombing and strafing run against Japanese military targets in the Philippine Islands. The B-25s encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire, and all three had to ditch in the sea off Zamboanga. Johnson broke both his ankles in the landing, and his bomber&#x27;s co-pilot was killed. Johnson received a Purple Heart for his injuries. He was also awarded the Air Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three campaign stars, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one campaign star, and the World War II Victory Medal.

Johnson was honorably discharged as a first lieutenant on November 22, 1945, then joined the United States Air Force Reserve.

==Movie, television, and radio career==
After his honorable discharge from the military, Johnson used the G.I. Bill to pay for his acting studies at the Actors&#x27; Lab in Hollywood.

Johnson became a close friend of Audie Murphy and later appeared with him in three of his films, &quot;Column South&quot; and &quot;Tumbleweed&quot; in 1953 and &quot;Ride Clear of Diablo&quot; in 1954. Johnson&#x27;s Hollywood career began in 1952, with the college fraternity hazing exposé &quot;For Men Only&quot;, and with &quot;Loan Shark&quot;, also released in 1952 and starring George Raft.

His early roles were primarily in Westerns such as &quot;Rancho Notorious&quot; (1952, starring Marlene Dietrich), &quot;Seminole&quot; (1953), &quot;Law and Order&quot; (1953, opposite Ronald Reagan), and &quot;Badman&#x27;s Country&quot; (1958), and science fiction films such as &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot; (1953), &quot;This Island Earth&quot; (1955), &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Space Children&quot; (1958). He also appeared in a Ma and Pa Kettle vehicle, &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot; (1955), as well as in Roger Corman&#x27;s rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-roll crime drama &quot;Rock All Night&quot; (1957). In 1955, he had a role in &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; along with Alan Hale Jr., later the Skipper from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Johnson and Hale also appeared together in an episode of the TV series &quot;Casey Jones&quot;, Season 1 Episode 20 &quot;The Track Walker&quot;.

During the 1950s, he played the head of a gang of crooks in episode 17 of season one of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; (originally broadcast in January 1953, filmed in 1951). Johnson was also cast on the religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

In 1957 he played a ruthless and heartless murdering outlaw named &quot;Stragger&quot; on the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in the episode &quot;Bloody Hands&quot; (S2E21), where he almost convinces Matt Dillon to quit from guilt because of his own constant need to kill. He returned to that series in 1959 as “Harry Webb” in the episode “The Bear”. He also played the Sundown Kid in an episode of the 1958 NBC&#x27;s Western series &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot; and guest-starred in another NBC Western series, &quot;The Californians&quot;. He appeared in episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Beauty Jamison Story&quot; and &quot;The Cliff Grundy Story.&quot;

He appeared four times on the first-run syndicated military drama &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, based on actual stories of the submarine section of the United States Navy. He was cast as Hugh Grafton in episode 28, &quot;The Gar Story&quot;, as the executive officer Beach in the 1957 &quot;Tirante Plays a Hunch&quot;, appeared twice as submarine officer and later author Edward L. Beach Jr., and as Tom Richards in two 1960 episodes, &quot;Intermission&quot; and &quot;The Desperate Challenge&quot;, and twice with June Allyson on her CBS anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. Also, he guest-starred with William Shatner in &quot;The Hungry Glass&quot;, a 1961 episode of &quot;Thriller&quot;, and with Joan Evans and Harvey Stephens in &quot;The Sky Diver&quot;, the unaired pilot episode of &quot;Ripcord&quot; of that same year. Then he was cast as John T. Metcalf in the 1962 episode &quot;Mile-Long Shot to Kill&quot; of the CBS anthology series &quot;GE True&quot;, hosted by Jack Webb. Also, in 1962, he was cast as Bob Murkland in the March 6 Season 3, episode 22 of Laramie, &#x27;The Dynamiters&#x27;. In April of that same year, he was cast as Doctor Ross in the episode &quot;Allergies Anonymous&quot; of The Real McCoys. Also that year he played a role in &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;. Then in 1963, he was cast in the episode &quot;Mutiny at Fort Mercy&quot; of the short-lived ABC/Warner Bros.&#x27; Western series &quot;The Dakotas&quot;, and later he performed in the premiere of another short-lived ABC show, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, a medical drama series starring Paul Richards and Eduard Franz.

From January 1959 to May 1960, Johnson co-starred as Marshal Gib Scott on the television series &quot;Black Saddle&quot;, which lasted two seasons—its first on NBC and its second on ABC.

===&quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episodes===
Johnson appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. His character brings a murderer from 1880 into the present via a time machine in the season-one episode &quot;Execution&quot;. In the season-two episode &quot;Back There&quot;, his character, Peter Corrigan, attempts to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The plot of both episodes involved time travel from the 20th to the 19th centuries. Johnson also appeared on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; in 1964, playing a crewmember on a United States space station in the episode &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;The Professor&quot; on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;===

Johnson was best known for playing Professor Roy Hinkley (usually called the &quot;Professor&quot;), the very knowledgeable polymath who could build all sorts of inventions out of the most rudimentary materials available on the island. As Johnson himself pointed out, though, he could not fix the hole in the boat. In the first episode of the show, the radio announcer describes the Professor as a research scientist and well-known Scoutmaster. &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; aired from 1964 to 1967, but has been shown in reruns continuously ever since. Johnson reprised this character in three &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; made-for-television movies: &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981), and two animated series: &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; from 1974-77 and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; from 1982-83. In a 2004 interview, Johnson commented about the role and shared his perspective regarding &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and the situation comedy&#x27;s place in television history:

===After &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;===

After &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Johnson found himself somewhat typecast, making portraying more unsophisticated roles other than his signature role as the Professor more difficult. Nevertheless, he was able to resume a sufficient acting career, appearing in several other movies and television shows, especially the latter. He appeared as a guest star in several dramatic series, including &quot;The Big Valley&quot; with Peter Breck (marking a reunion of sorts, since they co-starred together in &quot;Black Saddle&quot;, an earlier Four Star Productions series), &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; He was cast in the miniseries &quot;Vanished&quot;, based on a novel by Fletcher Knebel (1971), the TV horror movie &quot;The Horror at 37,000 Feet&quot; (1973), uncredited in the Robert Redford spy thriller &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), the low-budget thriller &quot;Hitch Hike to Hell&quot; (1977), and appeared on the episode &quot;Coffee, Tea or Cyanide&quot; on &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot; in 1977, and on the NBC soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

Johnson had a brief appearance in &quot;MacArthur&quot; (1977), in which he played United States Navy Admiral Ernest J. King, and he appeared in the 1978 made-for-television movies &quot;The Ghost of Flight 401&quot; and &quot;The Bastard&quot;. Russell provided the narration for the animated-short episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Stevie and Zoya&quot; that appeared on MTV during the mid-1980s.

In an interview with &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine in the early 1980s, Johnson said that he had wanted to appear in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; during its run on NBC from 1966 to 1969, but he was never cast. An episode of CBS&#x27; &quot;Newhart&quot; in 1986 featured the Beavers (a men&#x27;s organization) watching a &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode on television. When they are suddenly evicted from the room, one of them, portrayed by Johnson, protests, &quot;I want to see how it ends!&quot; He is assured that the castaways do not get off the island. Johnson also played the sheriff in a season 9 episode of &quot;Dallas&quot;. His character in that series did not return in season 10, however, as season 9 turned out to be the infamous &quot;dream season&quot;. In the late 1980s horror TV series &quot;Monsters&quot;, Johnson played an elder scientist in the episode &quot;Sleeping Dragon&quot;, in which he tries communicating with an ancient humanoid dinosaur that was awakened after a 65 million years-long slumber. His other appearances included a reprisal of his Gilligan&#x27;s Island character in episodes of &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;Meego&quot;, as well as appearances in &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

Johnson entertained fans at the 1996 MST3K Conventio-Con-Expo-Fest-a-Rama 2: Electric Boogaloo on the &quot;Celebrity Panel&quot;. Johnson was invited for his role in the movie-within-a-movie of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;, &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, but spent most of the time answering questions about his &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; days. He shared an amusing anecdote: 

Johnson once participated in the Ig Nobel award presentation ceremony, credited as &quot;The Professor Emeritus of Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Johnson had a number of guest roles in the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Harry Nile&quot;, one of the &quot;Imagination Theater&quot; series produced by Jim French.

==Personal life==
Johnson was married three times. His first marriage, to Edith Cahoon in 1943, ended in divorce in 1948.

In 1949 he married his second wife, Kay Cousins, whom he had met while at the Actors&#x27; Lab in Hollywood. Together they had a daughter, Kim, and a son, David. Cousins died on January 20, 1980, in Century City, California.

In 1982, Johnson married Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Dane, and became stepfather to her son, Courtney Dane. It was here that Johnson collaborated with writer Steve Cox on the memoir, &quot;Here on Gilligan&#x27;s Isle&quot;, published in 1993.

Johnson&#x27;s son David died of AIDS-related complications on October 27, 1994. After his son&#x27;s diagnosis with AIDS, Johnson frequently helped raise money for AIDS charities.

==Death==
Johnson died from kidney failure at his home in Bainbridge Island, Washington, on January 16, 2014, aged 89. Johnson&#x27;s memorial service was held a month later.

<text>Engineers Europe (stylized as ENGINEERS EUROPE), formally FEANI (Fédération Européenne d&#x27;Associations Nationales d&#x27;Ingénieurs / European Federation of National Engineering Associations) prior to 01 January 2023, is a federation of national professional bodies representing engineering in European countries. Founded in 1951, it aims to promote the recognition, mobility and interests of Europe&#x27;s engineering profession. Engineers Europe maintains a database of recognised engineering qualifications and also maintains a (non-comprehensive) register of professionally qualified engineers from member countries.

==The Engineers Europe register and European Engineer status==
Engineers Europe maintains a register of professionally qualified engineers from member countries. Individuals may have their names added to the register through the national member institution of their own country. To register, candidates need to have undergone at least seven years of &quot;formation&quot; including at least three years of engineering education and at least two years of professional engineering experience. (The balance of three years can be made up of any combination of engineering education, training and professional engineering experience.)
Engineers Europe grants engineers whose names are on the Engineers Europe register the title European Engineer and the corresponding &quot;Eur Ing&quot;, &quot;EUR ING&quot; prefix. However, European Engineer and the Eur Ing designation are not legally recognised in all countries.
The European Commission has acclaimed the register as a good example of a profession&#x27;s self-regulation, and indicated that member states will find the Engineers Europe register helpful when deciding whether foreign engineers are qualified to practice; the Commission concluded that engineers on the register &quot;should not normally be required to undertake an adaptation period or sit an aptitude test&quot; in order to practice in European countries.

<doc id="947002" wikidata="Q2338107" url="?curid=947002" title="American Campaign Medal">
<text>The American Campaign Medal was a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was first created on November 6, 1942, by issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The medal was intended to recognize those military members who had performed military service in the American Theater of Operations during World War II. A similar medal, known as the American Defense Service Medal was awarded for active duty service before the United States&#x27; entry into World War II.

==History==
The American Campaign Medal was established per Executive Order 9265 on 6 November 1942, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and announced in War Department Bulletin 56, 1942. The criteria were initially announced in Department of the Army (DA) Circular 1, dated 1 January 1943, so that the ribbon could be authorized prior to design of the medal. The criteria for the medal were announced in DA Circular 84, dated 25 March 1948 and subsequently published in Army Regulation 600–65, dated 22 September 1948. The American Campaign Medal was issued as a service ribbon only during the Second World War, and was not issued as a full-sized medal until 1947.

The first recipient of the American Campaign Medal was General of the Army George C. Marshall, Jr.

In January 2020, the United States Air Force retroactively authorized the American Campaign streamer to fly from the flag of the Civil Air Patrol located at CAP National Headquarters, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. The streamer recognizes CAP&#x27;s involvement in coastal patrol operations between May and August 1943 while attached to Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command.

==Criteria==
The requirements for the American Campaign Medal were for service within the American Theater between 7 December
1941 and 2 March 1946 under any of the following conditions:

# On permanent assignment outside the continental limits of the United States.
# Permanently assigned as a member of a crew of a vessel sailing ocean waters for a period of 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days.
# Outside the continental limits of the United States in a passenger status or on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days.
# In active combat against the enemy and was awarded a combat decoration or furnished a certificate by the commanding general of a corps, higher unit, or independent force that the Soldier actually participated in combat.
# Within the continental limits of the United States for an aggregate period of 1 year.

The boundaries of American Theater are as follows:
The eastern boundary is located from the North Pole, south along the 75th meridian west longitude to the 77th
parallel north latitude, thence southeast through Davis Strait to the intersection of the 40th parallel north latitude and
the 35th meridian west longitude, thence south along the meridian to the 10th parallel north latitude, thence southeast
to the intersection of the Equator and the 20th meridian west longitude, thence south along the 20th meridian west
longitude to the South Pole.

The western boundary is located from the North Pole, south along the 141st meridian west longitude to the east
boundary of Alaska, thence south and southeast along the Alaska boundary to the Pacific Ocean, thence south along the
130th meridian to its intersection with the 30th parallel north latitude, thence southeast to the intersection of the
Equator and the 100th meridian west longitude, thence south to the South Pole.

==Appearance==
The medal, made of bronze, is inches wide. The obverse was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones. It shows a Navy cruiser underway with a B-24 Liberator bomber flying overhead. In the foreground is a sinking enemy submarine, and in the background is the skyline of a city. At the top of the medal are the words &quot;AMERICAN CAMPAIGN&quot;. The reverse of the medal, designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman, is the same design as used on the reverse of both the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal. It depicts an American bald eagle between the dates &quot;1941 – 1945&quot; and the words &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;.

The ribbon is inches wide in oriental blue in the center is a inch center stripe divided into thirds of old glory blue, white, and scarlet. Between the center and the edges are stripes of inch in white, black, scarlet and white. 
The blue color represents the Americas; the central blue, white and red stripes, taken from the American Defense Service Medal ribbon, represents the continuance of American defense after Pearl Harbor. The white and black stripes represent the German part of the conflict on the Atlantic Coast, while the red and white stripes are for the Japanese colors and refer to that part of the conflict on the Pacific Coast.

==Ribbon devices==
3/16 inch service stars were authorized to service members who participated in combat with Axis forces within the American Theater. This primarily applied to those service members whose units participated in anti-U-boat patrols (Anti-submarine warfare) in the Atlantic.

==Campaigns==

===Navy campaigns===
Participation in these escort, antisubmarine, armed guard, and special operations entitle recipients to one campaign star for each participation: 
===Army campaigns===
A bronze service star is authorized for participation in the antisubmarine campaign. To qualify individuals must have been assigned to or attached to, and present for duty with, a unit with antisubmarine campaign credit.
