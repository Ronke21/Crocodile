<text>In horology, a movement, also known as a caliber or calibre (British English), is the mechanism of a watch or timepiece, as opposed to the &quot;case&quot;, which encloses and protects the movement, and the &quot;face&quot;, which displays the time. The term originated with mechanical timepieces, whose clockwork movements are made of many moving parts. The movement of a digital watch is more commonly known as a module.

In modern mass-produced clocks and watches, the same movement is often inserted into many different styles of case. When buying a quality pocketwatch from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, for example, the customer would select a movement and case individually. Mechanical movements get dirty and the lubricants dry up, so they must periodically be disassembled, cleaned, and lubricated. One source recommends servicing intervals of: 3–5 years for watches, 15–20 years for grandfather clocks, 10–15 years for wall or mantel clocks, 15–20 years for anniversary clocks, and 7 years for cuckoo clocks, with the longer intervals applying to antique timepieces.

==Mechanical movements==
A mechanical movement contains all the moving parts of a watch or clock except the hands, and in the case of pendulum clocks, the pendulum and driving weights. The movement is made of the following components:

;Power source: Either a mainspring, or a weight suspended from a cord wrapped around a pulley. The mainspring or pulley has a mechanism to allow it to be wound up, which includes a ratchet to prevent it from unwinding. The barrel or pulley has gear teeth on it which drives the center wheel.
;Wheel train: A wheel train is a gear train that transmits the force of the power source to the escapement. Large gears known as &quot;wheels&quot; mesh with small gears known as pinions. The wheels in a typical going train are the centre wheel, third wheel, and fourth wheel. A separate set of wheels, the motion work, divides the motion of the minute hand by 12 to move the hour hand and in watches another set, the keyless work, allows the hands to be set.
;Escapement: An escapement is a mechanism that allows the wheel train to advance, or &quot;escape&quot; a fixed amount with each swing of the balance wheel or pendulum. It consists of a gear called an &quot;escape wheel&quot; which is released one tooth at a time by a lever that rocks back and forth. Each time the escape wheel moves forward it also gives the pendulum or balance wheel a push to keep it moving.
;Oscillator: The timekeeping element, either a pendulum or a balance wheel. It swings back and forth, with a precisely constant time interval between each swing, called the beat. A pendulum movement has a pendulum hangar usually attached to a sturdy support on the back, from which the pendulum is suspended and a &quot;fork&quot; which gives the pendulum impulses. The oscillator always has some means for adjusting the rate of the clock. Pendulums usually have an adjustment nut under the bob, while balance wheels have a &quot;regulator&quot; lever on the balance spring.

==Types of movements==
Watch movements come in various shapes to fit different case styles, such as round, tonneau, rectangular, rectangular with cut corners, oval and baguette, and are measured in &quot;lignes&quot;, or in millimetres. Each specific watch movement is called a &quot;caliber&quot;. The movement parts are separated into two main categories: those belonging to the &quot;ébauches&quot; and those belonging to the &quot;assortments&quot;.

In watch movements the wheels and other moving parts are mounted between two plates, which are held a small distance apart with pillars to make a rigid framework for the movement. One of these plates, the front plate just behind the face, is always circular, or the same shape and dimensions as the movement. The back plate has various shapes: 
;Full plate movement: In this design, used in the earliest pocketwatches until the 18th century, the back plate was also circular. All the parts of the watch were mounted between the two plates except the balance wheel, which was mounted on the outside of the back plate, held by a bracket called the &quot;balance cock&quot;.
;Three-quarter plate movement: In the 18th century, to make movements thinner, part of the back plate was cut away to make room for the balance and balance cock.
;Bridge movement: In modern watch movements, the back plate is replaced with a series of plates or bars, called bridges. This makes servicing the movement easier, since individual bridges and the wheels they support can be removed and installed without disturbing the rest of the movement. The first bridge movements, in Swiss pocketwatches from around 1900, had three parallel bar bridges to support the three wheels of the going train. This style is called a &quot;three finger&quot; or &quot;Geneva&quot; movement.

Mechanical watch movements are also classified as manual or automatic:
;Manual or hand winding: In this type the wearer must turn the crown periodically, often daily, in order to wind the mainspring, storing energy to run the watch until the next winding.
;Automatic or self-winding: In an automatic watch, including in most mechanical watches sold today, the mainspring is automatically wound by the natural motions of the wearer&#x27;s wrist while it is being worn, eliminating the need for manual winding.

Additionally, a distinction is also sometimes made on whether or not the movement offers hacking, allowing the second hand to be stopped.

==Caliber==
In horology, &quot;caliber&quot; refers to the specific internal mechanism of a watch or clock, also known as a movement. Although the term originally was only used to refer to the size of a movement, it is now used to designate a specific model (although the same caliber can be used in many different watches or clocks). Different watch manufacturers tend to use their own identification system to number their calibers.

<text>Zach is a lunar impact crater located in the heavily cratered southern sector of the Moon. To the north is the crater Lilius, while to the southeast is Pentland and to the south the larger Curtius. Due to foreshortening, the crater has an oblong appearance when viewed from Earth. The crater is in diameter and deep. It is from the Nectarian period, 3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago.

The inner walls of the crater are prominently d, while parts of the outer wall are indented by lesser craters. There are adjacent craters attached to the northeast, southwest, and southern parts of the rim. There is also a pair of overlapping craters on the northwest rim. The bottom is relatively flat with a few craterlets and a double central peak offset to the north.

The crater is named for Franz Xaver, Baron Von Zach, a 19th-century Hungarian astronomer.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, features are identified on lunar maps by placing the respective letter to the side of the crater midpoint closest to Zach:

<doc id="949506" wikidata="Q2449718" url="?curid=949506" title="Aveley">
<text>Aveley is a town and former civil parish in the unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex, England, and forms one of the traditional Church of England parishes. Aveley is 16 miles (26.2 km) east of Charing Cross. In the 2021 United Kingdom census it had a population of 9,369.

==Position==
Aveley is located on the very edge of Greater London and is roughly bounded to the north and west by the London Borough of Havering, to the south by the A13 road and to the east by the M25 motorway. The nearest places are Purfleet, South Ockendon, Wennington and Rainham.

==Prehistory and history==
Aveley has given its name to the Aveley Interglacial period around 200,000 years ago. Important evidence of the local flora and fauna of the period and some signs of occupation by Neanderthal humans have been found there.

In Domesday the name has various spellings – Alvithelea, Alvileia and Alvilea. The name means Aelfgyth&#x27;s wood clearing. A variation, in 1418, is Alvythele.

After the Second World War the population grew rapidly as the area absorbed London overspill.

On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished to form Thurrock.

=== The Aveley mammoth ===
In 1964, amateur geologist John Hesketh found the remains of a late form of steppe mammoth in a clay pit on Sandy Lane. The Natural History Museum excavated the site and uncovered the most complete mammoth skeleton found in the UK, along with a junior straight-tusked elephant found beneath it. The animals were separated by 50,000 years and were originally thought to date back 100,000 and 125,000 years respectively, but recent dating techniques show they died 200,000 and 250,000 years ago.

The skeletons were on display from 1970 to 1990 in the Natural History Museum, before being stored in the museum&#x27;s palaeontology department for a number of years. They are currently being exhibited in the &#x27;From the Beginning&#x27; gallery. Other animal remains were also found at the Aveley site, including a 200,000 year-old jungle cat, a large lion, a brown bear, wolf, rhinoceros, moles, bats, and terrapins.

===Notable people===
*Paul Allen, English former professional footballer
*Martina Cole, the crime writer, was brought up in Aveley
*Alice Diehl (née Mangold), the novelist and concert pianist, was born in Aveley.
*Robert W. Gibson, English-American architect, born in Aveley in 1854.
*Kate Evelyn Luard, Royal Red Cross and bar was born in Aveley vicarage.
*John Newton, the author of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, lived in Aveley, which was the home of his father&#x27;s second wife.
*Alex Pritchard, professional footballer for Tottenham Hotspur, Brentford and Sunderland lived and went to school in Aveley

== Governance ==
Aveley forms part of the Thurrock constituency, and is covered by the Aveley and Uplands ward. 

The Aveley and Uplands ward elects three councillors to Thurrock Council. As of May 2022, two were of those elected were members of The Conservative Party and one was a member of The Labour Party.

==Historic buildings==
===St Michael&#x27;s Church===
The parish church of St Michael is a Grade I listed building dating from the 12th century. It contains a 14th-century memorial brass to Radulphus de Knevynton, which is echoed in the arms of the Thurrock unitary authority. The church was declared unsafe in the 19th century, with the recommendation that it should be pulled down. However, this was averted by its parishioners, who raised £1,000 to save it.

===Other listed buildings===
Grade II*
*Brett&#x27;s Farmhouse
*&quot;Sir Henry Gurnett&quot; public house
Grade II
*79, High Street
*&quot;Crown and Anchor&quot; public house
*Park Corner House
*54 and 56 High Street
*Courts Farm, Park Lane.
The core is half of a 13th-century timber framed Manor house.
*Court&#x27;s Farmhouse barn - demolished within last 15 yrs to make way for a modern housing estate.
*Brett&#x27;s Farmhouse barn
*Aveley Hall

The Old Ship public house at 58 High Street is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 United Kingdom census it had a population of 9,801. According to Thurrock Council, the ward of Aveley and Uplands had a population of 8,381 people in 2001. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2,003.

==Sport==
Aveley is the home of non-League football club Aveley, which plays at Parkside. It was also home of now defunct Thurrock, who played at Ship Lane.

Belhus golf course is located in Aveley near the site of the former Belhus Mansion. Much of the remaining land from Belhus forms the Belhus Woods Country Park.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are:
*Chafford Hundred railway station
*Ockendon railway station
*Purfleet railway station

London Buses route 372 serves the village three times an hour between Hornchurch and Lakeside Shopping Centre. Ensignbus also operates route 22 every 20 minutes from Aveley to Grays via Lakeside Shopping Centre.

<text>South Ockendon is a town, former civil parish and Church of England parish within the Thurrock borough in Essex in the East of England, United Kingdom. It is located on the border with Greater London, just outside the M25 motorway. The area to the north is North Ockendon. In 2019 it had an estimated population of 22,303 and in the 2021 United Kingdom census it had a population of 22,442.

==History==
South Ockendon is an ancient parish. It was a village before the Norman Conquest, had a priest in 1085. is listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Wocheduna&quot;, conjecturally named after a Saxon chief, Wocca, whose tribe allegedly lived on a hill. The suffix &quot;don&quot; in Old English means a low hill in open country. Until the late 1940s, the village centred on The Village Green, with its Norman church of St. Nicholas of Myra and adjoining &quot;The Royal Oak&quot; a 14th-century tavern with a 17th-century northern extension. North, South and West Roads all converge on The Green. The railway through Ockendon station was built in 1892 as a through line from Tilbury Dock to the Midlands and further via Upminster and Romford and now is a major commuter route between Southend and Fenchurch Street via Barking.

In 1912, &quot;Mollands Farm&quot; to the south of the original village was acquired for use as a &#x27;rehabilitation&#x27; facility for what are now termed &#x27;disadvantaged&#x27; or &#x27;educationally challenged&#x27; people who were put to useful work on the farm. Over time the farm developed into a major mental hospital (known locally as The Colony) or as South Ockendon Hospital. The hospital closed in 1994 and most of the buildings were subsequently demolished and the site was redeveloped as the Brandon Groves Estate.

South Ockendon village became a location for prefabricated houses (prefabs) accommodating bombed-out residents of East London/West Essex in the very late 40s. The majority of these were demolished in the late-1960s when a large Greater London Council estate, Lecaplan &quot;concrete&quot; construction homes – the Flowers&#x27; Estate – was built to replace them, once more with pre-fabricated dwellings, albeit of a superior design. The Lecaplan Type B form of pre-cast concrete (large panel concrete) terrace is constructed in rows of eight properties to a design by J C Tilley and manufactured by W. &amp; C. French.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 1355. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished to form Thurrock.

In the 1970s the Ford Motor Company factory at Aveley housed Ford&#x27;s Advanced Vehicle Operations which built cars such as the RS1600. The plant was wound down gradually from the late 1990s but closed entirely in 2004, when the last 150 jobs were lost. The majority of the 150 workers accepted transfers to other Ford or ancillary sites around Essex. The &#x27;Aveley&#x27; plant was situated along and west of the railway line, adjacent to Ockendon station in the Belhus Ward that part of Ockendon has now been developed into new housing estates, with street names after famous Ford vehicles in keeping with the sites history.

==Transport==
The town is served by Ockendon railway station on the Ockendon branch of the London, Tilbury and Southend Line. Train services are operated by c2c and provide connections to London Fenchurch Street, Grays, Tilbury, Southend-on-Sea and Shoeburyness.

London Buses route 370|370]], Ensignbus routes 22, 77, 77A and Z1, and NIBS Buses route 269 serve the town. These buses provide connections to Lakeside Shopping Centre, Romford, Upminster, Grays, Tilbury and Brentwood.

==Education==
Secondary education is provided by Harris Academy Ockendon (formally known as The Ockendon Academy, prior to that it was called The Ockendon School. Other schools in Ockendon included Culverhouse Comprehensive School which was demolished in 1992 and Lennard&#x27;s Secondary Modern School ). The Ockendon Academy joined the Harris family of schools in September 2019, with the aim to improve academic performance.

<text>Chignecto Bay () is an inlet of the Bay of Fundy located between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and separated from the waters of the Northumberland Strait by the Isthmus of Chignecto. It is a unit within the greater Gulf of Maine Watershed. Chignecto Bay forms the northeastern part of the Bay of Fundy which splits at Cape Chignecto and is delineated on the New Brunswick side by Martin Head. Chignecto Bay is a Ramsar site.

Chignecto bay was also the site of an unsuccessful railway and canal project of the 1880s and 1890s that would have intersected the landmass, thereby providing a transit passage between New England and Prince Edward Island. After several investigations into the feasibility of a new canal project, including most importantly by the Chignecto Canal Commission, the proposed Chignecto Canal was deemed commercially and economically unjustifiable and the project was abandoned. Some of the physical remnants of the 1880s project still continue to dot the landscape of Chignecto Bay today.

==Hydrography==

At its head, Chignecto Bay itself subdivides into two basins, separated by Cape Maringouin:
*Cumberland Basin - the northeast arm of Chignecto Bay (and the Bay of Fundy) between the two provinces, terminating at the Tantramar Marshes and the estuaries of the Tantramar River and Maccan River.
*Shepody Bay - the north arm of Chignecto Bay and is wholly within New Brunswick. Its northern limit is formed at the estuaries of the Petitcodiac and Memramcook Rivers.

Many small named bays line the Bay&#x27;s coast including Salisbury Bay at the mouths of the Upper Salmon River and Cleveland Brook, site of the Village of Alma, NB.

Chignecto Bay is a northern extension of a rift valley that forms much of the Bay of Fundy.

==Toponymy==

&quot;Chignecto&quot; is derived from the Mi&#x27;kmaq language, but its exact etymology is unclear. It may be from &#x27;foot cloth&#x27;, possibly alluding to a Mi&#x27;kmaq legend. Or it may be from , &#x27;drainage place&#x27;; the latter (as or , in longer form or ) is today the name of the Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki district in which the bay is located.

==Shorebird wildlife areas==
The head of Cumberland Basin is an important migrating area for many shorebirds. A large portion of it is protected as a wildlife sanctuary known as the Chignecto National Wildlife Area. It includes the 10.2 km2 John Lusby National Wildlife Area, which is recognized as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance since October 1985.

<text>Birkat Hachama (, &quot;Blessing of the Sun&quot;) refers to a rare Jewish blessing that is recited to the Creator, thanking God for creating the sun. The blessing is recited when the Sun completes its cycle every 28 years on a Tuesday at sundown. Jewish tradition says that when the Sun completes this cycle, it has returned to its position when the world was created. Because the blessing needs to be said when the Sun is visible, the blessing is postponed to the following day, on Wednesday morning.

According to Judaism, the Sun has a 28-year solar cycle known as &quot;machzor gadol&quot; (, &quot;the great cycle&quot;). A solar year is estimated as 365.25 days and the &quot;Blessing of the Sun&quot;, being said at the beginning of this cycle, is thus recited every 10,227 (28 times 365.25) days. The last time that it was recited was on April 8, 2009 (14 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5769 on the Hebrew calendar.)

From an astronomical point of view, there is nothing special to these dates; e.g. the Sun, Moon, planets and stars will not be aligned in any specific pattern. The text of the blessing itself is as follows:

==Source of the practice==
The primary source for the institution of &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; is a &quot;Beraita&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Talmud&quot;:

The middle of this clause in the &quot;beraita&quot; (elided here) speaks of other astronomical phenomena, the interpretation of which is ambiguous. The &quot;Gemara&quot; clarifies when the &#x27;turning point&#x27; () mentioned in the &quot;beraita&quot; occurs:

Next, the &quot;gemara&quot; explains the basis of the 28 years:

This explanation provided by Abaye is based on a ruling of Shmuel also mentioned in the &quot;Talmud&quot;:

Shmuel stated: The vernal equinox occurs only at the beginning of one of the four quarters of the day, either at the beginning of the day or at the beginning of the night, or midday or midnight. The summer solstice only occurs either at the end of 1.5 or at the end of 7.5 hours of the day or the night. The autumnal equinox only occurs at the end of 3 or 9 hours of the day or the night. The winter solstice only occurs at the end of 4.5 or 10.5 hours of the day or the night. The duration of a season of the year is no longer than 91 days and 7.5 hours.

Shmuel&#x27;s calculations, however, are imprecise because the Earth does not travel around the Sun with a constant speed. His imprecision, according to Abraham ibn Ezra, was a function of the desire of the time to avoid the necessity of manipulating fractions.

==Codification in Jewish law==
The Shulchan Aruch states that this blessing, generally said upon experiencing natural phenomena, should also be recited upon witnessing the &quot;chammah bi-tkufatah&quot; ( = sun at its turning point). This term, quoted from the above-mentioned Beraita, is explained by the Chofetz Chaim as referring to the point in time at which the Sun returns to the start of its cycle, similar to when it was created.

As explained below, the blessing is recited on the morning after the Sun completes its cycle; ideally, it should be recited at sunrise, referred to in Jewish law as &quot;haneitz hachammah&quot;. It is preferred to recite the blessing with a multitude of people, in keeping with the principle of &quot;b&#x27;rov am hadrat melech&quot;. The &quot;Magen Avraham&quot; and the &quot;Levush&quot; insist that it be recited within the first three hours after sunrise. The &quot;Mishnah Brurah&quot;, however, states on behalf of numerous &quot;Achronim&quot; that it is permitted the blessing to be recited until &quot;halachic&quot; noon.

According to most opinions, the blessing may only be recited if the Sun can be seen. However, if the Sun is completely blocked by clouds, there is a minority view that allows the blessing to be recited nevertheless, because essentially the blessing is on the concurrence of the Sun&#x27;s physical position with the timing of the day.

==Overview==
According to the Babylonian Talmud, the Sun makes a 28-year cycle to return to the position that it was in when the Universe was first created at the time (Tuesday evening) it was created.

According to Jewish tradition, the Sun was created on the fourth day (, &quot;yom revi&#x27;i&quot;) of the week of Creation. Because Jewish law considers the time unit of a day to span from evening to evening, the beginning of the &quot;halachic&quot; fourth day, so to speak, is on Tuesday evening at sundown. The 28-year cycle therefore begins and ends at the point in time when the Sun was created, this being sundown on Tuesday. The Sun only returns to this exact position at sundown on a Tuesday once every 28 years.

Despite the rigorous calculations that follow, there is no synchronization of this prayer and the actual astronomical point in time when the Sun crosses the celestial equator; the symbolism is no different from a situation in which the &quot;molad&quot; for &quot;Tishrei&quot; would fall out by day on a Sunday and &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; falls out on Monday.

==The vernal equinox==
As explained in the Talmud, there is a tradition that the Sun was created in its vernal equinox position at the beginning of the springtime Jewish lunar month of &quot;Nissan&quot;. The sages of the Talmud settled disputes over the &quot;halachic&quot; definition of the vernal equinox by establishing it on March 25 of the Julian calendar. Because both the Julian calendar and Jewish tradition define a solar year as exactly 365.25 days, the &quot;halachic&quot; vernal equinox historically fell out on March 25 every year. This halachic equinox now falls about 17 days after the true equinox, with the error increasing by about 3/4 of a day per century.

In summary, &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; is recited when the halachic vernal equinox (the position at which the Sun was created) occurs at sundown on a Tuesday (the time at which the sun was created).

==The solar calendar==
This method of marking the cycle of &quot;machzor gadol&quot; (that is, using the 25th of March) was invalidated in 1582 when the Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar by decree of Pope Gregory XIII. The calendar was adjusted to allow for Easter to be celebrated in the appropriate time according to an agreement reached at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. To recalibrate the calendar, two adjustments were made:

# Ten days were removed in order to compensate for the incorporation of excess days since the establishment of the Julian calendar.
# A method to avoid further incorporation of excess days was put into place, whereby February 29 would be skipped according to a particular algorithm.

The last day of the Julian calendar was Thursday, 4 October 1582 and this was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October. Thus, while the halachic vernal equinox occurred on March 25 until 1582, in 1583 it occurred on April 4 in countries that had accepted the new Gregorian Calendar. Nevertheless, other counties did not accept the Gregorian calendar right away; English accepted it on 1752, and some Eastern Orthodox churches continue to use the Julian calendar to this day.

For establishing the dates of the Jewish calendar, an algorithm is used that is more accurate than the Julian calendar, although not quite as accurate as the Gregorian calendar. However, since the computations of the seasons was something that the Sages wanted everyone to understand, they used the less accurate computation identical to the Julian calendar. Thus, the Jewish calendar was not modified. As a result, the &quot;halachic&quot; vernal equinox has been shifting slightly forward in the Gregorian every century.

* In 1609, the halachic vernal equinox was on April 4
* In 1709, the halachic vernal equinox was on April 5
* In 1809, the halachic vernal equinox was on April 6
* In 1909, the halachic vernal equinox was on April 7
* In 2009, the halachic vernal equinox was on April 7 
* In 2109, the halachic vernal equinox will fall on April 8
* In 2209, the halachic vernal equinox will fall on April 9
* In 2309, the halachic vernal equinox will fall on April 10

The &quot;halachic&quot; equinox usually jumps a day every century because the algorithm that established the Gregorian calendar dictates that leap years do not occur in years divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400. Jewish law, however, provides keeps the original computation. There was no shift between 1909 and 2009, however, because of the exception regarding years divisible by 400; thus, the year 2000 did contain a February 29 and no compensation was necessary. The table at right depicts all the vernal equinoxes from 1981 to 2009, two years in which &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; occurs; note that the equinox does not occur at sunset (time=0) on the fourth day (Tuesday) any other years in the entire 28-year cycle.

The &quot;halachic&quot; year of 365.25 days is equivalent to 52 weeks, 1 day and 6 hours. This means that any given date will, three times out of four, appear a day later in the calendar week in a subsequent year. For example:

* July 3, 1932 was on Sunday
* July 3, 1933 was on Monday
* July 3, 1934 was on Tuesday
* July 3, 1935 was on Wednesday

July 3, 1936, however, was on a Friday and not a Thursday because the six hours that accrued over each of the four years effectively adds another calendar day (i.e. 6 hours × 4 years = 24 hours = 1 day).

&quot;Halacha&quot; maintains that the Sun was created in the position of the vernal equinox immediately after sundown on the fourth day of the week of Creation, which is equivalent to sunset on Tuesday of that week. If that is considered time zero (t=0), and subsequent years&#x27; vernal equinoxes occur one day and six hours later, it would appear as follows:

* Year 1: Day 4 at sunset (Tuesday)
* Year 2: Day 5 at midnight (Thursday)
* Year 3: Day 6 at sunrise (Friday)
* Year 4: Day 7 at noon (Saturday)
* Year 5: Day 2 at sunset (Sunday)
* Year 6: Day 3 at midnight (Tuesday)

Every four years sees a jump of an additional day because the four six-hour periods sum to a full day. This is somewhat similar to a solar leap year occurring every 4 years to account for the four quarter days that accrued at a rate of a quarter day per year.

Although the proper time for the blessing would be at sundown on Tuesday April 7, the Sun is no longer visible at sundown; the blessing is therefore delayed until the following morning.

The 28-year cycle is based on a solar year of 365.25 days, which is only nearly precise. The Hebrew calendar itself uses a solar year of 365.2468222 days, but utilizes the less precise approximation of 365.25 for Birkat Hachama so that the blessing might occur with some frequency.

See also Hebrew calendar: Accuracy.

==How the date is calculated==

This table represents a week with all the 24 hours marked and labeled by the &quot;planet&quot;, actually a celestial light in direct translation, which corresponds to them according to the ancient geocentric model of &quot;planet&quot; order. It is based on Rashi&#x27;s commentary to &quot;Eruvin&quot; 56a. We create this table by noting that in the Bible the stars were created on Wednesday at twilight so we place Saturn (the first &quot;star&quot;) at hour 1 (or 6:00 p.m.). Then we follow with all the six other &quot;planets&quot; (Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon) and repeat the order until all the hours of the week have a &quot;star&quot; assigned to them.

It is assumed that the world was created in the Hebrew month of &quot;Nissan&quot;, not &quot;Tishrei&quot;. So hour 1 (sunset) on Wednesday on this chart represents the beginning of &quot;Tekufat Nissan&quot; (Spring) in the first year of creation, the Hebrew year 1. For the purpose of &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot;, the calculation of Samuel of Nehardea for the length of a tropical year is used not the more accurate calculation of &quot;Adda bar Ahavah&quot;. Therefore, a year is assumed to be 52 weeks and one day and six hours (365.25 days). This means that a year after creation &quot;Tekufat Nissan&quot; will occur one day and six hours later on this chart, or on Thursday at the sixth hour, Jupiter. Each year this will shift another day and six hours. It will take 28 years for &quot;Tekufat Nissan&quot; to return to being on Wednesday at twilight. It is worth noting that the true spring equinox occurs on March 21 yet &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; is said 18 days later. This inaccuracy accrued over thousands of years as a result of using the inexact calculation of Samuel for the length of the year.

==Order of the service==
The service generally includes:

* Psalms 148:1–6
* The blessing: &quot;&quot;Baruch Atah A-donai E-loheinu Melech Ha`olam Oseh Ma`aseh Breisheet&quot;.&quot;
* Those who say the &quot;Shehecheyanu&quot; blessing, do so here.
* Psalm 19
* Psalm 121
* Psalm 150
* A passage from the &quot;Talmud&quot; regarding the obligation of &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot;.
* Psalm 67
* &quot;Aleinu&quot;
* The mourner&#x27;s &quot;Kaddish&quot;.

The &quot;Shehecheyanu&quot; blessing is not recited. There is no obligation to say &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot;: it is an opportunistic blessing recited only if one happens to see the sun in this state; such blessings (another example is the annual blessing upon seeing flowering fruit trees in Nisan) receive no &quot;Shehecheyanu&quot;. Those who do recite &quot;Shehecheyanu&quot; should take care to wear a new garment or have a new fruit close by, to remove all doubt.

==Occurrences of &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot;==

Occurrences in the last 120 years:

* Wednesday, 7 April 1897 (5 Nisan 5657)
* Wednesday, 8 April 1925 (14 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5685 – &quot;Erev Pesach&quot;/Passover Eve)
* Wednesday, 8 April 1953 (23 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5713)
* Wednesday, 8 April 1981 (4 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5741)
* Wednesday, 8 April 2009 (14 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5769 – &quot;Erev Pesach&quot;/Passover Eve)
&quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; will occur next on
* Wednesday, 8 April 2037 (23 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5797)
* Wednesday, 8 April 2065 (2 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5825)
* Wednesday, 8 April 2093 (12 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5853)
* Wednesday, 9 April 2121 (21 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5881 – &quot;Shvi&#x27;i Shel Pesach&quot;/Seventh Day of Passover)
* Wednesday, 9 April 2149 (2 &quot;Nisan&quot; 5909)

Note: Because the dates for &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; assume a 365.25-day solar year and the Julian calendar also assumes a 365.25-day solar year, &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; will always fall on March 26 in the Julian calendar. While &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; usually occurs in the Jewish lunar month of &quot;Nissan&quot;, this is not always the case; it will occur on 29 &quot;Adar&quot; II (April 10) in the year 2233.

==Lerman&#x27;s thesis==
Moshe Lerman suggested a background to &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; by pointing out a possible connection between the traditional Hebrew dating and the two &quot;machzorim&quot; (&quot;cycles&quot;) that are observed in Jewish tradition—the &quot;small&quot; 19-year cycle which is the basis of the Jewish calendar, and the &quot;big&quot; 28-year cycle which determines the year in which &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; is recited. Mathematically, if one knows the position of a certain year in both cycles, one can compute the number associated to the year modulo 532 (19 times 28), given that the starting point of both cycles is year 1.

Because the astronomical year is slightly shorter than 365.25 days, the date of &quot;Birkat Hachama&quot; shifts away from the spring equinox as history proceeds. A simple astronomical calculation shows that 84 cycles of 28 years before 5769, in the Jewish year 3417, the spring equinox was in the beginning of the night before the fourth day of the week as stipulated by the Talmud. Lerman takes this as a hint that the astronomically astute Jewish sages of the time concluded that the Jewish year 3417 was a first year in the cycle of 28 years. Moreover, Lerman suggests that these same Jewish sages would have reasoned that year 3421 was a first year in the 19-year cycle, in accordance with an ancient tradition that the world was created in the first week of the month of &quot;Nissan&quot;, and thus the sun was created on the fourth day of &quot;Nissan&quot;. Since every 19 years the solar and lunar calendars align, and the Spring equinox of 3421 occurred early in the night leading to the fourth day of the Jewish month of &quot;Nissan&quot;, it follows that 3421 was the first year of a 19-year cycle.

Lerman surmises that the Jewish sages at the time could argue for a determination of the position of their years in both cycles and could therefore compute the absolute year-count modulo 532 years. They were left with a number of options, 532 years apart from each other, and Lerman suggests that they chose the dating closest to what seemed to be the truth according to a literal interpretation of biblical accounts. The sages legally defined future equinox times by instituting the 28-year cycle, to protect the Hebrew dating against future change, and to leave a remembrance to what they had done.

<doc id="949525" wikidata="Q3331220" url="?curid=949525" title="Wennington, London">
<text>Wennington is a small village in the London Borough of Havering, in east London. It is situated 14.8 miles (23.8 km) east of Charing Cross. Wennington was an ancient parish in the county of Essex that was abolished for civil purposes in 1934. It is peripheral to London, forming a ribbon development extending from the eastern edge of the urban sprawl and surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Wennington was added to Hornchurch Urban District in 1934 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

==History==

Wennington is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wemtuna&quot;. The manor had only three households and was in the possession of Westminster Abbey. The Church of England parish church, St Mary and St Peter&#x27;s, dates from the 12th century.

The parish included the Thameside area of Coldharbour, the Wennington Marshes and the village of Wennington. The Wennington parish became part of the Romford Poor Law Union in 1836. It was the smallest parish in the union with a population of 127. In 1875 the parish became part of the Romford rural sanitary district. In 1894 the Romford Rural District was created and Wennington gained a parish council.

Following a county review order in 1934, and in anticipation of suburban house building, Wennington became part of an expanded Hornchurch Urban District and the parish council was abolished. In 1965, Hornchurch Urban District was abolished, and Wennington became part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London.

On 19 July 2022, Wennington was hit by a wildfire during the 2022 United Kingdom heat wave. At least 18 houses were burnt down and many others damaged, while around 90 families were evacuated from the village with a rescue centre set up in a nearby hotel. Around 15 fire engines and 100 firefighters were sent to the scene by London Fire Brigade. The fire reportedly started from a compost heap which spontaneously combusted, with flames subsequently spreading along a garden fence.

==Government==
Wennington is within the Dagenham and Rainham UK Parliament constituency. The current MP is Jon Cruddas of the Labour Party. It forms part of the Rainham and Wennington electoral ward of Havering. The ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All three of the councillors elected in the 2022 London local elections were the Conservative Party candidates.

==Geography==
The village of Wennington is a ribbon development extending southeast of Rainham, along Wennington Road (B1335) near the junction of the A13 road and New Road (A1306). It is about 2 km (over 1 mile) north of the River Thames. It consists of mostly scattered houses and the Wennington Hall farmhouse. The village population is around 300. In the south lie the barren Wennington Marshes, which now form part of the RSPB&#x27;s Rainham Marshes nature reserve.

To the west and north Wennington has a boundary with Rainham, also in Havering, formed by the Common Watercourse. To the south there is a boundary in the middle of the Thames with Erith in the London Borough of Bexley. To the east are Aveley and Purfleet in Thurrock.

==Transport==
London Buses route 372 serves the village.

<doc id="949526" wikidata="Q745430" url="?curid=949526" title="Denudation">
<text>Denudation is the geological process in which moving water, ice, wind, and waves erode the Earth&#x27;s surface, leading to a reduction in elevation and in relief of landforms and landscapes. Although the terms erosion and denudation are used interchangeably, erosion is the transport of soil and rocks from one location to another, and denudation is the sum of processes, including erosion, that result in the lowering of Earth&#x27;s surface. Endogenous processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and tectonic uplift can expose continental crust to the exogenous processes of weathering, erosion, and mass wasting. The effects of denudation have been recorded for millennia but the mechanics behind it have been debated for the past 200 years and have only begun to be understood in the past few decades.

== Description==
Denudation incorporates the mechanical, biological, and chemical processes of erosion, weathering, and mass wasting. Denudation can involve the removal of both solid particles and dissolved material. These include sub-processes of cryofracture, insolation weathering, slaking, salt weathering, bioturbation, and anthropogenic impacts.

Factors affecting denudation include:

* Anthropogenic (human) activity, including agriculture, damming, mining, and deforestation;
* Biosphere, via animals, plants, and microorganisms contributing to chemical and physical weathering;
* Climate, most directly through chemical weathering from rain, but also because climate dictates what kind of weathering occurs;
* Lithology or the type of rock;
* Surface topography and changes to surface topography, such as mass wasting and erosion; and
* Tectonic activity, such as deformation, the changing of rocks due to stress mainly from tectonic forces, and orogeny, the process that forms mountains.

==Historical theories==
The effects of denudation have been written about since antiquity, although the terms &quot;denudation&quot; and &quot;erosion&quot; have been used interchangeably throughout most of history. In the Age of Enlightenment, scholars began trying to understand how denudation and erosion occurred without mythical or biblical explanations. Throughout the 18th century, scientists theorized valleys are formed by streams running through them, not from floods or other cataclysms. In 1785, Scottish physician James Hutton proposed an Earth history based on observable processes over an unlimited amount of time, which marked a shift from assumptions based on faith to reasoning based on logic and observation. In 1802, John Playfair, a friend of Hutton, published a paper clarifying Hutton&#x27;s ideas, explaining the basic process of water wearing down the Earth&#x27;s surface, and describing erosion and chemical weathering. Between 1830 and 1833, Charles Lyell published three volumes of &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, which describes the shaping of the surface of Earth by ongoing processes, and which endorsed and established gradual denudation in the wider scientific community.

As denudation came into the wider conscience, questions of how denudation occurs and what the result is began arising. Hutton and Playfair suggested over a period of time, a landscape would eventually be worn down to erosional planes at or near sea level, which gave the theory the name &quot;planation&quot;. Charles Lyell proposed marine planation, oceans, and ancient shallow seas were the primary driving force behind denudation. While surprising given the centuries of observation of fluvial and pluvial erosion, this is more understandable given early geomorphology was largely developed in Britain, where the effects of coastal erosion are more evident and play a larger role in geomorphic processes. There was more evidence against marine planation than there was for it. By the 1860s, marine planation had largely fallen from favor, a move led by Andrew Ramsay, a former proponent of marine planation who recognized rain and rivers play a more important role in denudation. In North America during the mid-19th century, advancements in identifying fluvial, pluvial, and glacial erosion were made. The work being done in the Appalachians and American West that formed the basis for William Morris Davis to hypothesize peneplanation, despite the fact while peneplanation was compatible in the Appalachians, it did not work as well in the more active American West. Peneplanation was a cycle in which young landscapes are produced by uplift and denuded down to sea level, which is the base level. The process would be restarted when the old landscape was uplifted again or when the base level was lowered, producing a new, young landscape.

Publication of the Davisian cycle of erosion caused many geologists to begin looking for evidence of planation around the world. Unsatisfied with Davis&#x27;s cycle due to evidence from the Western United States, Grove Karl Gilbert suggested backwearing of slopes would shape landscapes into pediplains, and W.J. McGee named these landscapes pediments. This later gave the concept the name pediplanation when L.C. King applied it on a global scale. The dominance of the Davisian cycle gave rise to several theories to explain planation, such as eolation and glacial planation, although only etchplanation survived time and scrutiny because it was based on observations and measurements done in different climates around the world and it also explained irregularities in landscapes. The majority of these concepts failed, partly because Joseph Jukes, a popular geologist and professor, separated denudation and uplift in an 1862 publication that had a lasting impact on geomorphology. These concepts also failed because the cycles, Davis&#x27;s in particular, were generalizations and based on broad observations of the landscape rather than detailed measurements; many of the concepts were developed based on local or specific processes, not regional processes, and they assumed long periods of continental stability.

Some scientists opposed the Davisian cycle; one was Grove Karl Gilbert, who, based on measurements over time, realized denudation is nonlinear; he started developing theories based on fluid dynamics and equilibrium concepts. Another was Walther Penck, who devised a more complex theory that denudation and uplift occurred at the same time, and that landscape formation is based on the ratio between denudation and uplift rates. His theory proposed geomorphology is based on endogenous and exogenous processes. Penck&#x27;s theory, while ultimately being ignored, returned to denudation and uplift occurring simultaneously and relying on continental mobility, even though Penck rejected continental drift. The Davisian and Penckian models were heavily debated for a few decades until Penck&#x27;s was ignored and support for Davis&#x27;s waned after his death as more critiques were made. One critic was John Leighly, who stated geologists did not know how landforms were developed, so Davis&#x27;s theory was built upon a shaky foundation. 

From 1945 to 1965, a change in geomorphology research saw a shift from mostly deductive work to detailed experimental designs that used improved technologies and techniques, although this led to research over details of established theories, rather than researching new theories. Through the 1950s and 1960s, as improvements were made in ocean geology and geophysics, it became clearer Wegener&#x27;s theory on continental drift was correct and that there is constant movement of parts (the plates) of Earth&#x27;s surface. Improvements were also made in geomorphology to quantify slope forms and drainage networks, and to find relationships between the form and process, and the magnitude and frequency of geomorphic processes. The final blow to peneplanation came in 1964 when a team led by Luna Leopold published &quot;Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology&quot;, which links landforms with measurable precipitation-infiltration runoff processes and concluded no peneplains exist over large areas in modern times, and any historical peneplains would have to be proven to exist, rather than inferred from modern geology. They also stated pediments could form across all rock types and regions, although through different processes. Through these findings and improvements in geophysics, the study of denudation shifted from planation to studying which relationships affect denudation–including uplift, isostasy, lithology, and vegetation–and measuring denudation rates around the world.

==Measurement==
Denudation is measured in the wearing down of Earth&#x27;s surface in inches or centimeters per 1000 years. This rate is intended as an estimate and often assumes uniform erosion, among other things, to simplify calculations. Assumptions made are often only valid for the landscapes being studied. Measurements of denudation over large areas are performed by averaging the rates of subdivisions. Often, no adjustments are made for human impact, which causes the measurements to be inflated. Calculations have suggested soil loss of up to caused by human activity will change previously calculated denudation rates by less than 30%.

Denudation rates are usually much lower than the rates of uplift and average orogeny rates can be eight times the maximum average denudation. The only areas at which there could be equal rates of denudation and uplift are active plate margins with an extended period of continuous deformation.

Denudation is measured in catchment-scale measurements and can use other erosion measurements, which are generally split into dating and survey methods. Techniques for measuring erosion and denudation include stream load measurement, cosmogenic exposure and burial dating, erosion tracking, topographic measurements, surveying the deposition in reservoirs, landslide mapping, chemical fingerprinting, thermochronology, and analysis of sedimentary records in deposition areas. The most common way of measuring denudation is from stream load measurements taken at gauging stations. The suspended load, bed load, and dissolved load are included in measurements. The weight of the load is converted to volumetric units and the load volume is divided by the area of the watershed above the gauging station. An issue with this method of measurement is the high annual variation in fluvial erosion, which can be up to a factor of five between successive years. An important equation for denudation is the stream power law: formula_1, where E is erosion rate, K is the erodibility constant, A is drainage area, S is channel gradient, and m and n are functions that are usually given beforehand or assumed based on the location. Most denudation measurements are based on stream load measurements and analysis of the sediment or the water chemistry.

A more recent technique is cosmogenic isotope analysis, which is used in conjunction with stream load measurements and sediment analysis. This technique measures chemical weathering intensity by calculating chemical alteration in molecular proportions. Preliminary research into using cosmogenic isotopes to measure weathering was done by studying the weathering of feldspar and volcanic glass, which contain most of the material found in the Earth&#x27;s upper crust. The most common isotopes used are 26Al and 10Be; however, 10Be is used more often in these analyses. 10Be is used due to its abundance and, while it is not stable, its half-life of 1.39 million years is relatively stable compared to the thousand or million-year scale in which denudation is measured. 26Al is used because of the low presence of Al in quartz, making it easy to separate, and because there is no risk of contamination of atmospheric 10Be. This technique was developed because previous denudation-rate studies assumed steady rates of erosion even though such uniformity is difficult to verify in the field and may be invalid for many landscapes; its use to help measure denudation and geologically date events was important. On average, the concentration of undisturbed cosmogenic isotopes in sediment leaving a particular basin is inversely related to the rate at which that basin is eroding. In a rapidly-eroding basin, most rock will be exposed to only a small number of cosmic rays before erosion and transport out of the basin; as a result, isotope concentration will be low. In a slowly-eroding basin, integrated cosmic ray exposure is much greater and isotope concentration will be much higher. Measuring isotopic reservoirs in most areas is difficult with this technique so uniform erosion is assumed. There is also variation in year-to-year measurements, which can be as high as a factor of three.

Problems in measuring denudation include both the technology used and the environment. Landslides can interfere with denudation measurements in mountainous regions, especially the Himalayas. The two main problems with dating methods are uncertainties in the measurements, both with equipment used and with assumptions made during measurement; and the relationship between the measured ages and histories of the markers. This relates to the problem of making assumptions based on the measurements being made and the area being measured. Environmental factors such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, elevation, wind, the speed of light at higher elevations if using lasers or time of flight measurements, instrument drift, chemical erosion, and for cosmogenic isotopes, climate and snow or glacier coverage. When studying denudation, the Stadler effect, which states measurements over short time periods show higher accumulation rates and than measurements over longer time periods, should be considered. In a study by James Gilully, the presented data suggested the denudation rate has stayed roughly the same throughout the Cenozoic era based on geological evidence; however, given estimates of denudation rates at the time of Gilully&#x27;s study and the United States&#x27; elevation, it would take 11-12 million years to erode North America; well before the 66 million years of the Cenozoic.

The research on denudation is primarily done in river basins and in mountainous regions like the Himalayas because these are very geologically active regions, which allows for research between uplift and denudation. There is also research on the effects of denudation on karst because only about 30% of chemical weathering from water occurs on the surface. Denudation has a large impact on karst and landscape evolution because the most-rapid changes to landscapes occur when there are changes to subterranean structures. Other research includes effects on denudation rates; this research is mostly studying how climate and vegetation impact denudation. Research is also being done to find the relationship between denudation and isostasy; the more denudation occurs, the lighter the crust becomes in an area, which allows for uplift. The work is primarily trying to determine a ratio between denudation and uplift so better estimates can be made on changes in the landscape. In 2016 and 2019, research that attempted to apply denudation rates to improve the stream power law so it can be used more effectively was conducted.

== Examples==

Denudation exposes deep subvolcanic structures on the present surface of the area where volcanic activity once occurred. Subvolcanic structures such as volcanic plugs and dikes are exposed by denudation.
Other examples include:
* Earthquakes causing landslides;
* Haloclasty, the build-up of salt in cracks in rocks leading to erosion and weathering;
* Ice accumulating in the cracks of rocks; and
* Microorganisms contributing to weathering through cellular respiration.

<text>Anigozanthos is a genus of plant found naturally in the Southwestern Australia biogeographic region, belonging to the bloodwort family Haemodoraceae. The 11 species and their subspecies are commonly known as kangaroo paw or catspaw, depending on their size, and the shape and colour of their flowers. A further species, previously identified as &quot;Anigozanthos fuliginosus&quot; (black kangaroo paw), was separated to a monotypic genus as &quot;Macropidia fuliginosa&quot;. All 11 species of Anigozanthos are endemic to the south west of Western Australia, Noongar Boodjar.

The species are recognised by their unusual flowers, numerous hybrids and cultivars have been developed for cultivation and floristry in recent years; kangaroo paws are much in demand as house plants and as cut flowers. The red-and-green kangaroo paw is the floral emblem of Western Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first named by Jacques Labillardière, a French botanist, in his work, &quot;Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse&quot;, issued in 1800; he collected and described the type species, &quot;Anigozanthos rufus&quot;, during the d&#x27;Entrecasteaux expedition&#x27;s visit to Southwest Australia in 1792. However, he does not provide a meaning for this name in his description. C.A. Gardener derived it from the Greek words &quot;ánisos&quot; &quot;unequal&quot; and &quot;ánthos&quot; &quot;flower&quot; according to La Billardiere&#x27;s description of its collective petals as &#x27;irregular&#x27; and &#x27;in the form of a tube divided at its extremities into six unequal parts&#x27;, he assumed the &quot;g&quot; was inserted for euphony.

The common name &#x27;kangaroo paw&#x27; was initially given to &quot;Anigozanthos manglesii&quot; and came to be used for other species of &quot;Anigozanthos&quot; as they became known. The origin of the name &#x27;catspaw&#x27; is uncertain, but presumed to distinguish the compact size of the plant and flowers from others of the genus. Kangaroo paws refers to a grouping of species resembling &quot;A. manglesii&quot;, with elongated red and green (or green) flowers and greater overall size.

==Description==

These perennials are endemic to dry sandy, siliceous areas of southwest Australia, but they occur as well in a variety of other environments and soil types. They are grown commercially in Australia, the United States, Japan and Israel.

The plant grows from short, underground, horizontal rhizomes. The length and the character of these may vary between the species: some are fleshy, others are fragile. The sap in the root system allows the plants to survive extreme dry spells. In summer, a number of species die back to the rhizome, growing back in autumn.

The plants have a basal rosette of long green to greyish-green leaves. The leaves of some species are hairy. From the heart of this roset merge long leafless stalks, which can reach 2 m, ending in a raceme of flowers. The size and height of these stalks, which can be clothed in coloured hairs, varies between the species.

The tuberous flower buds are also covered with coloured hairs, giving it a velvety aspect. These long furry hairs also determine the colour of the flower, which may range from almost black to yellow, orange and red. Some species are even dichromatic (as &quot;Anigozanthos manglesii&quot;). The tubular form of the flower bud resembles a kangaroo paw, hence its name. The flower tip spreads fanlike into six petals. Full-grown plants can have up to ten flowers at the end of each stalk.

==Species==
The genus comprises 11 species, some species with subspecies recognised by FloraBase as rare or endangered taxa.

**&quot;Anigozanthos viridis&quot; subsp. &quot;metallica&quot; (metallic green kangaroo paw)

==Commercial hybrids==
The popularity of &quot;Anigozanthos&quot;, as a garden plant or commercially produced cut-flower, has led to the development of cultivars. The Australian Cultivar Registration Authority lists twenty seven registered names and descriptions of cultivars derived from the genus. A larger number of patents for these, accepted or granted &#x27;varieties&#x27;, are recorded in the Plant breeders&#x27; rights database.

<text>George Dewey Nye (August 6, 1898 – January 27, 1969), born in Waverly, Ohio, was an American politician of the Democratic party.

During World War I, Nye served in the United States Navy. In 1928, Nye ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing to incumbent Republican Charles C. Kearns. In 1929, he was elected to a common pleas court judgeship, in which he served from 1930 to 1937. In 1938, Nye was a member of the Ohio Democratic State Central Committee. In 1940, he served as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

In 1942 and the six succeeding elections, Nye was nominated by the Democratic party for the office of lieutenant governor of Ohio. He won three two-year terms to the office in two separate tenures, serving as the 48th and 50th lieutenant governor, from 1945 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1953.

Nye died of complications of hip surgery in 1969 at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 70.

<text>USS &quot;Seal&quot; (SS-183), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seal, a sea mammal valued for its skin and oil.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Seal&quot;′s keel was laid down on 25 May 1936 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 25 April 1937 at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, sponsored by Mrs. Rosemary G. Greenslade, wife of Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) John F. Greenslade and daughter-in-law of Rear Admiral John W. Greenslade. &quot;Seal&quot; was commissioned on 30 April 1937, Lieutenant Karl Goldsmith Hensel, commanding.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
Following an extended shakedown cruise in the Caribbean and a post-shakedown yard period, &quot;Seal&quot; departed New England in late November and proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone to commence operations out of her home port, Coco Solo. Arriving on 3 December, she conducted local operations off Balboa, Panama, and off Coco Solo into January 1939, then proceeded to Haiti where she participated in type exercises prior to Fleet Problem XX. That exercise, to test the fleet&#x27;s ability to control the approaches to Central America and South America, was conducted during late February in the Lesser Antilles.

In March, &quot;Seal&quot; returned to the Haiti–Cuba area for exercises with Destroyer Division 4 (DesDiv 4). In April, she proceeded to New London, Connecticut, for overhaul which included modification of her main engines. In June, the submarine again sailed south, transited the Panama Canal, and continued on to San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor. In Hawaii from July to September, she took soundings for the Hydrographic Office and participated in various local exercises. At the end of the latter month, she returned to San Diego, her home port into 1941.

During the next two years, she conducted exercises and provided services to surface ships and to United States Navy and United States Army air units along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian area. In the fall of 1941, Submarine Division 21 (SubDiv 21) - of which she was now a part - was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet. Departing Pearl Harbor on 24 October, she reached Manila on 10 November, and 34 days later, cleared that bay to commence her first war patrol. She headed north to intercept Japanese forces moving into northern Luzon to reinforce those already landed at Vigan and Aparri, Cagayan.

===World War II===
Initially off Cape Bojeador, she shifted south to the Vigan area on 20 December, and on 23 December, torpedoed and sank , the last Japanese ship sunk by American torpedoes in December 1941 killing them all.

====1942====
From the Vigan area, the submarine moved into the approaches to Lingayen Gulf, and in January 1942, she again turned north to patrol the entrance to Lamon Bay. She rounded Cape Bojeador on 9 January and Cape Engaño on 10 January, and, on 11 January—as the Japanese invaded the Netherlands East Indies at Tarakan, Borneo, and Minahasa, Celebes—she headed south for the Molucca Passage. By 20 January, she was patrolling east of the Celebes to intercept enemy traffic into Kema. On 27 January, she was ordered to patrol off Kendari, which had been attacked on 24 January and then to proceed to the Royal Netherlands Naval Base at Soerabaja, then still under Allied control.

&quot;Seal&quot; arrived at Soerabaja on 5 February. Daily air raids necessitated diving during the day and precluded repairs to her engines, which smoked excessively, and to the broken prism control mechanism in her high periscope. On 11 February, she departed for Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java, and on 14 February, she went alongside . That same day, the Japanese moved into southern Sumatra, and on 19 February, they invaded Bali. Allied forces counterattacked, and as air and surface forces hit the Japanese fleet, &quot;Seal&quot; departed Tjilatjap and transited Lombok Strait to patrol north of Java. On 24 February, she attacked two convoys, only damaging one freighter. The next day, she unsuccessfully attacked an enemy warship formation. On 1 March, as the Japanese moved against Soerabaja, she was similarly disappointed. On 14 March, she headed east to patrol the southern approaches to Makassar City, and for the next week, with her forward air conditioning unit broken down and her refrigerating plant inoperable, she patrolled between that city and De Bril Bank. On 21 March, she headed for Fremantle, Western Australia—the Netherlands East Indies had fallen.

Arriving on 9 April, &quot;Seal&quot; departed again on 12 May and worked her way through the Malay Archipelago, the Celebes Sea, and the Sulu Sea to her patrol area off the Indochina coast. During the early morning hours of 28 May, she entered the South China Sea, and that night, she fired on and sank 1,946-ton &quot;Tatsufuku Maru&quot;. On 7 June, while off Cam Ranh Bay, she attacked an eight-ship convoy and underwent a seven-hour depth charging by surface ships and aircraft. From 15–17 June, heavy seas and high winds hampered hunting, and on 18 June, &quot;a healthy stream of air bubbles&quot; was discovered &quot;issuing from the starboard side...&quot; On 19 June, she left the area and headed for Balabac Strait. On 23 June, she moved into Makassar Strait, and on 4 July, she reached Fremantle.

On her fourth war patrol, from 10 August-2 October, &quot;Seal&quot; returned to the Indochina coast and patrolled north from Cape Padaran. Despite 11 sightings, she was plagued by uncertain torpedo performance against shallow draft vessels, by premature explosions and by leaky exhaust valves and holes in the fuel compensating line which resulted in air and oil leaks to the surface. She was able to damage only one cargo ship, on 3 September.

Twelve days later, &quot;Seal&quot; was en route back to Fremantle. She arrived on 2 October and departed again on 24 October to patrol in the shipping lanes in the Palau area. On 16 November, she intercepted a convoy of five cargomen in two columns with a destroyer escort and conducted a submerged attack on the leader of the near column as the formation zigzagged toward the submarine. Less than a minute after firing, &quot;Seal&quot; collided with, or was rammed by, another enemy ship. The periscope went black and vibrated severely. The submarine rose to ; hung there nearly a minute then started down. A few minutes later, depth charging began and &quot;Seal&quot; leveled off at . Breaking up noises were heard. Four hours later, the area was clear and &quot;Seal&quot; surfaced. The high periscope had been bent horizontally, and the housing on the low periscope had been sprung, preventing its operation. The radar antenna had been broken off the radio mast. Quantities of uncooked rice and beans, unlike those used on the submarine, were found between the wooden deck pieces of the , on the bridge, and caught in the bathythermograph. The periscope shears yielded &quot;a good sample of Japanese bottom paint.&quot;

Captured Japanese documents later confirmed the sinking of 3,500-ton &quot;Boston Maru&quot; by an American submarine on that date in that location. Whether that ship was &quot;Seal&quot;″s target or the colliding ship is not known, but it is possible that the freighter&#x27;s hull had been badly punctured by the submarine&#x27;s periscope shears.

On 17 November, &quot;Seal&quot; was ordered to start for Pearl Harbor. She arrived on 30 November, and after temporary repairs, continued on to the Mare Island Navy Yard for permanent repairs.

====1943====
On 2 April 1943, she returned to Hawaii, and 12 days later, she departed on her sixth war patrol. On 18 April, she topped off at Midway Island, and by 1 May, she was patrolling off the Palau Islands. On 2 May, she attacked a freighter, but missed and subsequently came under an aerial bombing attack. On 4 May, she sank &quot;San Clemente Maru&quot;, but for the remainder of the patrol, was unable to close any targets.

&quot;Seal&quot; returned to Midway on 3 June. Refit took two weeks; further training took a third. On 24 June, she was ready for sea. On 2 July, she entered her area off Todo Saki on the northeastern Honshū coast, and on 8 July, she underwent a severe, ten-hour, depth charging which resulted in persistent air and oil leaks and forced her to turn back for repairs.

She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 24 July. Her repairs were quickly completed, and in mid-August, she sailed west again. On 27 July, she entered the southern Kuril Islands. On 31 July, while the submarine was diving, the conning tower hatch failed to latch, and subsequently flew open. The pumproom was flooded before the boat could be surfaced. Substantial damage to her electrical circuits resulted and &quot;Seal&quot; retired eastward to make temporary repairs. The work continued for a week, and on 8 August, as the air compressors were being jury-rigged to provide sufficient air pressure to launch torpedoes, she returned to the Kurils and crossed into the Sea of Okhotsk. On 17 August, she attacked two freighters with no success. On 25 August, she cleared the area, and on 4 October, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

During her next war patrols, &quot;Seal&quot; provided lifeguard services and conducted reconnaissance missions—at Kwajalein on her ninth - from 7 November-19 December - and at Ponape on her tenth - from 17 January-6 March 1944.

====1944====
&quot;Seal&quot; proceeded to Mare Island, and after re-engining and overhaul, returned to the northern Hokkaidō–Kuril Islands area for her eleventh war patrol, from 8 August-17 September.

With 14–15 hours of daylight, she hunted in the coastal and inter-island shipping lanes to Muroran, Matsuwa, and Paramushiro. On 24 August, she attacked and sank &quot;Tosei Maru&quot; off Erimo Saki. On 5 September, after a six-hour chase, she fired four torpedoes at a maru with one escort. All of her torpedoes missed. On the night of 8 September, she encountered a two-column, six-ship convoy with an escort on each wing, and closed in to the leading ship. Shortly after 2045, she fired four torpedoes at overlapping targets, then opened to the eastward as the torpedoes started hitting. Just before midnight, she again attacked the convoy, now comprising only four ships. One freighter took two hits. A second maru turned to chase &quot;Seal&quot;. &quot;Seal&quot; retired briefly, and just before 0300 on 9 September, hit the remainder of the convoy. Daylight brought antisubmarine aircraft to the scene, and &quot;Seal&quot; fishtailed at deep submergence until 1700. At 2026, having sunk &quot;Shonan Maru&quot; and damaged three or four other ships, she headed for Midway, arriving on 17 September.

On her twelfth and final war patrol, from 10 October-29 November, &quot;Seal&quot; again hunted in the Kurils. Her 30 days in the area yielded only two contacts worthy of torpedo fire. On 25 October, she caught and sank (5,742 GRT) killing 1,415 as it ran down the convoy lanes away from Paramushiro. Three weeks later, she attacked and damaged another maru off Etorofu (now Iturup). During the last days of the patrol, she ranged off the coast of Sakhalin, scoreless. On 17 October, she cleared the area.

&quot;Seal&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 November, and after refit, assumed training duties in the Hawaiian area. In June 1945, she returned to New London where she continued her training duties through the end of World War II.

===Post-War===
After the war, she was ordered inactivated and disposed of. In early November, she proceeded to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned on 15 November, and after a change in her orders, was retained in the Reserve Fleet. On 19 June 1947, she was placed in service and assigned to Boston as a Naval Reserve training ship, and in March 1949, she was transferred to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she continued to serve the Naval Reserve until placed out of service and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1956. Six days later, she was removed from the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for scrapping.

<doc id="949556" wikidata="Q6130226" url="?curid=949556" title="USS Skipjack (SS-184)">
<text>USS &quot;Skipjack&quot; (SS-184), was a &quot;Salmon&quot;-class submarine, the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after the skipjack tuna. She earned multiple battle stars during World War II and then was sunk, remarkably, by an atomic bomb during post-World War II testing in Operation Crossroads. Among the most &quot;thoroughly sunk&quot; ships, she was refloated and then sunk a second time as a target ship two years later.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Skipjack&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 22 July 1936. She was launched on 23 October 1937, sponsored by Miss Frances Cuthbert Van Keuren, daughter of Captain Alexander H. Van Keuren, Superintending Constructor, New York Navy Yard. &quot;Skipjack&quot; was commissioned on 30 June 1938. 

==Pre-World War II service==

Following shakedown in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea and post-shakedown repairs at New London, Connecticut, &quot;Skipjack&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) and departed for fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. Following her return to New London on 10 April 1939, she sailed with sister ships and for the Pacific, transited the Panama Canal on 25 May, and arrived at San Diego, California, on 2 June. During July, she cruised to Pearl Harbor as part of SubRon 2; returned to San Diego on 16 August; and remained on the West Coast engaged in fleet tactics and training operations until 1 April 1940, when she again got underway for the Hawaiian area for training exercises there. Following her return to San Diego, &quot;Skipjack&quot; underwent overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, and then proceeded back to Pearl Harbor, where she was attached to Rear Admiral Wilhelm L. Friedell&#x27;s , Pacific Fleet, as a member of SubDiv 15 (commanded by Captain Ralph Christie). She operated out of Pearl Harbor until again undergoing overhaul at Mare Island in July and August 1941. &quot;Skipjack&quot; returned on 16 August and commenced patrols off Midway Island, Wake Island, and the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. In October 1941, SubDiv 15 (then commanded by &quot;Sunshine&quot; Murray) was transferred to ComSubAsiatic Fleet, along with the tender &quot;Holland&quot;, and Joe Connolly&#x27;s SubDiv 16, as SubRon 2. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December, &quot;Skipjack&quot; was in the Philippines undergoing repairs at the Cavite Navy Yard.

==First, Second and Third War Patrols==

On 9 December, &quot;Skipjack&quot; (under the command of Charles L. Freeman) departed Manila on her first war patrol, with all unfinished repair work completed by her crew &quot;en route&quot; to the patrol area off the east coast of Samar. The submarine conducted two torpedo attacks during this patrol. On 25 December, in the first attack of its kind by a U.S. submarine, &quot;Skipjack&quot; attacked an enemy aircraft carrier and a destroyer. She followed prewar doctrine and fired three torpedoes on sonar bearings from a depth of , without success. On 3 January 1942, three torpedoes were fired at an enemy submarine, resulting in two explosions, but a sinking could not be confirmed. She refueled at Balikpapan, Borneo, on 4 January and arrived at Port Darwin, Australia, for refit on 14 January.

&quot;Skipjack&quot;″s second war patrol, conducted in the Celebes Sea, was uneventful with the exception of an unsuccessful attack on a Japanese aircraft carrier. She returned to Fremantle, Western Australia, on 10 March 1942. On 14 April, &quot;Skipjack&quot; got underway under the command of James W. Coe for her third war patrol, conducted in the Celebes Sea, Sulu Sea, and South China Sea. On 6 May, contact was made with a Japanese cargo ship, and the submarine moved in for the kill. Finding herself almost dead ahead, &quot;Skipjack&quot; fired a &quot;down the throat&quot; spread of three torpedoes that sank (). Two days later, the submarine intercepted a three-ship convoy escorted by a destroyer and she fired two torpedoes that severely damaged the merchant ship, (). Then she let go with four more that quickly sank the cargo ship, (). On 17 May, &quot;Skipjack&quot; sank the passenger-cargo ship () off Indochina before heading back to Fremantle.

==Fourth through Ninth War Patrols==

Following participation in performance tests for the Mark 14 torpedo, &quot;Skipjack&quot; sailed for her fourth war patrol on 18 July 1942, conducted along the northwest coast of Timor which she reconnoitered and photographed. She also severely damaged an enemy oiler. The submarine returned to Fremantle for refit on 4 September.

&quot;Skipjack&quot;″s fifth war patrol was conducted off Timor Island, Amboina, and Halmahera. On 14 October, while patrolling south of the Palau Islands, the submarine torpedoed and sank the 6,781-ton cargo ship, (). Following a depth charge attack by a Japanese destroyer, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 November.

&quot;Skipjack&quot;″s sixth, seventh, and eighth war patrols were unproductive. But, during her ninth, conducted in the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands areas, she sank two enemy vessels. On 26 January 1944, she commenced a night attack on a merchant ship, but, prior to firing, she shifted targets when an enemy destroyer began a run on the submarine. She quickly fired her forward torpedoes and was rewarded with solid hits that quickly sank (). The submarine then fired her stern tubes at the merchant ship. One of the submarine&#x27;s torpedo tube valves stuck open and her after torpedo room began to flood. The torpedomen were unable to close the emergency valves until she had taken on approximately 14 tons of water. A large upward angle developed almost immediately, forcing the submarine to surface. By the time control of the boat had been regained, the water in the torpedo room was only a few inches from the top of the water tight door, but fortunately there were no casualties, and &quot;Skipjack&quot; resumed the attack. The submarine then torpedoed and sank the converted seaplane tender (). She returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 March.
==Tenth War Patrol==

Following repairs, &quot;Skipjack&quot; participated in performance tests on new torpedoes in cold water off the Pribilof Islands until 17 April and then headed for the Mare Island Navy Yard and overhaul. After returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Skipjack&quot; got underway for her tenth and final war patrol, conducted in the Kuril Islands area. During this patrol, she damaged an enemy auxiliary and attacked a Japanese destroyer without success.

==Late war==
On 11 December 1944, she returned to Midway Island and then continued on to Ulithi. She then sailed to Pearl Harbor for refit; and got underway on 1 June 1945 for New London, Connecticut, and duty training submarine school students.

==Fate==
&quot;Skipjack&quot; was later sunk as a target vessel in the second atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 and was later raised and towed to Mare Island. On 11 August 1948, she was again sunk as a target off the coast of California by aircraft rockets. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 September 1948.

<text>USS &quot;Snapper&quot; (SS-185), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy of the name and the second to be named for the snapper.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Snapper&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 23 July 1936. She was launched on 24 August 1937, sponsored by Mrs. Katharine R. Stark, wife of Rear Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, and commissioned on 16 December 1937.

==Pre-World War II service==

On 10 May 1938, &quot;Snapper&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for her shakedown cruise, visited Cuba, the Panama Canal Zone, Peru, and Chile, and returned to Portsmouth on 16 July. There, she conducted final acceptance trials and underwent post-shakedown overhaul.

On 3 October, &quot;Snapper&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 3 based at Balboa, Canal Zone, where she participated in training and fleet exercises until 15 March 1939, when she set sail for repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. Departing Portsmouth on 9 May, she stopped at New London, Connecticut, and then got underway for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego, California, on 2 June. On 1 July, the submarine set sail for Pearl Harbor and maneuvers in the Hawaiian area, followed by overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, from 1 December 1939 to 1 March 1940.

Following her return to San Diego, &quot;Snapper&quot; was assigned to SubRon 6 and got underway for Hawaii on 1 April, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 9 April. Except for a brief voyage to San Diego in October and November 1940, &quot;Snapper&quot; remained in the Hawaiian area participating in training exercises and fleet tactics until 3 May 1941, when she departed for overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Upon completion, she became a unit of SubRon 2 based at San Diego. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Snapper&quot; was operating in the Philippine Islands area.

==First and second war patrols==

On 19 December, &quot;Snapper&quot; departed Manila for her first war patrol, covering the shipping lanes between Hong Kong and Hainan Strait until 8 January 1942, when she set sail for Davao Gulf in the Philippines. On 12 January, she made an unsuccessful attack on a Japanese supply ship which escaped when &quot;Snapper&quot; was forced down by an escorting destroyer. While off Cape San Agustin on 24 January, she attacked another supply ship without success, again being forced deep by destroyer escorts. On 1 February, as the submarine approached Bangka Strait, she was detected by an enemy destroyer which made a fruitless depth charge attack. In return, &quot;Snapper&quot; fired two torpedoes but both failed to find the target. &quot;Snapper&quot; arrived at Soerabaja, Java, on 10 February and then continued on to Fremantle, Western Australia.

&quot;Snapper&quot; departed Fremantle on 6 March for the approaches to Tarakan and her second war patrol. Finding no suitable targets there, she was directed to Davao Gulf where, on 31 March, she closed a large armed tender or auxiliary cruiser. She fired two bow torpedoes at and, after reversing course, came to periscope depth to observe the enemy ship dead in the water. After firing one torpedo from her stern tube, she was forced deep to evade an attacking escort ship. Later that night, she was ordered to Mactan Island to unload ammunition and take on board 46 tons of food for the besieged island of Corregidor. Arriving there on 4 April, she transferred her cargo to submarine rescue vessel , took on board 27 evacuees, and headed back to Fremantle, evading Japanese destroyer patrols on the way.

On 23 April, &quot;Snapper&quot; received word that was in trouble and reversed course to go to her aid. After towing the stricken submarine to Fremantle, she sailed for Albany and then returned to Fremantle.

==Third and fourth war patrols==

&quot;Snapper&quot;″s third war patrol was conducted in the Flores Sea, Makassar Strait, and the western Celebes Sea. Despite intensive efforts, the submarine found no worthwhile targets and returned to Fremantle from a disappointing patrol on 16 July 1942.

On 8 August 1942, &quot;Snapper&quot; headed for the South China Sea and her fourth war patrol. On 19 August, she fired two torpedoes at a cargo ship but lost contact when forced to evade an escort ship. The only other targets sighted during this patrol were at too great a distance or on a course and speed that prevented the submarine from closing. On 28 September 1942, a PBY-5 Catalina flying boat of U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 101 (VP-101) mistook her for a Japanese submarine and attacked her in the Indian Ocean south-southwest of Bali at a position given by &quot;Snapper&quot; as and by the PBY-5 as . &quot;Snapper&quot; crash-dived, and the PBY-5 dropped one depth charge that shook &quot;Snapper&quot; as she passed through a depth of on her way to . &quot;Snapper&quot; suffered only superficial damage and no casualties.

==Fifth, sixth and seventh war patrols==

Although both the fifth and sixth war patrols were also unproductive, during the seventh, conducted in the vicinity of Guam, &quot;Snapper&quot; sank her initial victim of the war. According to her war diary, she sighted two vessels moored in the extreme northeast corner of Apra Harbor, Guam, and decided to patrol submerged off the harbor until they departed. Seven days later, on 27 August, she headed to the north of the harbor, firing three torpedoes at the first target and one at the second. As she quickly departed the vicinity, &quot;Snapper&quot; observed one hit on the first target, sinking the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Tokai Maru&quot;, stern first.

On 2 September, &quot;Snapper&quot; closed a convoy of five cargo ships and two escorts. The primary targets, the cargo ships, zigged away; and, when the port escort came into view &quot;head on,&quot; the submarine fired a &quot;down-the-throat&quot; shot at the escort, , that blew the enemy&#x27;s bow completely off and enveloped her in flames as she sank. The submarine quickly cleared the locality as the other escort commenced a depth charge attack. On 6 September, &quot;Snapper&quot; intercepted another convoy and fired three torpedoes; but all were misses. On 17 September, she terminated her seventh patrol at Pearl Harbor.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols==

&quot;Snapper&quot;″s eighth war patrol was conducted off Honshū, Japan, from 19 October to 14 December. While battling heavy seas on 29 November, the submarine sighted a convoy of five ships and two escorts and began to close the range. She fired three bow torpedoes and scored two hits that set the cargo ship &quot;Kenryu Maru&quot; ablaze as she settled by the bow and sank.

On 14 March 1944, following overhaul at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Snapper&quot; began her ninth war patrol, conducted in the area of the Bonin Islands. Few worthwhile targets were sighted during this patrol. On 24 March, she contacted a convoy of 12 ships and fired eight torpedoes with six hits. She was credited with damaging a freighter but, due to heavy seas, was unable to continue the attack. Enemy escorts and heavy seas continually prevented any further attacks, and &quot;Snapper&quot; returned to Midway Island on 29 April.

==Tenth and eleventh war patrols==

&quot;Snapper&quot; spent her tenth war patrol engaged in lifeguard duties near Truk in support of bombardment missions by the United States Army Air Forces. On 9 June, while the submarine was patrolling on the surface, an enemy plane broke quickly from a low cloud and attacked. As &quot;Snapper&quot; quickly dove, one bomb struck directly above the hatch instantly killing one crewman and injuring several others, including the commanding officer. As the submarine continued to dive, shells were heard striking her hull. Upon surfacing, it was found that her pressure hull had not been damaged, but a heavy oil slick indicated a puncture of a fuel oil ballast tank. Minor repairs were made. Two wounded enlisted men were transferred to submarine tender at Majuro Atoll on 13 June, and &quot;Snapper&quot; continued her lifeguard duty until returning to Pearl Harbor on 21 July.

On 5 September, &quot;Snapper&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her eleventh and final war patrol, conducted in the Bonin Islands area. On 1 October, the submarine encountered two enemy vessels escorted by a small patrol craft. The submarine fired her bow torpedoes at the large target then swung for a &quot;down-the-throat&quot; shot at the smaller vessel. Hits were scored on both vessels resulting in the sinking of the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Seian Maru&quot;, and the coastal minelayer, &quot;Ajiro&quot;. &quot;Snapper&quot; then took up lifeguard station off Iwo Jima until 18 October and terminated her eleventh patrol at Midway on 27 October, before continuing on to Pearl Harbor.

==End of war and fate==

&quot;Snapper&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 2 November and set sail for overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Getting underway from Mare Island on 9 March 1945, the submarine arrived at San Diego on 11 March and engaged in local training operations for several months. She transited the Panama Canal on 20 May and arrived at New London, Connecticut, on 27 May where she operated until decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 November 1945. &quot;Snapper&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948 and sold for scrap to the Interstate Metals Corporation of New York City, on 18 May 1948.

<text>USS &quot;Stingray&quot; (SS-186), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named the stingray.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Stingray&quot;′s keel was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 1 October 1936. She was launched on 6 October 1937, sponsored by Mrs. Olive G. McLean, widow of Rear Admiral Ridley McLean, who had had a distinguished career in the submarine service, and was commissioned on 15 March 1938.

==Pre-World War II service==

Following shakedown off New England and in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Stingray&quot; entered Portsmouth Navy Yard for alterations and upon completion on 14 January 1939, departed for a cruise in Caribbean waters. After briefly stopping at New London, Connecticut, on 20 April the submarine transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Diego, California, on 11 May for a rigorous schedule of training and maneuvers as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6. She put to sea on 1 April 1940 for fleet exercises in the Hawaiian area, followed by overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California. Upon completion, &quot;Stingray&quot; returned to the Hawaiian area, where she remained until joining the Asiatic Fleet at Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 23 October 1941.

==First and second war patrols==

&quot;Stingray&quot; was at Manila on 7 December during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and immediately put to sea on her first war patrol. Patrolling in Lingayen Gulf, the submarine witnessed the Japanese invasion of Lingayen, but due to material deficiencies in the submarine, she was unable to attack. She terminated her first war patrol at Manila on 24 December.

Following repairs, &quot;Stingray&quot; got underway on her second war patrol on 30 December. While in Sama Bay on 10 January 1942, she torpedoed and sank her initial victim of the war, the transport &quot;Harbin Maru&quot;. The submarine then patrolled in Davao Gulf through 8 February without any contacts and put into Surabaja, Java, on 12 February. As the Japanese closed upon that Dutch base, she quickly got underway for Fremantle, Western Australia, arriving on 3 March.

==Third and fourth war patrols==

&quot;Stingray&quot; departed Fremantle on 16 March for her third war patrol, conducted in the Celebes Sea and Java Sea. The only worthwhile target encountered during this patrol was a Japanese destroyer cruising just off Makassar City Celebes. Although the submarine fired three torpedoes at the enemy, all were misses. &quot;Stingray&quot; returned to Fremantle on 2 May.

For her fourth war patrol, &quot;Stingray&quot; got underway on 27 May and headed for Davao Gulf, and then on to Guam. On the afternoon of 28 June, the submarine sighted two ships with escort, and quickly began to close the range. She fired four torpedoes at the first ship, and the resultant explosion quickly sank the converted gunboat &quot;Saikyo Maru&quot;. The submarine continued patrol in the vicinity of Guam until 15 July, when she returned to Pearl Harbor for overhaul. During that overhaul, she was fitted with two external torpedo tubes, just below deck level forward.

==Fifth through seventh war patrols==

Although &quot;Stingray&quot;″s fifth war patrol, in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands, and sixth war patrol, conducted in the Marshall Islands, were unproductive, during the seventh, the submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Tamon Maru&quot;.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols==

For her eighth war patrol, &quot;Stingray&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor on 12 June 1943, and set course for the Caroline Islands. Her only contact during this patrol was a high-speed northbound convoy that she was unable to close on. The submarine returned to Brisbane, Australia, from a disappointing patrol on 31 July.

On 23 August 1943, &quot;Stingray&quot; departed Brisbane for her ninth war patrol, conducted en route to Pearl Harbor. On 31 August, a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber attacked her as she crash-dived in the Solomon Sea west of Buka Island at , dropping three bombs which missed her by .. &quot;Stingray&quot; suffered significant damage but no casualties. She was forced to surface and repair the damage. She then patrolled in the Admiralty Islands without making a single contact and terminated her ninth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 10 October 1943, continuing on to Mare Island Navy Yard for shipyard overhaul.

==Tenth war patrol==

Following return to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Stingray&quot; got underway on 10 March 1944 for her tenth war patrol conducted in the Mariana Islands. On 30 March, she slipped past three escorts to gain attack position on two cargo ships, and fired four torpedoes at the lead ship. One torpedo hit amidships and stopped the enemy dead in the water. &quot;Stingray&quot; then fired four more torpedoes at the damaged cargo ship that quickly sent &quot;Ikushima Maru&quot; to the bottom.

On the afternoon of 8 April, while patrolling north of the Marianas, &quot;Stingray&quot; bounced off a large submerged object at a depth of , lifting the submarine . Inasmuch as the submarine was in the middle of the ocean, with her charts showing over of water, the first thoughts of the commanding officer concerned what new type of antisubmarine measure the enemy was using. &quot;Stingray&quot; then took precautionary soundings and found no bottom at 2,000 fathoms. Unable to determine what she had collided with, the submarine continued patrol.

During the early morning darkness of 13 April, &quot;Stingray&quot;″s lookouts sighted the approach of a broaching torpedo. She made a sharp turn to port as the torpedo passed ahead. Two seconds later, a second torpedo just missed as it ran down her starboard side. She searched the area for her attacker without success and returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 April.

==Eleventh through sixteenth war patrols and fate==

&quot;Stingray&quot; spent her eleventh war patrol on lifeguard station for air strikes on Guam. On 11 June the submarine rescued a downed Navy aviator and the following day pulled two more airmen from the water. On 13 June, &quot;Stingray&quot; received word that a Navy airman was down approximately offshore. With shells exploding on either side of the submarine, she made four submerged approaches until the pilot was finally able to grab one of the submarine&#x27;s periscopes and was towed safely clear of the island and taken on board. On 18 June, &quot;Stingray&quot; experienced a fire in her superstructure near the conning tower hatch. After extinguishing the fire several times only to have it flare up again, the trouble was finally located, and the submarine continued patrol. She returned to Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 10 July.

For her twelfth war patrol, &quot;Stingray&quot; carried out a special mission, landing fifteen Filipino officers and men and six tons of supplies on the northeastern coast of Luzon. On the way back to Port Darwin, Australia, on 18 August, she picked up four Japanese sailors from the cruiser , which was sunk earlier in the day. &quot;Stingray&quot; reached Port Darwin on 7 September 1944.

&quot;Stingray&quot; was underway again on 10 September 1944 for her thirteenth war patrol, spent on a special mission to look over possible landing beaches at Marjoe Island. She returned to Port Darwin on 19 September 1944.

&quot;Stingray&quot; carried out two special missions in the Philippine Islands during her fourteenth and fifteenth war patrols. She was on the surface in the Pacific Ocean east-northeast of Morotai at on 3 October 1944 when a U.S. Navy TBF Avenger torpedo bomber from the escort carrier mistakenly attacked her. As she crash-dived to a depth of , she heard a loud thud as she passed , followed by an explosion after she reached , prompting her to dive to . She later learned that the thud probably was the sound of the TBF crashing while delivering the attack, killing the pilot, and that the explosion probably was the detonation of one of the TBF&#x27;s depth charges as it sank.

On 11 January 1945, &quot;Stingray&quot; put to sea on her sixteenth and final war patrol. Four special missions in the Celebes area were carried out during this patrol. Landing parties were put ashore on Nipanipa Peninsula, Celebes; Kagean Island; Pare Pare Bay, Celebes; and another at Nipanipa Peninsula. She returned to Fremantle, Western Australia, on 23 February and then headed back to the United States arriving at New London, Connecticut, on 29 April. She operated there until decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 October 1945. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 July 1946 and sold for scrap the following year.

Two of &quot;Stingray&quot; General Motors Model 248 V16 engines were acquired by the in Cleveland, Ohio. The two V16 1,600 HP diesel engines were originally built in Cleveland, Ohio. The engines are held in reserve for parts for the restoration of &quot;Cod&quot; engines.

==Honors and awards==

* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 12 battle stars for World War II service

&quot;Stingray&quot; holds the record for the most war patrols — sixteen — by any American submarine.

<text>USS &quot;Sturgeon&quot; (SS-187), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon. Her 1944 sinking of the Japanese troopship , killing more than 5,000 Japanese, was one of the highest death tolls from the sinking of a single ship in history. Her 1942 sinking of the which, unknown to crew on the &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, was carrying over 1,000 POWs, was the worst maritime disaster in Australian history.

==Construction==
Her keel was laid down on 27 October 1936, by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 15 March 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Alice N. Freeman, wife of Charles S. Freeman, Commander, Submarine Force, United States Fleet. The boat was commissioned on 25 June 1938.

== 1938–1941 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; completed builder&#x27;s trials in Monterey Bay and began her shakedown cruise on 15 October 1938, visiting ports in Mexico, Honduras, Panama, Peru, Ecuador, and Costa Rica before returning to San Diego, on 12 December 1938. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6 and operated along the West Coast as far north as Washington. She made two squadron cruises to Hawaii with the Pacific Fleet: from 1 July to 16 August 1939 and from 1 April to 12 July 1940. The submarine departed San Diego on 5 November 1940 for Pearl Harbor and operated from there until November 1941.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 10 November, headed for the Philippine Islands and arrived at Manila Bay on 22 November. She was then attached to SubRon 2, Submarine Division (SubDiv) 22, United States Asiatic Fleet.

== First patrol: December 1941 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; was moored in Mariveles Naval Section Base on 7 December 1941 during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She put to sea the next afternoon to patrol an area between the Pescadores Islands and Formosa. A small tanker was sighted the afternoon of 9 December, but it remained out of torpedo range.

The submarine found a convoy of five merchant ships accompanied by a cruiser and several destroyers on 18 December. As she came to periscope depth within attack range of the cruiser, she was sighted by one of the escorts approximately away. She started going deep but had only reached a depth of when the first depth charge exploded, breaking numerous light bulbs but causing no serious damage. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; began silent running and evaded the escorts.

On the evening of 21 December, the submarine sighted a darkened ship believed to be a large cargo carrier. A torpedo spread was fired from the stern tubes, but they all passed ahead of the ship because of an error in her estimated speed. The ship ended her first war patrol when she returned to Mariveles Bay on 25 December.

== Second patrol: December 1941 – March 1942 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; was at sea again on 28 December 1941 en route to the Tarakan area, off the coast of Borneo. A tanker was sighted southwest of Sibutu Island on 17 January 1942, but all three torpedoes missed and the ship escaped. On the night of 22 January, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; was alerted by that a large convoy was headed her way in Makassar Strait. A few minutes later, her sonar picked up the pings of ships dead astern. She submerged and fired four torpedoes at a large ship, with two explosions following. The submarine was then subjected to a two and one-half-hour depth charge attack by two destroyers which caused no damage.

On 26 January she sighted an enemy transport and four destroyers off Balikpapan. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; fired a spread from her forward tubes which resulted in a large explosion on the transport, and her screws stopped turning. No post-war record of a sinking could be found, but the transport was believed damaged. Three days later, she made two hits on a tanker.

On the morning of 8 February, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; found herself on the track of an enemy invasion fleet headed toward Makassar. She submerged to avoid detection by several destroyers and a cruiser as they passed overhead but was able to report the movement of the convoy to command. The submarine retired from her patrol area two days later when she was ordered to Java. She arrived at Soerabaja on 13 February, but since the Japanese were advancing upon that base, the ship proceeded to Tjilatjap. After embarking part of the Asiatic Fleet Submarine Force Staff, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; and sailed for Fremantle, Western Australia, on 20 February as escorts for and .

== Third patrol: March – May 1942 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; remained in Fremantle from 3 to 15 March, when she departed to again patrol off Makassar. On 30 March she sank the cargo ship &quot;Choko Maru&quot;. On 3 April one of her torpedoes struck a 750-ton frigate directly under the bridge, and she was officially listed as probably sunk. She then fired three torpedoes at a merchantman but missed. With one torpedo remaining in the bow tubes, she fired and hit the target abreast the foremast. When last seen, it was listing heavily to port and making for the Celebes shore.

On 6 April she fired a spread at a tanker, but the range was so close that they failed to arm. The submarine was then depth charged by escorts but eluded them and patrolled off Cape Mandar (in West Sulawesi) in the Makassar Strait. On 22 April a destroyer&#x27;s searchlight blinked to &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, and she went deep to avoid the subsequent two-hour depth charge attack. On 28 April the submarine sailed for Australia. However, she interrupted her voyage on the night of 30 April in an attempt to rescue some Royal Australian and Royal Air Force personnel reported on an island at the entrance of Cilacap Harbor. A landing party under Lieutenant Chester W. Nimitz, Jr. entered the cove and examined it by searchlight but found only a deserted lean-to. She continued to Fremantle and arrived there on 7 May.

== Fourth patrol: June – July 1942 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; refitted and returned to sea on 5 June to patrol an area west of Manila. On 25 June she caught up with a nine-ship convoy before daylight and fired three torpedoes at the largest ship and heard explosions. After some 21 depth charges were dropped by the escorts, she managed to escape with only a few gauges broken. On 1 July &quot;Sturgeon&quot; she sank the 7,267-ton prisoner transport off the coast of Luzon. On 5 July she scored hits on a tanker in a convoy northbound from Manila. Her patrol ended on 22 July when she arrived at Fremantle for refit.

It was later discovered that &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; had been carrying over 1,000 Australian prisoners of war and civilian internees from Rabaul. 1,140 (including 88 Japanese crew) were killed while 18 survived. Some of the Japanese including the ship&#x27;s captain made it to the Philippines, but most, including the captain, were killed by local guerrillas. This loss of Australian lives is the worst maritime disaster in Australian history. Only one eyewitness account has emerged. After 60 years the sole surviving Japanese sailor described the &quot;death cries&quot; of trapped Australians going down with the ship while others sung Auld Lang Syne.

== Fifth patrol: September – October 1942 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; stood out of port on 4 September to begin her fifth war patrol in an area between Mono Island and the Shortland Islands in the Solomon Islands group. On 11 September she began patrolling west of Bougainville to intercept enemy shipping between Rabaul, Buka, and Faisi. The submarine fired four torpedoes at a large cargo ship, on 14 September but missed with all.

Three days later she fired a spread at a tanker with two apparent hits. At 05:36 on 1 October &quot;Sturgeon&quot; sighted the 8,033-ton aircraft ferry &quot;Katsuragi Maru&quot;. A spread of four torpedoes was fired and resulted in three hits which sent the ship to the bottom. An escort depth charged the submarine for a while and then broke off to rescue survivors. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; moved south of Tetepare Island and patrolled there until she returned to Brisbane on 25 October for repairs and refit.

== Sixth patrol: November 1942 – January 1943 ==

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; returned to sea and began patrolling in the Truk area on 30 November. She fired four torpedoes at a Japanese ship on 6 December and observed one hit. She missed hitting targets on 9 and 18 December. The ship withdrew from the area on 25 December and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 January 1943. She was in the yard from 14 January to 11 May for an overhaul.

== Seventh and eighth patrols: June – October 1943 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot;″s seventh war patrol began on 12 June and ended at Midway Island on 2 August. She sighted seven worthwhile targets but was able to attack only one. That occurred on 1 July when she fired a spread at a freighter and heard two hits, causing possible damage. The next patrol, from 29 August to 23 October, was equally unrewarding, and she returned to Pearl Harbor.

== Ninth patrol: December 1943 – January 1944 ==
On 13 December 1943, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; sailed for Japanese home waters. She sighted a seven-ship convoy with four escorts on 11 January 1944. Finding an overlapping target, she fired four torpedoes, and the cargo ship &quot;Erie Maru&quot; went to the bottom. The submarine was forced to go deep to avoid a depth charge attack and was unable to regain contact with the convoy. Five days later, she attacked a freighter &quot;Akagi Maru&quot; and the destroyer in Bungo Channel. &quot;Suzutsuki&quot; was hit by two torpedoes which blew off the bow and stern. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; was pinned down all afternoon by the destroyer &#x27;s counterattacks and cleared the area at 18:55. Two attacks were made on a four-ship convoy on 24 January. One hit was registered on a Japanese merchant ship from the first attack while the spread fired at the other merchant ship sank &quot;Chosen Maru&quot;. Two days later, she made a fruitless attack on two freighters, and the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor, via Midway, for refit.

== Tenth patrol: April – May 1944 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot;″s next assignment was in the Bonin Islands area from 8 April until 26 May and included plane guard duty near Marcus Island during aircraft carrier strikes there. On 10 May, she attacked a convoy of five merchant ships and two escorts. She made two hits on a small freighter before the escorts and an enemy plane forced the submarine to go deep. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; finally came to periscope depth and trailed the convoy until the next morning when she made an end-around run and fired four torpedoes at a freighter. Three hits put &quot;Seiru Maru&quot; under in two minutes. The submarine swung around and fired her bow tubes at another ship. Two hits were recorded; when last seen the target was dead in the water, smoking heavily. The submarine began plane guard duty on 20 May and rescued three airmen before heading for Midway two days later.

== Eleventh patrol: June – August 1944 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; sailed for the Nansei Shoto on 10 June to begin her last war patrol. Only two worthy contacts were made, and they were heavily escorted. The first was an eight-ship convoy which she attacked on 29 June. Four torpedoes were fired at a large ship. Four hits on the 7,089-ton passenger-cargo troopship sent her up in flames and to the bottom. This sinking had a sizeable influence on the battle of Okinawa, as the ship was carrying 5,600 troops of the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade that were on their way to the island. On 3 July &quot;Sturgeon&quot; sighted a nine-ship convoy accompanied by air cover and numerous small escorts. She registered three hits on the cargo ship &quot;Tairin Maru&quot; that blew her bow off and holed her side. She rolled to starboard and sank. The submarine went deep and avoided the 196 depth charges and aerial bombs that were rained down upon her. She evaded the escorts and returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 August.

== 1944–1948 ==
&quot;Sturgeon&quot; was routed to California for an overhaul and arrived at San Francisco on 15 August. On 31 December 1944 the ship shifted to San Diego and sailed on 5 January 1945 for the East Coast. She arrived at New London on 26 January and was assigned to SubRon 1. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; operated in Block Island Sound as a training ship until 25 October. She entered the Boston Navy Yard on 30 October and was decommissioned on 15 November 1945. &quot;Sturgeon&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948 and sold to Interstate Metals Corporation of New York City on 12 June 1948 for scrap.

<text>In probability theory, a compound Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of the sum of a number of independent identically-distributed random variables, where the number of terms to be added is itself a Poisson-distributed variable. The result can be either a continuous or a discrete distribution.

==Definition==

Suppose that

:formula_1

i.e., &quot;N&quot; is a random variable whose distribution is a Poisson distribution with expected value λ, and that

:formula_2

are identically distributed random variables that are mutually independent and also independent of &quot;N&quot;. Then the probability distribution of the sum of formula_3 i.i.d. random variables

:formula_4

is a compound Poisson distribution.

In the case &quot;N&quot; = 0, then this is a sum of 0 terms, so the value of &quot;Y&quot; is 0. Hence the conditional distribution of &quot;Y&quot; given that &quot;N&quot; = 0 is a degenerate distribution.

The compound Poisson distribution is obtained by marginalising the joint distribution of (&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;N&quot;) over &quot;N&quot;, and this joint distribution can be obtained by combining the conditional distribution &quot;Y&quot; | &quot;N&quot; with the marginal distribution of &quot;N&quot;.

==Properties==

The expected value and the variance of the compound distribution can be derived in a simple way from law of total expectation and the law of total variance. Thus

:formula_5

: formula_6

Then, since E(&quot;N&quot;) = Var(&quot;N&quot;) if &quot;N&quot; is Poisson-distributed, these formulae can be reduced to

:formula_7
:formula_8

The probability distribution of &quot;Y&quot; can be determined in terms of characteristic functions:

:formula_9
and hence, using the probability-generating function of the Poisson distribution, we have
:formula_10

An alternative approach is via cumulant generating functions:
:formula_11

Via the law of total cumulance it can be shown that, if the mean of the Poisson distribution &quot;λ&quot; = 1, the cumulants of &quot;Y&quot; are the same as the moments of &quot;X&quot;1.

Every infinitely divisible probability distribution is a limit of compound Poisson distributions. And compound Poisson distributions is infinitely divisible by the definition.

==Discrete compound Poisson distribution==

When formula_2 are positive integer-valued i.i.d random variables with formula_13, then this compound Poisson distribution is named discrete compound Poisson distribution (or stuttering-Poisson distribution) . We say that the discrete random variable formula_14 satisfying probability generating function characterization

:formula_15

has a discrete compound Poisson(DCP) distribution with parameters formula_16 (where formula_17, with formula_18), which is denoted by

:formula_19

Moreover, if formula_20, we say formula_21 has a discrete compound Poisson distribution of order formula_22 . When formula_23, DCP becomes Poisson distribution and Hermite distribution, respectively. When formula_24, DCP becomes triple stuttering-Poisson distribution and quadruple stuttering-Poisson distribution, respectively. Other special cases include: shift geometric distribution, negative binomial distribution, Geometric Poisson distribution, Neyman type A distribution, Luria–Delbrück distribution in Luria–Delbrück experiment. For more special case of DCP, see the reviews paper and references therein.

Feller&#x27;s characterization of the compound Poisson distribution states that a non-negative integer valued r.v. formula_21 is infinitely divisible if and only if its distribution is a discrete compound Poisson distribution. The negative binomial distribution is discrete infinitely divisible, i.e., if &quot;X&quot; has a negative binomial distribution, then for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, there exist discrete i.i.d. random variables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; whose sum has the same distribution that &quot;X&quot; has. The shift geometric distribution is discrete compound Poisson distribution since it is a trivial case of negative binomial distribution.

This distribution can model batch arrivals (such as in a bulk queue). The discrete compound Poisson distribution is also widely used in actuarial science for modelling the distribution of the total claim amount.

When some formula_26 are negative, it is the discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution. We define that any discrete random variable formula_14 satisfying probability generating function characterization

:formula_28

has a discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution with parameters formula_29 where formula_30 and formula_31, with formula_32.

==Compound Poisson Gamma distribution==

If &quot;X&quot; has a gamma distribution, of which the exponential distribution is a special case, then the conditional distribution of &quot;Y&quot; | &quot;N&quot; is again a gamma distribution. The marginal distribution of &quot;Y&quot; is a Tweedie distribution with variance power 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2 (proof via comparison of characteristic function). To be more explicit, if

:formula_33

and

:formula_34

i.i.d., then the distribution of

:formula_35

is a reproductive exponential dispersion model formula_36 with

:formula_37

The mapping of parameters Tweedie parameter formula_38 to the Poisson and Gamma parameters formula_39 is the following:

:formula_40

==Compound Poisson processes==

A compound Poisson process with rate formula_41 and jump size distribution &quot;G&quot; is a continuous-time stochastic process formula_42 given by

:formula_43

where the sum is by convention equal to zero as long as &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 0. Here, formula_44 is a Poisson process with rate formula_45, and formula_46 are independent and identically distributed random variables, with distribution function &quot;G&quot;, which are also independent of formula_47

For the discrete version of compound Poisson process, it can be used in survival analysis for the frailty models.

==Applications==
A compound Poisson distribution, in which the summands have an exponential distribution, was used by Revfeim to model the distribution of the total rainfall in a day, where each day contains a Poisson-distributed number of events each of which provides an amount of rainfall which has an exponential distribution. Thompson applied the same model to monthly total rainfalls.

There have been applications to insurance claims and x-ray computed tomography.

<text>The 8 mm backup format is a discontinued magnetic tape data storage format used in computer systems, pioneered by Exabyte Corporation. It is also known as Data8, often abbreviated to D8 and is written as D-Eight on some Sony branded media. Such systems can back up up to 60 GB of data depending on configuration. The cassettes have the same dimensions and construction as the cassettes used in 8 mm video format recorders and camcorders. 

Until the advent of AIT, Exabyte was the sole vendor of 8 mm format tape drives. The company was formed with the aim of taking the 8 mm video format and making it suitable for data storage. They did so by building a reliable mechanism and data format that used the common 8 mm helical scan videotape technology that was available then.

Exabyte&#x27;s first 8 mm tape drive was made available in 1987. This was followed up with their Mammoth tape drive in 1996, and the Mammoth-2 (M2) in 1999.

Exabyte&#x27;s drive mechanisms were frequently rebranded and integrated into UNIX systems.

Metal Particle (MP) Data8 cartridges are essentially identical to Video8 cassettes and can be used for video recording. Similarly, Video8 cassettes will work in Data8 drives capable of using MP tape.

<doc id="949570" wikidata="Q621874" url="?curid=949570" title="M18 Hellcat">
<text>The M18 Hellcat (officially designated the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 or M18 GMC) is a tank destroyer used by the United States Army in World War II and the Korean War. Despite being equipped with the same main gun as some variants of the much larger Sherman tank, the M18 attained a much higher top speed of up to by keeping armor to a minimum, and using the innovative Torqmatic automatic transmission.

The M18 Hellcat was the culmination of the development of various prototypes of fast tank destroyers dating back to 1941. Entering production in summer 1943, the M18 first saw combat service in spring 1944. The M18 served primarily in Western Europe, but was also present in smaller numbers in Italy and the Pacific. Production continued until October 1944, with 2,507 built.

This tank was the most effective U.S. tank destroyer of World War II. It had a higher kill-to-loss ratio than any other tank or tank destroyer fielded by U.S. forces in World War II. Kills claimed were 526 in total: 498 in Europe, 17 in Italy, and 11 in the Pacific. The kills-to-losses ratio for Europe was 2.3 to 1, and the overall kill to loss ratio was 2.4 to 1. M18s were &quot;...not primarily used for tank fighting, but were committed more often to improvised roles, usually direct fire support for infantry.&quot; Although the M18 was retired from U.S. service immediately after the end of World War II, a variant, the M39 armored utility vehicle, served in the Korean War, and M18s continued in service with some countries until 1995.

The M18 Hellcat was an example of the balancing act among firepower, armor, and mobility in armored fighting vehicle design. Despite its excellent mobility and reasonably powerful main gun, the M18 Hellcat also had drawbacks, including thin armor and a poor high explosive shell for its main gun. Historian Steven J. Zaloga characterized the overall design of the M18 as &quot;poorly balanced&quot; and stated that &quot;the Hellcat&#x27;s combat record is attributable to the training and dedication of its crews, not to its ill-conceived design.&quot;

==Development==
When the Tank Destroyer Force was organized in 1941, their commander, Lieutenant Colonel (later General) Andrew Davis Bruce envisioned the units being equipped with something faster than a tank, with a better gun but less armor to allow for speed; a cruiser rather than a battleship. He objected to the 3-inch M10 gun motor carriage because it was too heavy and slow for his needs, and later on to the 90 mm M36 gun motor carriage because it was essentially an M10 with a bigger gun. The United States Ordnance Department made several failed attempts to provide such a vehicle using the weapons (the 37 mm, 57 mm, 3-inch, 75 mm and finally the lightweight 76 mm of 1942–1943) and technology available, including mounting the 3-inch gun on the fast M3 light tank chassis. The M18 was the end product of a long line of research vehicles aimed at providing the desired machine.

In December 1941, the Ordnance Department issued a requirement for the design of a fast tank destroyer using a Christie suspension, a Wright-Continental R-975 radial aircraft engine, and a 37 mm gun on the chassis of the Light Airborne Tank T9 as the 37 mm Gun Motor Carriage T42. In April 1942, the Army requested that the 37 mm gun be replaced with a 57 mm and a coil spring suspension be substituted for the Christie suspension as the 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage T49, and authorized the construction of two pilot models. The Tank Destroyer Force, meanwhile, concluded that the same 75 mm gun M3 as used on the M4 Sherman medium tank would be better for a tank destroyer. The second pilot T49 was built with the 75 mm gun in an open-topped turret as the 75 mm Gun Motor Carriage T67 and was delivered in November 1942. After testing, it was revealed that a more powerful engine was necessary, and the 76 mm gun M1A1 being developed for the M4 Sherman had also impressed the Tank Destroyer Force. The T67 project was closed in January 1943, and the Ordnance Department directed that six pilot models of the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage T70 be built with torsion bar suspensions, more powerful engines, new turrets and minor changes to the hull front. What became the M18 originated in Harley Earl&#x27;s design studio, part of the Buick Motor Division of General Motors. Previously, basic designs for other kinds of vehicles had mostly originated from within the Ordnance Department. Buick&#x27;s engineers used a torsion bar suspension that provided a steady ride.

The first pilot was delivered in April 1943, and all six were completed by July. Once developed, the Hellcat was tested in the same manner as passenger cars before and after it, at the General Motors Milford Proving Ground. Although the Hellcat was &quot;relatively mature&quot; when it came to automotive performance, problems had to be rectified that included issues with the engine and new automatic transmission, weak front shock absorbers, and the position of the gun to provide more working space for the gunner.

Top speed testing was done on a paved, banked oval and ride quality tests were done over specially developed stretches of bumps. The M18 also required tests of its ability to ford six feet of water, climb small walls, and ram through structures. Though it weighed about 20 tons, the Hellcat was capable of traveling at . Its power came from Wright R-975, a nine-cylinder, radial aircraft engine, the same as that used on the M4 Sherman tank, paired to a 900T Torqmatic automatic transmission.

The first models of the tank destroyer were tested by the US Army&#x27;s 704th Tank Destroyer Battalion. The unit had originally been trained on the M3 Gun Motor Carriage (a 75 mm gun installed in the bed of an M3 half-track). Despite its T70 prototypes requiring several improvements, the 704th had a &quot;superlative&quot; testing record, and the unit was later issued production Hellcats after many of their suggestions were integrated into the vehicle. The testing phase of the Hellcat proved that teamwork was an essential element of the new light tank destroyer units, and replaced the fixed, rigid structure of other units with a much more flexible command structure that allowed adapting to more complicated tasks.

== Design ==

The M18&#x27;s new design incorporated several innovative labor-saving maintenance features. Drivetrain maintenance was performed by removing a large access plate on the front of the hull, disconnecting the drivetrain from the driveshaft, attaching extension rails to the drivetrain mounting, and sliding the entire assembly out of the hull on the rails. For access to the bottom of the engine without having to remove it completely from the hull, it was possible to slide the engine out onto a rail system integrated with the rear hull access door.

The 900T Torqmatic transmission had three forward gears, with ranges of up to 16 mph, 12 to 34 mph, and 30 to 60 mph (corresponding to cruising speeds of 12 mph, 25 mph, and 45 mph, respectively), and one reverse gear with a cruising speed of . The engine speed was governed such that the vehicle normally could not exceed in third gear. The M18 carried a five-man crew, consisting of a commander, gunner, loader, driver, and assistant driver. The driver and assistant driver were seated in the front left and right of the hull, respectively. Uniquely, the driver and assistant driver were provided with identical sets of controls and either could be used to operate the vehicle, but only the driver&#x27;s set of steering levers could be used as parking brakes. The commander, gunner, and loader were positioned in the turret; the commander at the left rear, the gunner at the left front, and the loader on the right. The turret crew were all provided with seats, and the commander could stand on his seat to operate the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun on a flexible ring mount on the left rear of the turret. An SCR-610 radio was placed in the rear of the turret. An escape hatch was provided in the hull floor directly underneath the turret.

===Armament===

In contrast to the M10 and M36 tank destroyers, which used the heavy chassis of the M4 Sherman, the M18 Hellcat was designed from the start to be a fast tank destroyer. As a result, it was smaller, lighter, more comfortable, and significantly faster, while carrying the same gun as the Sherman 76 mm models. The turret could rotate through 360 degrees in 24 seconds using an electro-hydraulic traverse mechanism, and the 76 mm gun could depress 10 degrees, and elevate 20 degrees. The maximum firing rate was 20 rounds per minute. The breech block of the gun was tilted 45 degrees to the right to aid the loader in manipulating and inserting ammunition in the confined space of the turret. 45 rounds of main gun ammunition were carried, 9 in the turret to the right of the gun, and 18 in each sponson. A .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun with 800 rounds of ammunition was mounted on the left rear of the turret in a flexible ring mount. Each crew member was provided with an M1 carbine with 90 rounds for self-defense, and six Mk 2 grenades, six M50 white phosphorus smoke grenades, and six smoke pots were also carried in the vehicle.

One disadvantage of the M18 was the inconsistent performance of its 76 mm gun against the thick and steeply sloped frontal armor of later German designs such as the Tiger and Panther. The problem of the main gun performance was somewhat remedied with High Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) ammunition beginning in fall 1944, which allowed the 76 mm gun to achieve greater armor penetration, but this was never available in quantity. The 76 mm gun with standard ammunition could penetrate the frontal turret armor of Panther tanks only at very close ranges, whereas the HVAP ammunition gave it a possibility of effectively engaging some of the heavier German tanks and theoretically penetrating the front of the Panther turret at ranges of about .

=== Armor ===

The armor of the M18 Hellcat was quite light to facilitate its high speed, and only provided protection from small arms fire. The lower hull armor was thick all around, vertical on the sides, but sloped at 35 degrees from the vertical at the lower rear and angled twice at the lower front to form a nearly rounded shape; 53 degrees from the vertical and then 24 degrees from the vertical. The hull floor was only thick.

The upper front hull also had an angled construction to form the Hellcat&#x27;s sloping glacis; two plates were angled at 38 and 64 degrees from the vertical, respectively. The upper hull armor was also thick, being angled at 23 degrees from the vertical on the sides and 13 degrees from the vertical at the rear. The hull roof was The cast turret of the Hellcat was thick on the front (at a 23-degree angle from the vertical) and thick on the sides (also at a 23-degree angle from the vertical) and rear (angled at 9 degrees from the vertical) The front of the turret was further protected by a rounded cast gun mantlet which was thick.

Another disadvantage of the M18 was its very light armor protection and open-topped turret. In testing of the T70 for possible use as a light tank, 9 out of 30 armor-piercing .30 caliber bullets penetrated the side of the turret at a range of . The open-topped turret—a characteristic which it shared with all American tank destroyers—left the crew exposed to snipers, grenades, and shell fragments, however it gave the crew excellent visibility, which was of importance in the killing of tanks, the intent of tank destroyers being primarily ambush weapons. The doctrinal priority of high speed at the cost of armor protection thus led to a relatively unbalanced design.

=== Tactical mobility ===

While the M18 was capable of high road speeds, this attribute was difficult to use successfully in combat.

Although sustained travel at high speeds was hardly ever used outside of the Allied response during the Battle of the Bulge, most Hellcat crews found the higher speeds especially useful in a sprint to flank German tanks, which had relatively slow turret traverse speeds, and such maneuvering allowed the tank destroyer crew to direct a shot into the enemy&#x27;s thinner side or rear armor. The open top proved an advantage in terms of allowing the TD crews significantly better visibility than their opponents, many of which were German tank destroyers that did not have revolving turrets and were handicapped by poor lateral visibility.

In general, Hellcat crews were complimentary of their vehicle&#x27;s performance and capabilities but did complain that the open top created a cold interior in the Northern European winter of 1944–45. This problem was exacerbated because the air-cooled engine pulled some of its cooling air through the crew compartment, creating, in effect, a large armor-plated refrigerator; it proved impossible to seal off the crew compartment entirely from engine-induced drafts.

== Production ==

Original plans called for a total of 8,986 M18s to be supplied: 1,600 for Lend-Lease to other countries and 7,386 for the U.S. Army. The production plans of the M18 were curtailed to 2,507 vehicles, including the six pilot models. The reasons behind the reduction (in no particular order) were:
* The 76 mm gun was already inadequate for the thick and/or steeply sloped frontal armor of later German tanks and the Army Ground Forces (AGF) preferred to get the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36 into service, despite Tank Destroyer Force commander Andrew Bruce&#x27;s objections to adopting it
* The number of self-propelled tank destroyer battalions had been approximately halved due to a policy change forced by the AGF, who wanted towed guns to be used and hence far fewer self-propelled units were needed for the Tank Destroyers
* There was little potential Lend-Lease activity: Britain and the Soviet Union &quot;had little interest&quot;. Two, listed as &quot;T70&quot;, were transferred to the United Kingdom, and five to the Soviet Union.

Production of M18 Hellcats ran from July 1943 until October 1944, with 2,507 built. In March 1944, the T70 was standardized by the Ordnance Department as the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18. There were three production contracts for the Hellcat: RAD-563 covered the six pilot models. T-6641 was for the first 1,000 vehicles, and T-9167 was for the final 1,507 vehicles.

===Production changes===
The M18 experienced various changes throughout its production, both to refine the design from a mechanical standpoint and incorporate features that would enhance its combat effectiveness.

M18s with serial numbers 1–1000 and 1007–1096 (registration numbers 40108110–40109109 and 40144883–40144972) experienced problems with their transmission gear ratios. The same action that standardized the M18 directed that vehicles below serial number 685 be returned to the Buick factory for modification, and vehicles with serial numbers 685 through 1096 be modified before overseas shipment. The rest of the M18s built featured an improved transmission. 640 of the vehicles returned to Buick were eventually converted to M39 armored utility vehicles, and ten into T41E1 command and reconnaissance vehicles (see ).

Hellcats with serial numbers 1350 and below (registration numbers 40108110–40109109 and 40144883–40145226) had the naturally-aspirated R975-C1 engine, which produced 350 horsepower. The rectangular ventilation grate for the transmission and differential oil coolers located behind the driver&#x27;s hatch initially had an angled cylinder-like shape, protruding above the line of the upper hull. Beginning in March 1944, M18s with serial numbers 1351 and above (registration numbers 40145227–40146389) had the internally-modified supercharged R975-C4 engine, which produced 400 horsepower; at roughly the same time as the change in engine type, the shape of the ventilation grate was changed to be flush with the upper hull.

The model of 76 mm gun fitted to most Hellcats kicked up large amounts of dust when fired. This was enough to impede the vision of the crew, who had to wait until the muzzle blast cleared to fire accurately again. To solve this problem, a muzzle brake that directed the blast to the sides was standardized in February 1944, but a sufficient number were not produced to allow them to be incorporated onto production lines until the summer. In the interim, M18s produced in the spring of 1944 received the M1A1C gun, which was threaded to accept a muzzle brake, but was not so equipped; in October 1944, a maintenance work order was issued by the Ordnance Department to retrofit M1A1C guns with muzzle brakes, but &quot;in the event, few...appear to have been retrofitted with the muzzle brake during the war.&quot; Beginning in June 1944, roughly the last 700 Hellcats received the M1A2 gun equipped with a muzzle brake, which also incorporated a faster rifling twist.

M18s prior to serial number 1701 (registration number 40155577) did not have any winterization equipment installed at the factory. Beginning with M18 serial number 1701, an engine oil dilution valve and provisions for a battery-powered heating unit that drew fuel from the left fuel tank in order to produce hot air for heating the back of the engine, transmission and differential and their oil coolers, the vehicle battery, and the auxiliary generator in extreme cold conditions was installed. The network of hot air tubes was installed in the factory, but the heater power (blower) and burner units, their fuel pipe and connecting air tube, and the air intake shutter to close off the engine compartment were to be installed when necessary in the field.

Beginning with M18 serial number 1858 (registration number 40145734), the original gun travel lock on the turret roof which had a swinging arm held by a fastening pin was replaced by one that had a rotating ball stud with a retaining clamp operated by a handle. In October 1944, heavier shock absorbers were introduced. Later vehicles also featured an M20 azimuth indicator next to the gunner&#x27;s controls, allowing for easier performance of indirect fire missions. On late production vehicles, the towing pintle mounting was redesigned to allow it to swivel when towing a trailer over uneven ground.

==Combat use==
In July 1943, the AGF directed the Armored Board to consider the T70 for use as a light tank by comparing it with the existing requirements for a light tank. In January 1944, the proposal was rejected because it was felt that the T70 had insufficient armor and secondary armament.

===European Theater===
====Initial combat in Italy====
Five T70 prototypes were sent to Italy in the spring of 1944 for testing and saw combat during the breakout from the Anzio beachhead with the 601st (two) and 894th Tank Destroyer Battalions (three). The 894th employed them in the battalion&#x27;s Reconnaissance Company because of their high speed. In addition to the vehicle&#x27;s speed, battalion members were also impressed with the power of the 76 mm gun, but were less complimentary of the T70&#x27;s thin armor and small internal volume, which they felt affected crew confidence in battle, and made living inside the vehicle and handling main gun ammunition awkward, respectively. The 805th Tank Destroyer Battalion, originally a towed gun unit, re-equipped with the M18 during the summer of 1944; it was the only battalion in the Italian campaign to be fully equipped with the M18.

====Combat in Europe====
In January 1944, General Omar Bradley, commander of the First U.S. Army, refused the new M18s when he was first offered them; his older tank destroyer battalions in England had been equipped with the M10 tank destroyer for some time, and he was more interested in the development of the M36 tank destroyer than he was in the M18. As a result, the three M18 battalions initially shipped to England (the 603rd, 704th, and 705th) were assigned to General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third U.S. Army.

On 19 September 1944, near Arracourt, France, across the Moselle from Nancy, the 704th Tank Destroyer Battalion was attached to the 4th Armored Division. Lieutenant Edwin Leiper led an M18 platoon of Company C to Réchicourt-la-Petite, on the way to Moncourt. He saw a German tank gun muzzle appearing out of the fog 30 feet away, and deployed his platoon. In a five-minute period, five German tanks of the 113th Panzer Brigade were knocked out for the loss of one M18. The platoon continued to fire and destroyed ten more German tanks while losing another two M18s. One of the platoon&#x27;s M18s commanded by Sgt. Henry R. Hartman knocked out six of the German tanks, most of which were the much-feared Panther. By the time the Battle of Arracourt ended three days later, the 704th Tank Destroyer Battalion had knocked out 39 German tanks, for the loss of four M18s destroyed and three more damaged.

The M18 Hellcat was a key element during the Battle of the Bulge. On 19–20 December, Team Desobry, a battalion-sized tank-infantry task force of the 10th Armored Division was assigned to defend Noville located north-northeast of both Foy and of Bastogne, just away. With just four M18 tank destroyers of the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion to assist, the paratroopers of 1st Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment attacked units of the 2nd Panzer Division, whose mission was to proceed by secondary roads via Monaville (just northwest of Bastogne) to seize a key highway and capture, among other objectives, fuel dumps—for the lack of which the overall German counter-offensive faltered and failed. Worried about the threat to their left flank in Bastogne, the Americans organized a major joint arms attack to seize Noville. Team Desobry&#x27;s high-speed highway journey to reach the blocking position is one of the few documented cases in which the top speed of the M18 Hellcat, , was actually used to get ahead of an enemy force.

The attack of 1st Battalion and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyers of the 705th TD Battalion near Noville together destroyed at least 30 German tanks and inflicted 500 to 1,000 casualties on the attacking forces, in what amounted to a spoiling attack. A Military Channel historian credited the M18 tank destroyers with 24 kills, including several Tiger tanks, and believes that in part, their ability to &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; at high speed and then reappear elsewhere on the battlefield, confused and slowed the German attack, which finally stalled, leaving the Americans in control of the town overnight.

After the Battle of the Bulge, since numbers of the M36 tank destroyer were slow in arriving to the European Theater and towed tank destroyer battalions equipped with the 3-inch Gun M5 had uniformly performed very poorly in the battle when compared to self-propelled units, it was decided to re-equip many of them with the &quot;surplus&quot; of M18s that were then in the theater, with the new M36s mostly re-equipping former M10 units.

M18 strength in the European Theatre of Operations varied from 146 in June 1944 to a high of 540 in March 1945. Losses totaled 216.

====Reception====

The M18 was generally well received by its crews. They gave high praise to its mobility when compared to the heavier M10, such as speed and mobility in mud and snow. The speed of the turret traverse was also far faster when compared to the M10, which had a manually-rotated turret. Ease of maintenance of the engine and transmission was also noted. One M18 commander said that his vehicle &quot;operating under combat conditions and averaging a day during the Third Army drive from St. Lô to the German border near Strasbourg...was driven . No repairs were necessary either to the vehicle or engine; only minimal attention was paid to moving parts...M18 engine performance was excellent under the most trying conditions and was highly thought of by all men in my and other M18 tank destroyer outfits.&quot;

Conversely, the main gun was considered inadequate against the frontal armor of later German tanks like the Tiger and Panther, especially before the introduction of HVAP ammunition. In addition, even though it could pierce more armor than the 75 mm gun M3 mounted on the M4 Sherman tank, it did not have the high explosive firepower of the former when used for infantry support missions. Muzzle blast from 76 mm guns not equipped with muzzle brakes was also a complaint. There was also a desire for an armored roof over the turret, and it was concluded that additional armor up to one ton in weight would not impair the automotive performance of the M18.

Many battalions considered the assistant driver redundant, and removed him, or stated that the vehicle should be equipped with a bow machine gun. Many crews also added additional machine guns to the turret roofs of their M18s.

=== Pacific Theater ===

M18s served in tank destroyer battalions and other units supporting US Army infantry divisions in the latter stages of the Pacific war, notably in the Philippines and Okinawa. Tank destroyer battalions equipped with the M18 that served in the Pacific Theater of Operations included the 637th, 670th, and 671st, although only the 637th saw combat, most notably participating in the Battle of Manila where it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation. During the Battle of Okinawa, General Andrew Bruce, who was by then the commander of the 77th Infantry Division, located eight M18s to re-equip the Antitank Company of the 306th Infantry Regiment. M18s were not issued to U.S. Marine Corps units.

=== Korean War ===
The M39 armored utility vehicle, which was converted from the M18, was used as a prime mover, infantry carrier, and ammunition carrier in Korea.

==Export and legacy==

After World War II, many M18s were sold to other countries. Many intended for European countries under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act were rebuilt and refurbished by Brown &amp; Root in northern Italy in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and bear data plates that indicate those rebuilds. One of the users was Yugoslavia, which received 260 Hellcats during the Informbiro period and kept some of them in reserve until the early 1990s. A number of these vehicles were later used by the Serbian Army of Krajina and Army of Republika Srpska during the Yugoslav Wars. One example was used on an armored train named the &quot;Krajina express&quot; (&quot;Krajina Ekspres&quot;).

The Military of the Republic of China received 214 M18s, and operated them until their chassis and hulls were worn out, at which point the turrets were salvaged and installed onto surplus hulls of M42 Duster anti-aircraft vehicles to produce Type 64 light tanks.

The Greek Army received 127 M18s from 1952 to 1954. Initially, these were organized in three Tank Destroyer Regiments numbered 397, 398 and 399. In 1959 the Tank Destroyer Regiments were reorganized in three Tank Destroyer Battalions with the same numbers. Most of the M18s were retired by the end of the 1960s, but a few remained in service until the mid-1970s for training. The hulls of the M18s were dismantled and the turrets were used as gun emplacements on the northern borders of Greece and the Aegean islands. One M18 is preserved in the Greek Army Tank Museum.

Iran received 55 M18s in the 1950s.

Philippine Army received 50 units from American Stocks. Upon the outbreak of the Korean War, United Nations&#x27; request came in, the Philippines deployed 16 M4A1 Sherman tanks and one M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. This small armored force augmented the other Allied armor during the early days of the Korean conflict. The small Filipino armored force was brought in by then-2LT Francisco S. Tamondong, along with two noncommissioned officers, in July 1950.

The Venezuelan military operated M18s beginning in 1954, when they purchased 40. They were refurbished in 1983–1984, and at least one was heavily modernized by a Yugoslavian firm in the 1990s, but it is unclear if more conversions took place.

M18 Hellcat &quot;Amaz N Grace&quot; is on loan to the Museum of American Armor in Old Bethpage, New York, from the US Military Museum. An M18 is on display at the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

==Variants==
The only M18 variant produced in significant numbers was the M39 armored utility vehicle, a turretless variation used as a gun tractor or command and reconnaissance vehicle. In March 1944, the Ordnance Department authorized the construction of two prototypes; the T41 was a prime mover for the 3-inch Gun M5, while the T41E1 was a command and reconnaissance vehicle that could also be easily converted into a prime mover. The T41E1 configuration was found superior and development of the T41 version was cancelled, although subsequently, the prime mover version of the T41E1 was referred to as the T41, and the command and reconnaissance vehicle as its original designation of T41E1.

640 of the early production M18s that had been returned to the Buick factory for modification were converted into the T41 prime mover configuration between October 1944 and March 1945 by removing the turret and fitting seats for up to eight men in the open fighting space. This version was armed with a single M2 machine gun on a flexible mount. In November 1944, it was standardized as the M39. At the request of the European Theater in early 1945, ten more of the Hellcats were modified into the T41E1 configuration for testing, although they were never standardized. M39s saw combat during the last days of World War II in Europe and during the Korean War, primarily as armored personnel and munitions carriers and were finally declared obsolete on 14 February 1957. About 100 M39s were transferred to the West German Bundeswehr in 1956, where they were used to train the reestablished &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; armored infantry units.

A number of other variants were proposed, including a mobile command post, howitzer carrier, and flamethrower carrier. Known variants include:
* T41 prime mover: One Hellcat with its turret removed and internal changes made, converted into a prime mover for the 3-inch gun M5; project cancelled.
* T41E1 command and reconnaissance vehicle: One Hellcat with its turret removed and internal changes made, meant as a replacement for the M20 armored utility car in tank destroyer battalions. This design could be used as both a prime mover or command vehicle, and in the prime mover configuration it was redesignated T41 and standardized as the armored utility vehicle M39, with 640 converted (see above).
* 105 mm howitzer motor carriage T88: M18 with the 76 mm gun replaced with a 105 mm T12 howitzer. A pilot was built in 1944 but project cancelled after the end of the war.
* 90 mm gun motor carriage M18: M18 with the 76 mm gun replaced with a turret from an M36 tank destroyer mounting a 90 mm gun; cancelled after the end of the war.
* 76 mm gun motor carriage T86: M18 with the T7 flotation device, using its tracks for water propulsion. The T86E1 variant used propellers for propulsion.
* 105 mm howitzer motor carriage T87: The T86E1 showed that track propulsion was better and this was used for the T87, which had the same 105 mm T12 howitzer of the T88.

<doc id="949571" wikidata="Q4781695" url="?curid=949571" title="Apprendi v. New Jersey">
<text>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision with regard to aggravating factors in crimes. The Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, incorporated against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibited judges from enhancing criminal sentences beyond statutory maxima based on facts other than those decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision has been a cornerstone in the modern resurgence in jury trial rights. As Justice Scalia noted in his concurring opinion, the jury-trial right &quot;has never been efficient; but it has always been free.&quot;

The &quot;Apprendi&quot; decision was subsequently cited as precedent by the court in its consideration of &quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot; (2002), which struck down Arizona&#x27;s judge-only method of imposing the death penalty, and also in &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot; (2004), which ruled that mandatory state sentencing guidelines are the statutory maximum for purposes of applying the &quot;Apprendi&quot; rule.

== Background ==
In the early morning hours of December 22, 1994, Charles Apprendi Jr., fired several .22-caliber bullets into the home of an African-American family that had recently moved into his neighborhood. He was arrested an hour later. During questioning by police, he admitted that he shot at the house because its occupants were &quot;black in color&quot; and for that reason he did not &quot;want them in the neighborhood.&quot;

Later, Apprendi pleaded guilty to weapons possession charges. Each of these counts carried a sentence of between 5 and 10 years in prison. As part of the plea bargain, the prosecution reserved the right to seek an enhanced sentence on the basis that the crime was committed with a biased purpose. Such an enhancement would have doubled the sentence otherwise imposed for each of the crimes. Apprendi, in turn, reserved the right to challenge the bias crime enhancement, claiming it violated the federal Constitution.

The trial judge accepted Apprendi&#x27;s plea. At a later hearing, he heard testimony from Apprendi himself as well as from psychologists stating that the shooting was not motivated by racial hatred but instead was the result of intoxication. The policeman testified at this hearing that Apprendi&#x27;s motivation was racial animus. The trial judge found &quot;by a preponderance of the evidence&quot; that Apprendi&#x27;s crime was motivated by the race of the victims. He sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison—2 years above the maximum sentence authorized for the weapons charge apart from the race enhancement.

Apprendi appealed, represented by Charles Coant and Joseph O&#x27;Neill. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the enhancement on the grounds that it was a &quot;sentencing factor&quot; rather than an &quot;element&quot; of the crime, and therefore not subject to the jury-trial and proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirements of the Constitution. The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with this conclusion, and also affirmed Apprendi&#x27;s sentence. Apprendi appealed to the Supreme Court.

== Opinion of the Court ==
&quot;Apprendi&quot; shifted the landscape with regard to the findings that comprise a criminal sentence. &quot;Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; In this case, the hate-crime enhancement was determined by a judge, sitting alone, and subjected to a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of the evidence, instead of beyond a reasonable doubt. Because of the enhancement, the judge imposed a 12-year sentence, which was 2 years greater than the 10-year sentence otherwise authorized by the findings at the plea hearing. Under the rule the Court formulated, Apprendi&#x27;s case had to be sent back to the New Jersey courts.

=== Historical basis ===
Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, &quot;The law threatens certain pains if you do certain things, intending thereby to give you a new motive for not doing them. If you persist in doing them, it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may continue to be believed.&quot; Here, New Jersey threatened punishment for infractions against its firearms laws, and additional punishment for violations of its hate-crimes laws. Due process procedural safeguards should apply equally to both of these punishments.

Under the Constitution, due process gives criminal defendants two interdependent procedural safeguards with respect to the manner in which the sentence is determined. The first of these is the jury trial, a &quot;guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of the rulers&quot; and &quot;the great bulwark of our civil and political liberties,&quot; whereby &quot;the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of the defendant&#x27;s equals and neighbors.&quot; The second is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the historical &quot;measure of persuasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of all the essential elements of guilt.&quot; There was historically no distinction between an &quot;element&quot; of a crime and a &quot;sentencing factor&quot; because the trial judge had very little discretion at sentencing, because most crimes had a specific sentence attached to them.

Justice Thomas explained how the original understanding of the jury-trial requirement supported the Court&#x27;s ruling. He also argued that the jury-trial requirement applied to both mandatory minimum sentences and the findings of prior convictions used to enhance sentences. To make this argument, Justice Thomas had to repudiate his prior support for the prior conviction exception crafted in &quot;Almendarez-Torres v. United States&quot;, . &quot;What matters is the way by which a fact enters into the sentence.&quot; Even though a prior conviction may be valid because it entailed its own jury trial, the fact that that prior conviction was being used to enhance a new sentence meant that that fact must be submitted to a jury again.

=== 20th-century developments ===
In &quot;Williams v. New York&quot;, , the Court affirmed that a sentencing judge has discretion to impose any sentence authorized by statute in an individual case. This statement accommodated a shift in the way legislatures had set punishments between the 18th and 20th centuries — a shift away from fixed punishments and toward broader and broader ranges of punishment. This was not to say that &quot;trial practices cannot change in the course of centuries and still remain true to the principles that emerged from the Framers&#x27; fears that the jury right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion.&quot; Nevertheless, practice should at least adhere to basic principles, even as that practice evolves over the course of time.

With the decision in &quot;In re Winship&quot; in 1970, the Court expressly said for the first time that due process demands from the government proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of a crime. Thus, the Court held that a state court could not force a defendant to prove he did not act with malice aforethought in order to avoid a murder conviction, as in &quot;Mullaney v. Wilbur&quot;, . Criminal law &quot;is concerned not only with guilt or innocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability assessed&quot; in the defendant. Thus, redefining the elements of murder to make the level of intent required bear on punishment was not an appropriate method for avoiding the reasonable-doubt requirement of the Constitution.

It was not until 1986, in &quot;McMillan v. Pennsylvania&quot;, , that the Court first coined the term &quot;sentencing factor.&quot; A &quot;sentencing factor&quot; is a fact not found by a jury that nevertheless affected the sentence imposed by a judge. In &quot;McMillan&quot;, a state statute required a 5-year minimum sentence for anyone who visibly possessed a firearm during certain crimes. Imposing a mandatory minimum sentence based on this factual finding did not violate the reasonable-doubt requirement because it merely limited the discretion of the sentencing court rather than increased the maximum sentence available to the judge by virtue of the finding.

=== Sentencing enhancements and the reasonable-doubt requirement ===
The hate-crime sentencing enhancement at issue in this case was a ratchet — it exposed Apprendi to greater punishment by virtue of an additional fact which was not a component of the firearms violation that exposed him to any criminal liability at all. Thus, in order to apply the historical procedural safeguards in the novel context of sentencing enhancements, the Court had to extend these protections to those new enhancements.

Because the hate-crime enhancement increased the punishment available to the sentencing judge instead of raising the floor on the sentencing range as a mandatory minimum would, the Court would not allow the hate-crime enhancement to escape the constitutional protections. The reason for criminal activity requires an inquiry into the defendant&#x27;s motive, a traditional arena of criminal examination. Punishing a person for this specific bad intent has historically been the province of the criminal law, and historically required certain procedural safeguards. Merely labelling the hate-crime enhancement as a &quot;sentencing factor&quot; could not allow New Jersey to escape constitutional requirements.

=== Preservation of the recidivism exception ===
Two years before &quot;Apprendi&quot;, the Court decided &quot;Almendarez-Torres v. United States&quot;, , in which the Court held that a federal statute authorizing increased punishment for illegally reentering the United States after deportation pursuant to a conviction for certain crimes was constitutional despite a then-emerging view (later solidified in &quot;Apprendi&quot;) that facts that increased punishment must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In &quot;Apprendi&quot;, the Court acknowledged that &quot;Almendarez-Torres&quot; might conflict with the blanket rule it was adopting in that case. However, the Court allowed sentencing enhancements for prior convictions to stand because those prior convictions had already been subject to the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements.

=== Dissents ===
Justice O&#x27;Connor began with the argument that rather than allowing the Constitution to dictate what elements of crimes are, the Court usually deferred to the legislature&#x27;s definition of the elements that constitute a crime. She also disputed that the historical evidence cited by the majority dictated the result it reached. The fact that common-law judges may have had little discretion in imposing sentence had little bearing for her on modern sentencing schemes.

Furthermore, Justice O&#x27;Connor disputed that the Court&#x27;s modern cases dictated the result. Although the Court in &quot;Mullaney v. Wilbur&quot;, , may have ruled that the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements applied to the facts that dictated the degree of homicide crime the defendant had committed, and thus the level of punishment to which he was subject, two years later, in &quot;Patterson v. New York&quot;, , the Court ruled that a state could place on defendants the burden of proving affirmative defenses, such as extreme emotional disturbance. &quot;Patterson&quot;, for Justice O&#x27;Connor, repudiated the general principle that facts bearing on the degree of punishment must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, &quot;McMillan v. Pennsylvania&quot;, , was not relevant to the Court&#x27;s rule because &quot;McMillan&quot; involved a mandatory &quot;minimum&quot; punishment, rather than a maximum sentence.

Finally, Justice O&#x27;Connor warned that the Court&#x27;s decision did not square with &quot;Walton v. Arizona&quot;, , in which the Court had ruled that the jury-trial requirement expressly did &quot;not&quot; apply to the aggravating factors required under Arizona law to impose a death sentence. As Justice O&#x27;Connor observed, a judge in Arizona could not impose a death sentence without a finding that one of the aggravating factors applied. Under the rule the majority adopted, that finding would have to be made by a jury, yet O&#x27;Connor found the majority&#x27;s attempt to distinguish Arizona&#x27;s death penalty to be &quot;baffling.&quot; Two years later, in &quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot;, , Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s view about Arizona&#x27;s death penalty scheme would prevail. O&#x27;Connor also predicted that the &quot;Apprendi&quot; decision would give rise to serious constitutional doubt in the federal sentencing scheme. In 2005&#x27;s &quot;United States v. Booker&quot;, , this prediction also came to pass.

Justice Breyer complained that the &quot;real world of criminal justice&quot; would not be able to meet the &quot;ideal&quot; of submitting to juries facts that subject criminal defendants to increased punishments. Fixing certain punishments for all defendants convicted of the same offense would ignore specific harms committed by different defendants as well as certain characteristics of individual defendants. &quot;There are, to put it simply, far too many relevant sentencing factors to permit submission of all (or even many) of them to a jury.&quot; Because this was a premise upon which the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rested, Justice Breyer dissented from the majority&#x27;s opinion. Yet his opinion for the majority in &quot;United States v. Booker&quot;, in which he crafted the remedy of severance and excision of the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, meant that Breyer ultimately prevailed in the sentencing war, even if he had momentarily lost the constitutional battle in &quot;Apprendi&quot;.

===Subsequent cases===

In &quot;Southern Union Co. v. United States&quot; (2012), the Supreme Court determined that when a criminal fine is sufficient to trigger the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee, facts that would increase the penalty beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Respondent was convicted of storing hazardous liquid mercury without a permit, &quot;on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004,&quot; in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.). The jury was not asked to determine the exact duration of the violation. In sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, calculated by assessing the $50,000 maximum daily fine for each of the 762 days between September 19, 2002, and October 19, 2004. Respondent appealed on the basis that the jury never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing that the jury had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that &quot;Apprendi&quot; did not apply to criminal fines.

The Supreme Court reversed, holding there is no principled distinction between criminal fines and imprisonment for the purpose of &quot;Apprendi&quot; because &quot;Apprendi&quot; requires that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and determined beyond a reasonable doubt. The rule preserves the historic fact-finding function of the jury. Where a fine is sufficiently substantial to trigger the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee, &quot;Apprendi&quot; applies.

In &quot;Alleyne v. United States&quot; (2013), the Court ruled that all facts that increase a mandatory minimum must be submitted to and proven by a jury. In this ruling, the court explicitly overruled &quot;Harris v. United States&quot; (2002), which had held that such facts did not need to be submitted to a jury.

<text>Opryland USA (later called Opryland Themepark and colloquially &quot;Opryland&quot;) was a theme park in Nashville, Tennessee. It operated seasonally (generally March to October) from 1972 to 1997, and for a special Christmas-themed engagement every December from 1993 to 1997. During the late 1980s, nearly 2.5 million people visited the park annually. Billed as the &quot;Home of American Music&quot;, Opryland USA featured a large number of musical shows along with typical amusement park rides, such as roller coasters. The park was closed and demolished following the 1997 season. On its site was built Opry Mills, an outlet-heavy shopping mall, which opened in 2000.

==History==

===Origin===
The impetus for a theme park in Nashville was WSM, Inc.&#x27;s desire for a larger and more modern venue for its long-running &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; radio program. The Ryman Auditorium, the show&#x27;s home since 1943, was suffering from disrepair along with the downtown neighborhood&#x27;s increasing urban decay since the mid-1960s. Despite the shortcomings, the show&#x27;s popularity was increasing as its weekly crowds outgrew the 3,000-seat venue. The company sought to build a new, air-conditioned auditorium with a larger capacity and ample parking in a then-undeveloped area of the city, providing visitors a safer and more enjoyable experience than was possible at the Ryman.

During a 1969 visit to the Astrodomain in Houston, Texas, WSM, Inc. President Irving Waugh was inspired by the presence of AstroWorld. Waugh noted in particular that the theme park was able to draw visitors to the property on days when the Astrodome and related facilities were dormant. Waugh decided that an amusement park adjacent to a new Grand Ole Opry House, which itself would only operate two days per week as originally planned, would be a profitable venture. As a result, WSM, Inc. purchased a large tract of riverside land (Rudy&#x27;s Farm) owned by a local sausage manufacturer in the Pennington Bend area of Nashville along the Cumberland River, adjacent to the newly-constructed Briley Parkway, a four-lane highway with access to the interstate system. Plans for the Opryland complex were announced on October 13, 1969.

===1970s===

The theme park opened to the public on May 27, 1972, well ahead of the Grand Ole Opry House, which debuted on March 16, 1974, with a visit by President Richard Nixon. The park was named for WSM disc jockey Grant Turner&#x27;s early morning show, &quot;Opryland USA&quot;, itself a nod to the stars of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. However, despite the nominal connection to country music, the park&#x27;s theme was American music in general; there were jazz, gospel, bluegrass, pop, and rock and roll-themed attractions and shows in addition to country. Opryland&#x27;s focus was more on its musical productions than its rides and other attractions, which helped attract adults as much as children, the target of other similar venues. As such, it was billed as a &quot;showpark&quot;, instead of an &quot;amusement park&quot; or &quot;theme park&quot; in its early days. Major thrill rides at the park&#x27;s opening included the Timber Topper (later renamed Rock n&#x27; Roller Coaster) roller coaster and Flume Zoom (later renamed Dulcimer Splash) log flume.

In its fourth season in 1975, Opryland added the &quot;State Fair&quot; area on land formerly occupied by the buffalo exhibit. The expansion featured a large selection of carnival games, as well as the Wabash Cannonball (named after the famous Roy Acuff tune) roller coaster, Country Bumpkin Bump Cars, and Tennessee Waltz (named after a song made popular by Patti Page) swings. However, shortly before opening, the Cumberland River flooded most of the park, as deep as in some areas. The park&#x27;s opening was delayed by a month, and several animals in the petting zoo died in the floodwaters.

Opryland became very successful during the mid-1970s. By the 1977 season, the park was the most popular Nashville tourist attraction, drawing nearly two million guests annually, mostly from Tennessee and adjoining states. The park also drew upon the continued appeal of the &quot;Opry&quot; show to country music fans from the Southern United States and the Midwestern United States, who often brought their families for several days&#x27; vacation in Nashville. The nearest theme parks comparable to Opryland were four to six hours away, in places such as Cincinnati (Kings Island), St. Louis (Six Flags over Mid-America), and Atlanta (Six Flags Over Georgia). Attendance continued to climb into the 1980s.

Initial plans had called for a commercial corridor called Oprytown to be built on the land, but due to the overwhelming popularity of the complex in its early years, the master plan was altered to include a hotel and convention center which could house &quot;Opry&quot; and Opryland visitors on weekends, and also draw convention-related business during the week. In 1977, Opryland Hotel (now Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center), a large resort-style hotel, opened next door to the park and later expanded several times to become the largest hotel in the world not attached to a casino.

On March 31, 1979, Opryland opened the Roy Acuff Theater, named after the beloved traditional-country singer and pillar of the Opry. The theater was located next door to the Grand Ole Opry House in the Plaza area outside the park gates. It normally hosted the theme park&#x27;s premier musical production. Due to its location, tickets to the theme park were not needed to attend shows at the Acuff, which usually required a separately-purchased ticket. This allowed the general public to attend shows at the Acuff without having to pay for park admission, like the &quot;Opry&quot; itself.

===Ownership change===
WSM, Inc. was a subsidiary of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company; itself part of the larger NLT Corporation. Beginning in 1980, Houston-based insurer American General began acquiring NLT stock, eventually becoming its largest shareholder and setting the stage for an outright takeover. American General was not interested in NLT&#x27;s non-insurance businesses and opted to sell the WSM division, which included WSM-AM-FM-TV, The Nashville Network, the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the then-decrepit Ryman Auditorium, Opryland Hotel, and Opryland USA. Unable to acquire television and radio assets due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s ownership restrictions of the time, American General influenced NLT to sell WSM-TV to Gillett Broadcasting. Gillett bought the station on November 3, 1981, and its call sign was officially changed to WSMV-TV on July 15, 1982.

By 1982, the takeover was complete and American General approached prospects such as Music Corporation of America (MCA), Marriott Corporation and Anheuser-Busch attempting to sell the remainder of WSM, Inc. While some of the companies showed interest in individual assets, none was willing to buy the entire group. 

Unexpectedly, Gaylord Broadcasting Company of Oklahoma City stepped in and purchased the entire package in September 1983 for . After the purchase, the Opryland assets were organized into a subsidiary holding company called Opryland USA, Inc. Ed Gaylord, then the controlling figure of Gaylord Broadcasting, had become involved with the hit country music television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot; when his company had purchased the rights to the program in 1981 and moved production to a studio inside the Grand Ole Opry House. Gaylord quickly developed relationships with its stars, many of whom were members of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. His close friendship with Sarah Cannon (portrayer of Minnie Pearl) heavily influenced the decision to purchase the &quot;Opry&quot; and its associated properties.

Also included in Gaylord&#x27;s acquisition of the Opryland assets was WSM&#x27;s fledgling cable television network, The Nashville Network (TNN), and its production arm, Opryland Productions. TNN was dedicated entirely at first to country music. For years, its offices and production facilities were located at Opryland, and a nightly variety show (originally &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, later &quot;Music City Tonight&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Country&quot;) was broadcast live from the Gaslight Theatre inside the park. The theme park was often featured on the network as a concert venue for country music stars.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1981, Opryland expanded its footprint for the second and final time. The new area, entitled &quot;Grizzly Country&quot;, was built on the extreme north end of the park to house the Grizzly River Rampage, a river rafting ride. The ride was promoted by a band called the Grizzly River Boys, later known as the Tennessee River Boys. The band was originally intended to promote the park via a one-time television special, but became popular enough that they became an ongoing attraction at the park for several years. The band&#x27;s membership originally included Ty Herndon, and after several personnel changes, grew to become the band Diamond Rio.

In 1984, Opryland added a third roller coaster, The Screamin&#x27; Delta Demon (an Intamin bobsled roller coaster), in the New Orleans area of the park. This project also added a second park gate adjacent to the parking lot, primarily used as a group entrance/exit.

In the mid-1980s, &quot;Trickets&quot; (three-day admission tickets for one price) were introduced and large numbers of season passes were sold to residents of the Nashville area.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, two new competitors to Opryland emerged: Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky, and Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (which had recently been converted and expanded from its previous incarnation as Silver Dollar City). These two parks grew into regional destinations, contributing in part to a decline in Opryland attendance. Partially in response to the competition, and to entice out-of-town guests, package deals including hotel rooms, Opryland tickets, and admission to the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; were developed and marketed throughout the region.

Annual changes were made to the park to continue to attract local Nashvillians as well as out-of-town visitors. Large attractions such as the General Jackson Showboat, new roller coasters, and water rides were installed on a biennial basis until 1989, with the opening of the Chaos roller coaster. In the early 1990s, Opryland management—facing changing consumer preferences and limited land to expand upon—honored the park&#x27;s initial concept and invested in its live music entertainment, rather than building traditional theme park attractions. The next (and final) large attraction to open would be The Hangman roller coaster in 1995.

Gaylord Broadcasting spun off Opryland USA, Inc. as a public company and renamed it Gaylord Entertainment Company on October 24, 1991.

The park took possession of Nashville&#x27;s StarWalk and continued its tradition of adding commemorative plaques for country-music Grammy winners. In 1992, the Chevrolet-Geo Celebrity Theater (renamed Chevrolet Theater in 1997 after General Motors&#x27; retired the Geo brand) was constructed on the site of the former Jukebox and Flip-Side theaters. With the construction of the park&#x27;s new flagship venue, Opryland began attracting top country music acts for nightly concerts, included in the price of park admission. In 1994, Opryland began upcharging for the concerts and added two venues (Theater By The Lake and the Roy Acuff Theater) to the series, billing it as &quot;Nashville On Stage&quot;. As part of this, the Chevrolet-Geo Theater and Theater By The Lake venues were expanded and partially enclosed. Alabama, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Tanya Tucker, and The Oak Ridge Boys took up residency during the summer of 1994, occupying the Chevrolet-Geo Celebrity Theater and Theater By The Lake, while the conventional concert series, featuring traveling artists, moved to the Roy Acuff Theater. During the day, the Roy Acuff Theater hosted a live version of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; based on the long-running TV series. After lackluster ticket sales, the multi-venue series was significantly scaled back after 1994. By Opryland&#x27;s final season in 1997, only the Chevrolet Theater was hosting concerts.

During summer 1993, the popular Mark Goodson game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; traveled to Opryland and taped several weeks of episodes at the Chevrolet-Geo Celebrity Theater, which opened the show&#x27;s sixth and final season with Ray Combs as host. These syndicated episodes began airing in September and featured some of country music&#x27;s best-known stars including Porter Wagoner, Boxcar Willie, Charley Pride, Brenda Lee, the Mandrells, and the Statler Brothers, as well as at least one week of resident Nashville families playing against each other. , it remains the only time in the history of the long-running series that episodes have been taped on location.

Also, beginning in the early 1990s and continuing through its final season, as a nod to TNN&#x27;s NASCAR coverage, as well as Opryland&#x27;s official designation with NASCAR, the annual &quot;TNN Salute to Motorsports&quot; event took place over a week-long period. This included numerous motorsports exhibits as well as &quot;meet-and-greets&quot; with stock-car racing personalities.

In 1994, Gaylord Entertainment invested heavily in the renaissance of the entertainment district in downtown Nashville. The company converted an old Second Avenue building into the Wildhorse Saloon (unlike Opryland, an adults-only venue serving alcohol), renovated and reopened the Ryman Auditorium as a premier concert and theatre venue, and began to provide water taxi service along the Cumberland River between the docks adjacent to the amusement park and a dock downtown. The amusement park&#x27;s official name was changed to &quot;Opryland Themepark&quot;. &quot;Opryland USA&quot; was then designated as the destination name, to encompass all of Gaylord Entertainment&#x27;s Nashville properties.

In September 1995 and September 1996, the Grizzly River Rampage was used as a course for the NationsBank Whitewater Championships, which in 1995 served as a qualifier for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Following those events (as well as 1997), the course was drained and a temporary Halloween attraction—Quarantine, tied into the storyline of the neighboring indoor roller coaster Chaos—was constructed in its bed.

In 1996, a third park gate was added near Chaos, which allowed pedestrian traffic between Opryland Hotel and Opryland Themepark for the first time. Previously, hotel guests wishing to visit the amusement park had been shuttled between the two on buses.

===Shuttering and demolition ===

Opryland was profitable from the beginning, and remained so even in its final years. From its inception, however, Opryland was handicapped by its location. The park was located on a triangular shaped tract having the Cumberland River on one side, and Briley Parkway on another. Opryland Hotel was built in 1977 on the third, shortest leg of the triangle. This not only exposed the park to occasional flooding, as in 1975, but hampered its ability to expand for new attractions as consumer preferences changed. Opryland was forced to remove older attractions to add new ones, as was the case with the Raft Ride in 1986 for the Old Mill Scream, and the Tin Lizzies in 1994 for The Hangman. In 1993, Gaylord Entertainment embarked on the largest construction project in Nashville&#x27;s history so far: the Delta. This project, which opened in 1996, added an enormous atrium, over 1,000 guestrooms, and a new convention complex to Opryland Hotel. By this time, Opryland had grown to in size. However, the Delta project tied up all of the remaining land contiguous to the park, leaving it with no room to grow.

Nashville&#x27;s climate, with frequent winter cold, made year-round operation nearly impossible; seasons were restricted to weekends in the late fall and early spring expanding to daily in the summer. Seasonal workers became hard to find because of the Nashville area&#x27;s booming economy beginning in the 1980s, and Gaylord found itself with a labor shortage. Also, attendance plateaued through the first half of the 1990s. 

In 1997, Gaylord Entertainment CEO E.W. &quot;Bud&quot; Wendell retired. Wendell was a holdover from previous WSM, Inc. management, and he had been involved in Opryland management from the beginning. Wendell was replaced by Gaylord&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer, Terry London. Unlike Wendell or Ed Gaylord, London had no sentimental ties to the facility or to the other Gaylord country-music properties. One of London&#x27;s first acts as CEO refocused the company on its core hospitality businesses. London came to the conclusion that Opryland Themepark would not deliver the desired rate of return. He and his team decided the amusement park should be replaced by a property usable year-round, rather than being closed for several months of the year (despite the next-door &quot;Opry&quot; holding weekend shows year-round).

Rumors began to surface during the summer of 1997 that Gaylord was considering selling or demolishing the theme park. The decision to close the park and replace it with a shopping mall named Opry Mills was made public that November, about a week after the end of the park&#x27;s regular season.

Gaylord management, in conjunction with Mills Corporation, announced on November 4, 1997 that the entire property would close for two years for a $275 million renovation branded as &quot;Destination Opryland&quot;. The property would include Opry Mills, as well as a marina on the Cumberland River near the General Jackson&#x27;s dock, a TNN/CMT broadcast center with studio tours, a renovated Grand Ole Opry House (including a new stage design and new seating), and a revamped Opry Plaza that was to include retail, dining and entertainment options. Gaylord announced that around two-thirds of Opryland Themepark would remain, including existing rides and shows. The plans for Destination Opryland were quietly abandoned, and only Opry Mills came to fruition. Company filings later showed that Opryland had quietly put 13 of its most popular attractions up for auction several weeks before the Destination Opryland announcement. .

The 1997 &quot;Christmas in the Park&quot; season was billed as a &quot;last chance&quot; for Nashvillians to see Opryland, though only a small portion of the park was open for the season, and many of the larger attractions were already being dismantled. The park closed permanently on December 31, 1997. In early 1998, the park&#x27;s remaining merchandise, signage and fixtures were offered to the public in a parking-lot tent sale.

All five roller coasters and many other large attractions were sold to Premier Parks as part of the auction for $7.034 million. The Hangman was relocated immediately to Marine World in Northern California, where it became known as Kong. The remainder of the attractions were moved to a field near Thorntown, Indiana, where the company was prepared to revive the dormant Old Indiana Fun Park. Those plans were soon scrapped when Premier Parks purchased Six Flags and adopted its corporate name. The pieces of Opryland&#x27;s attractions sat rusting in the Indiana field until 2002, when the site was sold. By 2006, the site had been cleared; it is now farmland. Some of the flat rides were sold for scrap metal, while the fate of many of the larger attractions remained unknown. However, in 2003, The Rock n&#x27; Roller Coaster was reassembled at Six Flags Great Escape in Queensbury, New York, where it became known as Canyon Blaster. One of the Wabash Cannonball&#x27;s cars also appeared at a park in Belgium as part of a Halloween display.

The Opryland Themepark site was cleared and paved as a parking lot for Opry Mills and the Grand Ole Opry House by July 1998, while construction of the mall took place primarily on the site of the theme park&#x27;s parking lot.

===Post-demolition===
Opry Mills opened May 12, 2000, under the ownership of Mills Corporation (later acquired by Simon Property Group). Gaylord Entertainment initially had a minority stake in the new shopping center, but later divested. When the arrangements for the future of the Opryland property were made public in 1997, Gaylord announced its intention to construct a new entry plaza for the Grand Ole Opry House with shops and restaurants, as well as a public marina and entertainment complex at Cumberland Landing (the General Jackson&#x27;s port). However, these plans were abandoned as Gaylord focused less on entertainment and more on its hospitality assets.

The long low concrete levee wall which once separated the park&#x27;s New Orleans, Riverside and State Fair areas from the Cumberland River is still part of the mall grounds, and visitors who enter the mall property from the McGavock Pike entrance can view remnants of the graded railroad embankment which once supported the tracks of the park&#x27;s short-line railroad.

The Southern Living Cumberland River Cottage became a training center for hotel employees (Gaylord University), and was moved intact to the former location of Chaos until being torn down in 2010. The large administration building that briefly sat outside the park gates became the offices of the General Jackson and Music City Queen riverboats, and was moved intact to a location near the Cumberland Landing docks.

Much of the Opry Plaza area remained untouched and open for business. The Grand Ole Opry House, Roy Acuff Theater (later renamed BellSouth Acuff Theater), and the Grand Ole Opry Museum remained in constant use throughout and after demolition of the park. The buildings that once housed the Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl museums eventually became the administrative offices of WSM radio. The Gaslight Theater became home to Gaylord Opryland&#x27;s annual ICE! exhibit, and was utilized as a rental facility for television production, banquets, and other events. It was the only building left standing that once occupied the gated theme park.
Though much of the hardware had been removed, the course of the Grizzly River Rampage water ride was visible along the path between Opry Mills and Gaylord Opryland for 14 years after the ride entertained its final guests. In the fall of 2011, Gaylord Entertainment built a new events center designed mainly to hold the hotel&#x27;s yearly &quot;ICE!&quot; exhibit nearby, clearing the old Grizzly River Rampage site in the process. By November 2011, all recognizable remnants of the theme park were gone.

In 2004, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; newspaper published a statement by Gaylord Entertainment, claiming that current company executives had found no evidence that previous management ever had a business plan for Opryland, let alone any strategic analysis that led to closing it. No compelling reasons had been found for the park&#x27;s closure. Most of the Opryland-era executives left Gaylord Entertainment early in the decade, when it was refocused into a more hospitality-oriented company. In 2012, Gaylord CEO Colin Reed called the closing of Opryland &quot;a bad idea&quot;. He said that he had spent much of his first year at Gaylord fielding complaints about the decision (he arrived at the company [replacing Terry London] in 2001, more than three years after the park was demolished).

On January 19, 2012, Gaylord Entertainment announced plans to open a new theme park in Nashville near Opryland&#x27;s former location. The plans called for a park that could be used nearly year-round, as a water park in the summer and snow park in the winter. It was planned to be a joint venture with Dolly Parton and Herschend Family Entertainment (owners/operators of Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee) and was expected to open in 2014. Parton and Herschend backed out of the plans a few months later, citing Gaylord&#x27;s decision to sell the rights to operate its hotel chain to Marriott International as a reason for exiting. As a result of the joint venture&#x27;s collapse, the project was scrapped.

As the company transitioned into a real estate investment trust in 2012, Gaylord Entertainment was renamed Ryman Hospitality Properties in October 2012. In 2018, Gaylord Entertainment&#x27;s former CEO Bud Wendell talked about Opryland&#x27;s closure, saying &quot;Opryland was successful. And it was successful when they shut it down. We weren&#x27;t losing money.&quot; Wendell also said that the decision was &quot;the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

====2010 Tennessee floods====

The Opryland site was flooded in early May 2010, after two days of torrential downpours in the Nashville area caused the Cumberland River to overflow its banks.

The flood did not destroy any buildings on Gaylord property, but they were all severely damaged. Buildings that were demolished—rather than repaired—after the flood include the former TNN/CMT broadcast center, Roy Acuff Theater, Gaslight Theater, the Gaylord University building, the WSM administration buildings (former Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff museums), and the former Opryland Hospitality Center.

Gaylord Opryland, the Grand Ole Opry House, and the General Jackson were closed for several months and all reopened in late 2010. The Grand Ole Opry Museum did not reopen. Since then its structure has served as a training facility for new company employees. Many of its contents were lost in the flood, returned to their owners from loan, or relocated to a new museum space inside Ryman Auditorium. Opry Mills became entangled in a legal battle over flood insurance payout which was ongoing as of March 2015, stalling its flood repairs for several months, and finally reopening on March 29, 2012.

As of 2021, the Grand Ole Opry House, Roy Acuff&#x27;s former home, and the building that once housed the Grand Ole Opry Museum are the only theme park-era structures remaining on the property. The Cumberland Landing building was relocated from the gates of the theme park to the riverbank upon demolition of the park. It was vacated following the flood and beginning in November 2020, is home to Paula Deen&#x27;s Family Kitchen after extensive renovations and a sizeable addition.

==Park areas==
Opryland contained nine themed areas, most of which featured a motif centered on various types of American music.

===Opry Plaza===

Opry Plaza served as the main entry and exit point for Opryland, and contained the park&#x27;s three primary gates. The majority of Opry Plaza sat outside the gates, meaning it was accessible to guests with or without park tickets. It had an antebellum-inspired architectural theme, and featured music from &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; members playing on the speakers. Its centerpiece was the Grand Ole Opry House. Opry Plaza housed no thrill attractions, but was home to the park&#x27;s ticket booths, as well as the Roy Acuff Theatre, Grand Ole Opry Museum, Opryland Hospitality Center, Southern Living Cumberland River Cottage, WSM-FM studio, and the Gaslight Theatre/TNN Studio. Opry Plaza connected to Hill Country, Doo Wah Diddy City, and the parking lot.

During and after the park&#x27;s demolition, portions of Opry Plaza remained undisturbed and open for business. Today, it continues to serve as the area surrounding the Grand Ole Opry House, though many of its remaining buildings were demolished following the 2010 Tennessee floods.

===Hill Country/Opry Village===
Hill Country (renamed Opry Village in 1994) was themed around bluegrass and folk (acoustical) music and was designed to resemble the Appalachia region of the United States. It featured the Folk Music Theatre, which was sponsored by Martha White, and later C.F. Martin &amp; Company. The main attraction of Hill Country was the Dulcimer Splash log ride (originally named Flume Zoom, and briefly called Nestea Plunge). The Grinder&#x27;s Switch Train Station (named for the real-life railroad switch that represented the fictitious hometown of &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; star Minnie Pearl) was also located in this area, providing round-trip service to the El Paso Train Station in American West Area. Hill Country connected to Opry Plaza and New Orleans Area.

===New Orleans Area===
The New Orleans Area was themed around jazz music. Buildings in the area resembled architecture in the French Quarter area of New Orleans, Louisiana. It contained the New Orleans Bandstand, which featured live jazz shows throughout the day, and often played host to a comedy-music show featuring Opry star Mike Snider. The Screamin&#x27; Delta Demon roller coaster was added to the New Orleans Area in 1984, extending the theme to include the Mississippi River Delta. A new park gate was built adjacent to the Demon, but it was not prominently promoted. One of the two Skyride stations was located in New Orleans Area, offering one-way service to Doo Wah Diddy City. New Orleans Area was connected to Hill Country, Riverside Area, and the parking lot.

===Riverside Area===
The Riverside Area had no specific musical or architectural theme, and was named such because it bordered the Cumberland River, although the riverbank was not prominently featured. It was home to the American Music Theater, the gated park&#x27;s only indoor venue. The American Music Theatre was home to &quot;I Hear America Singing&quot;, changing over to &quot;For Me And My Gal&quot; in 1982, then &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;, and &quot;And The Winner Is...&quot;. In later years, &quot;For Me And My Gal&quot; and &quot;I Hear America Singing&quot; were revived in this venue. The Opryland Carousel was located at Riverside, as well as K.C.&#x27;s Kids&#x27; Club, one of the park&#x27;s two attractions geared exclusively toward children. Prior to the introduction of the K.C. character, the children&#x27;s area had been sponsored by General Mills, with the attractions featuring cartoon characters from its various brands of cereals. Riverside Area connected to New Orleans Area and American West Area.

===American West Area===
The American West Area celebrated the American frontier and featured Western music. Its buildings were designed to resemble the architecture of El Paso, Texas in the 1870s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a theatre in the shape of a showboat hosted a live show with music from (or in the styles of) the 1890s to 1900. In 1983, the façade of the theatre was changed, and it hosted &quot;Sing Tennessee&quot; – a version of the show produced by Opryland for the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville. By the mid-1980s, the theatre was converted again to the Durango Theatre, home to the long-running &quot;Way Out West&quot; musical production. The Tin Lizzie antique car ride was located here until 1994, when it was replaced by The Hangman inverted roller coaster, the last major attraction to be installed at Opryland. A small indoor theatre, the La Cantina, existed in American West in the park&#x27;s early years, featuring an improvisation revue that underwent frequent title changes, until the theatre was converted into a video arcade and recording studio for guests. The Angle Inn was also here, where guests watched a performance in a sloped room where a human named &quot;Bobby&quot; would interact with talking portraits on the wall while demonstrating various illusions based on the incline that made the room appear level. The American West Area also housed the El Paso Train Station, which provided round-trip service to Grinder&#x27;s Switch Train Station in Hill Country. Though one of Opryland&#x27;s smallest areas, its central location allowed it to serve as somewhat of a hub, connecting to Riverside Area and Lakeside Area, and as part of a three-way intersection with Doo Wah Diddy City and Grizzly Country.

===Lakeside Area===
The Lakeside Area celebrated modern country music, and was home to the Theatre By The Lake, host to the long-running &quot;Country Music USA&quot; musical production. It prominently featured Eagle Lake, a man-made reservoir that originally housed the Raft Ride, until it was replaced by the Old Mill Scream in 1987. The Barnstormer airplane ride sat on the lakeshore. It also served as home to the other of the park&#x27;s two Kids&#x27; Club areas, which in its later years was centered on Professor U.B. Sharp, a character who taught music to children. The Skycoaster was relocated here from State Fair in 1997, in an effort to increase ridership. Lakeside Area connected to State Fair and American West Area.

===State Fair===
The State Fair area was added to the park in 1975 (replacing a buffalo exhibit) and themed to resemble the midway at a typical state fair, with its central attraction being the Wabash Cannonball roller coaster. Also located in this area was the park&#x27;s petting zoo, the Country Bumpkin Bump Cars, the Tennessee Waltz swing ride, and a large stable of carnival-style games. State Fair also contained a picnic pavilion, typically closed to the general public, designed to host functions for large groups that were visiting the park. Skycoaster was erected adjacent to the picnic pavilion, and remained there during the 1995 and 1996 seasons, before moving to Lakeside Area in 1997. State Fair connected to Lakeside Area and Grizzly Country.

===Grizzly Country===
Grizzly Country was Opryland&#x27;s last major expansion project, in 1981. It was constructed primarily to house the Grizzly River Rampage river rafting ride. Chaos, an indoor roller coaster, was installed in Grizzly Country, and opened on April 8, 1989. For a while in the 1980s, Grizzly Country was home to a Mrs. Winner&#x27;s Chicken &amp; Biscuits fast-food location. Grizzly Country connected to State Fair and was part of a three-way intersection with American West Area and Doo Wah Diddy City. In 1996, following completion of the Delta expansion at Opryland Hotel, a park gate was added (adjacent to Chaos), allowing for pedestrian traffic between the park and the resort for the first time.

===Music of Today (&quot;Mod&quot;)/Doo Wah Diddy City===
The Music of Today, also called the &quot;Mod&quot; area, celebrated modern pop and rock music. Because the rapidly changing trends in those genres made the area difficult to keep current, this area was re-themed and became Doo Wah Diddy City in 1979. Though its name implied doo-wop, this area celebrated pop music and rock and roll, beginning with their origins in the 1950s. It was home to the Rock n&#x27; Roller Coaster (originally called Timber Topper), Opryland&#x27;s first thrill ride. Also in Doo Wah Diddy City was the Little Deuce Coupe, a teacups-style ride housed in a geodesic dome. The ride had previously been open-air and called the Disc Jockey. A Skyride station offering one-way service to the New Orleans Area also called the area home. The section featured a dual-sided theatre called the Jukebox and the Flip Side, which was removed in 1991 to make way for Opryland&#x27;s new centerpiece, the Chevrolet-Geo Celebrity Theatre. Doo Wah Diddy City connected to Opry Plaza, American West Area, and Grizzly Country.

<text>McDonough is an Irish surname.

==Origins and variants==
The surname is an Anglicized form of the Gaelic name &quot;Mac Donnchadha&quot;, which means son of Donnchadh or son of Donough. The name itself consists of elements meaning &quot;brown (donn)&quot; or Donn “the dark one”, plus &quot;battle (chatha)&quot;.

Various unrelated clans carrying this surname existed in Ireland, at least two in Connacht: these MacDonnchadhas were a branch of the MacDermots, the kings of Moylurg. Another McDonough clan were cadets of the O&#x27;Flaherty chiefs in Iar Connacht.

The second clan in Munster, whose chiefs held the Castle of Kanturk in County Cork, and who were known as the bards of Duhallow, were a branch of the MacCarthys going by McDonough. The name is now rare in Cork, with some of the original name holders, it is believed, changing their name to MacCarthy, although some with the original name still remain in Munster.

One explanation for the many spelling variations is that scribes and church officials frequently spelled the name as it sounded: an imprecise method at best. Understandably then, various spellings of the surname McDonough were found in the many archives researched including MacDonough, McDonogh, and many more.

<text>Reimond Tollenaere (June 29, 1909 – January 22, 1942) was a member of the Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond (VNV), a right-wing Flemish nationalist party in Belgium. He was an active collaborator with Nazi Germany during World War II.

Tollenaere became active in the Flemish nationalist movement during his law studies at the University of Ghent. He was appointed as propaganda leader of the VNV and, in 1936, became a VNV member of parliament. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940 he was arrested by the Belgian authorities as a potential subversive and spent some time in prison in France. After being freed following the French defeat, he resumed his political activities in Flanders.

Tollenaere was active in encouraging recruitment for the Flemish Legion attached to the Waffen-SS following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and later enlisted himself. He was killed by friendly fire from the Spanish Blue Division in January 1942 at Kopsy near Leningrad in the region of Veliky Novgorod. After his death, he was &quot;cannonized&quot; by the VNV as a political martyr.

<text>The United States Navy &quot;Salmon&quot;-class [[submarine]]s were an important developmental step in the design of the &quot;fleet submarine&quot; concept during the 1930s. An incremental improvement over the previous &quot;Porpoise&quot; class, they were the first US submarine class to achieve 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant, allowing them to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Also, their unrefueled range would allow them to operate in Japanese home waters. These rugged and dependable boats provided yeoman service during World War II, along with their immediate successors, the similar . In some references, the &quot;Salmon&quot;s and &quot;Sargo&quot;s are called the &quot;New S Class&quot;, 1st and 2nd Groups.

==Design==

Authorized under the Fiscal Year 1936 provision of the Vinson-Trammell Act, two distinct, but very similar, designs were developed, to be built by three different constructors. The Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut designed and built , , and (SS-182 to 184). The Navy&#x27;s lead submarine design entity, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine submitted a design for the Government group, which became and (SS-185 &amp; 186). Using the Portsmouth plans and acting as a follow yard, the Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California built . The two designs differed in minor details such as the locations of the access hatches for the forward engine room and crew&#x27;s quarters, the shape of the horizontal conning tower cylinder, and, most significantly, the closure of the main induction valve. This difference led to casualties in &quot;Snapper&quot; and &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, and to the loss of &quot;Squalus&quot;. Larger than the design of the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class, the conning tower installed by Electric Boat had two concave spherical ends, The Portsmouth design had a concave end aft and a convex one forward. Portsmouth and Mare Island ran into production difficulties with their conning towers, discovering cracks that caused the cylinder to fail the required pressure test. The problem was successfully fixed, but the experience caused the government yards to adopt the double concave design for the next several years.

Externally, there were minor differences in the shape of the upper edge of the aft end of the conning tower fairwater. The Electric Boat design had a gradual downward taper to this bulwark, the Government design was slightly higher and straighter. Also, as built the Electric Boat trio had two 34 foot periscopes. This resulted in a fairly small periscope shear support structure above the fairwater. The three Government boats had one 34 foot and one 40 foot periscope and this necessitated a taller shear and support stanchions.

The Electric Boat-built &quot;Porpoise&quot;s had been built to an all-welded design. Conservative engineers and shipfitters at the Government yards stuck with tried and true riveting. Electric Boat&#x27;s method proved superior, providing a stronger and tighter boat, as well as preventing leakage of fuel oil tanks after depth charge attacks. Finally convinced of the efficacy of Electric Boat&#x27;s innovation, Government yards finally converted wholesale to welding for their three &quot;Salmon&quot;s and the Navy was entirely happy with the results.

The six boats of this class were straight forward derivations of the later boats of the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot; class. Although considered to be successful in most respects, valuable lessons had been learned from the &quot;Porpoise&quot;s and operating experience showed the need to expand the operating envelope. The &quot;Salmon&quot;s were longer, heavier, and faster versions with a better internal arrangement and a heavier armament. Two additional torpedo tubes were added to the aft torpedo room, for a total of four forward and four aft. The development of the Torpedo Data Computer, making broadside attacks practical, had made stern tubes more desirable. Some submariners wanted six tubes forward, but design philosophy and tactics of the day did not yet support this; additionally, for years the tonnage required to provide the extra tubes was over-estimated. However, in an effort to increase the number of torpedoes carried, four non-firing torpedo stowage tubes were installed in the superstructure below the main deck, stacked vertically, two each on either side of the conning tower. In order to access the weapons in these tubes, the boat had to surface and remove a portion of the decking on either side of the deck gun. Small boats stowed there for running sailors ashore for liberty were removed and set in the water. The weapons were extracted from the tubes one by one and winched up to the main deck. They were then placed on a raised loading skid and carefully lowered on an angle through a hatch into the forward torpedo room. This whole process took several hours to complete. The impracticality of spending several hours on the surface in enemy waters moving torpedoes below was lost on the designers. War experience led to the removal of these tubes during the boats&#x27; first wartime overhauls.

Two different main (diesel) engine types were installed in these boats during construction. The Government boats received a new model GM-Winton 16-248 V16. Steady development work by GM-Winton had largely corrected earlier problems and this engine proved to be fairly reliable and rugged. The three Electric Boat units received a nine-cylinder version of the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) double-acting engine. This was based on a successful steam engine design. Having a power stroke in both directions of the piston, this engine promised nearly twice the horsepower in a size similar to a conventional in-line or V-type engine. Unfortunately, HOR encountered severe design and manufacturing difficulties converting the concept to internal combustion. They vibrated excessively due to imbalances in the combustion chambers. This broke engine mounts and caused difficulties in the drive train. Improper manufacture of the gearing resulted in broken gear teeth. Reluctant to give up on the promise of the engine, the Navy coddled the HORs along until after the United States entered the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor, when increased funding and operational needs caused these engines to be replaced with GM-Winton 16-278As during the boat&#x27;s first wartime overhauls.

Serious problems were encountered with the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class&#x27; diesel-electric drive. This drove the decision to radically alter the propulsion plant. The &quot;Salmon&quot;s were fitted with a so-called &quot;composite drive&quot;. In this arrangement, two main engines in the forward engine room drove generators in the fashion set by the &quot;Porpoise&quot;s. In the after engine room, two side-by-side engines were clutched to reduction gears which sat forward of the engines, with vibration-isolating hydraulic clutches. The propeller shafts led aft from each of the reduction gears, and were sited outboard of the engines. Two high-speed electric motors were mounted outboard of each shaft, connected directly to the reduction gears. For surfaced operation the engines were clutched in to the reduction gears and drove the propellers directly, with the generator engines providing additional voltage to the motors. For submerged operation, the direct drive engines were declutched from the reduction gears and the motors drove the shafts with electricity supplied by the batteries. Since World War I the US Navy had sought a 21-knot fleet submarine to maneuver with the Standard-type battleships. The first attempts, with the and the &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class &quot;V-boats&quot; in the 1920s, were failures due to unreliable engines. The &quot;Salmon&quot;s were the first US submarine class to achieve the desired speed of 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant. However, this unusual arrangement was quite cramped, making maintenance and repairs in the aft engine room somewhat difficult.

All six of these submarines (and all subsequent U.S. Navy submarines up to the late 1940s) were built to a &quot;partial-double hull&quot; design. In this hull type, the inner pressure resisting hull is wrapped by an outer hydrodynamically smooth hull. The space between these two hulls is used for ballast and fuel tanks. The outer hull smoothly tapers into the pressure hull in the area of the forward and after torpedo room bulkheads, leaving the pressure hull exposed at the extreme ends of the boat. This is actually an advantage as it allows access to the pressure hull in these areas for maintenance. In a full double hull boat, the outer hull completely encompasses the pressure hull and the very narrow ends make it very hard to reach the pressure hull for repairs and maintenance.

==Service history==
===Commissioning and pre-war service===

Portsmouth proved to be quite efficient in their production methods and they managed to complete and commission both &quot;Snapper&quot; and &quot;Stingray&quot; before Electric Boat delivered the lead boat &quot;Salmon&quot; for commissioning. In fact, all three of the Government built boats of this class beat their commercially built counterparts into service.

After commissioning, these boats were very active in the fleet, operating initially with the Atlantic Fleet, conducting exercises in the Caribbean and around both sides of the Panama Canal. They transferred to the Pacific Fleet in late 1939, homeported out of San Diego, commanded by  Admiral Wilhelm L. Friedell. In October 1941, as war clouds loomed on the horizon, all the &quot;Salmon&quot;s and most other newer available submarines were transferred to the Asiatic Fleet as part of a belated effort to reinforce U.S. and Allied forces in the Philippines. The Japanese occupation of southern Indo-China and the August 1941 American-British-Dutch retaliatory oil embargo had raised international tensions. They operated out of Cavite in Manila Bay until the war commenced.

===World War II===

From the very start, the &quot;Salmon&quot;s were in the thick of the fight in the defense of the Philippines. The submarines of the Asiatic Fleet were the primary striking force available to Admiral Thomas C. Hart, the fleet&#x27;s commander. He was assigned sixteen &quot;Salmon&quot;s or &quot;Sargo&quot;s, the entirety of both classes. The Japanese did not bomb Cavite Navy Yard until 10 December 1941, so almost all of the submarines were able to get underway before an attack.

The qualities designed into the &quot;Salmon&quot;s for their role as fleet submarines made them well suited for the war they found themselves fighting, but some shortcomings came up that were not apparent prior to the war. It came to be realized that the boats were going to spend a lot more time on the surface than what had been previously acknowledged. Thus the large bulk of the conning tower fairwater became a liability. It was too easily spotted by keen-eyed Japanese lookouts using their excellent binoculars. It was found that portions of the fairwater plating could be cut away both fore and aft of the bridge, greatly reducing the silhouette. This also had the desirable effect of creating mounting locations for 20mm Oerlikon autocannons, which were useful against aircraft and small surface targets.

The timely development of radar in the USN proved to be a key factor in the eventual victory over the Imperial Japanese Navy, and its incorporation into the &quot;Salmon&quot;s and other USN submarines gave them a critical advantage in detection and defense. The first sets became available within days of the war beginning, and they were introduced to the boats as they went into overhaul in 1942.

The original Mark 21 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun proved to be too light in service. It lacked sufficient punch to finish off crippled or small targets quickly enough to suit the crews. It was replaced by the Mark 9 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber gun in 1943–44, in most cases removed from an S-boat being transferred to training duty.

The Submarine Force relied heavily on the well-liked &quot;Salmon&quot;s during the first two and a half years of the war, with some of them completing 15 war patrols before being assigned to training duties by 1945.

&quot;Salmon&quot; barely survived a severe depth charging by Japanese escort ships on 30 October 1944. She was retired from combat duty and spent the rest of the war as a training boat.

&quot;Skipjack&quot; was expended as a target twice postwar: once in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll 25 July 1946, and again as a target for aircraft rockets off California 11 August 1948.

<text>Dougie Lee Poynter (born 30 November 1987) is an English musician, songwriter, fashion model, aspiring clothing designer and children&#x27;s author. He is the bassist of the pop rock band McFly. He won the eleventh series of the ITV reality series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Poynter was born in Orsett, Essex, England. He went to school at Herd Lane Primary School and Gable Hall School, both located in neighbouring Corringham. He has one sister.

===Musical career===

====McFly====
In 2003, a then 15 year-old Poynter auditioned for and subsequently became the bass player for the British band McFly. The band consists of Poynter, Tom Fletcher (vocals/guitar), Danny Jones (guitar/vocals), and Harry Judd (drums).

McFly rose to fame with their first single, &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair,&quot; which was released March 2004 and entered the UK Singles Chart at number one in April 2004. Their first album, &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;, also hit number one in the UK Albums Chart and would earn McFly a Guinness World Record for being the youngest band to have a debut album enter the chart in the top position, previously held by the Beatles. That year, McFly would support Busted on tour before going on to headline a personal tour in September 2004.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, was released in 2005 followed by &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot; in 2006. A Greatest Hits compilation was released in 2007 followed by two more studio albums: &quot;&quot; (2008) and &quot;Above the Noise&quot; (2010).

A second greatest hits album, &quot;Memory Lane: The Best of McFly&quot;, was released in November 2012. Also in 2012, the band debuted their first written autobiography, &quot;McFly: Unsaid Things... Our Story&quot; with Transworld Publishers Ltd.

In April 2016, McFly announced that they would be going on tour for a three-night residency in Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, and London. The Anthology tour, in which they will play all five of their albums, will serve as McFly&#x27;s first live reunion since 2013. The tour was postponed from June until September 2016 after drummer Harry Judd injured his neck.

====McBusted====
In November 2013, McFly joined the band Busted to form the super-group, McBusted. They played a 34-date tour called The McBusted Tour. It was the biggest UK tour of 2014. McBusted concluded the tour headlining the British Summer Time concert series in Hyde Park where they performed for an audience of over 60,000 attendees.

In 2015, the band went on tour for a second time. McBusted&#x27;s Most Excellent Adventure Tour consisted of 21 shows.

====INK====

In 2018, Poynter announced on his Instagram he had joined Todd Dorigo and Corey Alexander to form a new alt-rock band &quot;INK&quot;. That same day, they released their debut EP &quot;Heaven&quot; and announced a small UK tour. However, a second tour was cancelled due to &#x27;uncontrollable circumstances&#x27;. With no formal announcement, the tour was rescheduled without Poynter, who couldn&#x27;t attend due to the reformation of McFly. He was replaced by Elliot Morgan.

===Fashion career===
Poynter made his runway debut in January 2016 at the Joshua Kane with Lab Series Autumn/Winter show for London Collections Men. Off the catwalk, Poynter is a front-row fixture at LCM and other global fashion weeks, garnering invites from top brands including Topman, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Moschino, and Saint Laurent Paris. Runway-side, Poynter is celebrated for his trend-setting personal style.

Poynter served as a guest fashion writer for &quot;Fault Magazine&quot; during LCM in June 2016. He provided an insider&#x27;s perspective with his recaps of Topman S/S 2017, Katy Eary S/S 2017, and Christopher Raeburn S/S 2017. His most notable editorial work includes the fashion film &quot;At Full Tilt&quot; for &quot;Vogue India&quot; (August 2014), an online exclusive for &quot;Notion Magazine&quot; (August 2015), and a spread in Issue 19 of &quot;Adon Magazine&quot; (March 2016). Poynter also modelled alongside his then-girlfriend Ellie Goulding in the February 2016 issue of &quot;Glamour&quot;.

==Songwriting==

In addition to his work with McFly, Poynter has written collaboratively for talent such as 5 Seconds of Summer and One Direction (for the track &quot;I Would&quot; from the album Take Me Home and for the track &quot;Don’t Forget Where You Belong&quot; from the album Midnight Memories, respectively). He also worked alongside seasoned artists Mark Hoppus (Blink 182) and Alex Gaskarth (All Time Low) to develop the album for the McFly + Busted supergroup, McBusted. He is also credited in Busted&#x27;s album &quot;Half Way There&quot; for the song &quot;Nineties&quot;.

==Other work==
Poynter won &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2011.

Poynter wrote a children&#x27;s book with McFly band-mate Tom Fletcher titled &quot;The Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas&quot;. It sold over 72,000 copies and became the most popular debut children&#x27;s novel of 2012. The follow-up book titled &quot;The Dinosaur That Pooped A Planet&quot; was released the following year in August 2013. Poynter also wrote the children&#x27;s book &quot;Plastic Sucks!: How YOU Can Reduce Single-Use Plastic and Save Our Planet&quot; (2019).

Poynter is also an active participant of The 5 Gyres Institute and their mission to eradicate the pollution of plastic in the ocean. He supports the banning of microplastic materials across Europe, citing the serious detrimental impact of these substances on the marine environment as the reason of his disapproval.

Poynter has also been part of charity endeavors alongside McFly. The band has raised money for causes such as Comic Relief, Children in Need, Live 8, Sport Relief, and Earth Hour.

In addition to this, Poynter has founded various clothing lines. His skate clothing brand Zookie is still active under different ownership. He also owned and founded Saint Kidd, and Polonius, both of which are no longer trading.

==Personal life==
Poynter dated Frankie Bridge (née Sandford) of The Saturdays from 2008 to 2010. His relationship with fellow musician Ellie Goulding was confirmed in February 2014; the couple split in 2016.

He is in a relationship with actress Yasmeen Scott since 2023.

He is related to Josh Franceschi, the lead singer of You Me at Six.

<text>The Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) is the oldest tank unit in the world, being formed by the British Army in 1916 during the First World War. Today, it is the armoured regiment of the British Army&#x27;s 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade. Formerly known as the Tank Corps and the Royal Tank Corps, it is part of the Royal Armoured Corps.

==History==
===First World War===

The formation of the Royal Tank Regiment followed the invention of the tank. Tanks were first used at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War. They were at first considered artillery, and crews received artillery pay. At that time the six tank companies were grouped as the Heavy Section of the Machine Gun Corps (MGC). In November 1916 the eight companies then in existence were each expanded to form battalions (still identified by the letters A to H) and designated the Heavy Branch MGC; another seven battalions, I to O, were formed by January 1918, when all the battalions were changed to numbered units. On 28 July 1917, the Heavy Branch was separated from the rest of the Corps by Royal Warrant and given official status as the Tank Corps. The formation of new battalions continued and, by December 1918, 26 had been created though only 25 battalions were equipped with tanks, as the 17th had converted to armoured cars in April 1918. The first commander of the Tank Corps was Hugh Elles. The Corps saw much action at the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917.

===Interwar period===
After the war, the Tank Corps was trimmed down to a central depot and four battalions: the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th battalions. On 18 October 1923, it was officially given the title &quot;Royal&quot; making it the Royal Tank Corps (RTC) by Colonel-in-Chief King George V. It was at this time that the motto, &quot;Fear Naught&quot;, the black beret, and the unit badge were adopted. In 1933, the 6th Battalion, RTC was formed in Egypt by combining the personnel of the 3rd and 5th Regular Army Armoured Car Companies. In 1934, the 1st (Light) Battalion, RTC was formed in England with personnel drawn from the 2nd, 3rd &amp; 5th Battalions. With the preparations for war in the late 1930s, two more Regular Army battalions were formed: the 7th in 1937 and the 8th in 1938. In the latter half of 1938, six TA infantry battalions were converted to tank battalions; with a further six created in 1939 following the &quot;duplication&quot; of the TA.

During the early 1920s, the Tank Corps was augmented by 20 armoured car companies: twelve Regular Army, created using MGC elements; and eight Territorial Army (TA) created by the reduction and conversion of Yeomanry regiments. Eight of the Regular Army companies were later converted into independent light tank companies; all twelve companies had been disbanded by the outbreak of the Second World War.

On 4 April 1939, the Royal Tank Corps was renamed the Royal Tank Regiment and became a wing of the newly created Royal Armoured Corps. The eight Yeomanry Armoured Car Companies of the RTR were activated and transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps. Before the Second World War, Royal Tank Corps recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 4 inches tall. They initially enlisted for six years with the colours and a further six years with the reserve. They trained at the Royal Tank Corps Depot at Bovington Camp, Dorset for about eight months.

===Second World War===

At the outbreak of war, the regiment consisted of 20 battalions, 8 regular and 12 territorial.

* Regular Army
**Heavy Armoured Brigade (Egypt): 1st RTR and 6th RTR
**1st Heavy Armoured Brigade: 2nd RTR, 3rd RTR and 5th RTR
**1st Army Tank Brigade: 4th RTR, 7th RTR and 8th RTR
* Territorial Army
**21st Army Tank Brigade: 42nd RTR, 44th RTR and 48th RTR
**23rd Army Tank Brigade: 40th RTR, 46th RTR and 50th RTR
**24th Army Tank Brigade: 41st RTR, 45th RTR and 47th RTR
**25th Army Tank Brigade: 43rd RTR, 49th RTR and 51st RTR

During the course of the war, four &quot;hostilities-only&quot; battalions were formed: the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. 11 RTR formed part of 79th Armoured Division (a specialist group operating vehicles known as &quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot;), initially equipped with &quot;Canal Defence Light&quot; tanks, it converted to &quot;Buffalo&quot; (the British service name for the US Landing Vehicle Tracked) not long after D-Day and participated in the assault crossing of the Rhine. Prime Minister Winston Churchill was ferried across the Rhine in a Buffalo from &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, 11RTR.

The Regiment&#x27;s numerous units took part in countless battles in the Second World War, including the Battle of Dunkirk, El Alamein, Italian Campaign, Burma Campaign and D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery would frequently wear the regiment&#x27;s beret, with his Field Marshal&#x27;s badge sewn on next to the regimental cap badge, as it was more practical whilst travelling on a tank than either a formal peaked hat or the Australian slouch hat he previously wore.

===Post-war period===
After service in the Korean War, the RTR was reduced through various amalgamations, firstly, in 1959–60:
* 3 RTR and 6 RTR amalgamated as 3 RTR
* 4 RTR and 7 RTR amalgamated as 4 RTR
* 5 RTR and 8 RTR amalgamated as 5 RTR

In 1969, 5RTR was disbanded, while, in 1992 under Options for Change, 4RTR amalgamated with 1RTR, and 3RTR amalgamated with 2RTR.

The Royal Tank Regiment continued to see action including missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Elements of 1RTR were deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 and both regiments were involved in the invasion of Iraq, with the 2RTR battlegroup involved in taking Basra. Both regiments continued deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, with the final tour to Afghanistan taking place in 2013.

On 2 August 2014, 1RTR and 2RTR amalgamated at Bulford, and for the first time in its history the Royal Tank Regiment became a &quot;Single Battalion&quot; Regiment. The new regiment is titled the Royal Tank Regiment.

==Current status==
The regiment is equipped with Challenger 2 tanks and based at Tidworth coming under 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade following the Army 2020 refine. Unlike the other Type 56 Challenger 2 Regiments, the RTR also has an CBRN reconnaissance squadron operating the Fuchs reconnaissance vehicle which forms part of 28 Engineer Regiment. Thus the regiment comprises six squadrons:

*Ajax – Challenger 2 armoured squadron
*Badger – Challenger 2 armoured squadron
*Cyclops – Challenger 2 armoured squadron
*Dreadnaught – Challenger 2 armoured squadron
*Egypt – Headquarters, Command, and Reconnaissance squadron
*Falcon – CBRN reconnaissance squadron (under 28 Engineer Regiment)

==Uniform==
The Uniform of the Royal Tank Regiment is unique in many ways to the rest of the Royal Armoured Corps and British Army:

===The black beret===
Much of the uniform and equipment of soldiers during the First World War was quite impractical for use inside a tank. In particular, the vision apertures in a tank were so small that it was necessary to keep the eyes very close to them in order to get even a limited vision. Thus, any headdress with a peak was entirely unsuitable. In May 1918, General Elles and Colonel Fuller were discussing the future of the Tank Corps and its uniform and General Elles tried on a beret of the 70th Chasseurs Alpins, which was billeted nearby. A black beret was selected as it would not show oil stains. No change in uniform was possible during the war, but after a prolonged argument with the War Office, the black beret was approved by King George V on 5 March 1924. The black beret remained the exclusive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps until its practical value was recognised by others and its use extended to the majority of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. On the introduction of the blue beret in 1949, the Royal Tank Regiment reclaimed its right to the exclusive use of the black beret, which may not be worn by any other Regiment or Corps with the exception of the Berkshire and Westminster Dragoons Squadron of The Royal Yeomanry.

===Black overalls===
The wearing of black overalls is a custom reserved to the Regiment by Material Regulations for the Army, volume 3, Pamphlet No 4 (Code 13251). It stems from the Royal Review held at Aldershot in the presence of King George V on 13 July 1935 on which occasion black overalls were worn on parade by all ranks of the Royal Tanks Corps. The practice lapsed during the Second World War, but was re-introduced in the 1950s.

===Black accoutrements===
Royal Tank Regiment officers and senior warrant officers also wear both a black Sam Browne and a black sword scabbard, while other ranks wear a black parade belt. 

===Sleeve badge===
The sleeve badge of a First World War Mk 1 tank preceded the formation of the Royal Tank Corps when it was worn by the Heavy Branch of the Machine Gun Corps. Authorised on 7 May 1917, it is still worn today by all ranks on No.1 and No.2 dress and on their sleeve brassard on black overalls.

===The ash plant===
During the First World War, walking sticks were often carried by officers. Such sticks came to have a new and more important use with the introduction of tanks, which often became &#x27;bogged&#x27; on battlefields, particularly in Flanders. Officers of the Tank Corps used these sticks to probe the ground in front of their tanks testing for firmness as they went forward. Often, the commanders led their tanks into action on foot. To commemorate this, officers of the Regiment carry ash plant sticks instead of the short cane customary to other arms.

<text>Zagut (Zacut) is a crater located in the heavily impacted southeast sector of the Moon. It is almost surrounded by other named craters, with Wilkins to the northwest, Lindenau to the east, Rabbi Levi in the southeast, and Celsius to the southwest. It is named after Jewish Spanish astronomer and rabbi Abraham Zacuto.

The rim of Zagut (Zacut) is worn and irregular, especially to the north and east. The east rim is overlain by Zagut E, a crater with an irregular and flat floor. The floor of Zagut itself is also relatively flat, and the center is occupied by the crater Zagut A instead of a peak.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zagut.

<text>The Semipalatinsk Test Site or Semipalatinsk-21 (; ), also known as &quot;The Polygon&quot;, was the primary testing venue for the Soviet Union&#x27;s nuclear weapons. It is located in Zhanasemey District, Abai Region, Kazakhstan, south of the valley of the Irtysh River. The test site was part of the former Kazakh SSR. The scientific buildings for the test site were located around west of the town of Semipalatinsk, later renamed Semey, near the border of East Kazakhstan Region and Pavlodar Region. Most of the nuclear tests taking place at various sites further to the west and the south, some as far as into Karagandy Region.

The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991. According to estimates from Kazakh experts, 1.5 million people were exposed to fallout over the years.

From 1996 to 2012, a secret joint operation of Kazakh, Russian, and American nuclear scientists and engineers secured some waste plutonium in the tunnels of the mountains.

The Semipalatinsk Test Site saw the detonation of the first Soviet atom bomb, and the first air-tested hydrogen bomb. Over the course of 40 years, a quarter of all nuclear tests in history took place here. Since its closure on 29 August 1991, the Semipalatinsk Test Site has become the best-researched nuclear testing site in the world, and the only one in the world open to the public year-round.

==History==

The site was selected in 1947 by Lavrentiy Beria, political head of the Soviet atomic bomb project. Beria claimed the vast 18,000 km² steppe was &quot;uninhabited&quot;. Gulag labour was employed to build the primitive test facilities, including the laboratory complex in the northeast corner on the southern bank of the Irtysh River. The first Soviet bomb test, Operation First Lightning, was conducted in 1949 from a tower at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, scattering fallout on nearby villages. The same area, &quot;the experimental field&quot;, a region west of Kurchatov city, was used for more than 100 subsequent above-ground weapons tests.

Later tests were moved to the Balapan complex by the Chagan River in the southeast of the Semipalatinsk Polygon, including the site of the Chagan test, which formed Chagan Lake. Once atmospheric tests were banned, testing was transferred to underground locations at Saryozen, Murzhik in the west, and at the Degelen mountain complex in the south, which is riddled with boreholes and drifts for both subcritical and supercritical tests. After the closure of the Semipalatinsk labour camp, construction duties were performed by the 217th Separate Engineering and Mining Battalion, who later built the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

Between 1949 and the cessation of atomic testing in 1989, 456 explosions were conducted at the STS, including 340 underground borehole and tunnel shots and 116 atmospheric, either air-drop or tower shots. The lab complex, still the administrative and scientific centre of the STS, was renamed Kurchatov City after Igor Kurchatov, leader of the initial Soviet nuclear programme. The location of Kurchatov city has been typically shown on various maps as &quot;Konechnaya&quot;, the name of the train station, now Degelen, or &quot;Moldary&quot;, the name of the village that was later incorporated into the city.

The Semipalatinsk Complex was of acute interest to foreign governments during its operation, particularly during the phase when explosions were carried out above ground at the experimental field. Several U-2 overflights examined preparations and weapons effects, before being replaced with satellite reconnaissance. The US Defense Intelligence Agency who were spying on Soviet Union, believed that the Soviets established an enormous beam weapon station at a small research station located on the testing site.

This smaller research station, known to the Department of Defense as PNUTS (Possible Nuclear Underground Test Site) and to the CIA as URDF-3 (Unidentified Research and Development Facility-3) was of great interest to American intelligence agencies. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was discovered that the mysterious URDF-3 was tasked with researching a nuclear thermal rocket similar to the US&#x27;s NERVA.

===Closure of the test site===
Information about the test site was first made public during the Glasnost era. Before this, even the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan had neither access to the site nor any authority over its operations. According to Nazarbayev, then Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR, a few months after the Chernobyl disaster, Moscow sent an order to expand the territory of the Semipalatinsk site into the Taldy-Kurgan Region. Nazarbayev refused to sign the document, summoning Taldy-Kurgan’s regional executive committee chair, Seilbek Shaumakhanov, to Alma-Ata and instructing him to spread the word about the expansion plan and to hold a protest rally with an “unexpectedly assembled” public. A significant role was also played by Keshirim Boztaev, the First Secretary of the Semipalatinsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, who, with the approval of the republican leadership, sent a telegram on February 20, 1989, to the CPSU Central Committee, addressed to M. S. Gorbachev, requesting that “relevant ministries and agencies be instructed to temporarily suspend or drastically reduce the frequency and power of explosions and, in the future, move nuclear testing to another, more acceptable location.” Meanwhile, the KGB reported to Moscow that protest sentiments were intensifying and warned of a possible repeat of the December 1986 events in Alma-Ata, but on a republic-wide scale. Ultimately, the decision was made to abandon the site expansion plan.

On May 30, 1989, Nazarbayev addressed the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union:

In 1989, the prominent Kazakh activist Olzhas Suleimenov founded the Nevada-Semipalatinsk movement, uniting victims of nuclear testing worldwide. One of the movement’s most significant events was a mass rally held in the village of Karaaul in the Abay district.

The last explosion at the site was conducted on October 19, 1989.

One of Nazarbayev’s first decisions as president of the Kazakh SSR was to close the Semipalatinsk Test Site and to fully renounce the world’s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal. On August 29, 1991, the Kazakh SSR government closed the site. On that day, Nazarbayev announced a special parliamentary session to discuss the site’s closure without the Soviet leadership’s consent. The session began in the morning and concluded in the evening. By the end, some deputies and officials from the Semipalatinsk Region requested additional tests to secure the informal compensation promised by Moscow. In his closing statement, the president assumed responsibility and, exercising his authority, signed the decree to close the site on the spot.

===Legacy===
The Soviet government conducted its last tests in 1989. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the site was neglected. Fissile material was left behind in mountain tunnels and bore holes, virtually unguarded and vulnerable to scavengers, rogue states, or potential terrorists. The secret cleanup of Semipalatinsk was made public in the 2010s.

After some of the tests, radioactive material remained on the now abandoned area, including significant amounts of plutonium. The risk that material might fall into the hands of scavengers or terrorists was considered one of the largest nuclear security threats since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The operation to address the problem involved, in part, pouring special concrete into test holes, to bind the waste plutonium. In other cases, horizontal mine test holes were sealed and the entrances covered over. In October 2012, Kazakh, Russian, and American nuclear scientists and engineers celebrated the completion of a secret 17-year, $150 million operation to secure the plutonium in the tunnels of the mountains.

Large parts of the STS have opened up since 2014, and economic activity has resumed: mostly mining, but also agriculture and tourism. As with other areas affected by radioactivity, the lack of human interference has made the STS a haven for wildlife.

Residents of the test site&#x27;s surrounding area in the Kazakh Steppe have been affected by the radiation and have suffered from radiation caused illnesses just as other surrounding areas have. However, unlike other communities, some Kazakhs have formed an identity around this fact. Some have even considered themselves to be a new breed of human. As they understand it, they are mutants who have grown and adapted to the radiation present in their home. According to unconfirmed sources, the residents&#x27; opinion, the air and the food are toxic, and the people consume this and live. They believe they must be adapting to the radiation and that is why people only get a &#x27;little sick&#x27;. They even have begun to believe that they are so used to radiation that their bodies require it. This belief has stemmed from the fact that many individuals who left in favour of opportunities in cities have died soon after. Although the evidence villagers cite is anecdotal, and most of the deaths were as a result of alcoholism, overdose, and other challenges that arose after a failure to adapt to a new way of life, to some left behind, it seems that the lack of radiation killed them. This has further cemented their belief that they are &#x27;radioactive mutants&#x27;.

The locals also believe that their status is backed by science. The basis of this was a training exercise performed by the Comprehensive Test-Ban-Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The exercise was based around a hypothetical nuclear explosion, so CTBTO participants wore full protective gear during the exercise. Citizens of a nearby village witnessed this but were neither informed of the &#x27;exercise&#x27; nor the reason for the outsiders&#x27; presence. As such the citizens perceived strangers having to wear protective gear to enter the area around their community while they, the residents, had no need. This further cemented their belief that they must be radioactive mutants.

==Anti-nuclear movement==
The anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan, named Nevada-Semipalatinsk, was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear movements in the former Soviet Union. It was led by author Olzhas Suleimenov and attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk in 1991.

According to UNESCO, Nevada-Semipalatinsk played a positive role in promoting public understanding of &quot;the necessity to fight against nuclear threats&quot;. The movement gained global support and became &quot;a real historical factor in finding solutions to global ecological problems&quot;.

==Health impacts==

Studies conducted by scientists from Berlin and Kurchatov took blood samples from forty different families who lived in a district of Kazakhstan that were directly exposed at high levels to fallout from the Soviet bomb tests. These studies concluded that individuals who had been exposed to the fallout between 1949 and 1956 had an approximate 80% increase of mutations in the minisatellite regions of their DNA. The children of these individuals had 50% more mutations in their minisatellite regions compared to their control counterparts.

Some health scientists are still not sure what the germline mutations mean for the individuals&#x27; health, but there is increasing evidence these mutations may increase genetic predisposition to certain diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. There has also been evidence that increased levels of DNA mutation rates are correlated with prolonged
radiation exposure.

A longitudinal study conducted over a 40-year span found a correlation between radiation fallout exposure and prevalence of solid tumors. The most frequent sites for solid tumors were the esophagus, stomach, lungs, breasts, and liver. These sites were found to have statistically significant increases in prevalence when compared to a control group. However some bodily sites had no significant difference in number: cervix uteri, kidney, rectum, and pancreas. The study&#x27;s data suggests that there is a link between exposure length, and amount, to overall and cancer mortality. Nonetheless the relationship between the level of radiation exposure and effect is still up for discussion.

The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities. The general consensus of health studies conducted at the site since it was closed is that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing had a direct impact on the health of about 200,000 local residents. Specifically, scientists have linked higher rates of different types of cancer to post-irradiation effects. Likewise, several studies have explored the correlation between radiation exposure and thyroid abnormalities.
A BBC programme claimed in 2010 that in the worst affected locations one in twenty children born were with genetic defects. British film-maker Antony Butts documented some of the genetic health impacts in his 2010 film &quot;After the Apocalypse&quot;.

A recently declassified CIA report provides a first-hand witness account of the immediate impacts of a nuclear test near Semipalatinsk in 1955. In this report, a source who was in the vicinity of a Soviet thermonuclear test in November 1955 describes experiencing loss of hearing, &quot;the air... crackling up with pressure&quot; as if the &quot;air was tearing up&quot;, and the ground shaking.

Ethnographic data from anthropological study detail some of the unique perspectives of those populations that are affected and still live within the area of radiation exposure that allow those populations to understand their circumstances and the biological subjectivity of concepts like safety and their survival within an area still affected by radiation.

The nation of Kazakhstan recognizes more than a million of their citizens as victims of Soviet-era radiation exposure. In one village adjacent to the test site, categorized as &quot;minimal risk&quot;, the Kazakh government allots each resident a one time lump sum roughly equivalent to $50 USD. 

===Perception of adaptation to radiation===
Although there are clear biological impacts of the radiation exposure, the surrounding communities rarely have a sense of nuclear victimization. Although their health is negatively impacted by the radiation, residents see themselves as resilient. Many believe that they have genetically adapted to survive the radiation and report that they have come to rely upon it. One villager claimed that &quot;Our organism is different... now accustomed to radiation. For many years we were exposed to radioactive fallout, and now we eat it. Slowly and quietly, our bodies got used to it. Why do you think people don&#x27;t die [here], but only get a little sick?... Most of us can&#x27;t live in clean air—we need radiation to survive. Clean air is our death. We are not deformed, just a little sick.&quot; In the same manner, many within the village self-report that when they venture outside the area for supplies, they suffer symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and stomach cramps, furthering the thought that they have come to rely on the radiation to live. Overall, residents have embraced the radiation as a sign of their own genetic adaptation.

According to fieldwork in Koyan, with a population of 50, Koyaners have high rates of &quot;anemia, cancer, hypertension, headaches, skin rashes, and bone pain&quot; along with self-reported hair loss, nosebleeds, and cataracts. While unhealthy, Stawkowski noted that there was an absence of &quot;serious and life-threatening deformities&quot; that are portrayed, in media and by doctors, to be prevalent in people exposed to long-term and low-dose radiation. Examples of the mutations that could be found in Koyaners included &quot;a man born with webbed feet, a woman with one slightly short thumb, and several people living with vitiligo&quot; The nature of these mutations, coupled with the fact that villagers experienced aggravated symptoms upon leaving Koyan, Koyaners insist that they have biologically adapted to and subsequently rely on the radiation. To Koyaners, the prevalence of maladapted animals emphasized their resilience and further proved the success of their own adaptations. As one Koyaner said, &quot;the radiation exposure made everyone &#x27;a little sick&#x27;, ... but they have survived and live long lives.&quot;

==Site of the signing of the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone treaty==
Semipalatinsk was the site that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan chose for the signing of the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone on 8 September 2006, also commemorating the 15th anniversary of the test site&#x27;s closing.

==In popular culture==
The 2014 Russian film &quot;Test&quot; is a fictionalized account of the first Soviet nuclear test from the perspective of some of the local inhabitants.

The Dead Lake by Hamid Ismailov explores the effects of the nuclear tests on Kazakhs.

<text>WUCW (channel 23) is a television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving the Twin Cities area as an affiliate of The CW. Owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station maintains studios in the Pence Building on 8th Street and Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, and its transmitter is located at the Telefarm site in Shoreview.

Channel 23 was established as KTMA in 1982, airing a mix of commercial and subscription television programming; three years later, it became a full-time independent station. During this period, it became famous for originating the cult cable television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, which began as a locally produced program. After going into bankruptcy in 1989, channel 23 was bought and repositioned as a family-oriented station, KLGT, which affiliated with The WB upon its 1995 launch. Sinclair purchased channel 23 in 1998 and changed the call letters to KMWB; it became WUCW upon the merger of The WB and UPN in 2006.

==History==
===The subscription television years===

On April 16, 1966, Viking Television, Inc., a company organized by South St. Paul attorney and judge Irving W. Beaudoin, filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a new television station on channel 23 in Minneapolis. It was designated for hearing alongside a competing application from the Calvary Temple Evangelistic Association in late 1968; the church pulled out of the proceedings, and the Viking application was granted on November 24, 1969.

Little progress was made toward the construction of the station, which took the call letters KTMA-TV. In 1972, Viking presented a proposal for a studio and transmitter complex in Shoreview. However, residents feared the erection of a fourth mast in town after the collapse of a tower under construction killed seven workers the year before, and Ramsey County acquired the land for a park and nature center, creating a potential conflict of land uses. The loss of the site would further set back construction.

The prospect of subscription television had been thought of as early as the 1969 grant, when Viking held the local franchise to use the Phonevision system. However, a new generation of STV interests emerged in the mid-1970s. Viking signed a contract with American Subscription Television (SelecTV) and filed for subscription television authorization in October 1975.

Viking was still mired in tower site problems in 1976, when a second group filed to propose a subscription television station in the Twin Cities: Buford Television of Tyler, Texas, which applied for channel 29, only for a second application from Faith Broadcasting Network to compete against it. Meanwhile, Viking filed in March 1978 to sell the construction permit to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation; Metropolitan was in turn 20 percent owned by Universal Subscription Television, a subsidiary of Canadian media company CanWest Capital Corporation. This application was dismissed on June 22, 1979.

Viking had objected to Buford&#x27;s channel 29 application when it was filed, but in February 1980, Beaudoin sold 80 percent of the KTMA construction permit to Buford for $475,000 in construction costs, which in turn cleared the way for Faith Broadcasting Network to build channel 29. However, tower siting woes continued to snarl channel 23&#x27;s attempts to get on air. The FCC in the late 1960s had required that the VHF television stations give room to new UHF stations that wished to broadcast from Shoreview, and KMSP-TV&#x27;s mast was supposed to accommodate channel 23 and channel 29. However, when KSTP-TV obtained permission for a height extension to its tower (which also held WCCO-TV), only the KMSP tower was left out because it could not be extended with the UHF stations on it. This prompted KMSP-TV to rescind the agreement, resulting in legal action.

It was only the resolution of the tower site issue that got the ball rolling for KTMA. More than 16 years after the permit was granted, channel 23 began broadcasting on September 22, 1982. In addition to advertiser-supported programs, KTMA carried Spectrum, the subscription service owned by Buford&#x27;s Home Entertainment Network (HEN) division. The new service quickly secured valuable programming when it struck a deal to televise Minnesota Twins baseball and Minnesota North Stars hockey home games: the entire North Stars home slate and 50 Twins home games, packaged as &quot;Spectrum Sports&quot;—available for $19.95 a month or $29.90 along with the Spectrum movie service. The same year Buford launched KTMA, it sold a majority stake in HEN to United Cable.

At its peak, in May 1983, the service attracted 27,000 Twin Cities subscribers, making it the most successful of United Cable&#x27;s three STV operations. Even then, United Cable was laying off 55 staff, cutting costs, and considering outsourcing its movie programming to Oak Industries (owners of ON TV). That summer, United agreed to buy Buford&#x27;s 80 percent ownership of KTMA for $7.5 million while also writing down the Home Entertainment Network division and putting the three STV systems on the market.

As a sports service, Spectrum in the Twin Cities never reached the intended subscriber figures, prompting profits to fall far short of expectations for the Twins. Further, a federal judge had ruled against the Twins and North Stars pooling their broadcast rights in the Spectrum deal after WCCO-TV sued on antitrust charges. (Sports telecasts continued while the case was being appealed; after Spectrum&#x27;s demise, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found in the teams&#x27; favor.) In August 1985, the Twins and North Stars opted not to renew their Spectrum rights deal, a decision that sounded the death knell for the service, already down to just 13,000 subscribers. The movie service ended September 29, 1985, while Spectrum Sports concluded with the final game of the Twins season on October 6.

===Independent KTMA===
KTMA, still on the market when Spectrum closed, adopted a format of music videos programmed by local radio station KTWN. K-Twin Communications, owner of KTWN, made an $11 million offer to United Cable to purchase channel 23 outright. United rejected the bid and was reported to have accepted a $12 million offer from an Atlanta-based group. In the end, KTMA-TV Acquisition Corporation, owned by general manager Donald H. O&#x27;Connor, bought the entirety of the station—including Beaudoin&#x27;s stake—for $13.8 million. O&#x27;Connor purchased another $2.5 million in equipment and changed KTMA to a more traditional general entertainment station, acquiring a number of older syndicated programs such as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot;. A late 1986 billboard campaign centered around &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot; ended prematurely after the station received a dozen complaints over the slogan &quot;features that will scare you to death&quot;. The majority of complaints over the billboard came from Farmington, where their city council also lodged a complaint to KTMA. One programming tradition began on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1986: &quot;TV23&#x27;s 23rd Annual New Year&#x27;s Eve Extravaganza&quot;, a live comedy special emceed by station stagehand Kevin Murphy as &quot;Bob Bagadonuts&quot; culminating with a melon drop at midnight from the station&#x27;s rooftop; this special was revisited in 1987, 1988 and 1989.

Despite a major $1.2 million marketing campaign at the relaunch, after the station was acquired, the station was only moderately successful at attracting viewers and revenue from commercial advertising. By February 1988, KTMA&#x27;s ratings were still only half that of KITN-TV, which had become the Twin Cities area&#x27;s other major UHF independent. The first signs of financial trouble also occurred that year: KTMA had to temporarily stop carrying some programs in August because it needed to refinance to pay its syndicators in a timely fashion. That same year, attempts were made at creating locally produced shows: to fill a hole in the Saturday night line-up, the station created &quot;Saturday Night at Ringside&quot;, a multi-hour block of professional wrestling programming hosted by Mick Karch, and a late-night talk show, &quot;Sports Week with Stretch and Z&quot;, also was created.

Late 1988 brought two debuts, one ambitious and one low-key. On December 14, 1988, O&#x27;Connor announced the formation of the Minnesota Independent Network, which would unite KTMA with KXLI channel 41 in St. Cloud and KXLT-TV channel 47 in Rochester; low-power TV stations owned by Red River TV in Bemidji (K26AC), Brainerd, and Grand Rapids; and several additional low-power stations to be leased or built at Alexandria, Donnelly/Herman, Park Rapids, and Austin. The St. Cloud station was also slated under the proposal to move its tower northwest toward Sauk Centre and change to channel 19. The Minnesota Independent Network would give KTMA and KXLI the regional circulation necessary to compete with other Twin Cities-market stations for viewers and programming rights. Further, KTMA would become KMIN.

The other debut came with less bombast but cemented KTMA&#x27;s place in popular culture. As production manager Jim Mallon sought to fill a gap in the Sunday night line-up, he talked to his contacts in the local comedy community and ended up meeting Joel Hodgson, who had a warehouse in the same building as office space Mallon was using at the time. After a successful lunch meeting with Mallon to produce a new locally produced program for KTMA, Hodgson created &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (also known under the abbreviated title &quot;MST3K&quot;), which began in November 1988. The show quickly attracted the involvement of Kevin Murphy, who had been an associate of Mallon dating back to his horror film project &quot;Blood Hook&quot;, performing multiple tasks from camera operator to show writer to set builder. Hodgson recruited local comedians Josh Weinstein and Trace Beaulieu as his co-stars; owing to the show&#x27;s low budget, Weinstein and Beaulieu were only paid $25 per episode. A phone line Mallon established specifically for MST3K viewers netted such a favorable response that KTMA increased their show order from 13 episodes to 21. Unlike all future iterations of the show, the jokes provided by Hodgson and company during the course of a movie were ad libbed with a production cycle of less than 24 hours.

As &quot;MST3K&quot; grew, the Minnesota Independent Network collapsed. At the start of July 1989, O&#x27;Connor told a St. Cloud radio station that KTMA and the owner of KXLI and KXLT (which had gone silent awaiting the network&#x27;s launch) had &quot;bigger fish to fry&quot; and blamed the complexity of the arrangement for scuttling the plan. The nature of his remarks was explained at the end of the month, when the station filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with O&#x27;Connor noting that KTMA had been undercapitalized from the moment he had purchased it. Presaging the fate of &quot;MST3K&quot; in the years to come, KTMA ended production of the show after the June 1, 1989, season finale; the second issue of the show&#x27;s fan club newsletter included a direct appeal to KTMA to reconsider. Hodgson and Mallon purchased &quot;MST3K&quot;&#x27;s intellectual property under the production company Best Brains, Inc., along with a new studio in Eden Prairie. The Comedy Channel—recently established as an extension of HBO by Time Inc.—picked up the program as part of a $50 million launch campaign. &quot;MST3K&quot; ran on the network, later renamed Comedy Central, for seven years before moving to the Sci-Fi Channel for its final three seasons from 1997 to 1999.

Despite the failure of MIN to emerge, KTMA showed up in St. Cloud and Rochester anyway when new owners of KXLI and KXLT opted to simulcast channel 23 after returning to the air in 1990. The station, however, remained in bankruptcy for more than two years. Even during bankruptcy, the station moved from its original studios on Kennedy Street to a facility on Como Avenue as 1989 ended. It was not until the fall of 1991 that two groups emerged seeking to buy the station out of Chapter 11, at the same time that the court-appointed trustee fired O&#x27;Connor in a cost-cutting effort. The successful bidder, Lakeland Group Television, was headed by Linda Rios Brook, who had resigned from her position as general manager of KARE—reportedly over her conservative religious beliefs—and planned to reposition the station with Christian programs.

===Seeing the &quot;Sonlight&quot;===
After plans to use the KSON call letters fell through, the station relaunched as KLGT, a family- and Christian-oriented independent, in March 1992.

After the new format achieved low ratings, Rios Brook changed tack in late 1993. The dove that had formed part of the logo was dropped, and the format was shifted. KLGT picked up a package of 14 Twins games previously aired by KITN in 1994; they had been jettisoned by channel 29 due to increasing commitments to Fox network programming. Later that year, channel 23 added games from the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves. The sports expansion was the first in a series of moves that boosted channel 23&#x27;s visibility. On January 11, 1995, KLGT became a launch affiliate of The WB; it simultaneously debuted a unique news experiment, &quot;News of Your Choice&quot;, in partnership with WCCO-TV. (A trial run had taken place the previous August.) That station produced a second 10 p.m. newscast featuring an alternate mix of stories for channel 23 and encouraged viewers to switch between the two programs; the program was dropped at the end of the year in response to a collapse in ratings for WCCO&#x27;s newscasts.

===KMWB and WUCW===

In late 1997, Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into a deal to purchase KLGT for $52.5 million—a far cry from the $3.3 million spent to acquire it six years prior. The call letters were changed in November 1998 to KMWB, reflecting the state and network affiliation. The Timberwolves continued on channel 23 and KARE until they consolidated their over-the-air broadcasts with WFTC in 2001.

In 2006, The WB and UPN merged to create The CW. The UPN affiliate in the Twin Cities market, WFTC, was owned by Fox Television Stations; none of its UPN affiliates were chosen for the network&#x27;s launch, and it set up MyNetworkTV for them and other stations that would not join The CW. On May 2, 2006, Sinclair Broadcast Group signed an affiliation agreement with The CW for the company&#x27;s eight WB affiliates, including KMWB, to join the network. In preparation for the affiliation switch, KMWB changed its call sign to WUCW, planning to market itself as &quot;Your CW&quot;; as Minneapolis and St. Paul are on the line separating west &quot;K&quot; and east &quot;W&quot; calls, the station was able to switch to a &quot;W&quot;-prefixed call.

In January 2018, WUCW moved out of its longtime Como Avenue studios, which had been built for Twin Cities Public Television in 1960, and moved to the 7th floor of the Pence Building at 800 Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. The studios were then sold to the Minnesota State Fair.

WUCW served as the over-the-air home of Minnesota United FC in 2021 and 2022. In the first season, the station was scheduled to air 19 matches, all simulcasts from Bally Sports North.

In order to accommodate scheduling conflicts on Bally Sports North, WUCW aired five Minnesota Timberwolves games in April and May 2021 under the branding &quot;Bally Sports Extra on The CW Twin Cities&quot;. In April 2022, WUCW aired two Minnesota Twins games and a Minnesota Wild game.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Twin Cities television stations:

On August 16, 2023, WUCW became the ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) host station for the Twin Cities.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUCW (like most Sinclair-owned television stations) ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 23, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22.

As part of the SAFER Act, WUCW kept its analog signal on the air for 30 days to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

===Translators=== 
The broadcast signal of WUCW is also extended by way of six digital translators, owned by local translator associations, in central and southern Minnesota:

* Alexandria: 
* Frost: 
* Jackson: 
* St. James: 
* Walker: (main subchannel only)
* Willmar:

<text>The Cardenas Medal was an award approved by an act of Congress of the United States on May 3, 1900 (31 Stat. 716, 56th Congress). The award recognizes the crew of the , who showed gallantry in action at the Battle of Cárdenas during the Spanish–American War.

The statute awarding the medal is listed as follows:

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in recognition of the gallantry of First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding the revenue cutter Hudson, his officers and the men of his command, for their intrepid and heroic gallantry in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, on the eleventh day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, when the Hudson rescued the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow in the face of a most galling fire from the enemy&#x27;s guns, the Winslow being disabled, her captain wounded, her only other officer and half her crew killed. The commander of the Hudson kept his vessel in the very center of the hottest fire of the action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the shallow water, until finally he got a line made fast to the Winslow and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy&#x27;s guns. In commemoration of this signal act of heroism it is hereby enacted that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized and directed to cause to be and to present to First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, Revenue-Cutter Service, a gold medal, and to each of his officers a silver medal, and to each member of his crew a bronze medal.

==Appearance==
One medal was struck in gold for Newcomb, four in silver for the officers and 17 in bronze for the men of &quot;Hudson&quot;. The medal was designed by Charles E. Barber. The obverse of the medal depicts Victory wearing a winged cap. In her right hand she holds a sword and in her left an olive branch. In the background is the scene of &quot;Hudson&quot; tying up to the &quot;Winslow&quot;. At the bottom is the inscription &quot;CARDENAS MAY 11, 1898&quot;.

The reverse of the medal bears the inscription in eleven lines: &quot;JOINT RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS APPROVED MAY 3, 1900. IN RECOGNITION OF THE GALLANTRY OF THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE HUDSON WHO IN THE FACE OF GALLING FIRE TOWED THE WINSLOW OUT OF RANGE OF THE ENEMY&#x27;S GUNS.&quot; To the right of the inscription is a nude female figure holding a chisel and hammer, to the left is a palm leaf and laurel branch. At the bottom is a tablet flanked by laurels where recipients&#x27; names are engraved.

The medal was originally struck as a non-wearable table top medal. It was also accompanied by a wearable medal. Both medals were struck by the U.S. Mint in 1902. The Cardenas Medal of Honor appears in regulations on order of wear as late as 1930.

<text>The Cincinnati Post was an afternoon daily newspaper published in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. In Northern Kentucky, it was bundled inside a local edition called The Kentucky Post.

The &quot;Post&quot; was a founding publication and onetime flagship of Scripps-Howard Newspapers, a division of the E. W. Scripps Company. For much of its history, the &quot;Post&quot; was the most widely read paper in the Cincinnati market. Its readership was concentrated on the West Side of Cincinnati, as well as in Northern Kentucky, where it was considered the newspaper of record.

The &quot;Post&quot; began publishing in 1881 and launched its Northern Kentucky edition in 1890. It acquired &quot;The Cincinnati Times-Star&quot; in 1958. The &quot;Post&quot; ceased publication at the end of 2007, after 30 years in a joint operating agreement with &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;.

==Content==
The &quot;Post&quot; was known throughout its history for investigative journalism and focus on local coverage, characteristics common to Scripps papers. As one of the first successful penny presses outside the East Coast, the &quot;Post&quot; was written primarily for blue collar laborers who had no time to read a newspaper in the morning. Its articles were written to be easily readable. In its heyday, the paper consistently championed good governance and labor rights.

Though the &quot;Post&quot; considered itself politically independent, it historically tended to support progressive politicians relative to the &quot;Times-Star&quot; and &quot;Enquirer&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s editorial position became uniformly conservative in the years following its merger with the &quot;Times-Star&quot;, according to Stevens (1969). By the early 1990s, the paper&#x27;s political stance had become &quot;a grumpily conservative sigh of resentment&quot; according to journalist William Greider.

==Schedule==
The &quot;Post&quot; published regular editions on weekday afternoons and a &quot;Weekender&quot; edition on Saturday mornings. In keeping with Scripps tradition, the &quot;Post&quot; did not publish on Sundays for most of its history. However, it did publish a Sunday edition from November 30, 1924, to December 18, 1932. The &quot;Post&quot; published on schedule from its founding as &quot;The Penny Paper&quot; in 1881 until 1967. From October 30 to November 2, 1967, 300 Newspaper Guild members struck along with Pressmen and Stereotypers, while Printers were locked out.

==History==

===Early years===
The &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; began on January 3, 1881, as &quot;The Penny Paper&quot;, published from a second floor office at Vine and Longworth streets. The publishers, Walter E. Wellman and his brother Frank, hoped to emulate the success of the Cleveland &quot;Penny Press&quot;. By March, they ran out of funds and took an investment from James E. Scripps and half-brother Edward Willis Scripps, who ran the &quot;Penny Press&quot;. They used the funds to purchase a press and move the paper to larger facility on Home Street. In October, Walter Wellman was framed for blackmail in retaliation for exposés of policy racketeers and the police. Wellman fled to Kentucky, where he was unlikely to face extradition, and left the Scripps brothers in charge of operations at &quot;the blackmailing sheet&quot;.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; called &quot;The Penny Paper&quot; &quot;a fair success&quot; in its first year, estimating the upstart&#x27;s circulation at about 6,000, fifth in a market served by seven papers in English and five in German. E. W. Scripps estimated daily circulation at 7,000 in the city and 6,000 in the countryside, before countryside distribution was discontinued to save money.

With an editorial staff that leaned Republican and included a former minister, &quot;The Penny Paper&quot; was seen as &quot;the spokesman and the organ of the religious element of the community&quot;, according to Scripps. When in 1882 the &quot;Boy Preacher&quot; Rev. Thomas Harrison held 13 weeks of camp meetings in Cincinnati, &quot;the boy preacher and the little &quot;Penny [Paper]&quot; were vying with each other and cooperating with each other in the way of saving souls.&quot; The paper&#x27;s circulation quickly quadrupled.

On February 11, 1883, the paper was given a more distinctive name, &quot;The Penny Post&quot;, because &quot;Penny Paper&quot; was &quot;more of a description of the paper than a name&quot;. In July, the Scripps family assumed full ownership of the company, with E. W. having a controlling interest. It was the first paper that he had ever owned. It became &quot;The Evening Post&quot; on October 11, 1883 though the price would remain at one penny until 1918. On September 2, 1890, it was finally renamed &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;. On September 15, a Kentucky edition debuted with coverage of Covington, Newport, Bellevue, Dayton, and Ludlow by a dedicated staff in Covington. One year later, Scripps renamed it &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot; and began distributing it as a full-fledged publication wrapped around the Cincinnati paper at no additional charge. &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot; soon put its sole rival, &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;, out of business. By the time the local typographical union debuted its own penny paper, the &quot;News&quot;, in 1894, the &quot;Post&quot; had added such thorough coverage of labor relations that the &quot;News&quot; folded within two months.

In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League in recognition of &quot;Post&quot; general manager Milton A. McRae, a longtime partner. By 1903, the &quot;Post&quot; boasted of leading all Cincinnati dailies with a sworn daily average circulation of 146,884.

===Crusader for reform===
From its founding to 1930, the &quot;Post&quot; crusaded against bossism, aligning with the Democratic Party locally. In 1883, it launched a campaign against Thomas C. Campbell, a notorious jury fixer. Campbell responded by suing the paper for libel in front of a partially fixed jury. Amid threats from the Cox machine, the &quot;Post&quot; hired bodyguards for its editors and managers. Boss Campbell&#x27;s regime ended with the courthouse riots of 1884. In 1889, the &quot;Post&quot; put the &quot;Cincinnati Telegram&quot;, an afternoon competitor once run by Campbell, out of business by secretly financing its unsuccessful move to morning publication. In 1904 and 1905, the &quot;Post&quot; directed its fire against Campbell&#x27;s protégé, George B. Cox, exposing graft and lampooning his affiliates with the help of cartoonist Homer Davenport. The &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s afternoon competitor, the Taft-owned &quot;Times-Star&quot;, strongly supported Boss Cox.

In 1904, at President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s suggestion, the &quot;Post&quot; became the first newspaper in the country to endorse William Howard Taft for president in 1908. Corporate president Milton A. McRae had long been a supporter of the Cincinnati native, despite the Taft family owning the &quot;Times-Star&quot; and generally supporting the Cox machine. McRae secured the help of &quot;Times-Star&quot; editor Charles Phelps Taft in publicizing the editorial. The &quot;Post&quot; retracted its endorsement just before the 1908 election and by 1910 had resumed its attacks on President Taft and the Republican Party.

The &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s frequent reports of collusion would at times decimate advertising revenue. However, the paper always turned a profit because the exposés were immensely popular with readers. The &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s role in a 1905 Democratic mayoral victory led some advertisers to boycott the paper for up to a decade, and its valuation fell by half. The paper habitually refused advertisements attacking labor unions, such as those by Postum Cereals in 1905. In 1914, the &quot;Post&quot; weathered a severe drop in advertising after it exposed a scheme to extend the franchises of the local utilities and sided with striking streetcar workers. Still, disappointed that the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s advertising business always pressured the paper to moderate its investigative reporting, E. W. Scripps founded the Chicago &quot;Day Book&quot; in 1911 as an experimental daily paper entirely devoid of advertising. The &quot;Day Book&quot; folded in 1917.

In 1924, the &quot;Post&quot; was the only Cincinnati daily that endorsed a new municipal charter based on the council–manager system, nonpartisan elections, and proportional representation. The enactment of this charter the following year propelled the Charter Committee to power and led to the demise of political machines in Cincinnati, ultimately dooming the Cincinnati Subway that was seen as a product of bossism. In 1936, the &quot;Post&quot; backed the nonpartisan movement as it expanded to the Hamilton County government. In 1947, the &quot;Post&quot; successfully defended the proportional representation system against a campaign by Charles P. Taft to repeal it.

===Consolidation===
On October 1, 1935, the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s corporate parent, Scripps-Howard Newspapers, entered the radio business by purchasing AM station WFBE 1230. The callsign was changed to WCPO, for &quot;The Voice of the Cincinnati Post&quot;, and the station switched to a news radio format. Initially, the station&#x27;s main studios were located in David Sinton&#x27;s hotel, while news bulletins originated from a broom closet adjacent to the &quot;Post&quot; city room. WCPO-TV signed on the air on July 26, 1949.

By the late 1940s, sales of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, Cincinnati&#x27;s remaining morning daily, had increased dramatically, fueled in part by the success of its Sunday morning monopoly; meanwhile, the &quot;Post&quot; and especially &quot;The Cincinnati Times-Star&quot; faced a declining afternoon market. In 1948 and 1949, lawyers for Scripps-Howard and The Times-Star Company discussed the possibility of jointly publishing a Sunday morning edition called the &quot;Times-Post&quot;. The two companies determined that they would be safe from Sherman Act investigations, which were rare in the newspaper industry; however, they eventually scrapped the idea for fear that the &quot;Enquirer&quot; would sue them for any losses. Another factor was the difficulty of establishing a Sunday carrier system.

On April 26, 1956, Scripps-Howard purchased a 36.5% controlling interest in the &quot;Enquirer&quot; for $4,059,000, beating out The Times-Star Company&#x27;s $2,380,051 and Tribune Publishing&#x27;s $15 per share, or $2,238,000. Then, on July 20, 1958, Scripps also acquired the &quot;Times-Star&quot;, merging the afternoon paper with the &quot;Post&quot;. Only three &quot;Times-Star&quot; reporters were retained. The combined paper operated out of the Cincinnati Times-Star Building, noted for its Art Deco architecture. The paper would be published under the name &quot;The Cincinnati Post and Times-Star&quot; until December 31, 1974, when it reverted to &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;.

&quot;Post&quot; circulation peaked in 1961. Combined &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Post&quot; circulation was 275,000, including nearly 60,000 for the Kentucky edition alone. In 1968, the &quot;Post&quot; had 50,000 more daily subscriptions than the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. In the 1960s, the &quot;Kentucky Post&quot; dominated the newspaper market in 12 Kentucky counties: Bracken, Boone, Campbell, Carroll, Gallatin, Grant, Harrison, Kenton, Mason, Owen, Pendleton, and Robertson.

With the &quot;Times-Star&quot; and &quot;Enquirer&quot; acquisitions, the Scripps family owned all of Cincinnati&#x27;s dailies, along with WCPO-AM, WCPO-FM, and WCPO-TV, which consistently led local television ratings with Al Schottelkotte&#x27;s news reports. The E. W. Scripps Company operated the &quot;Enquirer&quot; at arm&#x27;s length, even omitting the Scripps lighthouse logo from the &quot;Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s nameplate. Nevertheless, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against the company in 1964. In 1968, Scripps entered into a consent decree to sell the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. It was sold to Carl Lindner, Jr.&#x27;s American Financial Corporation on February 20, 1971.

===Joint operating agreement===
On September 22, 1977, the &quot;Post&quot; signed a joint operating agreement (JOA) with &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. For two years, the &quot;Post&quot; had secretly negotiated the terms of the JOA with the &quot;Enquirer&quot; while securing concessions from labor unions. The two papers petitioned the Justice Department for an antitrust exemption under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970. This was the second JOA application under the Newspaper Preservation Act; the first, involving the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; and &quot;Anchorage Times&quot;, was summarily approved but already seen as a failure.

At Justice Department hearings, the &quot;Post&quot; claimed to be the brink of financial failure, with losses over the previous six years totaling $12 million. Scripps-Howard argued that the JOA would preserve a second editorial voice in Cincinnati, a &quot;no-growth market&quot;. However, &quot;Post&quot; employees and suburban newspaper publishers accused the &quot;Post&quot; of producing artificial losses in an attempt to secure expected profits from a JOA. Scripps-Howard rejected an informal offer by Larry Flynt to help fund a takeover of the &quot;Post&quot; by its employees instead of signing the JOA. &quot;Post&quot; coverage of the proceedings was limited to a single Saturday article, in contrast to multiple reports published in the &quot;Enquirer&quot;.

The &quot;Enquirer&quot;–&quot;Post&quot; agreement was approved on November 26, 1979, taking effect after negotiations and legal battles with unions, including with 131 &quot;Post&quot; printers who had been guaranteed jobs for life. As the more financially sound paper, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; received an 80% stake in the business and handled all business functions of both papers, including printing, distribution, and selling advertising. The &quot;Post&quot; forwent Sunday publishing, a major advantage the &quot;Enquirer&quot; had over the &quot;Post&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; eliminated 500 of 600 jobs as a result of the agreement.

On April 10, 2000, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; downsized from a traditional broadsheet format to an format similar to Berliner. They also began publishing in color every day of the week. Gannett promoted the narrower format as being &quot;easier to handle, hold, and read&quot; but also cited reduced newsprint costs.

===Decline and closure===
In a pattern seen throughout the industry, the &quot;Post&quot; declined severely during the 30-year term of the JOA, particularly during the 1980s. In 1977, when the agreement was announced, the &quot;Post&quot; had a daily circulation of 195,000, more than the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, but by September 2003, the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s daily circulation had fallen to 42,219, or 23% of the &quot;Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s 182,176. By this time, the &quot;Post&quot; had shifted its focus to the Kentucky edition, and sister station WCPO-TV more often partnered with the &quot;Enquirer&quot; than with the &quot;Post&quot;.

In January 2004, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; informed the &quot;Post&quot; of its intention to let the JOA expire on December 31, 2007. That spring, the &quot;Post&quot; ended distribution in the northern suburbs in Butler and Warren counties to concentrate on Hamilton County and its Northern Kentucky edition. Also that year, political cartoonist Jeff Stahler left the &quot;Post&quot; for &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. In June 2005, the &quot;Post&quot; closed its Kentucky newsroom and announced early retirement offers to employees in advance of its probable closure. These changes resulted in profits of $23.5 million in 2005 and $20.7 million the following year.

In 2006, the &quot;Post&quot; ended its 115-year practice of bundling the &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; inside the &quot;Kentucky Post&quot;. By then, the Kentucky paper had eclipsed its Cincinnati counterpart in circulation, despite the &quot;Enquirer&quot; limiting distribution to certain parts of three Northern Kentucky counties. By 2007, the paper employed only 52 newsroom staff, while its circulation had declined to 27,000, an estimated four percent of local households. On July 17, parent company E. W. Scripps confirmed that both &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; and &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot; would cease publication on the day of the JOA&#x27;s expiration.

The &quot;Post&quot; published its final print edition on December 31, 2007. The commemorative &quot;Farewell Edition&quot; led with the headline &quot;-30-&quot;, meaning &quot;the end&quot; in newsroom jargon. About 30 &quot;Enquirer&quot; employees assigned to &quot;Post&quot; operations lost their jobs. At a farewell party in the &quot;Post&quot; newsroom, a band played for the first time the &quot;Cincinnati Post March&quot;, which was composed by John N. Klohr and Frank Simon in 1931 for the paper&#x27;s 50th anniversary. WCPO-TV replaced the &quot;Post&quot; as sponsor of the local qualification rounds of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

The &quot;Post&quot; came to an end due to a number of factors, including the end of the joint operating agreement, a 75% decrease in readership, and decreasing advertising revenues. By the paper&#x27;s closing, its circulation had fallen to about 25,000 on weekdays and 34,000 on Saturdays, versus the &quot;Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s 195,000 on weekdays and Saturdays and 280,000 on Sundays. However, some &quot;Post&quot; employees faulted the &quot;Enquirer&quot; for neglecting its partner, citing empty or outdated newsboxes and uncooperative subscription agents. A 2009 study attempted to measure the impact of the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s closure on the political process in Northern Kentucky, a traditional stronghold for the paper. It concluded that the closure caused an initial short-term decline in political competition and voter turnout, despite the &quot;Post&quot; having low circulation in its final years.

==Online presence==
On November 1, 1996, the &quot;Post&quot; launched its website, &quot;@The Post&quot;. Due to a joint operating agreement with the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, it launched concurrently with the &quot;Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s site, &quot;Enquirer.com&quot;. A shared website, &quot;GoCincinnati!&quot;, displayed classified advertising and offered dial-up Internet access subscriptions. Local access numbers were available in cities throughout the country through a network of Gannett publications. Both papers&#x27; home pages moved to a more memorable domain, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot;, on November 1, 1998. The new brand encompassed about 300 local commercial sites and some community organizations.

The day after the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s closure, Scripps launched KYPost.com as a Northern Kentucky news website to compete with &quot;Enquirer&quot; sister site NKY.com. A dedicated staff embedded in WCPO-TV&#x27;s newsroom supplemented content from WCPO.com. In 2009, the website had two staff members plus interns. In 2013, KYPost.com began redirecting visitors to WCPO.com.

Archives of &quot;Post&quot; articles can be found in online subscription databases. NewsBank contains &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Post&quot; articles from 1882 to 2007. Until its closure, HighBeam Research contained 313,031 &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; articles from 1996 to 2007.

<text>Used in mechanical watches and clocks, a barrel is a cylindrical metal box closed by a cover, with a ring of gear teeth around it, containing a spiral spring called the mainspring, which provides power to run the timepiece. The barrel turns on an arbor (axle). The spring is hooked to the barrel at its outer end and to the arbor at its inner end. The barrel teeth engage the first pinion of the wheel train of the watch, usually the center wheel. Barrels rotate slowly: for a watch mainspring barrel, the rate is usually one rotation every 8 hours. This construction allows the mainspring to be wound (by turning the arbour) without interrupting the tension of the spring driving the timepiece.

==Types==
; Plain barrel: I.e. without teeth, used in fusee watches and clocks. A chain, or cord, was wound around the plain barrel, connecting it to the fusee.
; Going barrel: The form used in modern watches, is wound by turning the arbor and drives the watch movement by a ring of teeth around the barrel. This enables the mainspring to continue running the watch while it is being wound. Invented by Jean-Antoine Lépine.
; Hanging barrel: A version of the going barrel that to save space is supported by the movement only at its upper end.
; Motor, or safety, barrel: Used in pocket watches around 1900, a reverse variant of the going barrel in which the spring is wound by turning the barrel, and turns the watch movement by the central arbor. The purpose of this arrangement was that if the spring breaks, destructive recoil forces would not be applied to the vulnerable gear train.

<text>Placoderms (from Ancient Greek πλάξ (&quot;plax&quot;, &quot;plakos&quot;) &#x27;plate&#x27; and δέρμα (&quot;derma&quot;) &#x27;skin&#x27;) are vertebrate animals of the class Placodermi, an extinct group of prehistoric fish known from Paleozoic fossils during the Silurian and the Devonian periods. While their endoskeletons are mainly cartilaginous, their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates (hence the name), and the rest of the body was scaled or naked depending on the species.

Placoderms were among the first jawed fish (their jaws likely evolved from the first pair of gill arches), as well as the first vertebrates to have true teeth. They were also the first fish clade to develop pelvic fins, the second set of paired fins and the homologous precursor to hindlimbs in tetrapods. 380-million-year-old fossils of three other genera, &quot;Incisoscutum&quot;, &quot;Materpiscis&quot; and &quot;Austroptyctodus&quot;, represent the oldest known examples of live birth.

Placoderms are thought to be paraphyletic, consisting of several distinct outgroups or sister taxa to all living jawed vertebrates, which originated among their ranks. In contrast, one 2016 analysis concluded that Placodermi is likely monophyletic.

The first identifiable placoderms appear in the fossil record during the late Llandovery epoch of the early Silurian. They eventually outcompeted the previously dominant marine arthropods (e.g. eurypterids) and cephalopod molluscs (e.g. orthocones), producing some of the first and most infamous vertebrate apex predators such as &quot;Eastmanosteus&quot;, &quot;Dinichthys&quot; and the massive &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;. Various groups of placoderms were diverse and abundant during the Devonian, but all placoderms became extinct at the end-Devonian Hangenberg event 358.9 million years ago, leaving the niches open for the osteichthyan and chondrichthyan survivors who subsequently radiated during the Carboniferous.

==Characteristics==
Many placoderms, particularly the Rhenanida, Petalichthyida, Phyllolepida, and Antiarchi, were bottom-dwellers. In particular, the antiarchs, with their highly modified, jointed bony pectoral fins, were highly successful inhabitants of Middle-Late Devonian freshwater and shallow marine habitats, with the Middle to Late Devonian genus, &quot;Bothriolepis&quot;, known from over 100 valid species. The vast majority of placoderms were predators, many of which lived at or near the substrate. Many, primarily the arthrodires, were active, nektonic predators that dwelled in the middle to upper portions of the water column. A study of the arthrodire &quot;Compagopiscis&quot; published in 2012 concluded that placoderms (at least this particular genus) likely possessed true teeth contrary to some early studies. The teeth had well defined pulp cavities and were made of both bone and dentine. However, the tooth and jaw development were not as closely integrated as in modern gnathostomes. These teeth were likely homologous to the teeth of other gnathostomes.

One of the largest known arthrodires, &quot;Dunkleosteus terrelli&quot;, was long, and is presumed to have had a large distribution, as its remains have been found in Europe, North America and possibly Morocco. Some paleontologists regard it as the world&#x27;s first vertebrate &quot;superpredator&quot;, preying upon other predators. Other, smaller arthrodires, such as &quot;Fallacosteus&quot; and &quot;Rolfosteus&quot;, both of the Gogo Formation of Western Australia, had streamlined, bullet-shaped head armor, and &quot;Amazichthys&quot;, with morphology like that of other fast-swimming pelagic organisms, strongly supporting the idea that many, if not most, arthrodires were active swimmers, rather than passive ambush-hunters whose armor practically anchored them to the sea floor. Some placoderms were herbivorous, such as the Middle to Late Devonian arthrodire &quot;Holonema&quot;, and some were planktivores, such as the gigantic arthrodire &quot;Titanichthys&quot;, various members of Homostiidae, and &quot;Heterosteus&quot;.

Extraordinary evidence of internal fertilization in a placoderm was afforded by the discovery in the Gogo Formation, near Fitzroy Crossing, Kimberley, Western Australia, of a small female placoderm, about in length, which died in the process of giving birth to a 6 cm ( in) offspring and was fossilized with the umbilical cord intact. The fossil, named &quot;Materpiscis attenboroughi&quot; (after scientist David Attenborough), had eggs which were fertilized internally, the mother providing nourishment to the embryo and giving birth to live young. With this discovery, the placoderm became the oldest vertebrate known to have given birth to live young (&quot;viviparous&quot;), pushing the date of first viviparity back some 200 million years earlier than had been previously known. Specimens of the arthrodire &quot;Incisoscutum ritchei&quot;, also from the Gogo Formation, have been found with embryos inside them indicating this group also had live bearing ability. The males reproduced by inserting a long clasper into the female. Elongated basipterygia are also found on the phyllolepid placoderms, such as &quot;Austrophyllolepis&quot; and &quot;Cowralepis&quot;, both from the Middle Devonian of Australia, suggesting that the basipterygia were used in copulation.

The placoderm claspers are not homologous with the claspers in cartilaginous fishes. The similarities between the structures has been revealed to be an example of convergent evolution. While the claspers in cartilaginous fishes are specialized parts of their paired pelvic fins that have been modified for copulation due to changes in the hox genes hoxd13, the origin of the mating organs in placoderms most likely relied on different sets of hox genes and were structures that developed further down the body as an extra and independent pair of appendages, but which during development turned into body parts used for reproduction only. Because they were not attached to the pelvic fins, as are the claspers in fish like sharks, they were much more flexible and could probably be rotated forward.

A study on &quot;Kolymaspis&quot; showcases that the vertebrate shoulder girdle evolved from gill arches.

==Evolution and extinction==


It was thought for a time that placoderms became extinct due to competition from the first bony fish and early sharks, given a combination of the supposed inherent superiority of bony fish and the presumed sluggishness of placoderms. With more accurate summaries of prehistoric organisms, it is now thought that they systematically died out as marine and freshwater ecologies suffered from the environmental catastrophes of the Late Devonian and end-Devonian extinctions.

===Fossil record===
The earliest identifiable placoderm fossils are of Chinese origin and date to the early Silurian. At that time, they were already differentiated into antiarchs and arthrodires, as well as other, more primitive, groups. Earlier fossils of basal placoderms have not yet been discovered.

The Silurian fossil record of the placoderms is both literally and figuratively fragmented. Until the discovery of &quot;Silurolepis&quot; (and then, the discoveries of &quot;Entelognathus&quot; and &quot;Qilinyu&quot;), Silurian-aged placoderm specimens consisted of fragments. Some of them have been tentatively identified as antiarch or arthrodire due to histological similarities; and many of them have not yet been formally described or even named. The most commonly cited example of a Silurian placoderm, &quot;Wangolepis&quot; of Silurian China and possibly Vietnam, is known only from a few fragments that currently defy attempts to place them in any of the recognized placoderm orders. So far, only three officially described Silurian placoderms are known from more than scraps:
* the basal antiarch &quot;Silurolepis&quot;, from the Ludlow epoch of Yunnan, China, known from an almost complete thoracic armor
* &quot;Entelognathus&quot;, a placoderm &quot;incertae sedis&quot; that combines features of primitive arthrodires with jaw anatomy otherwise only seen in bony fish and tetrapods.
* &quot;Qilinyu&quot;, a close relative of &quot;Entelognathus&quot; that further links &quot;Entelognathus&quot; as a transitional form between placoderms and other stem-gnathostomes and crown-group gnathostomes.

The first officially described Silurian placoderm is an antiarch, &quot;Shimenolepis&quot;, which is known from distinctively ornamented plates from Hunan, China. It was originally considered to be from the late Llandovery, although later study reconsidered its age at Ludfordian. &quot;Shimenolepis&quot; plates are very similar to the early Devonian yunnanolepid &quot;Zhanjilepis&quot;, also known from distinctively ornamented plates. In 2022, &quot;Xiushanosteus&quot; is described from complete fossils from Telychian, late Llandovery of Chongqing, China.

Paleontologists and placoderm specialists suspect that the scarcity of placoderms in the Silurian fossil record is due to placoderms&#x27; living in environments unconducive to fossil preservation, rather than a genuine scarcity. This hypothesis helps to explain the placoderms&#x27; seemingly instantaneous appearance and diversity at the very beginning of the Devonian.

During the Devonian, placoderms went on to inhabit and dominate almost all known aquatic ecosystems, both freshwater and saltwater. But this diversity ultimately suffered many casualties during the extinction event at the Frasnian–Famennian boundary, the Late Devonian extinctions. The remaining species then died out during the end-Devonian extinction; not a single placoderm species has been confirmed to have survived into the Carboniferous.

===History of study===
The earliest studies of placoderms were published by Louis Agassiz, in his five volumes on fossil fishes, 1833–1843. In those days, placoderms were thought to be shelled jawless fish akin to ostracoderms. Some naturalists even suggested that they were shelled invertebrates or even turtle-like vertebrates.

In the late 1920s, Dr. Erik Stensiö, at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, established the details of placoderm anatomy and identified them as true jawed fishes related to sharks. He took fossil specimens with well-preserved skulls and ground them away, one tenth of a millimeter at a time. After each layer had been removed, he made an imprint of the next surface in wax. Once the specimens had been completely ground away (and so destroyed), he made enlarged, three-dimensional models of the skulls to examine the anatomical details more thoroughly. Many other placoderm specialists thought that Stensiö was trying to shoehorn placoderms into a relationship with sharks; however, as more fossils were found, placoderms were accepted as a sister group of chondrichthyans.

Much later, the exquisitely preserved placoderm fossils from Gogo reef changed the picture again. They showed that placoderms shared anatomical features not only with chondrichthyans but with other gnathostome groups as well. For example, Gogo placoderms show separate bones for the nasal capsules as in gnathostomes; in both sharks and bony fish those bones are incorporated into the braincase.

Placoderms also share certain anatomical features only with the jawless osteostracans; because of this, the theory that placoderms are the sister group of chondrichthyans has been replaced by the theory that placoderms are a group of basal gnathostomes.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Currently, Placodermi are divided into eight recognized orders. There are two further controversial orders: One is the monotypic Stensioellida, containing the enigmatic &quot;Stensioella&quot;; the other is the equally enigmatic Pseudopetalichthyida. These orders are considered to be basal or primitive groups within Placodermi, though their precise placement within the class remains unsure. Fossils of both are currently known only from the Hunsruck lagerstatten.

===Placoderm orders===
====Arthrodira====

Arthrodira (&quot;jointed neck&quot;) were the most diverse and numerically successful of the placoderm orders, occupying roles from giant apex predators to detritus-nibbling bottom dwellers. They had a movable joint between armour surrounding the head and body. As the lower jaw moved down, the head shield moved, allowing for a larger opening. All arthrodires, save for &quot;Compagopiscis&quot;, lacked teeth, and used instead the sharpened edges of a bony plate, termed a &quot;tooth plate,&quot; as a biting surface (&quot;Compagopiscis&quot; had true teeth in addition to tooth plates). The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some ichthyosaurs. Early arthrodires, such as the genus &quot;Arctolepis&quot;, were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;, was a true &quot;superpredator&quot; of the latest Devonian period, reaching 3 to as much as 8 metres in length. In contrast, the long-nosed &quot;Rolfosteus&quot; measured just 15 cm. Fossils of &quot;Incisoscutum&quot; have been found containing unborn fetuses, indicating that arthrodires gave birth to live young.

====Antiarchi====

Antiarchi (&quot;opposite anus&quot;) were the second most successful order of placoderms known, after the Arthrodira. The order&#x27;s name was coined by Edward Drinker Cope, who, after incorrectly identifying the first fossils as being those of an armored tunicate, mistakenly thought the eye-hole was the mouth, and the opening for the anal siphon was on the other side of the body, as opposed to having both oral and anal siphons together at one end. The front portions of their bodies were heavily armoured, to the point of literally resembling a box with eyes, with the sometimes scaled, sometimes naked rear portions often becoming , particularly with later forms. The pair of pectoral fins were modified into a pair of caliper-like, or arthropod-like limbs. In primitive forms, such as &quot;Yunnanolepis&quot;, the limbs were thick and short, while in advanced forms, such as &quot;Bothriolepis&quot;, the limbs were long and had elbow-like joints. The function of the limbs is still not perfectly understood, but most hypothesize that they helped their owners pull themselves across the substrate, as well as allowing their owners to bury themselves into the substrate.

====Brindabellaspida====

&quot;Brindabellaspis&quot; (&quot;Brindabella&#x27;s shield&quot;) was a long-snouted placoderm from the Early Devonian. When it was first discovered in 1980, it was originally regarded as a weejasperaspid acanthothoracid due to anatomical similarities with the other species found at the same locality. According to Philippe Janvier, anatomical similarities in the brain of &quot;Brindabellaspis stensioi&quot; and the brain of a jawless fish suggest it is a basal placoderm closest to the ancestral placoderm. Various Early to Middle Devonian placoderm &quot;incertae sedis&quot; have also been inserted in the order.

====Phyllolepida====

Phyllolepida (&quot;leaf scales&quot;) were flattened placoderms found throughout the world. Like other flattened placoderms they were bottom-dwelling predators that ambushed prey. Unlike other flattened placoderms, they were freshwater fish. Their armour was made of whole plates, rather than the numerous tubercles and scales of Petalichthyida. The eyes were on the sides of the head, unlike visual bottom-dwelling predators, such as stargazers or flatfish, which have eyes on the top of their head. The orbits for the eyes were extremely small, suggesting the eyes were vestigial and that the phyllolepids may have been blind.

====Ptyctodontida====

Ptyctodontida (&quot;folded teeth&quot;) were lightly armoured placoderms with big heads, big eyes and long bodies. They have a strong but superficial resemblance to modern day chimaeras. Their armour was reduced to a pattern of small plates around the head and neck. Like the extinct and related acanthothoracids, and the living and unrelated holocephalians, most of the ptyctodontids are thought to have lived near the sea bottom and preyed on shellfish. On account of their lack of armour, some paleontologists have suggested that the Ptyctodontida were not placoderms, but holocephalians or the ancestors of holocephalians. Anatomical examinations of whole fossil specimens have shown that the similarities between these two groups are superficial. The major differences were that holocephalians have shagreen on their skin, while ptyctodontids do not; the armoured plates and scales of holocephalians are made of dentine, while those of ptyctodontids are made of bone; the craniums of holocephalians are similar to sharks, while those of ptyctodontids are similar to those of other placoderms; and, most importantly, that holocephalians have true teeth, while ptyctodonts have beak-like tooth plates. Ptyctodontids were sexually dimorphic, with the males having pelvic claspers and possibly claspers on the head as well.

====Rhenanida====

Rhenanida (&quot;Rhine fish&quot;) were flattened, ray-like, bottom-dwelling predators with large, upturned mouths that lived in marine environments. The rhenanids were once presumed to be the most primitive, or at least the closest to the ancestral placoderm, as their armour was made of unfused components—a mosaic of tubercles—as opposed to the solidified plates of &quot;advanced&quot; placoderms, such as antiarchs and arthrodires. However, through comparisons of skull anatomies, rhenanids are now considered to be the sister group of the antiarchs. When rhenanids die, their &quot;mosaics&quot; come apart, and it has been suggested that the rarity of rhenanids in the fossil record reflects postmortem disassociation, and is not an actual rarity of the species.

====Acanthothoraci====

Acanthothoraci (&quot;spine chests&quot;) were a group of chimaera-like placoderms closely related to the rhenanid placoderms. Superficially, acanthoracids resembled scaly chimaeras or small, scaly arthrodires with blunt rostrums. They were distinguished from chimaeras by a pair of large spines that emanate from their chests, the presence of large scales and plates, tooth-like beak plates, and the typical bone-enhanced placoderm eyeball. They were distinguished from other placoderms due to differences in the anatomy of their skulls, and due to patterns on the skull plates and thoracic plates that are unique to this order. From what can be inferred from the mouthplates of fossil specimens, acanthothoracids were shellfish hunters ecologically similar to modern-day chimaeras. Competition with their relatives, the ptyctodont placoderms, may have been one of the main reasons for the acanthothoracids&#x27; extinction prior to the mid-Devonian extinction event.

====Petalichthyida====

Petalichthyida (&quot;thin-plated fish&quot;) were small, flattened placoderms, typified by their splayed fins and numerous tubercles that decorated all of the plates and scales of their armour. They reached a peak in diversity during the Early Devonian and were found throughout the world. The petalichthids &quot;Lunaspis&quot; and &quot;Wijdeaspis&quot; are among the best known. There was an independent diversification event that occurred in what is now Southern China, producing a handful of unique genera that were once placed in their own order, &quot;Quasipetalichthyida&quot;, named after the first discovered species there, &quot;Quasipetalichthys haikouensis&quot;. Soon after the petalichthids&#x27; diversification, they went into decline. Because they had compressed body forms, it is supposed they were bottom-dwellers that pursued or ambushed smaller fish. Their diet is not clear, as none of the fossil specimens found have preserved mouth parts.

====Pseudopetalichthyida ====

Pseudopetalichthyida (&quot;false petalichthyids&quot;) is a group of elongated, possibly flattened fishes comprising three, poorly preserved and poorly studied genera. It is known only from rare fossils in Lower Devonian strata in Hunsrück, Germany. Like &quot;Stensioella heintzi&quot;, and the Rhenanida, the pseudopetalichthids had armour made up of a mosaic of tubercles. Like &quot;Stensioella heintzi&quot;, the pseudopetalichthids&#x27; placement within Placodermi is suspect. The matter is not easy to resolve because there are no complete, undamaged and articulated specimens. The anatomical studies done on the crushed specimens that have been found indicate that if they are placoderms, they may be a group more advanced than the ptyctodonts. As such, placoderm experts consider Pseudopetalichthyida to be the sister group of the Arthrodires + Phyllolepida + Antiarchi trichotomy and the Acanthothoraci + Rhenanida dichotomy.

====Stensioellida ====

Stensioellida (&quot;[Heintz&#x27;s] little Stensio&quot;) contains another problematic placoderm of uncertain affinity, known only from the Lower Devonian Hunsrück slates of Germany. &quot;Stensioella&quot; was a thin fish that, when alive, looked vaguely like an elongated ratfish, or a skinny &quot;Gemuendina&quot; with thin, strap-like pectoral fins. Similar to those of the Rhenanida, its armour was a complex mosaic of small, scale-like tubercles. The shoulder joints of its armour are similar to other placoderms, and there are superficial similarities in skull plates, and even more superficial similarities between its tubercles and the tubercles of the rhenanids. It is tentatively placed within Placodermi as a primitive placoderm, though some paleontologists believe the rationale for the placement is inadequate. The paleontologist Philippe Janvier, as well as other paleontologists, has suggested that &quot;Stensioella&quot; is not a placoderm, but instead is a holocephalian. If this is true, then the holocephalians diverged from sharks before the Chondrichthyan Devonian radiation. Critics of Janvier&#x27;s position say that aside from a bodyplan superficially similar to primitive holocephalians, the two groups have little else in common anatomically.

==Cladogram==

The following cladogram shows the interrelationships of placoderms according to Carr &quot;et al.&quot; (2009):

However, the cladogram had changed significantly over the years, and the placoderms are now thought to be paraphyletic, with some being more closer to the Eugnathostomata than others. The updated cladogram (Zhu et al., 2016):

<text>Dartington Crystal is a British manufacturer of crystal glassware and it&#x27;s based in the town of Torrington in North Devon, England. The company manufactures their glassware using traditional glass blowing techniques.

Many of their ranges continue to be made in their North Devon factory and Dartington Crystal is now one of only a few crystal brands still producing in the UK.

==History==
The company was founded by the Dartington Hall Trust, a charity that then aimed to assist the economic regeneration of rural areas through business, education and the arts.

In the early 1960s, the trust became concerned that North Devon was becoming depopulated as a lack of job opportunities forced people to move elsewhere to find work. The glass-making factory was intended to be a solution to the problem, conceived as a center of employment giving local people a reason to stay in the area.

On the recommendation of Frank Thrower, a ceramic salesman and self-taught glassware designer, the trust recruited Eskil Vilhemson, a Swedish glass manufacturer, to be the company&#x27;s managing director. A team of Scandinavian glass blowers came with him to Torrington, most of whom stayed for many years. The factory opened in June 1967 under the name of Dartington Glass. A year later, in 1969, more glass blowers followed, one Italian and a couple from Denmark.
Demand outstripped production in the 1970s and the factory had to be expanded. By the 1980s the modern image of Dartington had attracted the attention of Wedgwood who took up a large stake in the business in 1982, allowing for further expansion.

In 1987, Frank Thrower MBE died of cancer, but the business still boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1989 The Dartington Hall Trust sold a controlling interest to the Rockware Group, whose investment in the business allowed a modern batch mixing plant and new retail shop to be built. The business underwent a management buyout in 1994 from BTR, which had previously acquired the Rockware Group, and The Dartington Hall Trust sold their remaining stake in the business. The business was later acquired by US giftware giant Enesco in 2004, following the company briefly going into administration.

Dartington Crystal underwent another management buyout in April 2006, safeguarding many skilled jobs in the area. Dartington Crystal bought Scottish-based Caithness Glass out of receivership in October 2006 and also owns Royal Brierley Crystal which was based in the West Midlands.

Today Dartington Crystal is the major private employer in Torrington and surrounding rural areas, which is very important to the South West and UK economy. All hand-made crystal items are still produced at Dartington Crystal in Torrington meaning the factory is the only working hand-made tableware producing crystal factory left in the UK, Given the demand for this product, the company does however outsource some ranges of items from within the EU (especially machine-made) crystal where Dartington still continue a rigorous quality control process.

== Products ==
Dartington Crystal&#x27;s most famous products date back to the 1970s, Frank Thrower&#x27;s Scandinavian influenced designs such as Sharon, Exmoor, and Dimple set Dartington out from the others who concentrated on the now seemingly &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; cut crystal styles. Indeed, this has given Dartington a modern and contemporary image, which has kept it ahead of others, and makes it much easier to sell in the modern market. Today&#x27;s most popular ranges include Wine Master, Florabundance as well as Sharon, Exmoor, and Dimple, which are still made today.

== Corporate ==
The company is also known for its personalized, corporate gifts and special commissions, including an FA cup replica used in the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of Sunderland&#x27;s FA Cup triumph over Leeds United. This replica can be seen in the Visitors Centre at the Torrington site.

Commissions include Holland &amp; Holland, Rolls-Royce Motor, P&amp;O Cruises and Chivas Regal as well as many others.

== UK manufacturing ==
Dartington are one of just a few remaining large scale producers of crystal and glass in the UK, with 150 staff. Not all of their crystal is made in Devon; they also design and source other glassware from European suppliers. In addition to Dartington crystal and glass products, the company owns and markets the Caithness Glass and Royal Brierley Crystal brands. They also sell and distribute John Beswick ceramic character sculptures.

<text>The James Beard Foundation is an American non-profit culinary arts organization based in New York City. It was named after James Beard, a food writer, teacher, and cookbook author. Its programs include guest-chef dinners to scholarships for aspiring culinary students, educational conferences, and industry awards. In the spirit of James Beard&#x27;s legacy, the foundation creates programs that help educate people about American cuisine, and supports and promotes the chefs and other industry professionals. 

== History ==
The foundation was started in 1986 by Peter Kump, a former student of James Beard who also founded the Institute of Culinary Education. At Julia Child&#x27;s suggestion, Kump purchased Beard&#x27;s New York brownstone townhouse at 167 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village and preserved it as a gathering place where the general public and press alike would be able to appreciate the talents of established and emerging chefs. The first such dinner was at the suggestion of Wolfgang Puck in 1987. Puck cooked a dinner to raise money and Kump later established it as a monthly event.

Leonard F. Pickell Jr. was nominated as president of the foundation in 1995. In August 2004, shortly before the results of a three-month audit were to be announced, he resigned. He was charged with fraud in late September, having misused the foundation&#x27;s finances for unnecessary and undocumented expenses. Pickell later pleaded guilty to second-degree grand larceny and a $1.1 million theft. As a result of the scandal and his indictment by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, the members of the board of the foundation were asked to resign in January 2005.

In January 2006, the reconstituted board, under the direction of interim president Edna Morris, initiated a search for a permanent president of the foundation. In April of that year Susan Ungaro, formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;Family Circle&quot; magazine from 1976 to 2005, was appointed president. Following the scandal, the foundation also made changes such as creating a salary for the president, CFO, auditors and a larger staff. The foundation lost about $1 million under Pickell&#x27;s leadership, and paid approximately $750,000 in legal and accounting fees. Sponsorships, donations, and event revenues also dropped after the scandal broke prompting the foundation to take out a $2 million mortgage on the Beard home, the only asset.

In October 2007, the board announced that Woodrow W. Campbell, senior partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, would be taking over chairmanship of the board after the resignation of Dorothy Cann Hamilton who served since 2005. 

During her presidency, Susan Ungaro increased the organization&#x27;s income, tripling it to roughly $12 million, with a $400,000 surplus. She also expanded the foundation&#x27;s culinary scholarship program; increased its membership base with a new online enrollment program; moved the annual James Beard Foundation Awards Gala to Lincoln Center and then Chicago; and hosted the James Beard Foundation&#x27;s traveling national food festival. 

In 2018, Clare Reichenbach was unanimously selected by the board as the foundation&#x27;s new chief executive, replacing Susan Ungaro. Reichenbach&#x27;s background is in marketing and consulting, rather than food.
== Criticism ==
In fall 2023, the foundation came under fire for disproportionate representation of white males.

== Programs ==

=== Dinners ===
Each year, the James Beard House hosts over 200 dinners featuring selected chefs who prepare tasting menus in the Beard House kitchen.

=== Greens ===
James Beard Foundation Greens events are for New York City food lovers under 40 to experience various culinary experiences and network. Most events take place outside the foundation&#x27;s West Village townhouse and various locations around the city. Founded during Susan Ungaro&#x27;s tenure as president of the foundation, the organization hopes to continue attracting younger audiences through these events.

=== Awards ===

The &quot;Oscars of the food world&quot; are held annually to honor exceptional chefs and journalists. The premier Awards gala is held on the first Monday in May and features a ceremony and a chef&#x27;s tasting reception. The foundation&#x27;s awards for journalism, books, and other media are held on a separate day. In 2014, the board elected to move the Restaurant and Chef Awards from Lincoln Center in New York to Chicago after Chicago appealed to the foundation to move the event.

The volunteer committee that presides over the awards distribution issued a criticism of the organization after being asked to conduct a recount of the 2020 voting when no black awardees were selected for the 23 categories. The 2020 awards were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and ultimately the foundation decided to not announce any winners and cancel the 2021 awards. According to the committee, these cancellations were a result of the controversy and several attempts by the foundation to alter the established awards procedures.

<text>Forest Gate is a district in the London Borough of Newham, east London, England. It is located northeast of Charing Cross.

The area&#x27;s name relates to its position adjacent to Wanstead Flats, the southernmost part of Epping Forest. The town was historically part of the parish (and later borough) of West Ham in the hundred of Becontree in Essex. Since 1965, Forest Gate has been part of the London Borough of Newham, a local government district of Greater London. The town forms the majority of the London E7 postcode district.

Neighbouring areas include Leytonstone to the north, East Ham to the east, Plaistow to the south and Stratford to the west.

==History==
The first known record of the name &#x27;Forest Gate&#x27; comes from the West Ham parish registers of the late 17th century and describes a gate placed across the modern Woodford Road to prevent cattle straying from the open Wanstead Flats area of Epping Forest onto the main Roman road (Romford road) linking Camulodunum to Londinium. The gate was located close to the former Eagle &amp; Child public house. It never was a toll gate and was demolished along with the keepers&#x27; cottage in 1881.
At the time of the gate&#x27;s construction, the Forest and its mosaic of habitats (coppice woodland, common grazing and wood pasture) extended from Epping to the Romford Road where a coppice woodland called &#x27;Hamfrith&#x27; (meaning the woodland belonging to the Ham area) Wood, which existed until around 1700, formed the southernmost point.

An Anglo-Saxon jewelled bead was found in Forest Gate in 1875 during sewer construction behind the former Princess Alice public house in the Sprowston Road area. The &#x27;bead&#x27; is made of gold, garnet and blue glass dating to the late sixth or early seventh century with the workmanship suggesting that it belonged to a woman of wealth or high status such as a &#x27;princess&#x27; and dates from the 6th–7th centuries (500 – 699 AD). At this time Essex was an independent kingdom with a territory extending over Essex, Middlesex and London and half of Hertfordshire. Having been found as a single object, it is surmised that the bead was lost casually whilst travelling along the ancient Roman road (now the Romford Road) rather than as a burial object, but this is by no means certain as there is a lack of detail about how it was recovered. Stylistically, the piece is said to relate to similar jewellery produced in Kent, which influenced designs in Essex. It is known that King Sledd of Essex married Ricula, the sister of King Æthelberht of Kent in about 580 AD. The piece was acquired by Sir John Evans and was presented to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford by Sir Arthur Evans in 1909.

The area remained rural until the 19th century. From the 18th century a number of wealthy city dwellers had large country houses in the area and many of them were Quakers; the best known of these were the families of Gurney, Fry and Lester. As the population expanded, new churches were built in the area, such as Emmanuel (1852) and its mission church St Mark&#x27;s (1893-1898).

In 1890 a fire at the Forest Gate Industrial School in Forest Lane, occupied by children belonging to the Whitechapel Union, killed 26 boys between the ages of 7 and 12 years old.

Forest Gate formed part of the County Borough of West Ham since its creation (initially as a municipal borough) in 1886. The county borough was abolished to form part of the present-day London Borough of Newham in 1965.

Local history blog &quot;E7 Now and Then&quot; details other Forest Gate history. An ethnographic study of the neighbourhood by researcher Dr Joy White, &quot;Terraformed: Young Black Lives in the Inner City&quot;, was published in 2020 by Repeater Books.

Newham has the second highest percentage of Muslims in Britain at 24.3% and Forest Gate reflects this with 23.4% stating their religion as Islam in the 2001 census. Many have their roots in Bangladesh and Pakistan and most follow the Sunni Deobandi or the Salafi tradition.

==Residential areas==
The Woodgrange Estate Conservation Area is a residential area with predominantly double-fronted Victorian three and four bedroomed houses built between 1887 and 1892 by developer Thomas Corbett and sons who went on to oversee the construction of more than 1,100 houses to exploit the transport links provided by one of the first Essex lines, opened by Eastern Counties Railway in 1839, running through Forest Gate in 1840. Corbett paid £40,000 () for land associated with Woodgrange Farm, Essex, in 1877, which was formerly used as a market garden serving London. The Woodgrange Estate consists of four roads from north to south: Hampton Road; Osborne Road; Claremont Road and Windsor Road, all of which link to Woodgrange Road to the west. There are blocks of council flats at the western end of Claremont and Windsor roads built on the site of houses damaged during bombing in World War II. Nearby Godwin Junior School in Forest Gate recently picked up a British Council International School Award, while the Ofsted Outstanding-rated Forest Gate Community School remains one of the best in the country, by measure of Progress 8 scores. The secondary school is also a member of World Class Schools, having been accredited following a process. To the north of the railway running through Forest Gate is the &quot;village&quot; with terraced streets named for the Oxford Martyrs (Latimer, Ridley and Cranmer) running up to the open spaces of Wanstead Flats.

==Leisure==
Forest Gate also houses West Ham Park, providing a place for sports to be played and to the north Forest Gate borders Wanstead Flats, which has numerous football pitches and areas set aside for bio-diversity and walking.

Among the many teams playing on the flats is Sunday League football team Senrab F.C. Based in Forest Gate, Senrab operates fifteen teams for age groups ranging from 5 to 17 years old and has produced several players who have gone on to successful professional careers, including: John Terry (who gave an undisclosed sum to keep the club running in April 2011), Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Ledley King, Bobby Zamora and Paul Konchesky. Several professional coaches also started out at Senrab, most notably Dario Gradi, Ray Wilkins and Alan Curbishley.

Pubs include the Spotted Dog at 212 Upton Lane.

==Transport==
Forest Gate railway station is in Travelcard Zone 3 on the Great Eastern Main Line and was first opened in 1840, a year after the line was built, but closed in 1843, before re-opening after pressure from local residents on 31 May 1846. The station is now on the Elizabeth Line, with services westbound to Paddington and eastbound to Shenfield. Other stations in the area include Wanstead Park railway station, which is on the Gospel Oak to Barking line in Zone 3.

===Bus===
Forest Gate is on the London Buses network, served by routes: 25, 58, 86, 325, 330, 308 and 425. Night bus N25 and N86 run overnight through Forest Gate.

==Music==
Forest Gate has various associations with music and acting: it was for many years the home of the Tonic Sol-fa College of John Curwen, which taught large numbers of people to play music without learning conventional notation and the Forest Gate School of Music. In December 1966 Jimi Hendrix wrote &quot;Purple Haze&quot; in the Upper Cut Club, owned by Douglas Bayle and George and Billy Walker, it had been opened by The Who, and had The Small Faces as the house band, for a while. It later became the Ace of Clubs in Woodgrange Road. De Underground Records, the seminal jungle/drum and bass record shop and studio was located in Sebert Road, Forest Gate, from 1991 to 1996. The Newham Generals (D Double E &amp; Footsie) are also from Forest Gate, and the video for their song &#x27;Frontline&#x27; was filmed at Forest Gate railway station. Ben Drew aka Plan B grew up in Forest Gate and lived in Hampton Road on the Woodgrange Estate. Depeche Mode started recording in John Bassett&#x27;s studio on Sebert Road. The first Rock Against Racism concert was held at the Princess Alice pub at the junction of Romford Road and Woodgrange Road in 1976.

Damnably Records began in Forest Gate on Salisbury Road and many of its bands including Shonen Knife, Geoff Farina, Chris Brokaw, Wussy stayed or visited there while on tour and Kath Bloom played a house concert there in 2011. Also based in the same E7 cul de sac that Damnably Records once called home are Vacilando &#x27;68 Recordings (previously operating as The Orchestra Pit Recording Co.) who have released vinyl records by international artists such as Howe Gelb, Orkesta Mendoza, Marianne Dissard and Naim Amor, as well as having a heavy involvement in the Medway music scene through the likes of The Singing Loins, Theatre Royal and Stuart Turner and the Flat Earth Society. Damnably and Vacilando &#x27;68 have teamed up numerous times to promote live shows including at the now defunct Moka East based in the Olympic Park, Stratford.

==Sport==
Forest Gate is home to non-league football club Clapton CFC., who completed the purchase of London&#x27;s oldest senior football ground The Old Spotted Dog Ground in 2020. The area is also home to well-known Sunday league side Senrab F.C.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis and ring theory, an approximate identity is a net in a Banach algebra or ring (generally without an identity) that acts as a substitute for an identity element.

==Definition==

A right approximate identity in a Banach algebra &quot;A&quot; is a net formula_1 such that for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, formula_2 Similarly, a left approximate identity in a Banach algebra &quot;A&quot; is a net formula_1 such that for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, formula_4 An approximate identity is a net which is both a right approximate identity and a left approximate identity.

==C*-algebras==

For C*-algebras, a right (or left) approximate identity consisting of self-adjoint elements is the same as an approximate identity. The net of all positive elements in &quot;A&quot; of norm ≤ 1 with its natural order is an approximate identity for any C*-algebra. This is called the canonical approximate identity of a C*-algebra. Approximate identities are not unique. For example, for compact operators acting on a Hilbert space, the net consisting of finite rank projections would be another approximate identity.

If an approximate identity is a sequence, we call it a sequential approximate identity and a C*-algebra with a sequential approximate identity is called σ-unital. Every separable C*-algebra is σ-unital, though the converse is false. A commutative C*-algebra is σ-unital if and only if its spectrum is σ-compact. In general, a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is σ-unital if and only if &quot;A&quot; contains a strictly positive element, i.e. there exists &quot;h&quot; in &quot;A&quot;+ such that the hereditary C*-subalgebra generated by &quot;h&quot; is &quot;A&quot;.

One sometimes considers approximate identities consisting of specific types of elements. For example, a C*-algebra has real rank zero if and only if every hereditary C*-subalgebra has an approximate identity consisting of projections. This was known as property (HP) in earlier literature.

==Convolution algebras==

An approximate identity in a convolution algebra plays the same role as a sequence of function approximations to the Dirac delta function (which is the identity element for convolution). For example, the Fejér kernels of Fourier series theory give rise to an approximate identity.

==Rings==

In ring theory, an approximate identity is defined in a similar way, except that the ring is given the discrete topology so that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;ae&quot;λ for some λ.

A module over a ring with approximate identity is called non-degenerate if for every &quot;m&quot; in the module there is some λ with &quot;m&quot; = &quot;me&quot;λ.

<doc id="949630" wikidata="Q371359" url="?curid=949630" title="Mitsubishi MU-2">
<text>The Mitsubishi MU-2 is a Japanese high-wing, twin-engine turboprop aircraft with a pressurized cabin manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. It made its maiden flight in September 1963 and was produced until 1986. It is one of postwar Japan&#x27;s most successful aircraft, with 704 manufactured in Japan and San Angelo, Texas, in the United States.

==Design and development==

Work on the MU-2, Mitsubishi&#x27;s first postwar aircraft design, began in 1956. Designed as a light twin turboprop transport suitable for a variety of civil and military roles, the MU-2 first flew on 14 September 1963. This first MU-2, and the three MU-2As built, were powered by the Turbomeca Astazou turboprop.

Civil MU-2s powered by Garrett engines were certified as variants of the MU-2B, using the MU-2B type followed by a number. For marketing purposes, each variant was given a suffix letter; the MU-2B-10, for example, was sold as the MU-2D, while the MU-2B-36A was marketed as the MU-2N.

The MU-2 has a high cruise speed coupled with a low landing speed. This is accomplished by using over-wing spoilers instead of conventional ailerons for roll control, allowing the use of full-span double-slotted flaps on the trailing edge of the wing; the very large flaps give the MU-2 wing loading comparable to a Beechcraft King Air in landing configuration, while having wing loading comparable to a light jet in cruise. The spoilers are highly effective, even when the MU-2 wing is stalled, and the lack of ailerons eliminates adverse yaw.

===Production===
In 1963, Mitsubishi granted Mooney Aircraft rights in North America to assemble, sell, and support the MU-2. In 1965, Mooney established a facility to assemble MU-2s at its new factory in San Angelo, Texas. Major components were shipped from Japan, and the San Angelo factory installed engines, avionics, and interiors, then painted, flight tested, and delivered the completed aircraft to customers. By 1969, Mooney was in financial difficulty, and the San Angelo facility was taken over by Mitsubishi. Production in the United States ended in 1986. The last Japanese-built aircraft was completed in January 1987.

The subsequent production aircraft, designated MU-2B, were delivered with the Garrett TPE331 engines that remained standard on all later models. Thirty-four MU-2Bs were built, followed by 18 examples of the similar MU-2D. The Japanese armed forces purchased four unpressurized MU-2Cs and 16 search and rescue variants designated MU-2E. Featuring slightly more powerful upgraded TPE331 engines, 95 examples of the MU-2F were sold.

Beginning with the MU-2G, the fuselage was stretched. The MU-2M, of which only 28 were built, is regarded as the toughest and most desired of all short-bodied MU-2s, especially with a −10 engine conversion. It had a short fuselage and the same engines as the MU-2K and stretched MU-2J, and had an increase in cabin pressurization to 6.0 psi; it was followed by the MU-2P, which had newer, four-blade propellers. The final short-fuselage MU-2s produced were known as Solitaires and were fitted with Garrett TPE331-10-501M engines.

The first significant change to the airframe came with the stretched MU-2G, first flying 10 January 1969, which featured a 1.91 m (6 ft 3 in) longer fuselage than earlier models; 46 were built before being succeeded by the more powerful MU-2J (108 constructed). The MU-2L (29 built) was a higher-gross-weight variant, followed by the MU-2N (39 built) with uprated engines and four-blade propellers. The final stretched-fuselage MU-2 was named the Marquise, and like the Solitaire, used TPE331 engines.

==Operational history==

===Military service===
====Japan====

The Japan Self-Defense Forces are the only military operators to have flown the MU-2 in front-line service.

=====Ground Self-Defense Force=====
The four C-model aircraft built, in addition to 16 MU-2Ks, entered service with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) with the designation LR-1; they were used as liaison and photo reconnaissance aircraft. They were retired in 2016. A number of them have been placed as gate guardians at JGSDF bases.

=====Air Self-Defense Force=====
29 MU-2Es were purchased by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force as search-and-rescue aircraft and designated MU-2S. Additional equipment consisted of a &quot;thimble&quot; nose radome, increased fuel capacity, bulged observation windows, and a sliding door for dropping rafts. They were replaced in 2008 by the British Aerospace U-125A. Some have been preserved.

==== Argentina ====
Four civilian MU-2 (LV-MCV, LV-MOP, LV-OAN and LV-ODZ) were acquired by the Argentine Air Force during the Falkland War. These Mitsubishi were unarmed, but used during combat operations by the Escuadrón Fénix as pathfinders, reconnaissance and comm-relay planes. Among their missions were flying as guiding planes to the IA-58 Pucará replacements required after losses on the raid on Pebble Island.

====New Zealand====
In late 2009 the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) took delivery of four Mitsubishi MU-2F fixed-wing training aircraft from the United States for use as training aids. In New Zealand service they are known as the Mitsubishi MU-2 Sumo. The aircraft were ferried to New Zealand and are located at the RNZAF&#x27;s Ground Training Wing (GTW) at RNZAF Base Woodbourne near Blenheim in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island.

====United States====
Since 1987 MU-2s have been flown by retired United States Air Force pilots working under government contract at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, where they provide U.S. Air Force undergraduate Air Battle Manager students of the U.S. Air Force Weapons Controller School with their initial experience controlling live aircraft. In the tactical simulations, the aircraft usually represent F-15s and Mikoyan MiG-29s. Students must control eight MU-2 missions before they can progress to controlling high-performance aircraft such as F-15s or F-22s.

===Flight around the world===
On 25 August 2013, Mike Laver, owner and pilot of N50ET (a −10 engine converted 1974 K-model equipped with 5-blade MT-composite propellers, which had just received a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) under Air 1st of Aiken, South Carolina), along with &quot;AOPA Pilot&quot; technical editor Mike Collins, embarked on an around-the-world journey in the MU-2B-25. The voyage commenced at Aiken Municipal Airport (now Aiken Regional Airport) and visited Nagoya, Japan, on 14 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of the MU-2.

===Safety concerns===
In the United States, the MU-2 had a spotty safety record during its early decades, as its high performance coupled with a relatively low purchase price appealed to amateur pilots who did not appreciate how demanding it is to fly compared to slower piston engined aircraft. The MU-2 has performance similar to a small jet; however, as it weighs less than , under U.S. pilot certification rules in force at the time, a pilot holding a multi-engine rating for much slower light twin piston-engine aircraft was allowed to fly the MU-2 with only a simple flight instructor endorsement. Inexperience with the MU-2&#x27;s higher speeds, altitudes, and climb and descent rates resulted in many crashes. In Europe, pilots were required to obtain a specific type rating to fly the MU-2, resulting in roughly half the accident rate of early operations in the U.S.

Some of the aircraft&#x27;s flight characteristics may be unfamiliar to pilots accustomed to slower light piston twins. Standard engine-out procedures are counterproductive when flying the MU-2: the commonly taught procedure of reducing flap following an engine failure on takeoff leads to a critical reduction in lift in the MU-2 with its unusually large and effective flaps. When pilots were taught to retain takeoff flap and reduce climb rate after an engine failure, MU-2 takeoff accident rates were reduced. Additionally, the MU-2 is sensitive to trim settings, and it is critical to promptly trim the aircraft properly in all phases of flight. The absence of adverse yaw eliminates the need to use rudder for coordinated flight, but proper and prompt use of rudder is vital to counter the aircraft&#x27;s tendency to roll in reaction to engine torque; at low airspeed, the aircraft will rapidly roll and enter an accelerated stall if the pilot applies full power without adequate preparation, and safe recovery from this condition is very difficult at low altitude.

Most crashes early in the type&#x27;s service life were attributable to pilot error; however, in 1981, four uncontrolled descents from altitude prompted the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to initiate separate investigations into the cabin pressurization system and autopilot, but the outcome was inconclusive. In 1983, after more crashes, the NTSB convinced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to perform a more comprehensive study of various aircraft systems; the study ultimately did not fault the MU-2&#x27;s design, but the repeated investigations had damaged the aircraft&#x27;s reputation by this time. This prompted Mitsubishi, in cooperation with FlightSafety International, to initiate the &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Review of Proficiency&quot; (PROP) seminar program to better educate MU-2 pilots about the aircraft&#x27;s characteristics. The PROP seminars were suspended following the end of MU-2 production in 1986 but were reinstated in 1994 due to continuing accidents.

The aircraft&#x27;s accident rate caused resale values to fall and prompted Mitsubishi to campaign the FAA to require an MU-2 type rating. In 2005, the FAA undertook another safety evaluation of the MU-2 and concluded that a properly maintained MU-2 was safe when operated by well-trained pilot; however, the study also found that training standards were inconsistent, and sometimes recommended unusual or unauthorized procedures. In 2006, the FAA issued a Special Federal Air Regulation (SFAR) directed at MU-2 operations, with standards exceeding a type rating in some aspects. The training curriculum was standardized and pilots required to receive type-specific initial and recurrent training. A fully functional autopilot became a requirement for single-pilot operations, and FAA-approved checklists and operating manuals must be on board at all times. Unusual for this SFAR, pilot experience in other aircraft types cannot be used to comply with MU-2 operational requirements.

By 2011, the SFAR was credited with lowering MU-2 accident rates below those for similar turboprop aircraft. Additionally, although some owners had worried that the SFAR would depress aircraft prices even further, resale values rebounded as potential owners recognized that the aircraft is very safe with a properly trained pilot. PROP seminars continue to be held biennially and count towards MU-2 training requirements, and have become popular social events for MU-2 operators and even potential buyers, as MU-2 ownership is not required for attendance.

The aircraft had several airworthiness issues early in its service history. Airworthiness directives (ADs) were issued for nose gear cracks and various problems with the TPE331 engine. In April 1993, an emergency AD was issued after four serious accidents, two of them fatal, caused by propeller blade separations in aircraft equipped with similar three and four-blade Hartzell propellers; the AD required immediate inspections of the propeller assemblies having more than 3,000 flight hours, and also covered various other aircraft types, but focused on the MU-2B-60 since it was the heaviest aircraft using these propellers. Despite these early problems, aviation experts have characterized the MU-2 as being robustly designed and constructed, and relatively few MU-2 crashes have been directly attributed to mechanical or structural failures.

==Incidents and accidents==
As of May 2024, there have been 170 documented crashes and 394 deaths involving the MU-2.
* On 19 April 1993, an MU-2B-60 owned by the State of South Dakota, registration number &quot;N86SD&quot;, sustained extensive damage to the fuselage and left-hand wing and engine mounts after a propeller blade separation during cruise. The pilot was unable to maintain altitude and crashed into a farm silo in low visibility about south of Dubuque, Iowa. All eight people aboard the aircraft died, including George S. Mickelson, then Governor of South Dakota. Later that April, investigators&#x27; findings prompted the FAA to order the immediate inspection of Hartzell propellers similar to those on the accident aircraft. The accident was attributed to metal fatigue of the propeller hub caused by improper design and manufacturing.
* On 6 October 2000, an MU-2B-26A, registration number &quot;N60BT&quot;, crashed in a wooded area short of Runway 24 at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Airport in Edgartown, Massachusetts, during a landing approach in low visibility. The crash killed pilot and former New Jersey State Senator Charles B. Yates, his wife, and two of their children. The NTSB attributed the crash to the pilot&#x27;s failure to follow instrument flight procedures, with the low cloud ceiling being a contributing factor; the report also noted that he had initiated but failed to complete MU-2 specific flight training.
* On 10 November 2013, Perry Inhofe, son of U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe, died when the MU-2 he was flying crashed in Owasso, Oklahoma. Inhofe was the sole occupant of the aircraft.
* On 29 March 2016, an MU-2B-60 operated by Aero Teknic, a Canadian aircraft maintenance company, crashed on approach to Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, killing all seven people aboard, including former Canadian politician Jean Lapierre, his family, and the two pilots. An initial survivor died of a heart attack after being pulled from the wreckage. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigated the crash and determined that the pilot&#x27;s decision to continue an unstable approach resulted in loss of control during final approach.

<doc id="949631" wikidata="Q381444" url="?curid=949631" title="Luxating patella">
<text>A luxating patella, sometimes called a trick knee, is a condition in which the patella, or kneecap, dislocates or moves out of its normal location. It can be associated with damage to the anterior cruciate ligament.

Patellar luxation is a common condition in dogs, particularly small and miniature breeds. The condition usually becomes evident between the ages of 4 and 6 months. It can occur in cats, as well, especially domestic short-haired cats.

There have been several reports of patella luxation in other species such as miniature pigs, alpacas, llamas, cattle and goats.

==Causes==
Rarely, it can be caused by some form of blunt trauma, but most frequently, it is a developmental, congenital defect. In congenital cases, it is frequently bilateral. The condition can also be inherited through genetics. This can also be caused by obesity.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made through palpation of the knee, to see whether it slips inside the joint more than would normally be expected. Often, a dog owner might be told that his or her pet has &quot;loose knee&quot;, but this is not a medical term, and it is not correct to use it interchangeably with luxating patella.

Luxating patella cannot be present without the knee being loose, but a loose knee is not necessarily slipping out of the joint. Even with luxating patella, symptoms such as intermittent limping in the rear leg might be mild or absent. Physical examination and manual manipulation are the preferred methods for diagnosis. More extreme cases can result in severe lameness. Osteoarthritis typically develops secondarily.

The four recognized diagnostic grades of patellar luxation include, in order of severity:

=== Grade I ===
* Grade I - the patella can be manually luxated but is reduced (returns to the normal position) when released.

=== Grade II ===
* Grade II - the patella can be manually luxated or it can spontaneously luxate with flexion of the stifle joint. The patella remains luxated until it is manually reduced or when the animal extends the joint and derotates the tibia in the opposite direction of luxation.

=== Grade III ===
* Grade III - the patella remains luxated most of the time, but can be manually reduced with the stifle joint in extension. Flexion and extension of the stifle results again in luxation of the patella.

=== Grade IV ===
* Grade IV - the patella is permanently luxated and cannot be manually repositioned, with up to 90° of rotation of the proximal tibial plateau. The femoral trochlear groove is shallow or absent, with displacement of the quadriceps muscle group in the direction of luxation.

==Treatment==
Grades II, III, and IV require surgery to correct, if the animal has difficulty walking. The surgery required is governed by the type of abnormality present, but often involves a sulcoplasty, a deepening of the trochlear sulcus where the patella sits, a realignment of the attachment of the patella tendon on the tibia, and tightening or releasing of the capsule on either side of the patella, according to which side the patella is slipping. Some grade IV conditions may require more involved surgery to realign the femur and/or tibia.

A therapeutic dosage of glucosamine can be used as a preliminary treatment to strengthen ligaments and the surrounding tissues of the joint and can delay or prevent surgery.

Additional help can be given with the use of pet ramps, stairs, or steps. These can help the animal travel from one place to another, especially up and down, without adding any pain or damage to the patella.

==In animal breeds==
Most cases of patellar luxation are medial, and this is frequently a congenital problem in toy- and miniature-breed dogs. Breeds showing a predisposition for medial patellar luxation include miniature and toy Poodles, Maltese, Jack Russell Terriers, Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Pekingese, Patterdale Terriers, Chihuahuas, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Papillons, Boston Terriers, Plummer Terriers and Teddy Roosevelt Terriers. Large-breed dogs are also affected, and the Labrador retriever seems particularly predisposed.

Patellar luxation is less common in cats than in dogs. Predisposed breeds include the Devon Rex and the Abyssinian. Although the specific cause of patellar luxation is unknown in these cases, a defect in hind limb conformation is generally agreed to be the underlying cause.

<text>Eugene Isaac Meyer (October 31, 1875 – July 17, 1959) was a prominent American banker, businessman, financier, and newspaper publisher. His most notable public service role was as the fifth chairman of the Federal Reserve, a position he held from 1930 to 1933. Meyer purchased &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1933, and was its publisher from 1933 to 1946, with the paper staying in his family throughout the rest of the 20th century. He was the first president of the World Bank Group from June to December 1946.

His daughter, Katharine &quot;Kay&quot; Graham, took the &quot;Post&quot; over in 1963 and remained its titular head until her death in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Meyer was born in 1875 to a Jewish family in Los Angeles, California, descended from a long line of rabbis and civic leaders. He was one of eight children of Harriet (née Newmark) and Marc Eugene Meyer. His mother was the daughter of Joseph Newmark. He grew up in San Francisco. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, but dropped out after one year. He later enrolled at Yale University, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1895, and a Doctorate of Law.

==Career==
===Banking and finance===
After college, Meyer went to work for Lazard Frères, where his father was a partner, but quit in 1901 after four years and went out on his own. He was a successful investor and speculator, and owned a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. He married Agnes Elizabeth Ernst, a Lutheran, in 1910; they had five children, including the future Katharine Graham, and another daughter, Florence Meyer (Mrs. Oskar Homolka). By 1915, when he was forty, he was worth $40 million.

In 1920, Meyer teamed with William H. Nichols of General Chemical to help fulfill his vision of a bigger, better chemical company. Meyer and Nichols combined five smaller chemical companies to create the Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation, which later became Allied Chemical Corp., which in turn became part of AlliedSignal, the forerunner of Honeywell’s specialty materials business. Both men have buildings named after them at Honeywell’s Morris Plains, New Jersey, headquarters.

====Chairman of the Federal Reserve====
Meyer went to Washington, D.C., during World War I as a dollar-a-year man for Woodrow Wilson, becoming the head of the War Finance Corporation and serving there long after the end of hostilities. President Calvin Coolidge named him as chairman of the Federal Farm Loan Board in 1927.

Herbert Hoover promoted him to Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1930. He took on an additional half-year post in 1932 as chief of the new Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was Hoover&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to aid companies by providing loans to businesses. After Franklin D. Roosevelt became president, Meyer resigned his Fed position on May 10, 1933.

Meyer has been criticized as Fed Chairman for not attacking the economic catastrophe of the early 1930s with monetary stimulus, thus allowing the banking crisis to get out of hand and deepening the economic collapse. One of his biggest critics at the time condemned Meyer along with J. P. Morgan, Andrew Mellon and Ogden Mills
as being the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
More recent critics include Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and his fellow economist Anna Schwartz who, in their landmark book &quot;A Monetary History of the United States,&quot; put forth the argument that the Fed could have lessened the severity of the Depression, but failed to exercise its role of managing the monetary system and ameliorating banking panics.

===Publishing===
====&quot;The Washington Post&quot;====
In 1929, Meyer made an offer of $5 million for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but he was rebuffed. In June 1933, he bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction for $825,000, the paper having been ruined by its spendthrift socialite owner Ned McLean, and by the Great Depression. Meyer had resigned as Fed chairman just three weeks earlier, and he had no experience in the publishing business. But he was prepared to bid up to $2 million for the &quot;Post,&quot; far more than the other bidders, including William Randolph Hearst. Preferring to remain anonymous, Meyer stayed home from the proceedings.

After weeks of speculation when even his daughter Katharine did not know the buyer&#x27;s name, it was finally revealed in newspapers around the country on June 13.

In his statement to the press, Meyer vowed to improve the &quot;Post,&quot; and asserted that he would operate it independently. He also said that he had bought the &quot;Post&quot; on his own, without the influence of &quot;any person, group or organization.&quot; He made this statement to contradict the rumors that as a well-known Republican, he would soon turn it into a voice for Republican causes. Press reaction to the purchase was positive, with other newspapers being pleased that the &quot;Post&quot; would not go out of business, and would continue to report the news from the nation&#x27;s capital; given its important location, said one editorial, rescuing the &quot;Post&quot; was &quot;a public service.&quot;

An editorial in a newspaper that was identifiably Republican praised the purchase as &quot;good news for journalism.&quot; While expressing the hope that Meyer would in fact take the Republican point of view, the editorial acknowledged that he probably would not do so, since he seemed to be &quot;no slavish supporter of any party or leader,&quot; assuring that under his leadership the &quot;Washington Post&quot; would be &quot;hard hitting and independent, a paper that nobody can ignore.&quot; As it turned out, Meyer did take the side of the Republican party on some issues. He was opposed to FDR&#x27;s New Deal, and this was reflected in the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; editorial stance as well as its news coverage, especially regarding the National Recovery Administration (NRA). He even wrote an editorializing &quot;news&quot; story under a fake name.

Over the next twenty years, Meyer spent millions of dollars of his own money to keep the money-losing paper in business, while focusing on improving its quality; by the 1950s, it was finally consistently profitable and was increasingly recognized for good reporting and important editorials. As publisher, Meyer occasionally contributed to stories: his friendship with the British Ambassador, Lord Lothian, led to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; scoop on reporting of Edward VIII&#x27;s relationship with Wallis Simpson.

===World Bank===
Following World War II in June 1946, U.S. president Harry S. Truman named Meyer, then 70 years old, the first head of the World Bank. Meyer appointed his son-in-law, Phil Graham, as publisher of the &quot;Post.&quot; After six months with the World Bank, Meyer returned to the &quot;Post,&quot; serving as chairman of the Washington Post Company until his death in Mount Kisco, New York, in 1959.

==Personal life==

Meyer&#x27;s older sister, Florence Meyer Blumenthal, was noted for the philanthropic organization she formed, the Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation, which awarded the Prix Blumenthal. His brother, Edgar J. Meyer, married to Leila Saks Meyer, the daughter of Andrew Saks, perished in the sinking of the .

Meyer died at age 83 on July 17, 1959 at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he had been under treatment for a heart ailment and cancer.

==Legacy==
Eugene Meyer Elementary School in Washington, D.C., was named in Meyer&#x27;s honor in 1963. The school closed in 2008, and the building has since been used as swing space by District of Columbia Public Schools.

<doc id="949645" wikidata="Q209897" url="?curid=949645" title="Pinch hitter">
<text>In baseball, a pinch hitter (PH) is a substitute batter. Batters can be substituted at any time while the ball is dead (not in active play); the manager may use any player who has not yet entered the game as a substitute. Unlike basketball, American football or ice hockey, and in a similar way to association football, baseball does not have a free substitution rule (at the professional level) and thus the replaced player is not allowed back into that game. The pinch hitter assumes the spot in the batting order of the player whom he replaces. Pinch hitters are commonly used to replace a weak hitter (often the pitcher) or to gain a platoon advantage.

The player chosen to be a pinch hitter is often a backup infielder or outfielder whose defensive skills are limited. In Major League Baseball (MLB), catchers are less likely to be called upon to pinch-hit, because most teams have only two catchers. Pitchers are rarely used as pinch hitters, because they tend to be worse hitters than other players on the team. However, some pitchers have been used as pinch hitters; this tactic had almost vanished by the 1980s, but later saw a comeback in situations when benches have diminished due to injuries, offering few other options beyond a team&#x27;s 12 or 13 pitchers.

MLB, the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the KBO League (in South Korea), the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (in Mexico), and various other leagues use the designated hitter rule, such that pitchers seldom bat. This eliminates one possible situation in which a pinch hitter may be more desirable.

For statistical and scorekeeping purposes, the pinch hitter is denoted by &quot;PH&quot;.

==Usage==
Pinch hitters are often used to replace a starting player because of injury or when the pinch hitter is thought to have a better chance of reaching base or helping other runners to score.

When the designated hitter rule is not in effect (e.g., in the Central League in NPB, in the National League before 2022 and American League before 1973 in MLB and leagues such as the Atlantic League which use the double hook rule), pinch hitters are often substituted for the pitcher in the middle or late innings of a game. This is because pitchers are often poor hitters and may become less effective after six to seven innings of pitching. Thus, as the manager often plans to replace the pitcher in the next inning, the player being replaced cannot re-enter the game, the major downside of using a pinch hitter.

This use of a pinch hitter is often part of a double switch, in which a relief pitcher replaces a defensive player who will not bat soon, and at the same time a defensive player replaces the pitcher who is scheduled to bat soon. If a player acts as a pinch hitter and his team bats around in the inning, he may come to the plate a second time. The second (and subsequent) times he bats in the inning are not considered pinch-hitting appearances.

The pinch hitter need not (but may) assume the same position as the player for whom he pinch-hits as long as some other player assumes that position. For example, on August 16, 2009, the Washington Nationals&#x27; Ryan Zimmerman pinch-hit for second baseman Alberto González and then remained in the game at third base, with previous third baseman Ronnie Belliard switching positions to play second base after the change. Alternatively, the manager may designate another player to replace the pinch hitter; this scenario is common when a team pinch-hits for a pitcher without executing a double switch, such that the new pitcher then replaces the pinch hitter and assumes the previous pitcher&#x27;s place in the batting order.

If a pinch hitter hits for the DH, the new pinch hitter stays in the game as a DH, and may not be used in the field. If the new DH does take the field, then the team forfeits the DH for the remainder of the game (thus, causing the pitcher to enter the batting order).

<doc id="949648" wikidata="Q1740771" url="?curid=949648" title="Synectics">
<text>Synectics is a problem solving methodology that stimulates thought processes of which the subject may be unaware. This method was developed by George M. Prince (1918–2009) and William J.J. Gordon, originating in the Arthur D. Little Invention Design Unit in the 1950s.

According to Gordon, Synectics research has three main assumptions:
* the creative process can be described and taught
* invention processes in arts and sciences are analogous and are driven by the same &quot;psychic&quot; processes
* individual and group creativity are analogous

==History==
The process was derived from tape-recording (initially audio, later video) meetings, analysis of the results, and experiments with alternative ways of dealing with the obstacles to success in the meeting. &quot;Success&quot; was defined as getting a creative solution that the group was committed to implement.

The name Synectics comes from Greek and means &quot;the joining together of different and apparently irrelevant elements.&quot;

Gordon and Prince named both their practice and their new company Synectics, which can cause confusion, as people not part of the company are trained and use the practice. While the name was trademarked, it has become a standard word for describing creative problem solving in groups.

==Theory==
Synectics is a way to approach creativity and problem-solving in a rational way. &quot;Traditionally, the creative process has been considered after the fact... The Synectics study has attempted to research creative process in vivo, while it is going on.&quot;

According to Gordon, Synectics research has three main assumptions:
*The creative process can be described and taught;
*Invention processes in arts and sciences are analogous and are driven by the same &quot;psychic&quot; processes;
*Individual and group creativity are analogous.
With these assumptions in mind, Synectics believes that people can be better at being creative if they understand how creativity works.

One important element in creativity is embracing the seemingly irrelevant. Emotion is emphasized over intellect and the irrational over the rational. Through understanding the emotional and irrational elements of a problem or idea, a group can be more successful at solving a problem.

Prince emphasized the importance of creative behaviour in reducing inhibitions and releasing the inherent creativity of everyone. He and his colleagues developed specific practices and meeting structures which help people to ensure that their constructive intentions are experienced positively by one another. The use of the creative behaviour tools extends the application of Synectics to many situations beyond invention sessions (particularly constructive resolution of conflict).

Gordon emphasized the importance of metaphorical process&#x27; to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar&quot;. He expressed his central principle as: &quot;Trust things that are alien, and alienate things that are trusted.&quot; This encourages, on the one hand, fundamental problem-analysis and, on the other hand, the alienation of the original problem through the creation of analogies. It is thus possible for new and surprising solutions to emerge.

As an invention tool, Synectics invented a technique called &quot;springboarding&quot; for getting creative beginning ideas. For the development of beginning ideas, the method incorporates brainstorming and deepens and widens it with metaphor; it also adds an important evaluation process for Idea Development, which takes embryonic new ideas that are attractive but not yet feasible and builds them into new courses of action which have the commitment of the people who will implement them.

Synectics is more demanding of the subject than brainstorming, as the steps involved imply that the process is more complicated and requires more time and effort. The success of the Synectics methodology depends highly on the skill of a trained facilitator.

<doc id="949651" wikidata="Q1321523" url="?curid=949651" title="Criticality accident">
<text>A criticality accident is an accidental uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reaction. It is sometimes referred to as a critical excursion, critical power excursion, divergent chain reaction, or simply critical. Any such event involves the unintended accumulation or arrangement of a critical mass of fissile material, for example enriched uranium or plutonium. Criticality accidents can release potentially fatal radiation doses if they occur in an unprotected environment.

Under normal circumstances, a critical or supercritical fission reaction (one that is self-sustaining in power or increasing in power) should only occur inside a safely shielded location, such as a reactor core or a suitable test environment. A criticality accident occurs if the same reaction is achieved unintentionally, for example in an unsafe environment or during reactor maintenance.

Though dangerous and frequently lethal to humans within the immediate area, the critical mass formed would not be capable of producing a massive nuclear explosion of the type that fission bombs are designed to produce. This is because all the design features needed to make a nuclear warhead cannot arise by chance. In some cases, the heat released by the chain reaction will cause the fissile (and other nearby) materials to expand. In such cases, the chain reaction can either settle into a low power steady state or may even become either temporarily or permanently shut down (subcritical).

In the history of atomic power development, at least 60 criticality accidents have occurred, including 22 in process environments, outside nuclear reactor cores or experimental assemblies, and 38 in small experimental reactors and other test assemblies. Although process accidents occurring outside reactors are characterized by large releases of radiation, the releases are localized. Nonetheless, fatal radiation exposures have occurred to persons close to these events, resulting in more than 20 fatalities. In a few reactor and critical experiment assembly accidents, the energy released has caused significant mechanical damage or steam explosions.

==Physical basis==
Criticality occurs when sufficient fissile material (a critical mass) accumulates in a small volume such that each fission, on average, produces one neutron that in turn strikes another fissile atom and causes another fission. This causes the fission chain reaction to become self-sustaining within the mass of material. In other words, in a critical mass, the number of neutrons emitted over time, &quot;exactly equals&quot; the number of neutrons captured by another nucleus or lost to the environment. If the mass is supercritical, the number of neutrons emitted per unit time &quot;exceeds&quot; those absorbed or lost, resulting in a cascade of nuclear fissions at increasing rate.

Criticality can be achieved by using metallic uranium or plutonium, liquid solutions, or powder slurries. The chain reaction is influenced by a range of parameters noted by the mnemonics MAGIC MERV (mass, absorption, geometry, interaction, concentration, moderation, enrichment, reflection, and volume) and MERMAIDS (mass, enrichment, reflection, moderation, absorption, interaction, density, and shape). Temperature is also a factor in criticality.

Calculations can be performed to determine the conditions needed for a critical state, e.g. mass, geometry, concentration etc. Where fissile materials are handled in civil and military installations, specially trained personnel are employed to carry out such calculations and ensure that all reasonably practicable measures are used to prevent criticality accidents, during both planned normal operations and any potential process upset conditions that cannot be dismissed on the basis of negligible likelihoods (reasonably foreseeable accidents).

The assembly of a critical mass establishes a nuclear chain reaction, resulting in an exponential rate of change in the neutron population over space and time leading to an increase in neutron flux. This increased flux and attendant fission rate produces radiation that contains both a neutron and gamma ray component and is extremely dangerous to any unprotected nearby life-form. The rate of change of neutron population depends on the neutron generation time, which is characteristic of the neutron population, the state of &quot;criticality&quot;, and the fissile medium.

A nuclear fission creates approximately 2.5 neutrons per fission event on average. Hence, to maintain a stable, exactly critical chain reaction, 1.5 neutrons per fission event must either leak from the system or be absorbed without causing further fissions.

For every 1,000 neutrons released by fission, a small number, typically no more than about 7, are delayed neutrons which are emitted from the fission product precursors, called &quot;delayed neutron emitters&quot;. This delayed neutron fraction, on the order of 0.007 for uranium, is crucial for the control of the neutron chain reaction in reactors. It is called one dollar of reactivity. The lifetime of delayed neutrons ranges from fractions of seconds to almost 100 seconds after fission. The neutrons are usually classified in 6 delayed neutron groups. The average neutron lifetime considering delayed neutrons is approximately 0.1 sec, which makes the chain reaction relatively easy to control over time. The remaining 993 prompt neutrons are released very quickly, approximately 1 μs after the fission event.

In steady-state operation, nuclear reactors operate at exact criticality. When at least one dollar of reactivity is added above the exact critical point (where the neutron production rate balances the rate of neutron losses, from both absorption and leakage) then the chain reaction does not rely on delayed neutrons. In such cases, the neutron population can rapidly increase exponentially, with a very small time constant, known as the prompt neutron lifetime. Thus there is a very large increase in neutron population over a very short time frame. Since each fission event contributes approximately 200 MeV per fission, this results in a very large energy burst as a &quot;prompt-critical spike&quot;. This spike can be easily detected by radiation dosimetry instrumentation and &quot;criticality accident alarm system&quot; detectors that are properly deployed.

==Accident types==
Criticality accidents are divided into one of two categories:
*Process accidents, where controls in place to prevent any criticality are breached;
*Reactor accidents, which occur due to operator errors or other unintended events (e.g., during maintenance or fuel loading) in locations intended to achieve or approach criticality, such as nuclear power plants, nuclear reactors, and nuclear experiments.

Excursion types can be classified into four categories depicting the nature of the evolution over time:
# Prompt criticality excursion
# Transient criticality excursion
# Exponential excursion
# Steady-state excursion

The prompt-critical excursion is characterized by a power history with an initial prompt-critical spike as previously noted, which either self-terminates or continues with a tail region that decreases over an extended period of time. The transient critical excursion is characterized by a continuing or repeating spike pattern (sometimes known as &quot;chugging&quot;) after the initial prompt-critical excursion. The longest of the 22 process accidents occurred at Hanford Works in 1962 and lasted for 37.5 hours. The 1999 Tokaimura nuclear accident remained critical for about 20 hours, until it was shut down by active intervention. The exponential excursion is characterized by a reactivity of less than one dollar added, where the neutron population rises as an exponential over time, until either feedback effects or intervention reduce the reactivity. The exponential excursion can reach a peak power level, then decrease over time, or reach a steady-state power level, where the critical state is exactly achieved for a &quot;steady-state&quot; excursion.

The steady-state excursion is also a state which the heat generated by fission is balanced by the heat losses to the ambient environment. This excursion has been characterized by the Oklo natural reactor that was naturally produced within uranium deposits in Gabon, Africa about 1.7 billion years ago.

==Known incidents==
According to modern estimations, 67 known criticality accidents have occurred globally between 1945 and 1999, with none confirmed since. They have occurred during experimentation and production relating to nuclear weapon cores, research reactors, commercial reactors, and naval reactors.

A 2000 Los Alamos report recorded 60 criticality accidents between 1945 and 1999. These caused 21 deaths: seven in the United States, ten in the Soviet Union, two in Japan, one in Argentina, and one in Yugoslavia. Nine have been due to process accidents, and the others from reactor and critical experiment accidents. 

The Los Alamos also grouped reactor and critical experiment accidents by material: 5 in fissile solutions, 15 in bare and reflected metal systems, 13 in moderated metal and oxide systems, and 5 in miscellaneous systems.

A 2014 University of Nevada report identified 7 further criticality accidents prior to 2000 that were not included in the Los Alamos report. Five occurred in the maintenance and refuelling of Soviet nuclear submarine reactors, and two occurred in Japanese commercial reactors during testing and were covered up until 2007.

The table below gives a selection of well documented incidents.

== Suspected accidents since 1999 ==
, there have been no confirmed criticality accidents since the 1999 Tokaimura nuclear accident. There have been suspected criticalities involved in the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident and 2019 Nyonoksa radiation accident.

Additionally, the US State Department alleged in 2020 that Russia and possibly China have since 1996 up to 2019 carried out secret underground experiments involving supercriticality and thus a violation of the zero-yield standard, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and possibly the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. Such experiments may have led to accidents similar to at Nyonoksa.
==Observed effects==
===Blue glow===

It has been observed that many criticality accidents emit a blue flash of light.

The blue glow of a criticality accident results from the fluorescence of the excited ions, atoms and molecules of the surrounding medium falling back to unexcited states. This is also the reason electric sparks in air, including lightning, appear electric blue. The smell of ozone was said to be a sign of high ambient radioactivity by Chernobyl liquidators.

This blue flash or &quot;blue glow&quot; can also be attributed to Cherenkov radiation, if either water is involved in the critical system or when the blue flash is experienced by the human eye. Additionally, if ionizing radiation directly transects the vitreous humor of the eye, Cherenkov radiation can be generated and perceived as a visual blue glow/spark sensation.

It is a coincidence that the color of Cherenkov light and light emitted by ionized air are a very similar blue; their methods of production are different. Cherenkov radiation does occur in air for high-energy particles (such as particle showers from cosmic rays) but not for the lower energy charged particles emitted from nuclear decay.

===Heat effects===
Some people reported feeling a &quot;heat wave&quot; during a criticality event. It is not known whether this may be a psychosomatic reaction to the realization of what has just occurred (i.e. the high probability of inevitable impending death from a fatal radiation dose), or if it is a physical effect of heating (or non-thermal stimulation of heat sensing nerves in the skin) due to radiation emitted by the criticality event.

A review of all of the criticality accidents with eyewitness accounts indicates that the heat waves were only observed when the fluorescent blue glow (the non-Cherenkov light, see above) was also observed. This would suggest a possible relationship between the two, and indeed, one can be potentially identified. In dense air, over 30% of the emission lines from nitrogen and oxygen are in the ultraviolet range, and about 45% are in the infrared range. Only about 25% are in the visible range. Since the skin feels light (visible or otherwise) through its heating of the skin surface, it is possible that this phenomenon can explain the heat wave perceptions. However, this explanation has not been confirmed and may be inconsistent with the intensity of light reported by witnesses compared to the intensity of heat perceived. Further research is hindered by the small amount of data available from the few instances where humans have witnessed these incidents and survived long enough to provide a detailed account of their experiences and observations.

<text>Zähringer is a small lunar impact crater located near the southeast fringes of Mare Tranquillitatis. To the northeast is the flooded crater Lawrence, and to the southeast are the Montes Secchi mountains and the crater Secchi. Farther to the east lies Taruntius. Zähringer is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. It is not markedly worn by subsequent impacts.

This crater was previously identified as Taruntius E before being named by the IAU.

<text>Courier 1B, is the world&#x27;s first active repeater communications satellite, Courier 1B was successfully launched on October 4, 1960 at 17:45:00 GMT from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The first Courier satellite in Project Courier, Courier 1A, was lost 2.5 minutes after lift-off on August 18, 1960.

==History==
As a Cold War initiative, Courier 1B was the 26th satellite launched by the US as opposed to the Soviet Union&#x27;s six satellites since Sputnik I in 1957. Proposed by the US Army Signal Corps in September 1958, Courier 1B was a follow-up to SCORE program launched December 18, 1958. SCORE &quot;was the first step of an evolutionary program to develop communication satellite systems for use by the military services&quot;. The Project Courier was a joint program of the US Department of Defense (ARPA) along with the US Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.

Courier 1B would receive messages or photographs, store them, and then re-transmit them. Courier 1B was:

:&quot;An experimental system to demonstrate the feasibility of using satellites for providing a solution to global communications problems. It was designed to store teletype messages and transmit them at high speed while the satellite is in view of a ground station... orbiting Earth at &quot;.

==Spacecraft==
Courier 1B was built by the Western Development Labs (WDL) division of Philco, previously known as &quot;Army Fort Monmouth Laboratories&quot;. Philco was bought by Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Ford Aerospace division, which was acquired by Loral Corporation. WDL then became part of Space Systems/Loral division of Loral Space &amp; Communications. IT&amp;T provided ground support equipment and Radiation, Inc, Melbourne, Florida, made the large dish ground antennas. Sonotone Corporation, Elmsford, New York developed the on-board power system for the satellite.

Courier 1B was a , diameter sphere, of this was the electronic equipment payload. It carried four 2-W microwave FM (1700-1800 MHz) transmitters and a 50-mW transistorized VHF beacon transmitter subsystem. It contained four solid-state receivers in the 1800-1900 MHz microwave band. Five tape recorders were used to store data for later playback. Four of these were digital with a total capacity of 13.2 Mb (4 minutes at 55 kbit/s) each. One was an analog recorder with a 4-minute capacity and a range of 300 to 50,000 Hz.

Four whip antennas were mounted at 90° intervals along the equator of the sphere. It also held two microwave antennas, a transistorized telemetry generator, a VHF diplexer, and a command decoder. The transmitters and receivers were set up so two of each would be running at any given time, the others were on standby and could be switched in by ground command. The sphere was covered with 19,200 solar cells, charging nickel-cadmium batteries, providing 60 W power. It was the first satellite to use nickel–cadmium storage batteries.

The satellite had the capability to simultaneously transmit, receive, and store approximately 68,000 coded words per minute. It also had real-time communications mode, supporting a single half-duplex voice circuit. The mission was operated by two monitoring stations in New Jersey and Puerto Rico using special 8.5 meters of dish antennas.

==Mission==
Courier 1B launched on 4 October 1960 at 17:45:00 GMT from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch vehicle was a Thor-Able-Star, comprising a modified USAF Thor IRBM first stage and a USAF Able-Star upper stage with a re-startable liquid engine. The satellite was successfully inserted into an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 28.33°, and an Orbital period of 106.8 minutes. Messages were successfully received and transmitted and the satellite operated nominally until a command system failure ended communications 17 days after launch.

After completing a first orbit, a teletype message to the United Nations General Assembly from President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower was sent to United States Secretary of State Christian Herter, to be delivered by Herter to Frederick Boland, President of the General Assembly at the United Nations then in session at New York. The message of Eisenhower was transmitted by Courier 1B from the Camp Evans, Deal Test Site, a New Jersey off-base transmission facility of Fort Monmouth. The message was relayed to the Camp Salinas Training Area, a ground station and tracking installation in Salinas, Puerto Rico. If Courier 1B was in sight of the two ground stations at the same time, Courier 1B had the capability of &quot;real time&quot; messaging.

Courier 1B had an effective message transmission rate of 55,000 bits per second and:

&quot;Used ultra–high frequency (UHF) communications. This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum had remained relatively unused and generally free from man-made and atmospheric interference. The Courier satellite could simultaneously transmit and receive approximately 68,000 words per minute while moving through space at 16,000 miles per hour, and could send and receive facsimile photographs.

After 228 orbits over 17 days, the payload failed to respond to commands. It was believed that the clock-based access codes got out of synchronization and the satellite would not respond to what it interpreted as unauthorized commands.

<doc id="949657" wikidata="Q250897" url="?curid=949657" title="Amphizoa">
<text>Amphizoa is a genus of aquatic beetles in the suborder Adephaga, placed in its own monogeneric family, Amphizoidae. There are five known species of Amphizoa, three in western North America and two in the eastern Palearctic. They are sometimes referred to by the common name troutstream beetles.

==Description==

Troutstream beetles have a characteristic appearance. They are relatively large, oval, slightly convex, dull black to piceus. Body length ranges between . The head is broad with a quadrate shape and small round eyes. The antenna is filiform, rather short with 11 segments. The pronotum is significantly narrower than the elytra and with lateral margins slightly crenulated; the prosternal processes are broad and flat, rounded to truncate at the apex; the elytra are vaguely striate and have a series of short spines of unknown function. The legs are not well adapted for swimming, and lack long swimming setae. The hind coxae extend to the lateral margin of the abdomen and the tarsal formula is 5-5-5.



=== Known species of &quot;Amphizoa&quot; ===
The genus &quot;Amphizoa&quot; contains the following known species:

*&quot;Amphizoa davidis&quot;
*&quot;Amphizoa insolens&quot;
*&quot;Amphizoa lecontei&quot;
*&quot;Amphizoa sinica&quot;
*&quot;Amphizoa striata&quot;

==Biology==
Troutstream beetles can be found in streams and rivers in mountain regions of China, North Korea and western North America. Streams are often cold and medium to fast flowing, and the beetles can be found clinging to rocks, woody debris or at margins. Both adults and larvae are predators, especially on stonefly larvae but occasionally on other aquatic insects. Larvae may also scavenge dead insects.

When disturbed, adults exude a yellowish fluid from the anus, with an odor described as that of cantaloupe or decaying wood, probably as a defense mechanism against predators like frogs and toads.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
Amphizoidae share some plesiomorphic features with Carabidae, such as slender ambulatory legs, and other characteristics with Dytiscidae, such as large sensorial lobes on the epipharynx. In an analysis based on the genes 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I, Amphizoidae was placed as a sister group of a clade comprising the newly described family Aspidytidae, Paelobiidae(=Hygrobiidae) and Dytiscidae. An analysis based on a morphological character matrix also came to this conclusion. However, two other studies with more genes have placed Amphizoidae as sister group to Aspidytidae. With Aspidytidae and Amphizoa share the same morphology of the apical part of the pro-sternal process and the mesocoxal cavities. The phylogeny within Amphizoa has been analysed in two studies based on morphological characters and they suggested that &quot;A. davidis&quot; is an isolated species and sister to the remaining four species as follows (&quot;A davidis&quot;, (&quot;A. insolens&quot;, (&quot;A. striata&quot;, (&quot;A. sinica&quot; &amp; &quot;A. lecontei&quot;)))).

<text>Multi-speed Europe or two-speed Europe (called also &quot;variable geometry Europe&quot; or &quot;Core Europe&quot; depending on the form it would take in practice) is the idea that different parts of the European Union should integrate at different levels and pace depending on the political situation in each individual country. Indeed, multi-speed Europe is currently a reality, with only a subset of EU countries being members of the eurozone and of the Schengen area. Like other forms of [[Multi-speed Europe|differentiated]] [[Multi-speed Europe|integration]] such as à la carte and variable geometry, &quot;multi-speed Europe&quot; arguably aims to salvage the &quot;widening and deepening of the European Union&quot; in the face of political opposition.

==Reasons and actuality of the concept ==

The concept entered political discourse when, after the end of the Cold War, an eastward enlargement of the European Union began to materialise and the question arose how &quot;widening&quot; could be made compatible with &quot;deepening&quot;, i.e., how the imminent enlargement process could be prevented from diluting the idea of an &quot;ever closer union among the peoples of Europe&quot;, as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community of 1957 had put it. In 1994 – still at a time of the EU12 – the German Christian Democrats Wolfgang Schäuble and Karl Lamers published a document in which they called for a &quot;Kerneuropa&quot; (= core Europe). This idea envisaged that &quot;core Europe&quot; would have a &quot;centripetal effect&quot;, a magnetic attraction for the rest of Europe. A precursor to that concept had been a proposal by two advisors to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Michael Mertes and Norbert J. Prill, published as early as July 1989. Mertes and Prill called for a concentric circles Europe, built around a federal core consisting of the Inner Six (EU6) and like-minded EU member states. In 1994 they partly revoked their original idea, arguing that the post-Cold War EU would rather look like a &quot;Europe of Olympic rings&quot; than a &quot;Europe of concentric circles&quot;.

The multi-speed Europe concept has been debated for years in European political circles, as a way to solve some institutional issues. The concept is that the more members there are in the Union, the more difficult it becomes to reach consensus on various topics, and the less likely it is that all would advance at the same pace in various fields.

Intermediate forms could be limited to some areas of close cooperation, as some historical examples are given below. It is also possible now for a minimum of nine EU member states to use enhanced co-operation, but this new framework has been used only once. A second proposal, a unified European patent, is nearing completion [as of December 2010] with only two countries (Italy and Spain) not participating.

The idea of a multi-speed Europe has been revived because of the following initiatives:
* the eurozone, with 20 member states and two more in ERM II (Bulgaria and Denmark). Every EU member except Denmark has agreed by treaty to join, but many currently have no plans to do so.
* the Schengen Area, with 29 member states, 25 EU members and four non-EU members (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). It excludes two EU members: Cyprus, which is legally obligated to join in the future, and Ireland, which has an opt-out from participating.
* other initiatives limited to some states, such as the European Defence initiative and Prüm Convention.

Furthermore, important events were:
* the enlargement of the European Union to 28 member-states and in the forthcoming years other candidates (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine) where new members initially don&#x27;t join the Schengen area and the Eurozone for some time.
* the European Convention that led to the European Constitution that was signed in 2004 by the 25 Heads of State, but was not ratified by all national parliaments or assemblies and so failed. Later most of its provisions were adopted through the Treaty of Lisbon that included additional opt-outs for some states.
* differences of view between EU members on some foreign diplomatic and military issues. In a 2004 article &quot;The Economist&quot; compared the variances of Europe to a lake that has many deep parts (areas in which countries are similar) and many shallow parts (areas in which countries have major differences).
Currently in the EU there are the following cases of non-uniform application of the European Union law:


== Overview of non-uniformity inside the EU ==
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and Slovenia participate in all EU provisions.

== Participation of European countries in non EU-only integration initiatives ==
A number of countries have special relations to the European Union implementing many of its regulations. Prominently there are Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein which are the only remaining EFTA members while all other former EFTA members have converted into EU members. Through agreements Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (not including Switzerland) are members of the European Economic Area since 1994. As a consequence of taking part in the EU single market they need to adopt part of the Law of the European Union. Formally they would not need to fund the EU government but in practice they have opted to take on their part of financing EU institutions as required by EU law (see EEA and Norway Grants) with the financial footprint of Norway being equal to that of an EU member since 2009. Especially Norway and Iceland are known to forfeit EU membership on the basis of EU fishery regulations that they want to opt out on. Both Norway and Iceland have signed and implemented the Schengen zone agreements from the start. During the turmoils of the financial crisis, Iceland was looking into membership of the Eurozone and it did apply for EU membership in 2009. Norway has joined all EU political treaties and it has applied to EU membership multiple times but while fulfilling the requirements the membership was rejected by referendums in 1972 and 1994. This leaves Norway to be integrated into Inner Europe&#x27;s institutions while not being part their governing body.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==Post-Brexit-vote revival of &quot;multispeed Europe&quot; ideas==

In March 2017, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker released a five-point view of possible courses for the EC and its to-be-27 post-Brexit members, looking forward to the year 2025. The points, among which Juncker expressed no preference, &quot;range from standing down from policing of government financing of companies, for example, to a broader pullback that would essentially strip the EU back to being merely a single market&quot;, per one report.
The updated possibilities would entail member countries or groups of countries adopting different levels of participation with the union. The EC was approaching a March meeting of the 27 members in Rome and Juncker&#x27;s paper addressed the options that &quot;once invited scorn from convinced Europhiles&quot; and seemed maybe even to have some backing &quot;of lifelong federalists&quot; like the president.

<doc id="949661" wikidata="Q556171" url="?curid=949661" title="Nvi">
<text>nvi (new vi) is a re-implementation of the classic Berkeley text editor, ex/vi, traditionally distributed with BSD and, later, Unix systems. It was originally distributed as part of the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD).

Due to licensing disputes between AT&amp;T and the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, the CSRG was required to replace all Unix-derived portions of BSD source with new and unencumbered code. nvi was one of many components rewritten, despite the fact that the original vi was from UC Berkeley. AT&amp;T had a legal claim over the license.

==Credits and distribution==
nvi was written by Keith Bostic. It is the default vi on all major BSD systems (NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) as well as MINIX.

It was originally derived from the first incarnation of elvis, written by Steve Kirkendall, as noted in the README file included in nvi&#x27;s sources.

Sven Verdoolaege added support for Unicode in 2000. He also has been developing a GTK+ front end for nvi, but this effort seems to have stalled. The aspects of nvi that are still marked preliminary or unimplemented are, for the time being, likely to remain that way.

BSD projects continue to use nvi version 1.79 due to licensing differences between Berkeley Database 1.85 and the later versions by Sleepycat Software. nvi is unusual because it uses a database to store the text as it is being edited. Sven Verdoolaege&#x27;s changes after version 1.79 use locking features not available in the Berkeley DB 1.85 database. Reportedly, changes to nvi after 1.79 make it less vi-compatible.

nvi can vary subtly across the BSDs.

nvi is only available on POSIX/Unix platforms due to its reliance on the curses/ncurses library.

An unmaintained, multilingual version by the late Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino is available as nvi-m17n.
A currently-maintained, multibyte version is available as nvi2, and is the default vi on DragonFly BSD.

<doc id="949667" wikidata="Q4972421" url="?curid=949667" title="Broadway Bridge (Portland, Oregon)">
<text>The Broadway Bridge is a Rall-type bascule bridge spanning the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, built in 1913. It was Portland&#x27;s first bascule bridge, and it continues to hold the distinction of being the longest span of its bascule design type in the world. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

==History and description==
The bridge was anticipated to be the world&#x27;s longest bascule bridge and there was competition between the Strauss, Scherzer, and Rall bascule design patent holders. The &quot;Rall&quot; was selected based on cost.

Ralph Modjeski designed the structure, which opened on April 22, 1913, at a cost of $1.6 million. It was the world&#x27;s longest double-leaf bascule bridge, of any bascule type, at the time. The bridge&#x27;s name derives from the street it carries, Broadway, but at the time of the bridge&#x27;s construction that street name was in use only east of the river. The westside portion of what is now Broadway had been named 7th Avenue, but was renamed Broadway when the bridge opened and connected the two streets.

The bridge has four vehicle lanes (two lanes in each direction) that in 2006 carried about 30,000 vehicles per day. It is also a major bicycle route over the river with more than 2,000 crossings daily in 2005, and has a pair of wide sidewalks. On average, the bridge&#x27;s draw span is opened about 25 times a month.

In 1927–28, a -long viaduct was built from the bridge&#x27;s west deck, extending due west above Lovejoy Street to 14th Avenue, providing access to and from the bridge that had previously been blocked by railroad yards. This viaduct was known as the Lovejoy Ramp. A shorter ramp rising from Northwest 10th Avenue at Irving Street and connecting to the easternmost portion of the new Lovejoy viaduct was built in 1927, but not opened, due to delays to the start of work on the Lovejoy viaduct&#x27;s western section (west of 10th), and did not open until October 1928. Construction of the long viaduct section from 10th to 14th began in mid-1928, and the viaduct opened in December 1928.
The bridge was originally black, in common with the nearby Steel and Hawthorne spans, but Portland architect Lewis Crutcher suggested in 1961 that each have its own distinct color. The Broadway Bridge was repainted &quot;Golden Gate&quot; red (also known as international orange) in 1963.

The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

===Public transit use===
Streetcars originally crossed the bridge from its opening in 1913 until 1940, but by at least 1944, the abandoned tracks had been removed or paved over. Work to reinstall tracks began in 2010, and streetcar service across the bridge resumed in 2012. The Broadway Bridge was also used by trolley buses, from 1937 to 1958. In addition to the Portland Streetcar&#x27;s A Loop and B Loop lines, one TriMet bus route currently uses the bridge, route 17-Broadway.

===Modifications and repairs===
Because it is such a complicated bridge there have been frequent repairs to its structure and mechanicals. In 1948, the concrete deck was replaced with steel grating. During 1982, bicycle access was improved through an $18,000 signal and sidewalk upgrade. In order to improve access and reduce energy costs, the sidewalks and lighting were replaced in 2000–2001. The Lovejoy Ramp, the long viaduct to and from 14th Avenue, was removed in 1999 as part of a $12.4 million reconstruction, intended to open up the site of the by-then-abandoned railroad yards for redevelopment. It was rebuilt as a much shorter Lovejoy ramp, from 9th Avenue, which opened in May 2002. A $28 million renovation began in February 2003. Included in this was the replacement of steel grating with a fiber-reinforced polymer composite material called DuraSpan, made by Martin Marietta Materials. The renovation was completed in February 2005.

In July 2010, the bridge was closed to all traffic for two months in order to begin re-installing streetcar infrastructure, for an expansion of the Portland Streetcar system. Progress was sufficient to reopen two of four lanes of the bridge on September 4. Streetcar-related construction continued through 2011, including installation of the overhead power equipment. The new streetcar line opened in September 2012 and was known as the CL Line (Central Loop); in 2015, its name was changed to A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise).

==In popular culture==
The Broadway Bridge is prominently featured in the climax of the film &quot;Untraceable&quot; (2008). In the film, FBI agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) becomes stranded on the east end of the bridge after an online serial killer hacks into her car&#x27;s computer. The scene was filmed both on location as well as on a studio sound stage. The bridge is also a setting for the 1996 film &quot;Foxfire&quot;, its most notable appearance being in the final scene when Legs Sadovsky (Angelina Jolie) and Maddy Wirtz (Hedy Burress) decide to part ways.

<doc id="949670" wikidata="Q596899" url="?curid=949670" title="Miosis">
<text>Miosis, or myosis (), is excessive constriction of the pupil. The opposite condition, mydriasis, is the dilation of the pupil. Anisocoria is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other.

==Causes==

=== Age ===
* Senile miosis (a reduction in the size of a person&#x27;s pupil in old age)

=== Diseases ===
* Ehlers Danlos Syndrome
* Horner&#x27;s syndrome
* Hemorrhage into pons (intracranial hemorrhage)
* Hereditary disorders 
* Cluster headaches with ptosis
* Iridocyclitis
* Fatal familial insomnia
* Aphakia
=== Drugs ===
* Opioids such as fentanyl, morphine, heroin and methadone (the notable exception being pethidine)
* Products containing nicotine such as cigarettes, chewing tobacco or gum
* Imidazolines such as clonidine, naphazoline, oxymetazoline and tetrahydrozoline
* Antipsychotics, including risperidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine
* Cholinergic agents such as acetylcholine 
* Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
* Serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron (an anti-emetic) known by its brand name Zofran/ Emiston in BD
* Some cancer chemotherapy drugs, including camptothecin derivatives
* Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA)
* Some MAO inhibitors
* Pilocarpine eye drops and all other parasympathomimetics
* In some rare cases, when exposed to mustard gas
* Organophosphates

==Physiology of the photomotor reflex==
Light entering the eye strikes three different photoreceptors in the retina: the familiar rods and cones used in image forming and the more newly discovered photosensitive ganglion cells. The ganglion cells give information about ambient light levels, and react sluggishly compared to the rods and cones. Signals from photosensitive ganglion cells have multiple functions including acute suppression of the hormone melatonin, entrainment of the body&#x27;s circadian rhythms and regulation of the size of the pupil.

The retinal photoceptors convert light stimuli into electric impulses. Nerves involved in the resizing of the pupil connect to the pretectal nucleus of the high midbrain, bypassing the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex. From the pretectal nucleus neurons send axons to neurons of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus whose visceromotor axons run along both the left and right oculomotor nerves. Visceromotor nerve axons (which constitute a portion of cranial nerve III, along with the somatomotor portion derived from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus) synapse on ciliary ganglion neurons, whose parasympathetic axons innervate the iris sphincter muscle, producing miosis.

<text>There have been 48 individuals that have served as mayor of Columbus, Ohio, serving 53 distinct mayoralties or consecutive terms in office. The first mayor of Columbus was Jarvis W. Pike. He was appointed by the Burough Council of Columbus in 1816. The first mayor of Columbus to be elected by popular vote was John Brooks in 1834. Five mayors have served non-consecutive terms. Philo H. Olmsted is counted as both the 8th and 12th mayor, Alexander Patton as both the 17th and 19th mayor, James G. Bull as both the 22nd and 24th mayor, George J. Karb as both the 30th and 39th mayor, and Jack Sensenbrenner as both the 46th and 48th mayor. Of the individuals appointed or elected as mayor, five have resigned from office - James Robinson, John Brooks, Warren Jenkins, John G. Miller, and Jim Rhodes. No mayor has died or become permanently disabled while in office. The shortest-serving former mayor is James Robinson, who served only eight months before resigning from office on September 11, 1827. The longest-serving mayor is Michael B. Coleman, who served 16 years and is the only African American to serve as mayor. Andrew Ginther is the current mayor. He took office on January 1, 2016.

<text>Zasyadko is a small lunar impact crater located to the northeast of Mare Smythii. It was named by the IAU in 1976. It lies beyond the eastern lunar limb in an area that is only visible from Earth during favorable librations. It is located entirely within the crater Babcock. To the southwest is McAdie. Zasyadko is a bowl-shaped formation with a relatively small interior floor. It is not significantly eroded along the rim.

<text>Prumnopitys is a genus of conifers belonging to the family Podocarpaceae. The nine recognized species of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; are densely branched, dioecious evergreen trees up to 40 metres in height.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &#x27; ( ‘hindmost’) and &#x27; ( ‘pine’), referring to the resin duct being behind the midrib.

== Description ==
The leaves are similar to those of the yew, strap-shaped, 1–4 cm long and 2–3 mm broad, with a soft texture; they are green above, and with two blue-green stomatal bands below. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 1–5 cm long bearing several scales; one to five scales are fertile, each bearing a single seed surrounded by fleshy scale tissue, resembling a drupe. These berry-like cone scales are eaten by birds which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.

== Distribution ==
The species are distributed on both sides of the Pacific, in eastern Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia, and along the mountain ranges of western South America from Chile to Venezuela and Costa Rica. This distribution indicates the origins of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; in the Antarctic flora, which evolved from the humid temperate flora of southern Gondwana, an ancient supercontinent.

== Fossil record ==
Fossils of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; have been described from the Eocene of Australia, including &quot;Prumnopitys tasmanica&quot; (Townrow) Greenwood, &quot;Prumnopitys lanceolata&quot; Greenwood, and &quot;Prumnopitys portensis&quot; Pole.

== Taxonomy ==
Although the genus &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; was first described in 1861, it was only from 1978 that it was widely distinguished as distinct from the allied genus &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, despite the marked differences in cone development with different parts of the cone structure becoming fleshy and berry-like. Many older texts still have the species listed under &quot;Podocarpus&quot;.

The Chilean species for which the correct scientific name is &quot;Prumnopitys andina&quot; (previously &quot;Podocarpus andinus&quot;), has been treated by some botanists as &quot;Prumnopitys spicata&quot; (Molloy &amp; Muñoz-Schick 1999); however this name is illegitimate (Mill &amp; Quinn 2001).

Several species of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; are used for timber, though as they are slow-growing, supplies are very limited and over-cutting has led to some having an unfavourable conservation status.

<text>Matthias Alexander Castrén (2 December 1813 – 7 May 1852) was a Finnish Swedish ethnologist and philologist who was a pioneer in the study of the Uralic languages. He was an educator, author and linguist at the University of Helsinki. Castrén is known for his research in the linguistics and ethnography of the Northern Eurasian peoples.

== Early life ==
Castrén was born at Tervola, in Northern Finland. His father, Christian Castrén, parish priest and vicar at Rovaniemi, died in 1825. Castrén passed under the protection of his uncle, Matthias Castrén. At the age of twelve he was sent to school at Oulu. On entering the Alexander University at Helsinki (now University of Helsinki) in 1828 he first devoted himself to Greek and Hebrew with the intention of entering the church; but his interest was soon excited by the Finnish language and even before his course was completed he began to lay the foundations of a work on Finnish mythology. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1836 and graduate degree in 1839.

== Linguistic adventures ==

The necessity of personal explorations among the still unwritten languages of cognate tribes soon made itself evident. In 1838 he joined a medical fellow student, Dr. Ehrström, in a journey through Lapland. This was the first of the voyages Castrén undertook in order to investigate the kinship between Finnish and several other languages. Following this he was appointed in 1840 to associate professor in Finnish and Norse languages at the University of Helsinki. In the following year, he traveled in Karelia at the expense of the Literary Society of Finland.

In 1841 he undertook, in company with Finnish philologist Elias Lönnrot, a third journey, which ultimately extended beyond the Urals as far as Obdorsk, and occupied a period of three years. Before starting on this last expedition he had published a translation into Swedish of the Finnish epic of Kalevala. Upon his return he gave to the world his (1844) and (1845).

No sooner had he recovered from the illness which his last journey had occasioned than he set out, under the auspices of the Academy of St Petersburg and the Alexander University, on an exploration among the indigenous peoples of Siberia, which resulted in a vast addition to previous knowledge, but seriously affected the health of the adventurous investigator. The first fruits of his collections were published at St. Petersburg in 1849 in the form of (1858). In 1850 he published a treatise , and was appointed professor of the new chair of Finnish language and literature at the University of Helsinki. The following year saw him raised to the rank of chancellor of the university. He was busily engaged in what he regarded as his principal work, a grammar of the Samoyedic languages, when he died in 1852 at 38 years of age.

==Personal life==
In 1850, he married Lovisa Natalia Tengström (1830–1881), whose father Johan Jakob Tengström (1787–1858), was a professor of theoretical and practical philosophy at Alexander University. They were the parents of newspaper publisher and elected official (1851–1883).

== Posthumous publications ==
Five volumes of his collected works appeared from 1852 to 1858, containing respectively (1) &quot;Reseminnen från åren 1838-1844&quot;; (2) &quot;Reseberättelser och bref åren 1845-1849&quot;; (3) &quot;Föreläsningar i finsk mytologi&quot;; (4) &quot;Ethnologiska föreläsningar öfver altaiska folken&quot;; and (5) &quot;Smärre afhandlingar och akademiska dissertationer&quot;. A German translation was published by Anton Schiefner, who was also entrusted by the St Petersburg Academy with the editing of his manuscripts, which had been left to the University of Helsinki and which were subsequently published.

==M. A. Castrén Society==
The M. A. Castrén Society was founded in Helsinki on 22 January 1990. The Society creates contacts and fosters dialogue between Finns and other Uralic-speaking peoples and provides assistance for the publication of literature in the Uralic languages.

<text>Ardon (; , &quot;Ærydon&quot;) is a town and the administrative center of Ardonsky District in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, Russia, located in the center of the republic on the west bank of the Ardon River, northwest of the republic&#x27;s capital Vladikavkaz. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 18,774.

==History==
It was founded in 1824 and was granted town status in 1964.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Ardon serves as the administrative center of Ardonsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities (the settlements of Bekan and Stepnoy), incorporated within Ardonsky District as Ardon Town Under District Jurisdiction. As a municipal division, the town of Ardon and the settlement of Bekan (but not the settlement of Stepnoy) are incorporated within Ardonsky Municipal District as Ardonskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
The town is an important road and rail junction at the head of a branch line to the southern town of Alagir. It grew significantly in the 1960s, transforming into an industrial-agricultural hub with a cannery, a hemp processing factory, and other facilities for food and agricultural processing.

<doc id="949696" wikidata="Q11060227" url="?curid=949696" title="Mainspring">
<text>A mainspring is a spiral torsion spring of metal ribbon—commonly spring steel—used as a power source in mechanical watches, some clocks, and other clockwork mechanisms. &quot;Winding&quot; the timepiece, by turning a knob or key, stores energy in the mainspring by twisting the spiral tighter. The force of the mainspring then turns the clock&#x27;s wheels as it unwinds, until the next winding is needed. The adjectives wind-up and spring-powered refer to mechanisms powered by mainsprings, which also include kitchen timers, metronomes, music boxes, wind-up toys and clockwork radios.

== Modern mainsprings ==

A modern watch mainspring is a long strip of hardened and blued steel, or specialised steel alloy, 20–30 cm long and 0.05-0.2 mm thick. The mainspring in the common 1-day movement is calculated to enable the watch to run for 36 to 40 hours, i.e. 24 hours between daily windings with a power-reserve of 12 to 16 hours, in case the owner is late winding the watch. This is the normal standard for hand-wound as well as self-winding watches. 8-Day movements, used in clocks meant to be wound weekly, provide power for at least 192 hours but use longer mainsprings and bigger barrels. Clock mainsprings are similar to watch springs, only larger.

Since 1945, carbon steel alloys have been increasingly superseded by newer special alloys (iron, nickel and chromium with the addition of cobalt, molybdenum, or beryllium), and also by cold-rolled alloys (structural hardening). Known to watchmakers as &quot;white metal&quot; springs (as opposed to blued carbon steel), these are stainless and have a higher elastic limit. They are less subject to permanent bending (becoming tired) and there is scarcely any risk of their breaking. Some of them are also practically non-magnetic. Proprietary alloys include SPRON made by Seiko and Nivarox by Swatch Group.

In their relaxed form, mainsprings are made in three distinct shapes:
*&quot;Spiral coiled&quot;: These are coiled in the same direction throughout, in a simple spiral.
*&quot;Semi-reverse&quot;: The outer end of the spring is coiled in the reverse direction for less than one turn (less than 360°).
*&quot;Reverse&quot; (resilient): the outer end of the spring is coiled in the reverse direction for one or more turns (exceeding 360°).
The semi-reverse and reverse types provide extra force at the end of the running period, when the spring is almost out of energy, in order to keep the timepiece running at a constant rate to the end.

== Operation == 


The mainspring is coiled around an axle called the arbor, with the inner end hooked to it. In many clocks, the outer end is attached to a stationary post. The spring is wound up by turning the arbor, and after winding its force turns the arbor the other way to run the clock. The disadvantage of this &quot;open spring&quot; arrangement is that while the mainspring is being wound, its drive force is removed from the clock movement, so the clock may stop. This type is often used on alarm clocks, music boxes and kitchen timers where it doesn&#x27;t matter if the mechanism stops while winding. The winding mechanism always has a ratchet attached, with a pawl (called by clockmakers the &quot;click&quot;) to prevent the spring from unwinding.

In the form used in modern watches, called the &quot;going barrel&quot;, the mainspring is coiled around an arbor and enclosed inside a cylindrical box called the barrel which is free to turn. The spring is attached to the arbor at its inner end, and to the barrel at its outer end. The attachments are small hooks or tabs, which the spring is hooked to by square holes in its ends, so it can be easily replaced.

The mainspring is wound by turning the arbor, but drives the watch movement by the barrel; this arrangement allows the spring to continue powering the watch while it is being wound. Winding the watch turns the arbor, which tightens the mainspring, wrapping it closer around the arbor. The arbor has a ratchet attached to it, with a click to prevent the spring from turning the arbor backward and unwinding. After winding, the arbor is stationary and the pull of the mainspring turns the barrel, which has a ring of gear teeth around it. This meshes with one of the clock&#x27;s gears, usually the &quot;center wheel&quot; pinion and drives the wheel train. The barrel usually rotates once every 8 hours, so the common 40-hour spring requires 5 turns to unwind completely.

===Hazards===
The mainspring contains a lot of energy. If precautions are not taken during disassembly the spring can release suddenly, causing potentially serious injury. Before servicing, mainsprings are “let down” gently by pulling the click back while holding the winding key, allowing the spring to slowly unwind. However, even in their “let down” state, mainsprings contain dangerous residual tension. Watchmakers and clockmakers use a tool called a &quot;mainspring winder&quot; to safely install and remove them. Large mainsprings in clocks are immobilized by &quot;mainspring clamps&quot; before removal.

== History ==
Mainsprings appeared in the first spring-powered clocks, in 15th-century Europe. It replaced the weight hanging from a cord wrapped around a pulley, which was the power source used in all previous mechanical clocks. Around 1400 coiled springs began to be used in locks, and many early clockmakers were also locksmiths. Springs were applied to clocks to make them smaller and more portable than previous weight-driven clocks, evolving into the first pocketwatches by 1600. Many sources erroneously credit the invention of the mainspring to the Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (also spelled Henle, or Hele) around 1511. However, many references in 15th-century sources to portable clocks &#x27;without weights&#x27;, and at least two surviving examples, show that spring-driven clocks existed by the early years of that century. The oldest surviving clock powered by a mainspring is the &quot;Burgunderuhr&quot; (Burgundy Clock), an ornate, gilt chamber clock, currently at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, whose iconography suggests that it was made around 1430 for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.

The first mainsprings were made of steel without tempering or hardening processes. They didn&#x27;t run very long, and had to be wound twice a day. Henlein was noted for making watches that would run 40 hours between windings. The 18th century methods of making mainsprings are described by Berthoud and Blakey

=== Constant force from a spring ===
A problem throughout the history of spring-driven clocks and watches is that the force (torque) provided by a spring is not constant, but diminishes as the spring unwinds (see graph). However, timepieces have to run at a constant rate in order to keep accurate time. Timekeeping mechanisms are never perfectly isochronous, meaning their rate is affected by changes in the drive force. This was especially true of the primitive verge and foliot type used before the advent of the balance spring in 1657. So early clocks slowed down during their running period as the mainspring ran down, causing inaccurate timekeeping.

Two solutions to this problem appeared in the early spring-powered clocks in the 15th century; the &quot;stackfreed&quot; and the &quot;fusee&quot;:

====Stackfreed====

The stackfreed was an eccentric cam mounted on the mainspring arbor, with a spring-loaded roller that pressed against it. The cam had a &#x27;snail&#x27; shape so that early in the running period when the mainspring was pushing strongly, the spring would bear against the wide part of the cam, providing a strong opposing force, while later in the running period as the force of the mainspring decreased, the spring would bear against the narrower part of the cam and the opposing force would also decrease. The stackfreed added a lot of friction and probably reduced a clock&#x27;s running time substantially; it was only used in some German timepieces and was abandoned after about a century.

====Fusee====

The fusee was a much longer-lasting innovation. This was a cone-shaped pulley that was turned by a chain wrapped around the mainspring barrel. Its curving shape continuously changed the mechanical advantage of the linkage to even out the force of the mainspring as it ran down. Fusees became the standard method of getting constant torque from a mainspring. They were used in most spring-driven clocks and watches from their first appearance until the 19th century when the going barrel took over, and in marine chronometers until the 1970s.

====Stopwork====
Another early device which helped even out the spring&#x27;s force was &quot;stopwork&quot; or &quot;winding stops&quot;, which prevented the mainspring from being wound up all the way, and prevented it from unwinding all the way. The idea was to use only the central part of the spring&#x27;s &#x27;torque curve&#x27;, where its force was more constant. The most common form was the Geneva stop or &#x27;Maltese cross&#x27;. Stopwork isn&#x27;t needed in modern watches.

====Remontoire====

A fourth device used in a few precision timepieces was the remontoire. This was a small secondary spring or weight which powered the timepiece&#x27;s escapement, and was itself rewound periodically by the mainspring. This isolated the timekeeping element from the varying mainspring force.

====Going barrel====
The modern going barrel, invented in 1760 by Jean-Antoine Lépine, produces a constant force by simply using a longer mainspring than needed, and coiling it under tension in the barrel. In operation, only a few turns of the spring at a time are used, with the remainder pressed against the outer wall of the barrel. Mathematically, the tension creates a &#x27;flat&#x27; section in the spring&#x27;s torque curve (see graph) and only this flat section is used. In addition, the outer end of the spring is often given a reverse curve, so it has an &quot;S&quot; shape. This stores more tension in the spring&#x27;s outer turns where it is available toward the end of the running period. The result is that the barrel provides approximately constant torque over the watch&#x27;s designed running period; the torque doesn&#x27;t decline until the mainspring has almost run down.

The built-in tension of the spring in the going barrel makes it hazardous to disassemble even when not wound up.

== Broken mainsprings ==
Because they are subjected to constant stress cycles, up until the 1960s mainsprings generally broke from metal fatigue long before other parts of the timepiece. They were considered expendable items. This often happened at the end of the winding process, when the spring is wound as tightly as possible around the arbor, with no space between the coils. When manually winding, it is easy to reach this point unexpectedly and put excessive pressure on the spring. Another cause was temperature changes. If a watch was fully wound in the evening and the temperature dropped at night, without any slack between the coils the thermal contraction of the long spring could break it loose from its attachments at one end. In earlier times, watch repairers noted that changes in the weather brought in a rash of watches with broken mainsprings. Broken mainsprings were the largest cause of watch repairs until the 1960s. Since then, the improvements in spring metallurgy mentioned above have made broken mainsprings rare.

===&#x27;Knocking&#x27; or &#x27;banking&#x27;===
Even if the mainsprings were not prone to breakage, too much force during winding caused another problem in early watches, called &#x27;knocking&#x27; or &#x27;banking&#x27;. If very little slack was left in the spring after winding (&#x27;overwinding&quot;), the pressure of the last turn of the winding knob put the end of the spring under excessive tension, which was locked in by the last click of the ratchet. So the watch ran with excessive drive force for several hours, until the extra tension in the end of the spring was relieved. This made the balance wheel rotate too far in each direction, causing the impulse pin on the wheel to knock against the back of the fork horns. This caused the watch to gain time, and could break the impulse pin. In older watches this was prevented with &#x27;stopwork&#x27;. In modern watches this is prevented by designing the &#x27;click&#x27; with some &#x27;recoil&#x27; (backlash), to allow the arbor to rotate backward after winding by about two ratchet teeth, enough to remove excess tension.

===Motor or safety barrel===
Around 1900, when broken watchsprings were more of a problem, some pocketwatches used a variation of the going barrel called the &quot;motor barrel&quot; or &quot;safety barrel&quot;. Mainsprings usually broke at their attachment to the arbor, where bending stresses are greatest. When the mainspring broke, the outer part recoiled and the momentum spun the barrel in the reverse direction. This applied great force to the delicate wheel train and escapement, often breaking pivots and jewels.

In the motor barrel, the functions of the arbor and barrel were reversed from the going barrel. The mainspring was wound by the barrel, and turned the arbor to drive the wheel train. Thus if the mainspring broke, the destructive recoil of the barrel would be applied not to the wheel train but to the winding mechanism, which was robust enough to take it.

===Safety pinion===
A &quot;safety pinion&quot; was an alternate means of protection, used with the going barrel. In this, the center wheel pinion, which the barrel gear engages, was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread. If the spring broke, the reverse recoil of the barrel, instead of being passed on to the gear train, would simply unscrew the pinion.

==The myth of &#x27;overwinding&#x27;==
Watches and clocks are often found stopped with the mainspring fully wound, which led to a myth that winding a spring-driven timepiece all the way up damages it. Several problems can cause this type of breakdown, but it is never due to &quot;overwinding&quot;, as timepieces are designed to handle being wound up all the way.

One cause of “overwinding” is dirt. Watch movements require regular cleaning and lubrication, and the normal result of neglecting to get a watch cleaned is a watch stopped at full wind. As the watch movement collects dirt and the oil dries up, friction increases, so that the mainspring doesn&#x27;t have the force to turn the watch at the end of its normal running period, and it stops prematurely. If the owner continues to wind and use the watch without servicing, eventually the friction force reaches the &#x27;flat&#x27; part of the torque curve, and quickly a point is reached where the mainspring doesn&#x27;t have the force to run the watch even at full wind, so the watch stops with the mainspring fully wound. The watch needs service, but the problem is caused by a dirty movement or other defect, not &quot;overwinding&quot;.

Another common cause of a watch stopped at full wind is that if a watch is dropped then the balance staff can break and the watch can no longer run even when the mainspring is fully wound.

==Self-winding watches and &#x27;unbreakable&#x27; mainsprings==

Self-winding or automatic watches, introduced widely in the 1950s, use the natural motions of the wrist to keep the mainspring wound. A semicircular weight, pivoted at the center of the watch, rotates with each wrist motion. A winder mechanism uses rotations in both directions to wind the mainspring.

In automatic watches, motion of the wrist could continue winding the mainspring until it broke. This is prevented with a slipping clutch device. The outer end of the mainspring, instead of attaching to the barrel, is attached to a circular expansion spring called the &quot;bridle&quot; that presses against the inner wall of the barrel, which has serrations or notches to hold it. During normal winding the bridle holds by friction to the barrel, allowing the mainspring to wind. When the mainspring reaches its full tension, its pull is stronger than the bridle. Further rotation of the arbor causes the bridle to slip along the barrel, preventing further winding. In watch company terminology, this is often misleadingly referred to as an &#x27;unbreakable mainspring&#x27;.

==&#x27;Tired&#x27; or &#x27;set&#x27; mainsprings==
After decades of use, mainsprings in older timepieces are found to deform slightly and lose some of their force, becoming &#x27;tired&#x27; or &#x27;set&#x27;. This condition is mostly found in springs in barrels. It causes the running time between windings to decrease. During servicing the mainspring should be checked for &#x27;tiredness&#x27; and replaced if necessary. The British Horological Institute suggests these tests:
* In a mainspring barrel, when unwound and relaxed, most of a healthy spring&#x27;s turns should be pressed flat against the wall of the barrel, with only 1 or 2 turns spiralling across the central space to attach to the arbor. If more than 2 turns are loose in the center, the spring may be &#x27;tired&#x27;; with 4 or 5 turns it definitely is &#x27;tired&#x27;.
* When removed from the barrel, if the diameter of the relaxed spring lying on a flat surface is less than 2½ times the barrel diameter, it is &#x27;tired&#x27;.

==Power reserve indicator==

Some high-grade watches have an extra dial on the face indicating how much power is left in the mainspring, often graduated in hours the watch has left to run. Since both the arbor and the barrel turn, this mechanism requires a differential gear that measures how far the arbor has been turned, compared to the barrel.

==Unusual forms of mainspring==

A mainspring is usually a coiled metal spring, however there are exceptions:
* The wagon spring clock: During a brief time in American clockmaking history, coilable spring steel was not available in the United States, and inventive clockmakers built clocks powered by a stack of leaf springs, similar to what has traditionally served as a suspension spring for wagons.
* Other spring types are conceivable and have been used occasionally on experimental timepieces.
* Occasionally one finds an odd clock with a spring made of material other than metal, such as synthetic elastic materials.

<text>The [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] of [[New Brunswick]] (), informally and more commonly, the Cabinet of New Brunswick (), is the Cabinet of the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

Almost always made up of members of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, though not necessarily so, New Brunswick&#x27;s Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the federal Cabinet of Canada, while being smaller in size. As federal and provincial responsibilities and areas of jurisdiction differ, there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments. For example, education being a provincial domain, New Brunswick has a Minister of Education, while the federal Cabinet would not.

The Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, as representative of the King in Right of New Brunswick, appoints the Premier and the Executive Council of whichever party forms government in a given legislature, which exists to advise them on the governance of the Province. The term &quot;Lieutenant-Governor in Council&quot; refers to the Lieutenant-Governor acting on the recommendations of Cabinet, though they have no real decision-making authority. Members of the Executive Council, called Cabinet Ministers, are appointed on the recommendation of the Premier, at whose pleasure they serve, and each oversees a certain area of the provincial government, called a &quot;portfolio&quot;. Some Ministers head entire government departments (&quot;Minister of ...&quot;), while others are responsible for parts of departments or cross-government initiatives (&quot;Minister responsible for ...&quot;).
The Cabinet meets on a weekly basis during the fall, winter and spring, and a monthly basis during the summer, at which Ministers and the Premier discuss policy matters and the governance of the Province. Such meetings are confidential, under the principle of &quot;Cabinet confidentiality&quot;, and Ministers must agree to present a united front based on whichever decision is taken. Government departments will often bring proposals to Cabinet for direction or approval (for example, to draft a Bill or enter into an agreement), on which Cabinet will issue a decision and, where applicable, provide a recommendation to the Lieutenant-Governor for issuing an Order-in-Council.

There are currently two committees within the Cabinet: Policy and Priorities Board, which studies strategic and policy matters and is chaired by the Premier, and Treasury Board, which studies financial and administrative matters and is chaired by the Minister of Finance. The two committees may also hold a joint meeting. There was previously a COVID-19 Cabinet Committee, which, uniquely, included members from all parties in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly. However, in late 2021, committee members from the Green and Liberal parties quit the committee over a controversy in which the provincial government had issued an emergency order forcing striking healthcare workers back to work.

==Current cabinet==
The current Cabinet is led by Premier Susan Holt. The governing party is the Liberal Association.

<text>Chang-rae Lee (born July 29, 1965) is a Korean-American novelist and a professor of creative writing at Stanford University. He was previously Professor of Creative Writing at Princeton and director of Princeton University&#x27;s Program in Creative Writing.

==Early life==
Lee was born in South Korea in 1965 to Young Yong and Inja Hong Lee. He immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 3 years old to join his father, who was then a psychiatric resident and later established a successful practice in Westchester County, New York. In a 1999 interview with Ferdinand M. De Leon, Lee described his childhood as &quot;a standard suburban American upbringing,&quot; in which he attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, before earning a B.A. in English at Yale University in 1987. After working as an equities analyst on Wall Street for a year, he enrolled at the University of Oregon. With the manuscript for &quot;Native Speaker&quot; as his thesis, he received a master of fine arts degree in writing in 1993 and became an assistant professor of creative writing at the university. On 19 June 1993 Lee married architect Michelle Branca, with whom he has two daughters. The success of his debut novel, &quot;Native Speaker&quot;, led Lee to move to Hunter College of the City University of New York, where he was hired to direct and teach in the prestigious creative-writing program.

==Career==
Lee&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Native Speaker&quot; (1995), won numerous awards including the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel. Centered on a Korean-American industrial spy, the novel explores themes of alienation and betrayal as experienced by immigrants and first-generation citizens, in their struggle to assimilate in American life. In 1999, he published his second novel, &quot;A Gesture Life&quot;. This elaborated on his themes of identity and assimilation through the narrative of an elderly Japanese immigrant in the US who was born in Korea but later adopted to a Japanese family and remembers treating Korean comfort women during World War II. For this book, Lee received the Asian American Literary Award. His 2004 novel &quot;Aloft&quot; received mixed notices from the critics and featured Lee&#x27;s first protagonist who is not Asian American, but a disengaged and isolated Italian-American suburbanite forced to deal with his world. It received the 2006 Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature in the Adult Fiction category. His 2010 novel &quot;The Surrendered&quot; won the 2011 Dayton Literary Peace Prize and was a nominated finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Lee&#x27;s next novel, &quot;On Such a Full Sea&quot; (2014) is set in a dystopian future version of the American city of Baltimore, Maryland called B-Mor where the main character, Fan, is a Chinese-American laborer working as a diver in a fish farm. It was a finalist for the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award.

In 2016, Lee joined the faculty of Stanford University, where he is the Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Professor of English. He previously taught creative writing in the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University. He was also a Shinhan Distinguished Visiting Professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea.

Lee has compared his writing process to spelunking. &quot;You kind of create the right path for yourself. But, boy, are there so many points at which you think, absolutely, I&#x27;m going down the wrong hole here. And I can&#x27;t get back to the right hole.&quot;

==Major themes==
Lee explores issues central to the Asian-American experience: the legacy of the past; the encounter of diverse cultures; the challenges of racism and discrimination, and exclusion; dreams achieved and dreams deferred. In the process of developing and defining itself, then, Asian-American literature speaks to the very heart of what it means to be American. The authors of this literature above all concern themselves with identity, with the question of becoming and being American, of being accepted, not &quot;foreign.&quot; Lee&#x27;s writings have addressed these questions of identity, exile and diaspora, assimilation, and alienation.

== Awards and honors ==
In 2015, the American Library Association included &quot;On Such a Full Sea&quot; on their list of the year&#x27;s Notable Books.

<text>Zeeman is a lunar impact crater located on the far side of the Moon near its south pole. It is not directly visible from the Earth. To the northwest of Zeeman lies the crater Numerov. Southeast of the rim is the crater Ashbrook.

The outer rim of Zeeman is eroded somewhat irregularly, with considerable variation in width of the inner slopes. The crater Zeeman Y lies across the northern wall, reaching almost to the relatively flat interior floor. In the western rim is a small crater that joins a gash that runs down to the floor. The surface of the interior is pock-marked by many tiny craterlets, and worn crater features. There is a low central rise, offset to the southeast of the interior midpoint.

An unusual, (officially) unnamed massif is present in the northwest section of the rim, which rises about 4.0 km above adjacent parts of the rim and about 7.57 km above the crater floor. The formation of the massif does not appear to be explainable simply on the basis of the impact that created the crater.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zeeman.

<text>Prigorodny District (; ; ) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the eight in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania, Russia. It is located in the east of the republic. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) of Oktyabrskoye.

==History==
One of the oldest centers of settlement of the Ingush on the plane is the Tarskoye Valley, the name of which derives from the villagers of Tärsh in the Armkhi Gorge. According to Georgian geographer Vakhushti Bagrationi, the village &quot;Angusht&quot; had already existed in the 17th century in the Tarskoye Valley. The exonym “Ingush” originated from this village.

As a result of the policy of the government of the Russian Empire in the North Caucasus, aimed at deporting the highlanders from part of the plains and foothill settlements, a strip was created on the lands that previously belonged to the Ingush, which was a line of Cossack villages, the &quot;Sunzha Line&quot;, dividing the plain from mountainous Ingushetia. In the middle of the 19th century, the Ingush were evicted from a number of villages located on the territory of the present-day Prigorodny district, after which the Cossack &quot;stanitsa&quot; &quot;Tarskaya&quot; was built on the site of the village Angusht. The same happened on other Ingush lands: on the site of the village Akhki-Yurt appeared the &quot;Sunzhenskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Tauzen-Yurt — the &quot;Vorontsovsko-Dashkovskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Akh-Borze — the &quot;Assinovskaya stanitsa&quot;, on the site of the village Mahmad-Khithe — the &quot;Voznesenskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Alkhaste — the &quot;Feldmarshalskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Ghazhara-Yurt — the &quot;Nesterovskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Ildarkha-Ghala — the &quot;Karabulakskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Ebarg-Yurt — the &quot;Troitskaya stanitsa&quot;; on the site of the village Sholkhi — the &quot;Tarskiy khutor&quot;, as well as the &quot;Sleptsovskaya, Datikhskaya, Mikhailovksya and Galashevskaya stanitsa&#x27;s&quot;.

After decades of hostilities and skirmishes between the Cossack settlers and Ingush, the civil war of the early 20th century, in which the majority of the Ingush took up arms against the White Army during the Russian Revolution, became the main reason that the Cossack population from the above villages had to be deported, after which many of the occupied villages and lands were returned to the Ingush.

Until 1944, the eastern part of the modern Prigorodny District of was part of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On March 7, 1944, after the deportation of Chechens and Ingush to Kazakhstan and Central Asia, the territory was included in the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. At the same time, the mountainous part of this territory (the southern region of present-day Ingushetia) was transferred to the Georgian SSR. On November 24, 1956, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU adopted a resolution on the restoration of the national autonomy of the Chechen and Ingush peoples, but the Prigorodny district remained part of North Ossetia.

Unlike the rest of the republic where Ossetians account for the majority of the population, the district has a significant Ingush population. The district in its eastern part is still considered a troublesome zone of the republic due to the high tensions between the Ingush and Ossetians.

<text>Zeno is a lunar impact crater located near the northwestern limb of the Moon. It was named by the IAU in 1935.

The rim of Zeno is slightly distorted and has received some erosion due to subsequent impacts. There is a depression in the surface attached to the eastern rim, forming a bulging extension. Small craters lie on the southern rim and across the interior of the northern wall. The crater Zeno B is attached to the exterior of the southwestern rim, and the distorted Zeno A is attached in turn to the western rim of Zeno B.

Zeno lies to the east-southeast of the crater Mercurius. Farther to the east of Zeno, along the limb, is the well-formed crater Boss.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zeno.
