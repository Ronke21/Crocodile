<text>Hot Jupiters (sometimes called hot Saturns) are a class of gas giant exoplanets that are inferred to be physically similar to Jupiter but that have very short orbital periods (). The close proximity to their stars and high surface-atmosphere temperatures resulted in their informal name &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;.

Hot Jupiters are the easiest extrasolar planets to detect via the radial-velocity method, because the oscillations they induce in their parent stars&#x27; motion are relatively large and rapid compared to those of other known types of planets. One of the best-known hot Jupiters is . Discovered in 1995, it was the first extrasolar planet found orbiting a Sun-like star. has an orbital period of about four days.

== General characteristics ==

Though there is diversity among hot Jupiters, they do share some common properties.
* Their defining characteristics are their large masses and short orbital periods, spanning 0.36–11.8 Jupiter masses and 1.3–111 Earth days. The mass cannot be greater than approximately 13.6 Jupiter masses because then the pressure and temperature inside the planet would be high enough to cause deuterium fusion, and the planet would be a brown dwarf.
* Most have nearly circular orbits (low eccentricities). It is thought that their orbits are circularized by perturbations from nearby stars or tidal forces. Whether they remain in these circular orbits for long periods of time or collide with their host stars depends on the coupling of their orbital and physical evolution, which are related through the dissipation of energy and tidal deformation.
* Many have unusually low densities. The lowest one measured thus far is that of TrES-4b at 0.222 g/cm3. The large radii of hot Jupiters are not yet fully understood but it is thought that the expanded envelopes can be attributed to high stellar irradiation, high atmospheric opacities, possible internal energy sources, and orbits close enough to their stars for the outer layers of the planets to exceed their Roche limit and be pulled further outward.
* Usually they are tidally locked, with one side always facing its host star.
* They are likely to have extreme and exotic atmospheres due to their short periods, relatively long days, and tidal locking.
*Atmospheric dynamics models predict strong vertical stratification with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jets driven by radiative forcing and the transfer of heat and momentum. Recent models also predict a variety of storms (vortices) that can mix their atmospheres and transport hot and cold regions of gas. 
*The day-night temperature difference at the photosphere is predicted to be substantial, approximately for a model based on HD 209458 b.
* They appear to be more common around F- and G-type stars and less so around K-type stars. Hot Jupiters around red dwarfs are very rare. Generalizations about the distribution of these planets must take into account the various observational biases, but in general their prevalence decreases exponentially as a function of the absolute stellar magnitude.

== Formation and evolution ==
There are three schools of thought regarding the possible origin of hot Jupiters. One possibility is that they were formed &quot;in situ&quot; at the distances at which they are currently observed. Another possibility is that they were formed at a distance but later migrated inward. Such a shift in position might occur due to interactions with gas and dust during the solar nebula phase. It might also occur as a result of a close encounter with another large object destabilizing a Jupiter&#x27;s orbit.

=== Migration ===
In the migration hypothesis, a hot Jupiter forms beyond the frost line, from rock, ice, and gases via the core accretion method of planetary formation. The planet then migrates inwards to the star where it eventually forms a stable orbit. The planet may have migrated inward smoothly via type II orbital migration. Or it may have migrated more suddenly due to gravitational scattering onto eccentric orbits during an encounter with another massive planet, followed by the circularization and shrinking of the orbits due to tidal interactions with the star. A hot Jupiter&#x27;s orbit could also have been altered via the Kozai mechanism, causing an exchange of inclination for eccentricity resulting in a high eccentricity low perihelion orbit, in combination with tidal friction. This requires a massive body—another planet or a stellar companion—on a more distant and inclined orbit; approximately 50% of hot Jupiters have distant Jupiter-mass or larger companions, which can leave the hot Jupiter with an orbit inclined relative to the star&#x27;s rotation.

The type II migration happens during the solar nebula phase, i.e. when gas is still present. Energetic stellar photons and strong stellar winds at this time remove most of the remaining nebula. Migration via the other mechanism can happen after the loss of the gas disk.

=== In situ ===
Instead of being gas giants that migrated inward, in an alternate hypothesis the cores of the hot Jupiters began as more common super-Earths which accreted their gas envelopes at their current locations, becoming gas giants &quot;in situ&quot;. The super-Earths providing the cores in this hypothesis could have formed either &quot;in situ&quot; or at greater distances and have undergone migration before acquiring their gas envelopes. Since super-Earths are often found with companions, the hot Jupiters formed &quot;in situ&quot; could also be expected to have companions. The increase of the mass of the locally growing hot Jupiter has a number of possible effects on neighboring planets. If the hot Jupiter maintains an eccentricity greater than 0.01, sweeping secular resonances can increase the eccentricity of a companion planet, causing it to collide with the hot Jupiter. The core of the hot Jupiter in this case would be unusually large. If the hot Jupiter&#x27;s eccentricity remains small the sweeping secular resonances could also tilt the orbit of the companion. Traditionally, the &quot;in situ&quot; mode of conglomeration has been disfavored because the assembly of massive cores, which is necessary for the formation of hot Jupiters, requires surface densities of solids ≈ 104 g/cm2, or larger. Recent surveys, however, have found that the inner regions of planetary systems are frequently occupied by super-Earth type planets. If these super-Earths formed at greater distances and migrated closer, the formation of &quot;in situ&quot; hot Jupiters is not entirely &quot;in situ&quot;.

===Atmospheric loss===
If the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter is stripped away via hydrodynamic escape, its core may become a chthonian planet. The amount of gas removed from the outermost layers depends on the planet&#x27;s size, the gases forming the envelope, the orbital distance from the star, and the star&#x27;s luminosity. In a typical system, a gas giant orbiting at 0.02 AU around its parent star loses 5–7% of its mass during its lifetime, but orbiting closer than 0.015 AU can mean evaporation of a substantially larger fraction of the planet&#x27;s mass. No such objects have been found yet and they are still hypothetical.
== Terrestrial planets in systems with hot Jupiters ==
Simulations have shown that the migration of a Jupiter-sized planet through the inner protoplanetary disk (the region between 5 and 0.1 AU from the star) is not as destructive as expected. More than 60% of the solid disk materials in that region are scattered outward, including planetesimals and protoplanets, allowing the planet-forming disk to reform in the gas giant&#x27;s wake. In the simulation, planets up to two Earth masses were able to form in the habitable zone after the hot Jupiter passed through and its orbit stabilized at 0.1 AU. Due to the mixing of inner-planetary-system material with outer-planetary-system material from beyond the frost line, simulations indicated that the terrestrial planets that formed after a hot Jupiter&#x27;s passage would be particularly water-rich. According to a 2011 study, hot Jupiters may become disrupted planets while migrating inwards; this could explain an abundance of &quot;hot&quot; Earth-sized to Neptune-sized planets within 0.2 AU of their host star.

One example of these sorts of systems is that of WASP-47. There are three inner planets and an outer gas giant in the habitable zone. The innermost planet, WASP-47e, is a large terrestrial planet of 6.83 Earth masses and 1.8 Earth radii; the hot Jupiter, b, is little heavier than Jupiter, but about 12.63 Earth radii; a final hot Neptune, c, is 15.2 Earth masses and 3.6 Earth radii. A similar orbital architecture is also exhibited by the Kepler-30 system.

==Misaligned orbits==
Several hot Jupiters, such as HD 80606 b, have orbits that are misaligned with their host stars, including several with retrograde orbits such as HAT-P-14b. This misalignment may be related to the heat of the photosphere the hot Jupiter is orbiting. There are several proposed hypotheses as to why this might occur. One such hypothesis involves tidal dissipation and suggests there is a single mechanism for producing hot Jupiters and this mechanism yields a range of obliquities. Cooler stars with higher tidal dissipation damps the obliquity (explaining why hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are well aligned) while hotter stars do not damp the obliquity (explaining the observed misalignment). Another hypothesis is that the host star sometimes changes rotation early in its evolution, rather than the orbit changing. Yet another hypothesis is that hot Jupiters tend to form in dense clusters, where perturbations are more common and gravitational capture of planets by neighboring stars is possible.

==Ultra-hot Jupiters==
Ultra-hot Jupiters are hot Jupiters with a dayside temperature greater than . In such dayside atmospheres, most molecules dissociate into their constituent atoms and circulate to the nightside where they recombine into molecules again.

One example is TOI-1431b, announced by the University of Southern Queensland in April 2021, which has an orbital period of just two and a half days. Its dayside temperature is , making it hotter than 40% of stars in our galaxy. The nightside temperature is .

==Ultra-short period planets==

Ultra-short period planets (USP) are a class of planets with orbital periods below one day and occur only around stars of less than about 1.25 solar masses.

Confirmed transiting hot Jupiters that have orbital periods of less than one day include WASP-18b, Banksia, Astrolábos and WASP-103b.

==Puffy planets==
Gas giants with a large radius and very low density are sometimes called &quot;puffy planets&quot; or &quot;hot Saturns&quot;, due to their density being similar to Saturn&#x27;s. Puffy planets orbit close to their stars so that the intense heat from the star combined with internal heating within the planet will help inflate the atmosphere. Six large-radius low-density planets have been detected by the transit method. In order of discovery they are: HAT-P-1b, CoRoT-1b, TrES-4b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, and Kepler-7b. Some hot Jupiters detected by the radial-velocity method may be puffy planets. Most of these planets are around or below Jupiter mass as more massive planets have stronger gravity keeping them at roughly Jupiter&#x27;s size. Indeed, hot Jupiters with masses below Jupiter, and temperatures above 1800 Kelvin, are so inflated and puffed out that they are all on unstable evolutionary paths which eventually lead to Roche-Lobe overflow and the evaporation and loss of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere.

Even when taking surface heating from the star into account, many transiting hot Jupiters have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between atmospheric winds and the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up, causing it to expand. The hotter the planet, the greater the atmospheric ionization, and thus the greater the magnitude of the interaction and the larger the electric current, leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that planetary temperature is correlated with inflated planetary radii.

== Moons ==
Theoretical research suggests that hot Jupiters are unlikely to have moons, due to both a small Hill sphere and the tidal forces of the stars they orbit, which would destabilize any satellite&#x27;s orbit, the latter process being stronger for larger moons. This means that for most hot Jupiters, stable satellites would be small asteroid-sized bodies. Furthermore, the physical evolution of hot Jupiters can determine the final fate of their moons: stall them in semi-asymptotic semimajor axes, or eject them from the system where they may undergo other unknown processes. In spite of this, observations of WASP-12b suggest that it is orbited by at least one large exomoon.

== Hot Jupiters around red giants ==
It has been proposed that gas giants orbiting red giants at distances similar to that of Jupiter could be hot Jupiters due to the intense irradiation they would receive from their stars. It is very likely that in the Solar System Jupiter will become a hot Jupiter after the transformation of the Sun into a red giant. The recent discovery of particularly low-density gas giants orbiting red giant stars supports this hypothesis.

Hot Jupiters orbiting red giants would differ from those orbiting main-sequence stars in a number of ways, most notably the possibility of accreting material from the stellar winds of their stars and, assuming a fast rotation (not tidally locked to their stars), a much more evenly distributed heat with many narrow-banded jets. Their detection using the transit method would be much more difficult due to their tiny size compared to the stars they orbit, as well as the long time needed (months or even years) for one to transit their star as well as to be occulted by it.

==Star–planet interactions==
Theoretical research since 2000 suggested that &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; may cause increased flaring due to the interaction of the magnetic fields of the star and its orbiting exoplanet, or because of tidal forces between them. These effects are called &quot;star–planet interactions&quot; or SPIs. The HD 189733 system is the best-studied exoplanet system where this effect was thought to occur.

In 2008, a team of astronomers first described how as the exoplanet orbiting HD 189733 A reaches a certain place in its orbit, it causes increased stellar flaring. In 2010, a different team found that every time they observe the exoplanet at a certain position in its orbit, they also detected X-ray flares. In 2019, astronomers analyzed data from Arecibo Observatory, MOST, and the Automated Photoelectric Telescope, in addition to historical observations of the star at radio, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths to examine these claims. They found that the previous claims were exaggerated and the host star failed to display many of the brightness and spectral characteristics associated with stellar flaring and solar active regions, including sunspots. Their statistical analysis also found that many stellar flares are seen regardless of the position of the exoplanet, therefore debunking the earlier claims. The magnetic fields of the host star and exoplanet do not interact, and this system is no longer believed to have a &quot;star-planet interaction.&quot; Some researchers had also suggested that HD 189733 accretes, or pulls, material from its orbiting exoplanet at a rate similar to those found around young protostars in T Tauri star systems. Later analysis demonstrated that very little, if any, gas was accreted from the &quot;hot Jupiter&quot; companion.

<text>Eric Shannon Moulds (born July 17, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Mississippi State University and was drafted by the Buffalo Bills 24th overall in the 1996 NFL draft. In 2009, Moulds (affectionately called E-Money for short) was one of three receivers named to the Buffalo Bills 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==College career==
At Mississippi State University, Moulds caught 117 passes for 2,022 yards (averaging 17.1 per catch). He ranks fifth in yards and fourth in touchdowns on Mississippi State&#x27;s career receiving list. 1993, he had 17 catches for 398 yards and 4 TD while being utilized as a vertical receiver. In 1994, he had 39 catches for 845 yards and 7 TD. He followed that up in 1995 with 62 catches for 779 yards and 6 TD.

In 1994, Moulds led the NCAA Division I-A in kickoff returns with a 32.8 yds/return average.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
=== 1996 NFL draft ===
Several NFL teams were hesitant to draft Moulds because of perceived character issues. One Dallas Cowboys scout characterized Moulds as a &quot;me guy&quot;, and Chicago Bears head coach Dave Wannstedt told a scout that he would not draft Moulds in any round because Moulds had once ordered a pizza to be delivered to the field before a game and had refused to participate in a team meeting after the Senior Bowl game, in which he dropped nine passes.

===Buffalo Bills===
Moulds was the Bills&#x27; first round draft pick (24th overall) in 1996. For his first two seasons, Moulds was stuck on the depth chart behind receivers Andre Reed and Quinn Early.

Moulds finally had his breakout season in 1998, where set a single-season team record with 1,368 receiving yards, a total that led the AFC and was second in the league. That record would stand until 2020, when Stefon Diggs would earn a total of 1,535 yards. Moulds also has the Bills&#x27; third-highest single-season total, with 1,326 in 2002. Moulds&#x27;s 20.4 yards per catch was second in the NFL in 1998.

In his eight seasons as the number one receiver for the Bills (1998–2005), Moulds had 626 receptions for 8,523 yards, an average of 78.25 catches and 1,065 yards per season. Moulds&#x27;s yardage was 7th-most in the NFL over that span.

In 2002, Moulds became the first player in Bills history to log 100 receptions in a single season. His team record for receptions in a season would stand until Stefon Diggs broke the record in 2020 with 127.

In the playoffs, Moulds had an NFL playoff record 240 receiving yards against the Miami Dolphins, though he notably lost a fumble on the Bills&#x27; first play, a 65-yard pass from Doug Flutie. Buffalo lost 24–17.

Moulds established himself as one of the premier receivers in football in the late 1990s and early 2000s, amassing 764 career receptions and being selected to three Pro Bowls (1998, 2000, 2002).

In 2005 Moulds was suspended for one game for conduct detrimental to the team for a sideline dispute with wide receivers coach Tyke Tolbert in a 24–23 loss at Miami in which the Bills blew a lead in the fourth quarter.

===2006 and 2007 seasons===
On April 4, 2006, Moulds was traded to the Houston Texans, in exchange for their fifth round draft pick in the 2006 NFL draft, which the Bills would eventually use on future All-Pro defensive tackle Kyle Williams. Moulds was released from the Texans after the 2006 season. After his release, Moulds criticized then-Texans quarterback David Carr, saying &quot;[t]he quarterback has to show that he can carry [the team].&quot;

The Tennessee Titans signed Moulds on July 25, 2007, and at the beginning of the season he had earned a starting position. Moulds played in all 16 games in 2007, having the 4th most receptions on his team, 2nd most by wide receivers, with 32 catches for 342 yards. The Titans released Moulds after the 2007 season.

<text>Eddie Bernice Johnson (December 3, 1934 – December 31, 2023) was an American politician who represented Texas&#x27;s in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2023. Johnson was a member of the Democratic Party.

Johnson was elected to the House in 1992, becoming the first registered nurse in Congress. At the swearing-in of the 116th United States Congress, she became dean of Texas&#x27;s congressional delegation. Upon Representative Don Young&#x27;s death in March 2022, Johnson became the oldest member of the House of Representatives. She retired at the end of the 117th Congress.

Johnson also served in the Texas House of Representatives, where she was elected in 1972 in a landslide, the first black woman to win electoral office from Dallas. She also served three terms in the Texas Senate.

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Eddie Bernice Johnson was born in Waco, Texas, on December 3, 1934, to Edward Johnson, a tailor, and Lillie Mae White Johnson, a homemaker. She and her three siblings grew up attending Toliver Chapel Baptist Church, where her mother was an active member. Johnson had aspired to a career in medicine since childhood, and wished to become a doctor, but was told by a high school guidance counselor that this would not be possible because she was female. Johnson graduated from A.J. Moore High School at age 16, and moved to Indiana to attend Saint Mary&#x27;s College of Notre Dame, where she graduated in 1955 with her nursing certificate. She transferred to Texas Christian University, from which she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in nursing. She later attended Southern Methodist University and earned a Master of Public Administration in 1976.

Johnson was the first African American to serve as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital. She entered politics after 16 years in that position.

==Early political career==
After passage of civil-rights legislation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which enabled African Americans in the South to register and vote, more African Americans began to run for office and be elected. Johnson first became known in Dallas as a civil-rights activist in the 1960s.

In 1972, as an underdog candidate running for a seat in the Texas House, Johnson won a landslide victory. She was the first black woman ever elected to public office from Dallas. She soon became the first woman in Texas history to lead a major Texas House committee, the Labor Committee.

Johnson left the State House in 1977, when President Jimmy Carter appointed her as the regional director for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the first African-American woman to hold this position.

Johnson entered electoral politics again in 1986, when she was elected as a Texas state senator. She was the first woman and the first African American from the Dallas area to hold this office since Reconstruction. Her concerns included health care, education, public housing, racial equity, economic development, and job expansion. Johnson served on the Finance Committee, for which she chaired the subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and the Education Committee. She wrote legislation to regulate diagnostic radiology centers, require drug testing in hospitals, prohibit discrimination against AIDS victims, improve access to health care for AIDS patients, and prohibit hospital kickbacks to doctors. A fair-housing advocate, she sponsored a bill to empower city governments to repair substandard housing at landlords&#x27; expense, and wrote a bill to enforce prohibitions against housing discrimination.

Johnson worked against racism while dealing with discrimination in the legislature. &quot;Being a woman and being black is perhaps a double handicap,&quot; she told the &quot;Chicago Tribune.&quot; &quot;When you see who&#x27;s in the important huddles, who&#x27;s making the important decisions, it&#x27;s men.&quot; Johnson sponsored several bills aimed at equity, including a bill to establish goals for Texas to do business with &quot;socially disadvantaged&quot; businesses. She crafted a fair-housing act aimed at toughening fair-housing laws and establishing a commission to investigate complaints of discriminatory housing practices.

Johnson also held committee hearings and investigated complaints. In 1989, she testified in federal court about racism in Dallas&#x27;s city government. In 1992, she formally asked the Justice Department to investigate harassment of local black students. That same year, she held hearings to examine discrimination charges about unfair contracting bids for the government&#x27;s Superconducting Super Collider.

Johnson feared the legacy that discrimination leaves for youth. &quot;I am frightened to see young people who believe that a racist power structure is responsible for every negative thing that happens to them,&quot; she told the &quot;New York Times.&quot; &quot;After a point it does not matter whether these perceptions are true or false; it is the perceptions that matter.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Midway through her second term in the state senate, Johnson ran in the Democratic primary for the newly created 30th congressional district. She defeated Republican nominee Lucy Cain 72%-25% in the 1992 general election, and became the first nurse elected to the United States Congress. In 1994, she defeated Cain again, 73%-26%.

In 1996, after her district was significantly redrawn as a result of &quot;Bush v. Vera,&quot; she was reelected to a third term with 55% of the vote, the worst election performance of her congressional career. All the candidates in the race appeared on a single ballot regardless of party, and Johnson faced two other Democrats. Proving just how Democratic this district still was, the three Democrats tallied 73% of the vote.

Johnson never faced another contest nearly that close. She was reelected nine more times with at least 72% of the vote. In 2012, Johnson easily beat two opponents in the Democratic primary, State Representative Barbara Mallory Caraway and lawyer Taj Clayton, gaining 70% of the vote; she won the general election with almost 79% of the vote. She was reelected in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. In October 2019, Johnson announced she would retire in 2022.

===Tenure===
The 17th chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Johnson opposed the Iraq Resolution of 2002. During debate on the House floor, she stated:

I am not convinced that giving the President the authority to launch a unilateral, first-strike attack on Iraq is the appropriate course of action at this time. While I believe that under international law and under the authority of our Constitution, the United States must maintain the option to act in its own self-defense, I strongly believe that the administration has not provided evidence of an imminent threat of attack on the United States that would justify a unilateral strike. I also believe that actions alone, without exhausting peaceful options, could seriously harm global support for our war on terrorism and distract our own resources from this cause.

In 2007, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Jim Oberstar appointed Johnson chair of its Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment during the 110th and 111th Congresses. She was the first African American and first woman in Congress to chair this subcommittee. As Subcommittee Chair, Johnson sponsored the Water Resources Development Act. She led Congress in overriding President Bush&#x27;s veto of it, the only veto override of his presidency.

During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Johnson initially supported U.S. Senator John Edwards. After he withdrew from the race, she pledged her support as a superdelegate to Barack Obama. Her district backed Obama heavily in the election.

Johnson and Representative Donna Edwards proposed a publicly funded park on the moon to mark where the Apollo missions landed between 1969 and 1972. The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, H.R. 2617, calls for the park to be run jointly by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Johnson attended COP26 in 2021 and urged immediate climate action, warning, &quot;Scientists have been sounding the alarm on climate for years&quot; and &quot;Inaction is not an option&quot;. &quot;We are working to build a clean energy future while creating high quality jobs, and so much more&quot;, she said.

====Armenian genocide denial====
Johnson consistently opposed the historical consensus on the Armenian genocide. In 2009, when asked if she acknowledged the Armenian genocide, she responded &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; In 2017, when interviewed for a film and asked if she denied that the Armenian genocide occurred, Johnson replied &quot;I do deny that.&quot; In 2019, Johnson was one of three House members to vote &quot;present&quot; on a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. The Armenian National Committee of America gave Johnson an F− rating for her voting record during the 117th congress.

====Presidential election objections====
In 2001, Johnson and other House members objected to counting Florida&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election. Because no senator joined her objection, it was dismissed by Senate President Al Gore.

In 2005, Johnson was one of 31 House Democrats who voted not to count Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote, in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Johnson voted to certify Joe Biden&#x27;s win in the 2020 presidential election. Johnson called the 2021 United States Capitol attack &quot;like a real war&quot;.

====Scholarship violations====
In August 2010, Amy Goldson, counsel for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, said that Johnson violated organizational rules by awarding at least 15 scholarships to relatives of her own or to children of her district director, Rod Givens. The awards violated an anti-nepotism rule and the recipients did not qualify for the scholarships because they were not residents of Johnson&#x27;s district. Johnson said she &quot;unknowingly&quot; made a mistake in awarding the grants and would work with the foundation to rectify it.

Opponent Stephen Broden released letters bearing Johnson&#x27;s signature in which she requested that the scholarship check be made out to and sent directly to her relatives, instead of to the destination university as would normally be done. The &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; ran an editorial questioning her changing story on the matter, saying that it was overshadowing her service in the House.

===Committees===
In December 2010, Johnson became the first African American and the first female Ranking Member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. From 2000 to 2002, she was the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education. Johnson has been a strong advocate of investing in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. In 2012, she introduced the Broadening Participation in STEM Education Act, which would authorize the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award grants to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups receiving STEM degrees. The bill would also expand the number of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups at colleges and universities.

== Personal life and death ==
Johnson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and The Links. In 1956, she married educator Lacey Kirk Johnson. They had one child, a son. The marriage ended in divorce in 1970.

Johnson died in Dallas on December 31, 2023, at the age of 89, shortly after being admitted into hospice care. Three days later, her family announced plans to file a lawsuit against her health-care providers, claiming medical negligence was responsible for her death.

== Legacy ==
Dallas Independent School District opened an elementary school in Wilmer, Texas, named after Johnson, in 2020.

Dallas Union Station is officially known as &quot;Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station&quot; after Johnson.

==College career==
Henry attended the University of Tennessee from 1997 to 2000. While at Tennessee, he played college football under head coach Phillip Fulmer.

===1997 season===

In regular season play, he made 176 rushing attempts for 970 yards and four touchdowns as well as four receptions for 31 yards.

====2004 season====
In the 2004 season, Henry was injured for the later part of the year and lost his starting job to the Bills&#x27; 2003 first round pick, Willis McGahee, in Week 8. He appeared in ten games and finished with 94 carries for 326 rushing yards. Henry refused to accept becoming McGahee&#x27;s backup and demanded a trade. Buffalo conceded to his demand and traded him to the Tennessee Titans.

===Tennessee Titans===
In July 2005, Henry was dealt to the Tennessee Titans for a third round draft pick in 2006. Henry was suspended four games during the 2005 season for violating the NFL&#x27;s substance abuse policy.

====2005 season====
In the 2005 season, Henry was the backup to Chris Brown for his first season with the Titans. He appeared in ten games and started one. He recorded 88 carries for 335 rushing yards to go along with 13 receptions for 117 receiving yards in the 2005 season.

====2006 season====

In the following game, a 25–22 victory over Washington, he had 32 carries for 178 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. In Week 11, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had 18 carries for 143 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 31–13 victory. On December 3, 2006, Henry became the 100th running back in NFL history to rush for more than 5,000 career yards. On Christmas Eve in 2006, Henry broke the 1,000 yard mark for the 2006 NFL season against his former team, the Buffalo Bills. Henry played a significant role in the Titans&#x27; win as he rushed for 135 yards total. He finished the 2006 NFL season with 270 carries for 1,211 rushing yards at 4.5 yards per carry and seven rushing touchdowns. He got into the end zone seven times while only fumbling three times. In addition, he caught 22 passes for 179 yards, at an average of 8.1 yards per reception, giving him 1,282 all-purpose yards. Nevertheless, the Titans released him, which was seen as a cost-cutting move.

===Denver Broncos===

Not long after his release from the Titans, Henry signed with the Denver Broncos.

Henry started off the 2007 season strong before injuries would keep him in and out of the lineup throughout the remainder of the season. In the regular season opener against the Buffalo Bills, he had 183 scrimmage yards (139 rushing, 44 receiving) in the 15–14 victory. In the following game against the Oakland Raiders, he had 26 carries for 128 rushing yards in the 23–20 victory. Two games later, he had 26 carries for 131 rushing yards in the 38–20 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.

According to an article written by MyFOX Colorado, it was reported that Henry faced the possibility of being suspended for the remainder of the 2007 season for a positive marijuana test. At the time of the incident, both the Denver Broncos and the NFL refused to comment on the situation. Henry appealed the suspension and his case was taken to Federal courts, allowing him to play until a decision was made.

Following the breaking news of Henry&#x27;s reported positive failure, Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan publicly supported Henry. This led to Shanahan being fined $25,000 by the NFL.

Henry won his appeal on December 4, 2007. Henry remained in the substance abuse program, but was not suspended. Henry stated the positive test result was due to second-hand smoke. Henry is reported as passing a lie detector test, as well as a hair follicle test regarding whether or not he smoked marijuana.

On February 21, 2008, Henry restructured his contract with the Broncos prior to his scheduled $6 million bonus to stay with the team. Henry had previously stated, &quot;I want to make it right to the Broncos, the fans and myself,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to be a Bronco and make it all right. I don&#x27;t want to be anywhere else. I owe those people something for all that happened last year. I want to clear my name there. I&#x27;m so hungry to do right there.&quot;

On June 2, 2008, Henry was released from the Denver Broncos just one year into his five-year, $22.5 million deal. &quot;We did not feel his commitment to the Broncos was enough to warrant a spot on this football team,&quot; said head coach Mike Shanahan in a prepared statement. &quot;He&#x27;s just too inconsistent as a person. I&#x27;m not going to get into details what he did do or didn&#x27;t do. If you don&#x27;t do the little things, obviously you can&#x27;t count on somebody. So that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s released.&quot; At the time Henry was reported to be out of the country and had not yet participated in any Broncos off-season workouts.

On July 12, 2008, it was revealed that Henry had once again tested positive for marijuana and would be suspended for one year. The failed test was reportedly dated in May 2008, showing that he used marijuana five months after winning his appeal. The Broncos stated that the team was not aware of Henry&#x27;s test results at the time he was released.

===Suspension===
On August 31, 2008, Henry was suspended for at least one year by the NFL for violating the league&#x27;s substance abuse policy. He was reinstated by the NFL following his release from prison in August 2012.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
Henry was married once, at age 19, to a woman six years his senior; the marriage was later annulled. He was engaged in 2009, but no marriage has been reported as of January 2016. Henry has fathered at least 11 children by 10 different women (one of the women having twins).

Henry has had on-going problems making his child support payments to the mothers of nine of his children. He was arrested in Polk County, Florida, in March 2009 and charged with failing to pay $16,600 in child support. His lawyer estimates that he is obligated to pay at least $170,000 per year in child support payments.

==Drug trafficking arrest==
On September 30, 2008, Henry was arrested by the DEA after allegedly being involved in a multi-kilogram cocaine transaction that occurred in Centennial, Colorado. Henry, portrayed by court documents &quot;as the ruthless &#x27;money guy&#x27; in a cocaine trafficking ring&quot;, faced ten years to life on federal drug trafficking charges. On March 31, 2009, Henry and prosecutors reached a plea agreement; a change-of-plea hearing was set for April 16 by the judge. The plea deal consisted of Henry accepting a charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. The maximum penalties included serving ten years to life in prison, and a fines of up to $4 million.

On July 15, 2009, Henry was sentenced to three years in federal prison for financing a cocaine trafficking operation. The fine was waived by the judge, who stated that the defendant (Henry) could not afford a fine. In addition, if Henry completed a drug program while in prison, his sentence could be reduced by one year. Henry was released from custody after two years.

Spikes is one of only seven linebackers to start more than 200 NFL games. Only once did Spikes record fewer than 70 tackles in a season. He was a team captain in 13 out of 15 seasons. Spikes played in 219 games without a playoff appearance, the most in NFL history. The Eagles, 49ers, and Chargers all made the playoffs the year after Spikes left each team.

After retiring from the NFL, Spikes became a media personality. He is a football analyst on NBC Sports Network and Sky Sports in the United Kingdom and co-hosts shows on SiriusXM and the SEC Network.

==Early life and education==
Spikes was born in Augusta, Georgia. He attended Washington County High School in Sandersville, Georgia, where he earned All-American honors from &quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; and was named Georgia&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Football&quot; by state coaches as a senior. Spikes was also named &quot;Georgia Player of the Year&quot; as a senior.

==College career==
Takeo entered Auburn University, majoring in liberal arts. In the 1997 campaign, he led Auburn with 136 tackles as Auburn advanced to the SEC Championship game where they were defeated, 30–29, by the Tennessee Volunteers, led by Peyton Manning. Spikes was named MVP for his performance in this game. Spikes was college teammates with productive tailback Stephen Davis.

Takeo Spikes received his Auburn degree in 2016.

==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Bengals===
Spikes entered the 1998 NFL draft and was selected in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals. In his rookie season he started all preseason games and all regular season games. He became the first rookie to lead the Bengals in tackles since James Francis led them in 1990. He also led the team by total snaps played on offense and defense, which added up to 997.

In 1999, he was the team captain, playing in all his games as a Right Inside Linebacker and a Right Linebacker. He forced four fumbles and recovered four, leading the team in fumble recoveries as well.

In 2000, he played every game as a Right Linebacker and recorded 128 tackles. He passed the 100 tackle mark for the third straight time and led the team in tackles and fumble recoveries.

In 2001, Spikes started at RLB for all of the 15 games he played that season. He once again led the team in solo and total tackles in the 2001 campaign. Spikes missed Game 5 because of his father&#x27;s death. Spikes dedicated the season, and the remainder of his professional career to his father. He wrote his dad&#x27;s name on the tape he wrapped around his wrists for the remaining 12 games of the season.

The 2002 season was his final season with the Bengals, as he played all 16 games. In his tenure with the Bengals, he played 79 of a possible 80 games, missing only one for his father&#x27;s funeral. He led the team in solo and total tackles once again and scored his second defensive TD by way of fumble recovery. Following the season, Spikes was given the designated player tag making him a restricted free agent. After not finishing better than 6–10 during any of his seasons in Cincinnati, Spikes stated he rather sign with a playoff contender. (However, the Bills did not make the playoffs for the entire 2000s decade, while the Bengals went 11–5 and won their division in 2005).

===Buffalo Bills===

The Buffalo Bills signed Spikes to an offersheet worth $32 million over six years, that the Bengals did not match. The 2003 season earned Spikes his first Pro Bowl selection. He recorded 126 tackles, with the addition of a pair of sacks, a pair of interceptions, and a pair of fumble recoveries.

On September 25, 2005, Spikes suffered a season-ending tear to his right Achilles&#x27; tendon while tackling Michael Vick during the Bills&#x27; 24–16 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in Week 3. In 2006, while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon, Spikes played in 12 games while missing 4 games early in the season due to a hamstring injury. During the first series of the first game of the year, Spikes made a blind side sack on Patriots QB Tom Brady, forcing a fumble which was recovered by Bills LB London Fletcher for a touchdown. The sack and forced fumble were Spikes&#x27; only of the season.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

On March 26, 2007, he was traded alongside Kelly Holcomb to the Philadelphia Eagles, in exchange for Darwin Walker and a 2008 NFL draft selection. After an effective first season as an Eagle, Spikes&#x27; season was cut short in week 14 when he suffered a torn rotator cuff injury against the Dallas Cowboys, a game the Eagles won, 10–6.

With emerging linebackers Stewart Bradley and Omar Gaither ready to take over, the Eagles chose not to pick up his team option, thus making him a free agent. The Eagles had made the playoffs six of the previous seven years before he was traded there, and also the following three after he left (including a trip to the NFC Championship game the next year). However, by not making the playoffs in his lone season in Philadelphia, Spikes went eight seasons without being part of a playoff team.

===San Francisco 49ers===
On August 10, 2008, Spikes was signed by the San Francisco 49ers on the same day they released linebacker Brandon Moore. Spikes was assigned No. 51, with Dontarrious Thomas changing from 51 to 56 – the number previously worn by Moore. On February 27, 2009, Takeo was re-signed to a 2-year contract. Spikes was team captain in San Francisco all 3 years of play.

Spikes recorded 1 sack and 3 interceptions in the 2008 season. In 2009, Spikes recorded 4 sacks and missed one game due to an injury on November 1, 2009. In San Francisco, Spikes became famous for his sack dance. In 2010, Spikes led all linebackers in most attempted tackles per miss. Spikes missed four tackles over his three seasons with San Francisco.

Called Bamm Bamm and TKO, Patrick Willis and Takeo Spikes were called the dynamic duo. Spikes said, &quot;With Patrick I’ve always admired how great he wants to be at a young age. That’s how he gained my respect. He would always just hound me and ask me questions. He was the sponge and I was the bucket of water...that’s why our relationship is bigger than just on the field. He’s like a brother to me.&quot;

After being assured that he would be re-signed by head coach Mike Singletary, the 49ers fired Singletary and decided to go with rookie NaVorro Bowman as the starter, making Spikes a free agent once again.

===San Diego Chargers===
Spikes signed a three-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on July 26, 2011. Spikes was team captain both seasons with San Diego.

On September 11, 2012, Spikes played his 200th career start earning him membership in a very elite group of linebackers to reach this achievement. On September 30, 2012, he forced Jamaal Charles to fumble when playing against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chargers later won the game, 37–20. Spikes was released by the Chargers on March 7, 2013.

===NFL statistics===
==Personal life==
Spikes was named after Japan&#x27;s 66th Prime Minister Takeo Miki after Spikes&#x27; parents saw a news report about the Japanese prime minister. Miki&#x27;s successor, who was appointed the nation&#x27;s 67th Prime Minister on December 24, 1976, a week after Takeo was born, was also a Takeo (Fukuda). Takeo&#x27;s younger cousin Brandon Spikes is a former linebacker who played for the New England Patriots and the Buffalo Bills.

Spikes dedicated his entire career to his father shortly after he died. Spikes said, &quot;My father was a good man. Really showed me the work ethic ... taught me to feel like you&#x27;re not entitled to anything. If I can live my life just as he did, even three-quarters of the way he did, then I figure I&#x27;ll have a pretty successful life.&quot;

Spikes and singer Tionne Watkins dated from 2006 to 2009.

Takeo Spikes received his Auburn degree in 2016.
In 2016, Spikes earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Miami Business School.

===Neck and strength===
Spikes is recognized and known for the size and strength of his neck. Bleacher Report called Spikes &quot;the most jacked linebacker in the NFL.&quot; Spikes has measured his neck at 21 inches. At one point in his career, he could bench 490 pounds. He was featured in &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;″s &quot;The Body Issue&quot; in 2012 with a focus on his neck and trapezius.

==Philanthropy==
Spikes provides mentoring at his annual TKO camp where he inspires young boys and girls to reach their goals. The mission of the camp is to help the participants bridge the gap of taking their goals from dreams to reality. The day-long event gives middle to high school age girls and boys an opportunity to participate in a basketball camp, football camp, and cheerleading camp with motivational speeches and Q&amp;A with professional athletes. The annual event also includes a financial contribution to the local Washington County, GA athletic department.

<text>Alberto Manguel (born March 13, 1948, in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine-Canadian anthologist, translator, essayist, novelist, editor, and a former director of the National Library of Argentina. He is a cosmopolitan and polyglot scholar, speaking English, Spanish, German, and French fluently, and also Italian and Portuguese at a very advanced level. He left Argentina at the age of twenty, in 1968. He has lived in Israel (Tel Aviv, 1948-1955), Argentina (Buenos Aires, 1955-1968), France (Paris, 1968-1971, and Poitou-Charentes, 2000-2015), United Kingdom (London, 1972), Italy (Milan, 1974-1979), French Polynesia (Tahiti, 1973-1974), Canada (Toronto, 1980-2000), United States (New York; 2015-2020) and Portugal (Lisbon, since 2021). Since 2021 he has directed an international center for reading studies in Lisbon, baptized in 2023 as Espaço Atlântida; In the biography of the center&#x27;s website you can read: &quot;He became a Canadian citizen and continues to identify his nationality as first and foremost Canadian.&quot;

He is the author of numerous non-fiction books such as &quot;The Dictionary of Imaginary Places&quot; (co-written with Gianni Guadalupi in 1980), &quot;A History of Reading&quot; (1996), &quot;The Library at Night&quot; (2007) and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Iliad and Odyssey: A Biography&quot; (2008); and novels such as &quot;News From a Foreign Country Came&quot; (1991). Though almost all of Manguel&#x27;s books were written in English, two of his novels (&quot;El regreso&quot; and &quot;Todos los hombres son mentirosos&quot;) were written in Spanish, and &quot;El regreso&quot; has not yet been published in English. Manguel has also written film criticism such as &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1997) and collections of essays such as &quot;Into the Looking Glass Wood&quot; (1998). In 2007, Manguel was selected to be that year&#x27;s annual lecturer for the prestigious Massey Lectures. in 2021, he gave the Roger Lancelyn Green lecture to the Lewis Carroll Society on his love of the &#x27;Alice&#x27; stories from Lewis Carroll.

For more than twenty years, Manguel has edited a number of literary anthologies on a variety of themes or genres ranging from erotica and gay stories to fantastic literature and mysteries.

==Career==
Manguel was born to Pablo and Rosalia Manguel, both Jewish. He spent his first years in Israel where his father Pablo was the Argentine ambassador, returning to his native country at the age of seven. Later, in Buenos Aires, when Manguel was still a teenager, he met the writer Jorge Luis Borges, a customer of the Pygmalion Anglo-German bookshop in Buenos Aires where Manguel worked after school. As Borges was almost blind, he would ask others to read out loud for him, and Manguel became one of Borges&#x27; readers, several times a week from 1964 to 1968.

In Buenos Aires, Manguel attended the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires from 1961 to 1966; among his teachers were notable Argentinian intellectuals such as the historian Alberto Salas, the Cervantes scholar Isaias Lerner and the literary critic Enrique Pezzoni. Manguel did one year (1967) at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Filosofía y Letras, but he abandoned his studies and started working at the recently founded Editorial Galerna of Guillermo Schavelzon (who thirty-five years later, now established in Barcelona, was to become Manguel&#x27;s literary agent). In 1969 Manguel travelled to Europe and worked as a reader for various publishing companies: Denoël, Gallimard and &quot;Les Lettres Nouvelles&quot; in Paris, and Calder &amp; Boyars in London.

===1970s===
In 1971, Manguel, living then in Paris and London, was awarded the Premio La Nación (Buenos Aires) for a collection of short stories. The prize was shared with the writer Bernardo Schiavetta. 
In 1972 Manguel returned to Buenos Aires and worked for a year as a reporter for the newspaper La Nación.
In 1974, he was offered employment as foreign editor at the Franco Maria Ricci publishing company in Milan. Here he met Gianni Guadalupi and later, at Guadalupi&#x27;s suggestion, wrote with him &quot;The Dictionary of Imaginary Places&quot;. The book is a travel guide to fantasy lands, islands, cities, and other locations from world literature, including &quot;Ruritania&quot;, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot;, Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, Edwin Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Flatland&quot;, C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Narnia&quot;, and the realms of Francois Rabelais, Jonathan Swift, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
In 1976, Manguel moved to Tahiti, where he worked as editor for Les Éditions du Pacifique until 1977. He then worked for the same company in Paris for one year.
In 1978 Manguel settled in Milford, Surrey (England) and set up the short-lived Ram Publishing Company.
In 1979, Manguel returned to Tahiti to work again for Les Éditions du Pacifique, this time until 1982.

===1980s–1990s===

In 1982 Manguel moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada and lived there (with a brief European period) until 2000. He has been a Canadian citizen ever since. Here Manguel contributed regularly to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; (Toronto), &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (London), &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (New York), &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Australian Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; (Stockholm), and reviewed books and plays for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Manguel&#x27;s early impression of Canada was that it was &quot;...like one of those places whose existence we assume because of a name on a sign above a platform, glimpsed at as our train stops and then rushes on.&quot; (from Passages: Welcome Home to Canada (2002), with preface by Rudyard Griffiths). As well, though, Manguel noted that &quot;When I arrived in Canada, for the first time I felt I was living in a place where I could participate actively as a writer in the running of the state.&quot;

In 1983, he selected the stories for what is perhaps his best-known anthology &quot;Black Water: The Book of Fantastic Literature&quot;. His first novel, &quot;News From a Foreign Country Came&quot;, won the &quot;McKitterick Prize&quot; in 1992.

In 1997, Manguel translated into English &quot;The Anatomist&quot;, first novel of the Argentine writer Federico Andahazi.

He was appointed as the Distinguished Visiting Writer in the &quot;Markin-Flanagan Distinguished Writers Program&quot; at the University of Calgary from 1997 to 1999. Manguel was the Opening Lecturer at the &quot;Exile &amp; Migration&quot; Congress, Boston University, in June 1999, and the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; lecturer in 1997.

===2000s===

In 2000, Manguel moved to the Poitou-Charentes region of France, where he and his partner purchased and renovated a medieval presbytery. Among the renovations was an oak-panelled library to house Manguel&#x27;s nearly 40,000 books. In September 2020, the collection was donated to the Centre for Research in the History of Reading in Lisbon, Portugal with Manguel as its head.

Manguel held the &quot;Cátedra Cortázar&quot; at the Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2007 and the &quot;S. Fischer Chair&quot; at the Freie Universität Berlin, in 2003. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Liège.

Manguel delivered the 2007 &quot;Massey Lectures&quot; which were later published as &quot;The City of Words&quot; and in the same year delivered the &quot;Northrop Frye-Antonine Maillet Lecture&quot; in Moncton, New Brunswick. He was the &quot;Pratt Lecturer&quot; at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in 2003.

In 2008, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris honoured Alberto Manguel as part of its 30th Anniversary Celebrations, by inviting him to set up a three-month long program of lectures, film and round tables.

He writes a regular column for &quot;Geist&quot; magazine.

Manguel&#x27;s book &quot;History of Reading&quot; was referenced as a source of inspiration to the &quot;Book of Sand&quot; film. He suffered a stroke in December 2013, and reflected on the experience in a 2014 op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2011 he delivered the A.S.W. Rosenbach Lectures in Bibliography, &quot;The Traveller, the Tower and the Worm &quot; at the University of Pennsylvania.

In December 2015 he was named director of the National Library in his native Argentina, replacing Horacio González. Manguel held the post from July 2016 to August 2018.

In 2018 he was awarded the Gutenberg Prize of the International Gutenberg Society and the City of Mainz.

In 2021 he was elected to the Roxburghe Club.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Pauline Ann Brewer from 1975 to 1986, and their children are Alice Emily, Rachel Claire, and Rupert Tobias. Upon divorcing Brewer in 1987, Manguel began seeing his current partner Craig Stephenson.

<doc id="961377" wikidata="Q83069" url="?curid=961377" title="Sakarya Province">
<text>Sakarya () is a province and metropolitan municipality in Turkey, located on the coast of the Black Sea. Its area is , and its population is 1,080,080 (2022). The Sakarya River creates a webbing of estuaries in the province, which is in the Marmara Region. The adjacent provinces are Kocaeli to the west, Bilecik to the south, Bolu to the southeast and Düzce to the east. The capital of Sakarya is Adapazarı. Its climate is maritime in the north and humid subtropical in the south and changes by the distance to the Black Sea.
Sakarya is on the Ankara-Istanbul highway and is also connected by rail. Sakarya is serviced by Istanbul&#x27;s Sabiha Gökçen International Airport. The mayor of Sakarya is Yusuf Alemdar as of 2024 (AKP). The city of Sakarya, one of the most important cities in Turkey for its rapid growth and development, is also noteworthy for its natural beauties and its cultural richness. It is one of the paradise-like spots of the country with its sea, beaches, lakes, rivers, highlands, thermal springs, traditional Ottoman lifestyle districts such as Taraklı and Geyve and noteworthy historical relics that are inherited from the Byzantine and the Ottoman eras.
The Turks conquered the city of Sakarya in the 13th century. There was intensive immigration from the Caucasus and the Balkans in the 18th and the 19th centuries. The last massive immigration was in 1989 from Bulgaria. The city has developed industry from being a transportation crossroads and still has inward domestic migration. 


== History ==
It was founded in 1400 by 400 Armenian immigrant families who escaped from Timur&#x27;s oppression in Sivas and was named &quot;Donigaşen&quot; after the name of their leaders. Today&#x27;s inhabitants are Manavs. The Native Muslims are Armenians and Greeks who gradually converted to Islam, and it should not be ignored that Turk households settled in the region. Adapazarı&#x27;s known name in Turkish at that time was Adacık and Ada. The source of the information that the region was conquered by Orhan Gazi and opened to settlement is also unknown. Adapazarı was the village of Ada in 1573, a sub-district in 1646, a village in Akyazı in 1658, and administrative district of a qadi in 1692 and again a sub-district in 1742. The residency area had the status of a district between 1837 and 1954 during the Ottoman and the Republican eras. Adapazarı was a district of Kocaeli for many years but separated from it and took the name of Sakarya on June 22, 1954 by Law 6419. Adapazarı took the name of Sakarya since it was the centre of the districts f Akyazı, Geyve, Hendek and Karasu. On December 1, 1954, the first governor, Nazım Üner, began active duty with ceremonies.

Adapazarı was experiencing a rapid growth and great development in the centre of Akova, but the city had to face massive destruction during the great Marmara earthquake, on August 17, 1999.

<text>An arcade cabinet, also known as an arcade machine or a coin-op cabinet or coin-op machine, is the housing within which an arcade game&#x27;s electronic hardware resides. Most cabinets designed since the mid-1980s conform to the Japanese Amusement Machine Manufacturers Association (JAMMA) wiring standard. Some include additional connectors for features not included in the standard.

==Parts of an arcade cabinet==
Because arcade cabinets vary according to the games they were built for or contain, they may not possess all of the parts listed below:

*A display output, on which the game is displayed. They may display either raster or vector graphics, raster being most common. Standard resolution is between 262.5 and 315 vertical lines, depending on the refresh rate (usually between 50 and 60 Hz). Slower refresh rates allow for better vertical resolution. Monitors may be oriented horizontally or vertically, depending on the game. Some games use more than one monitor. Some newer cabinets have monitors that can display high-definition video.
*An audio output for sound effects and music, usually produced from a sound chip.
*Printed circuit boards (PCB) or arcade system boards, the actual hardware upon which the game runs. Hidden within the cabinet. Some systems, such as the SNK Neo-Geo MVS, use a mainboard with game carts. Some mainboards may hold multiple game carts as well.
*A power supply to provide DC power to the arcade system boards and low voltage lighting for the coin slots and lighted buttons.
*A marquee, a sign above the monitor displaying the game&#x27;s title. They are often brightly colored and backlit.
*A bezel, which is the border around the monitor. It may contain instructions or artwork.
*A control panel, a level surface near the monitor, upon which the game&#x27;s controls are arranged. Control panels sometimes have playing instructions. Players often pile their coins or tokens on the control panels of upright and cocktail cabinets.
*Coin slots, coin returns and the coin box, which allow for the exchange of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.

The sides of the arcade cabinet are usually decorated with brightly colored stickers or paint, representing the gameplay of their particular game.

==Types of cabinets==
There are many types of arcade cabinets, some being custom-made for a particular game; however, the most common are the &quot;upright&quot;, the &quot;cocktail&quot; or &quot;table&quot;, and the &quot;sit-down&quot;.

===Upright cabinets===

Upright cabinets are the most common in North America, with their design heavily influenced by &quot;Computer Space&quot; and &quot;Pong&quot;. While the futuristic look of &quot;Computer Space&quot; outer fiberglass cabinet did not carry forward, both games did establish separating parts of the arcade machine for the cathode-ray tube (CRT) display, the game controllers, and the computer logic areas. Atari also had placed the controls at a height suitable for most adult players to use, but close enough to the console&#x27;s base to also allow children to play. Further, the cabinets were more compact than traditional electro-mechanical games and did not use flashing lights or other means to attract players. The side panels of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; had a simple wood veneer finish, making it easier to market to non-arcade venues, such as hotels, country clubs, and cocktail bars. In the face of growing competition, Atari started to include cabinet art and attraction panels around 1973–1974, which soon became a standard practice.

Arcade cabinets today are usually made of wood and metal, about six feet or two meters tall, with the control panel set perpendicular to the monitor at slightly above waist level. The monitor is housed inside the cabinet, at approximately eye level. The marquee is above it, and often overhangs it.

In &quot;Computer Space&quot;, &quot;Pong&quot; and other early arcade games, the CRT was mounted 90 degrees from the ground, facing directly outward. Arcade game manufacturers began incorporating design principles from older electro-mechanical games by using CRTs mounted at a 45-degree angle, facing upward and away from the player but towards a one-way mirror that reflected the display to the player. Additional transparent overlays could be added between the mirror and the player&#x27;s view to include additional images and colorize the black-and-white CRT output, as is the case in &quot;Boot Hill&quot;. Other games, like &quot;Warrior&quot;, used a one-sided mirror and included an illuminated background behind the mirror, so that the on-screen characters would appear to the players as if they were on that background. With the advent of color CRT displays, the need for the mirror was eliminated. The CRT was subsequently positioned at an angle permitting a typical adult player to look directly at the screen.

Controls are most commonly a joystick for as many players as the game allows, plus action buttons and &quot;player&quot; buttons which serve the same purpose as the start button on console gamepads. Trackballs are sometimes used instead of joysticks, especially in games from the early 1980s. Spinners (knobs for turning, also called &quot;paddle controls&quot;) are used to control game elements that move strictly horizontally or vertically, such as the paddles in &quot;Arkanoid&quot; and &quot;Pong&quot;. Games such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Smash TV&quot; and &quot;Battlezone&quot; use double joysticks instead of action buttons. Some versions of the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; had pressure-sensitive rubber pads instead of buttons.

If an upright is housing a driving game, it may have a steering wheel and throttle pedal instead of a joystick and buttons. If the upright is housing a shooting game, it may have light guns attached to the front of the machine, via durable cables. Some arcade machines had the monitor placed at the bottom of the cabinet with a mirror mounted at around 45 degrees above the screen facing the player. This was done to save space, as a large CRT monitor would otherwise poke out the back of the cabinet. To correct for the mirrored image, some games had an option to flip the video output using a dip switch setting. Other genres of games such as &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot; feature controllers resembling musical instruments.

Upright cabinet shape designs vary from the simplest symmetric perpendicular boxes as with &quot;Star Trek&quot; to complicated asymmetric forms.

Games are typically for one or two players; however, games such as &quot;Gauntlet&quot; feature as many as four sets of controls.

===Sit-down or table cabinets===
==== Cocktail cabinets====
Cocktail cabinets are shaped like low, rectangular tables, with the controls usually set at either of the broad ends, or, though not as common, at the narrow ends, and the monitor inside the table, the screen facing upward. Two-player games housed in cocktails were usually alternant, each player taking turns. The monitor reverses its orientation (game software controlled) for each player, so the game display is properly oriented for each player. This requires special programming of the cocktail versions of the game (usually set by dip switches). The monitor&#x27;s orientation is usually in player two&#x27;s favor only in two-player games when it is player two&#x27;s turn and in player one&#x27;s favor all other times. Simultaneous, 4 player games that are built as a cocktail include &quot;Warlords&quot;, and others.

In Japan, many games manufactured by Taito from the 1970s to the early 1980s have the cocktail versions prefixed by &quot;T.T&quot; in their titles (eg. &quot;T.T Space Invaders&quot;). 

Cocktail cabinet versions were usually released alongside the upright version of the same game. They were relatively common in the 1980s, especially during the Golden Age of Arcade Games, but have since lost popularity. Their main advantage over upright cabinets was their smaller size, making them seem less obtrusive, although requiring more floor space (more so by having players seated at each end). The top of the table was covered with a piece of tempered glass, making it convenient to set drinks on (hence the name), and they were often seen in bars and pubs.
====Candy cabinets====


Owing to the resemblance of plastic to hard candy, they are often known as &quot;candy cabinets&quot;, by both arcade enthusiasts and by people in the industry. They are also generally easier to clean and move than upright cabinets, but usually just as heavy as most have 29&quot; screens, as opposed to 20&quot;–25&quot;. They are positioned so that the player can sit down on a chair or stool and play for extended periods. SNK sold many Neo-Geo MVS cabinets in this configuration, though most arcade games made in Japan that only use a joystick and buttons will come in a sit-down cabinet variety. In Japanese arcades, this type of cabinet is generally more prevalent than the upright kind, and they are usually lined up in uniform-looking rows. A variant of this, often referred to as &quot;versus-style&quot; cabinets are designed to look like two cabinets facing each other, with two monitors and separate controls allowing two players to fight each other without having to share the same monitor and control area. Some newer cabinets can emulate these &quot;versus-style&quot; cabinets through networking.
===Deluxe cabinets===

Deluxe cabinets (also known as DX cabinets in Japan) are most commonly used for games involving gambling, long stints of gaming (such as fighting games), or vehicles (such as flight simulators and racing games). These cabinets typically have equipment resembling the controls of a vehicle (though some of them are merely large cabinets with fair features such as a great screen or chairs). Driving games may have a bucket seat, foot pedals, a stick shift, and even an ignition, while flight simulators may have a flight yoke or joystick, and motorcycle games handlebars, and a seat shaped like a full-size bike. Often, these cabinets are arranged side-by-side, to allow players to compete together. Sega is one of the biggest manufacturers of these kinds of cabinets, while Namco released &quot;Ridge Racer Full Scale&quot;, in which the player sits in a full-size Mazda MX-5 road car.

====Cockpit or environmental cabinets====
A cockpit or environmental cabinet is a type of deluxe cabinet where the player sits inside the cabinet itself. It also typically has an enclosure. Examples of this can be seen on the Killer List of Videogames, including shooter games such as &quot;Star Fire&quot;, &quot;Missile Command&quot;, &quot;SubRoc-3D&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Astron Belt&quot;, &quot;Sinistar&quot; and &quot;Discs of Tron&quot; as well as racing games such as &quot;Monaco GP&quot;, &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;Pole Position&quot;. A number of cockpit/or environmental cabinets incorporate hydraulic motion simulation, as covered in the section below.

====Motion simulator cabinets====
A motion simulator cabinet is a type of deluxe cabinet that is very elaborate, including hydraulics which move the player according to the action on screen. In Japan, they are known as &quot;taikan&quot; games, with &quot;taikan&quot; meaning &quot;body sensation&quot; in Japanese. Sega is particularly known for these kinds of cabinets, with various types of sit-down and cockpit motion cabinets that Sega have been manufacturing since the 1980s. Namco was another major manufacturer of motion simulator cabinets.

Motorbike racing games since Sega&#x27;s &quot;Hang-On&quot; have had the player sit on and move a motorbike replica to control the in-game actions (like a motion controller). Driving games since Sega&#x27;s &quot;Out Run&quot; have had hydraulic motion simulator sit-down cabinets, while hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets have been used for space combat games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Tactics&quot; (1981) and &quot;Galaxy Force&quot;, rail shooters such as &quot;Space Harrier&quot; and &quot;Thunder Blade&quot;, and combat flight simulators such as &quot;After Burner&quot; and &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot;. One of the most sophisticated motion simulator cabinets is Sega&#x27;s R360, which simulates the full 360-degree rotation of an aircraft.

===Mini or cabaret cabinets===
&quot;Mini&quot; or &quot;cabaret&quot; cabinets are similar forms of arcade cabinet but are intended for different markets. Modern mini cabinets are sold directly to consumers and are not intended for commercial operation. They are styled just like a standard upright cabinet, often with full art and marquees, but are scaled down to more easily fit in a home environment or be used by children. The older form of mini or cabaret cabinets were marketed for commercial use and are no longer made. They were often thinner as well as shorter, lacked side art, and had smaller marquees and monitors. This reduced their cost, reduced their weight, made them better suited to locations with less space, and also made them less conspicuous in darker environments. In place of side art they were often clad in faux wood grain vinyl instead.

===Countertop cabinets===
&quot;Countertop&quot; or &quot;bartop&quot; cabinets are usually only large enough to house their monitors and control panels. They are often used for trivia and gambling-type games and are usually found installed on bars or tables in pubs and restaurants. These cabinets often have touchscreen controls instead of traditional push-button controls. They are also fairly popular with home use, as they can be placed upon a table or countertop.

=== Large-scale satellite machines ===
Usually found in Japan, these machines have multiple screens interconnected to one system, sometimes with one big screen in the middle. These also often feature the dispensation of different types of cards, either a smartcard in order to save stats and progress or trading cards used in the game.

==Conversion kit==
An arcade conversion kit, also known as a software kit, is special equipment that can be installed into an arcade machine that changes the current game it plays into another one. For example, a conversion kit can be used to reconfigure an arcade machine designed to play one game so that it would play its sequel or update instead, such as from &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot; to &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;.

==Restoration==
Since arcade games are becoming increasingly popular as collectibles, an entire niche industry has sprung up focused on arcade cabinet restoration. There are many websites (both commercial and hobbyist) and newsgroups devoted to arcade cabinet restoration. They are full of tips and advice on restoring games to mint condition.

===Artwork===
Often game cabinets were used to host a variety of games. Often after the cabinet&#x27;s initial game was removed and replaced with another, the cabinet&#x27;s side art was painted over (usually black) so that the cabinet would not misrepresent the game contained within. The side art was also painted over to hide damaged or faded artwork.

Of course, hobbyists prefer cabinets with original artwork in the best possible condition. Since machines with good quality art are hard to find, one of the first tasks is stripping any old artwork or paint from the cabinet. This is done with conventional chemical paint strippers or by sanding (preferences vary). Normally artwork cannot be preserved that has been painted over and is removed with any covering paint. New paint can be applied in any manner preferred (roller, brush, spray). Paint used is often just conventional paint with a finish matching the cabinet&#x27;s original paint.

Many games had artwork that was silkscreened directly on the cabinets. Others used large decals for the side art. Some manufacturers produce replication artwork for popular classic games—each varying in quality. This side art can be applied over the new paint after it has dried. These appliques can be very large and must be carefully applied to avoid bubbles or wrinkles from developing. Spraying the surface with a slightly soapy water solution allows the artwork to be quickly repositioned if wrinkles or bubbles develop like in window tinting applications.

===Control panels, bezels, marquees===
Acquiring these pieces is harder than installing them. Many hobbyists trade these items via newsgroups or sites such as eBay (the same is true for side art). As with side art, some replication art shops also produce replication artwork for these pieces that is indistinguishable from the original. Some even surpass the originals in quality. Once these pieces are acquired, they usually snap right into place.

If the controls are worn and need replacing, if the game is popular, they can be easily obtained. Rarer game controls are harder to come by, but some shops stock replacement controls for classic arcade games. Some shops manufacture controls that are more robust than originals and fit a variety of machines. Installing them takes some experimentation for novices, but are usually not too difficult to place.

===Monitors===
While both use the same basic type of tube, raster monitors are easier to service than vector monitors, as the support circuitry is very similar to that which is used in CRT televisions and computer monitors, and is typically easy to adjust for color and brightness. On the other hand, vector monitors can be challenging or very costly to service, and some can no longer be repaired due to certain parts having been discontinued years ago. Even finding a drop-in replacement for a vector monitor is a challenge today, as few were produced after their heyday in the early 1980s. CRT replacement is possible, but the process of transferring the deflection yoke and other parts from one tube neck to the other also means a long process of positioning and adjusting the parts on the CRT for proper performance, a job that may prove too challenging for the typical amateur arcade collector. On the other hand, it may be possible to retrofit other monitor technologies to emulate vector graphics.

Some electronic components are stressed by the hot, cramped conditions inside a cabinet. Electrolytic capacitors dry out over time, and if a classic arcade cabinet is still using its original components, it may be near the end of its service life. A common step in refurbishing vintage electronics (of all types) is &quot;recapping&quot;: replacing certain capacitors (and other parts) to restore, or ensure the continued safe operation of the monitor and power supplies. Because of the capacity and voltage ratings of these parts, it can be dangerous if not done properly, and should only be attempted by experienced hobbyists or professionals. If a monitor is broken, it may be easier to just source a drop-in replacement through coin-op machine distributors or parts suppliers.

===Wiring===
If a cabinet needs rewiring, some wiring kits are available over the Internet. An experienced hobbyist can usually solve most wiring problems through trial and error.

Many cabinets are converted to be used to host a game other than the original. In these cases, if both games conform to the JAMMA standard, the process is simple. Other conversions can be more difficult, but some manufacturers such as Nintendo have produced kits to ease the conversion process (Nintendo manufactured kits to convert a cabinet from Classic wiring to VS. wiring).

<doc id="961384" wikidata="Q1340752" url="?curid=961384" title="Endolymph">
<text>Endolymph is the fluid contained in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. The major cation in endolymph is potassium, with the values of sodium and potassium concentration in the endolymph being 0.91 mM and 154 mM, respectively. It is also called &quot;Scarpa&#x27;s fluid&quot;, after Antonio Scarpa.

==Structure==
The inner ear has two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is contained within the bony labyrinth, and within the membranous labyrinth is a fluid called endolymph. Between the outer wall of the membranous labyrinth and the wall of the bony labyrinth is the location of perilymph.

===Composition===
Perilymph and endolymph have unique ionic compositions suited to their functions in regulating electrochemical impulses of hair cells. The electric potential of endolymph is ~80-90 mV more positive than perilymph due to a higher concentration of K compared to Na.

The main component of this unique extracellular fluid is potassium, which is secreted from the stria vascularis. The high potassium content of the endolymph means that potassium, not sodium, is carried as the de-polarizing electric current in the hair cells. This is known as the mechano-electric transduction (MET) current.

Endolymph has a high positive potential (80–120 mV in the cochlea), relative to other nearby fluids such as perilymph, due to its high concentration of positively charged ions. It is mainly this electrical potential difference that allows potassium ions to flow into the hair cells during mechanical stimulation of the hair bundle. Because the hair cells are at a negative potential of about −50 mV, the potential difference from endolymph to hair cell is on the order of 150 mV, which is the largest electrical potential difference found in the body.

==Function==
* Hearing: Cochlear duct: fluid waves in the endolymph of the cochlear duct stimulate the receptor cells, which in turn translate their movement into nerve impulses that the brain perceives as sound.
* Balance: Semicircular canals: angular acceleration of the endolymph in the semicircular canals stimulate the vestibular receptors of the endolymph. The semicircular canals of both inner ears act in concert to coordinate balance.

==Clinical significance==
Disruption of the endolymph due to jerky movements (like spinning around or driving over bumps while riding in a car) can cause motion sickness. A condition where the volume of the endolymph is greatly enlarged is called endolymphatic hydrops and has been linked to Ménière&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="961400" wikidata="Q5387381" url="?curid=961400" title="Eric Robinson (Canadian politician)">
<text>Eric Robinson (born February 5, 1953) is an Aboriginal Canadian politician in Manitoba. He was previously a member of the Manitoba legislature, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic government of Greg Selinger.

Born in Norway House, Manitoba, he was placed in a residential school at the age of five. Robinson is a member of the Cross Lake First Nation, covered under Treaty 5. Robinson worked at a variety of jobs including dishwasher in Churchill, an addiction counsellor in British Columbia and a radio disc jockey. He has been active in Aboriginal issues for several years, and has worked for the Assembly of First Nations and the Brotherhood of Indian Nations, as well as other organizations promoting native rights within Canada.

Before entering provincial politics, Robinson was also a producer and broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and worked for Native Communications Incorporated. In 1985, he co-authored a work entitled &quot;Infested Blanket&quot;, an historical indictment of the Canadian government&#x27;s past dealings with Aboriginal peoples.

Robinson entered provincial politics on September 21, 1993, winning a by-election in the northern riding of Rupertsland (he replaced Elijah Harper in the assembly). Running for the NDP, Robinson received 1697 votes; his closest opponent, Liberal George Munroe, received 1023.

Robinson was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, and served as the NDP&#x27;s critic for Aboriginal and Northern Affairs. Also in 1995, he supported Lorne Nystrom for leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

After the NDP won a majority government in the 1999 election, Premier Gary Doer named Robinson Minister of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund on October 5, 1999. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 25, 2002, he became Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism with responsibility for Sport.

In 2003, Robinson supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal NDP. In the 2003 provincial election, Robinson was re-elected with over 86% of the vote in his riding. He was returned again in the 2007 election. In 2007, he was reassigned as Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport.

<doc id="961405" wikidata="Q566224" url="?curid=961405" title="Markgräflerland">
<text>Markgräflerland () is a region in the southwest of Germany, in the south of the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg, located between the Breisgau in the north and the Black Forest in the east; adjacent to west with France and in the south with Switzerland.

==History and geography==

The name translates to &quot;Margraves&#x27; Land&quot;, in reference to the Margraves of Baden. They ruled the area from the 12th century as a margraviate of the Holy Roman Empire until its elevation to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1806, following the Empire&#x27;s dissolution. Markgräflerland is the combination of three lordships: Badenweiler, Rötteln and Sausenburg. In 1556 the Markgraf (Margrave) became Protestant following the actions of the German monk Martin Luther.

The river Rhine marks the frontier to France in the west and Switzerland in the south. Markgräflerland is considered to be part of the transnational metropolitan area that includes Freiburg, Basel, and Mulhouse. This region of Germany, also called the &quot;Dreiländereck&quot; (three-country corner), includes many towns, but it is generally accepted that the center of the region is the town of Müllheim. Historically the region was a bit smaller, only reaching to Heitersheim in the north. The largest mountain in the region, the Blauen, lies on the outside border.

==Viticulture==

The region is known for its vineyards. A unique grape variety is the Gutedel grape, also known as Chasselas, which probably made its way into the region in 1780 from Vevey in Switzerland; this grape is also used in some of the viticulture on the northern shore of Lake Constance. Other popular varieties in the region include Müller-Thurgau, Grau Burgunder (Pinot gris), Weiss Burgunder (Pinot blanc), Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) and Weissherbst. Other agricultural products include Spargel (white asparagus) and cherries.

The region is often called by Germans the Tuscany of Germany, referring to the Tuscan region of Italy, due in part to its climate, milder than the rest of the nation.

==Language==
This region is home to the German dialect known as Alemannisch. The most famous writer of &quot;Alemannisch&quot; literature is Johann Peter Hebel.

==Cities and towns==
Markgräflerland includes (among others) the following locations:

Auggen, Badenweiler, Ballrechten-Dottingen, Betberg, Binzen, Bollschweil, Britzingen, Buggingen, Dattingen, Dossenbach, Efringen-Kirchen, Eimeldingen, Gersbach, Hach, Hartheim am Rhein, Hammerstein, Hausen im Wiesental, Heitersheim, Hügelheim, Inzlingen, Kandern, Kleinkems, Lörrach, Malsburg, Marzell, Müllheim, Neuenburg, Neuenweg, Riedlingen, Schliengen, Schopfheim, Seefelden, Steinen, Sulzburg, Tegernau, Vögisheim, Weil am Rhein, Wies, Wieslet, Weitenau, Wollbach.

<doc id="961407" wikidata="Q539536" url="?curid=961407" title="Randy Neugebauer">
<text>Robert Randolph Neugebauer (born December 24, 1949) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , having served from a special election in 2003 to 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes a large swath of West Texas, including Lubbock and Abilene. According to a 2011 survey by the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Neugebauer was &quot;the most conservative&quot; member of the House.

On September 17, 2015, Neugebauer announced he would not seek reelection to an eighth term in 2016.

==Early life, education and career==
Neugebauer was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and reared in Lubbock. His father was an insurance salesman and his mother a real estate agent and interior designer. He has two brothers, Jon and Bradley, and a sister, Virginia Volpe. When Randy was nine years old, his parents divorced, and his father died in 1985 after remarrying. In 1963, his mother married Joe W. Smith, a bank manager. Neugebauer graduated from Coronado High School and later from Texas Tech University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from the College of Business Administration (now Rawls College of Business).

Like his mother, Neugebauer has long been involved in the real estate business, having served as president of the development company Lubbock Land before his election to Congress. He is a former president of the Texas Association of Builders from 1996 to 1997.

==Early political career==
From 1992 to 1998, Neugebauer was a Lubbock city councilman. He was mayor &quot;pro tempore&quot; from 1994 to 1996. While involved in Lubbock government, Neugebauer worked to reduce taxes and to privatize municipal services.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== &quot;Baby Killer&quot; remark ===
On March 21, 2010, during the debate in the House of Representatives of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Neugebauer yelled out &quot;Baby killer!&quot; The remark was believed to have been directed at Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, a leader of the anti-abortion Democrats in the House, who was discussing a motion filed by the Republicans. While immediate inquiries began to determine who shouted the words, more than 12 hours later, on March 22, 2010, Neugebauer publicly identified himself as the person, apologized for the incident and argued that his words were &quot;It&#x27;s a baby killer&quot;, referring to the bill, not Stupak himself.

However, reporters and others in the room insisted Neugebauer precisely shouted &quot;Baby killer!&quot;, referring to Stupak. Stupak said that he does not &quot;buy&quot; Neugebauer&#x27;s description of the outburst, said his words were &quot;very clear&quot;, and believes Neugebauer should apologize for his remark on the floor of the US House. In contrast to Neugebauer&#x27;s &quot;baby killer&quot; comment, Stupak and the Politifact watchdog group agree, &quot;there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation&quot; that Neugebauer detests.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Colorado Springs Gazette&quot; have compared Neugebauer&#x27;s comment to Joe Wilson shouting &quot;You lie!&quot; during President Barack Obama&#x27;s September 2009 address to Congress, and to racial and sexual slurs said to have been shouted at Democratic legislators outside the Capitol building by members of the public who opposed the bill during the 48 hours preceding Neugebauer&#x27;s March 21, 2010, outburst. Neugebauer&#x27;s comment was covered by media worldwide, including Canada&#x27;s &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot;, and Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

===Legislation sponsored===
Neugebauer has sponsored the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1155; 113th Congress) (), a bill meant to reduce the regulatory costs of complying with multiple states&#x27; requirements for insurance companies, making it easier for the same corporation to operate in multiple states. The bill would transform the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) into a clearing house that set up its own standards that insurance companies would be required to meet in order to do business in other states. In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities).

Proponents of the bill argued that it would help lower costs for insurance companies and make insurance cheaper for people to buy. It passed the House on September 10, 2013.

On April 26, 2013, Neugebauer introduced the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2014 (H.R. 1786; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP), which was created to improve the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and to develop measures to reduce the damage they cause.

===National World War II Memorial confrontation===

On October 2, 2013, during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Neugebauer publicly scolded a National Park Service ranger who was enforcing the agency&#x27;s closure of the National World War II Memorial due to the lapse in appropriations. His actions were widely criticized in the media, and he has responded that the phrase &quot;The Park Service should be ashamed of themselves&quot; was taken out of context.

==Political campaigns==
Neugebauer was elected to Congress after a hotly contested special election runoff in the spring of 2003. The seat came open after 18-year Republican incumbent Larry Combest announced his retirement not long after having been reelected to a 10th term in 2002. Although Combest had been the only Republican ever to represent this district, the 19th has long been one of the most conservative areas of Texas (indeed, in the entire nation), and it was virtually taken for granted that Combest would be succeeded by another Republican. The 19th has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964, and Combest&#x27;s first bid for the seat was the only time in the previous two decades that a Democrat won more than 40 percent of the vote.

Neugebauer was one of seven candidates to run in the primary, all Republicans, though the district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Neugebauer stressed his conservative credentials; he described himself as a &quot;pro-family, pro-life Christian who has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ&quot; and believed that &quot;our region&#x27;s most precious resources are our values.&quot;

Neugebauer led the primary field, but finished well short of a majority. He was forced into a runoff with Mike Conaway of Midland, the chairman of the Texas Board of Public Accountancy and a friend of President George W. Bush. In a close third-place finish in the first round of balloting was then-State Representative Carl Isett of Lubbock. In the runoff election, Neugebauer defeated Conaway by only 587 votes, becoming only the fourth person to represent the 19th since its creation in 1935. Soon afterward in 2004, Conaway won election to Congress in the newly reconfigured 11th District.

Neugebauer ran for a full term in 2004, facing 26-year incumbent Democrat Charles Stenholm of Abilene. Stenholm had previously represented the Abilene-based 17th District, but that district had been dismantled in the 2003 Texas redistricting. The largest chunk of Stenholm&#x27;s former territory, including most of Abilene, was thrown into Neugebauer&#x27;s district. Although Stenholm had more seniority, the new district retained about 60 percent of Neugebauer&#x27;s former territory, a disadvantage Stenholm was unable to overcome despite his seniority. Neugebauer won by 18 points, and was reelected four more times with little substantive opposition, each time taking well over 60 percent of the vote.

===2012===

Neugebauer faced opposition in the May 29 Republican primary from Chris Winn, who resigned as the Lubbock County Republican chairman to enter the race. Neugebauer defeated Winn, 45,372 (74.3%) to 15,675 (25.7%).

===2017===
Press reports indicated that Neugebauer was under consideration to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the incoming first Trump administration. The job was ultimately given to Mick Mulvaney.

===Campaign funding===

During the first seven years of his political career, from 2003 to February 2010, he has raised $6.4 million, most of these funds coming from the oil and gas, real estate, commercial banking and crop production/processing industries, and leadership PACs. His largest corporate and association donors have been the National Auto Dealers Association, National Association of Home Builders, Quantum Energy Partners, the National Beer Wholesalers Association and the National Association of Realtors. Outspoken against abortion during Congress&#x27; debate on health care reform legislation, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets, Neugebauer has received a total of $3,000 during his career from people and committees associated with anti-abortion advocacy groups.

====Investigation====
In October 2015, the Campaign for Accountability asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate Neugebauer for allegations of bribery and illegal gratuity related to $8,000 given to Neugebauer by Pay Day Loan financiers for his co-sponsorship of H.R.1121 - Responsible Consumer Financial Protection Regulations Act of 2011 which provided additional protection and lack of regulation to Pay Day Loan lenders.

==Personal life==

Neugebauer married his high school sweetheart, the former Dana Collins, and they have two sons, Todd Neugebauer, President of Aspect Holdings, LLC, and Toby Neugebauer, the co-CEO of Quantum Energy Partners. They also have four grandchildren. As of 2010, Neugebauer served as a deacon at a Southern Baptist church.

<doc id="961409" wikidata="Q2279022" url="?curid=961409" title="Psychoderelict">
<text>Psychoderelict is a seventh studio album by the English musician Pete Townshend. Some characters and issues presented in this work were continued in Townshend&#x27;s later opus &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot;, first presented on the Who&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Endless Wire&quot; (2006) and then adapted as a rock musical.

&quot;Psychoderelict&quot; is Townshend&#x27;s seventh and most recent solo studio album to date.

==History==
Released in 1993, &quot;Psychoderelict&quot; is a rock opera conceived by Townshend in 1991 as the follow-up to &quot;The Iron Man&quot; (1989), but despite having recorded several demos, a bicycle accident in September 1991 forced him to delay work on the album until his wrist was able to heal properly. It is structured more like a radio play than the more &quot;traditional&quot; rock operas Townshend had recorded both with the Who (1969&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;, 1973&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; and the unreleased &quot;Lifehouse&quot; album) and as a solo artist (1985&#x27;s &quot;White City&quot; and &quot;The Iron Man&quot;).

The album&#x27;s central character is Ray High (real name Raymond Highsmith), a &#x27;60s rock star who has dwindled and turned into an alcoholic recluse. Ray&#x27;s manager, Rastus Knight, worried at the rocker&#x27;s dwindling bank account, attempts unsuccessfully to talk him into recording new material. Rastus complains about it to radio pop-music reporter Ruth Streeting, an outspoken critic of Ray&#x27;s. Ruth says she has an idea to &quot;fire him up&quot; and Rastus offers her a cut of the profits if she can do it.

Ruth sends Ray a letter posing as a 15-year-old girl named Rosalind Nathan, who dreams of being a star. She includes in her letter an erotic Polaroid of herself lying naked on her mother&#x27;s grave when she was 12. Ray responds to her immediately, calling the photograph &quot;stunning&quot; and telling her that they both &quot;share complicated problems.&quot; He offers to help her if she will keep it a secret. He and &quot;Rosalind&quot; exchange several letters, where Ray opens his heart about his insecurity, his life&#x27;s past tragedies, and his insights into the relationships between the performers, the public, and the press. He sends her a tape of &quot;Flame,&quot; a song he wrote for his secret &quot;Gridlife&quot; project. In his last letter he talks about Ruth Streeting, calling her &quot;symbolic of the entire establishment&quot; and saying &quot;her disgust is the greatest motivator of the artist in me.&quot; He confesses that he has fallen in love with her. Ruth, now sleeping with Rastus, laughs about it while being spanked.

Ruth publishes the photograph in her &quot;porno pen-pal story,&quot; calling Ray a slime ball who took advantage of a young fan&#x27;s innocence to solicit the photograph and &quot;test out his weird theories.&quot; The resulting controversy drives the re-release of Ray&#x27;s records to huge sales. Rastus is delighted. &quot;Rosalind&#x27;s&quot; version of &quot;Flame,&quot; off of her new Ruth Streeting-produced album, becomes a huge hit. Ruth promotes Rosalind as a &quot;brilliant songwriter&quot; while keeping the real writer of the song a secret, even from Rastus.

Ruth receives her cut of the profits, and Rastus is in seventh heaven, once again rolling in money. Ray, upset about Ruth&#x27;s exposé, confronts them both. Ruth accuses Ray of &quot;manipulating&quot; Rosalind. Rastus says it all worked out for the best, they&#x27;re back in calculator country. Ray insists that he was helping Rosalind deal with a problem. Ruth insists Rosalind never had a problem and all Ray did was &quot;help her become a fucking star.&quot;

In a meeting with Ruth at a bar, Raymond springs the surprise that he has known all along that Ruth and Rosalind are one and the same. It is heavily implied that Ruth fakes being attracted to Ray so that she can manoeuvre him into writing new material. Ruth, littering her language with endearments, is now producing the &quot;Gridlife&quot; album, which contains a sample of the Who&#x27;s famous &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley.&quot;

At the end of the play, Ray says that &quot;Gridlife&quot; was a vision, not a fiction, and that the apocalypse it foresaw is near. He wonders what happened to peace, love, and &quot;all that hippie shit.&quot;

==Commentary==

The album is a critical, perhaps satirical look at Townshend&#x27;s own life: the dedication of his music to Meher Baba&#x27;s teachings, and his &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, which closely resembles the &quot;Gridlife&quot; project on which the Ray High character is working. The album also makes use of Townshend&#x27;s earlier song &quot;Who Are You&quot; which is sampled on the track &quot;Meher Baba M4 (Signal Box)&quot;.

Only one single proper was released from the album: &quot;English Boy&quot;, both non-dialogue and dialogue versions, was released with a variety of B-sides and non-album songs, including &quot;Psycho Montage&quot; (a collection of dialogue from the album) and &quot;Electronic Wizardry&quot; (written and recorded in 1970 as a potential track for The Who&#x27;s unreleased &quot;Lifehouse&quot; album), as well as demos for &quot;Flame&quot; and &quot;Early Morning Dreams&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Make Me Real&quot;, &quot;Outlive the Dinosaur&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot; were all issued to radio stations with dialogue excised. A previously unreleased track, &quot;Uneasy Street&quot;, was later released on the compilation album &quot;The Best of Pete Townshend&quot; (1996).

After slow sales of the initial dialogue intense release, a &quot;music only&quot; version was issued, though sales and reviews were still disappointing. Fan reception was divided: some felt that Townshend&#x27;s ideas were too pretentious even for him, while others have embraced it as the first worthy concept since &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. To date, it remains the final Pete Townshend solo album of all-original material, although further compilations have surfaced.

The Ray High character would resurface in 2005 as the central character in &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot;, a novella written by Townshend for his Web site; and again the following year in Townshend&#x27;s mini rock opera adaptation of that story, &quot;Wire &amp; Glass&quot;. That mini-opera would become the centrepiece of the Who&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Endless Wire&quot;.

==Meher Baba instrumentals==
There are four instrumental tracks which originated from Townshend&#x27;s 1970–1971 synthesizer demos for the Who&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971). Some of these experiments were released as &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; that year and as &quot;Who Are You&quot; in 1978. On &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;, the Meher Baba instrumentals appear in this order:
* &quot;Meher Baba M3&quot;: features a hypnotic synthesizer backing that may have been created specifically for this album. During this song, Ray High can be heard on a tape machine, listening through songs he had demoed as early as 1970 (an obvious allusion to Townshend trawling through his archives for &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;).
* &quot;Meher Baba M4 (Signal Box)&quot;: a heavier track that sounds similar to &quot;Who Are You&quot;, though this song undoubtedly features overdubs recorded by the musicians Townshend employed for &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;.
* &quot;Meher Baba M5 (Vivaldi)&quot;: an upbeat arrangement which draws its inspiration from classical composer Vivaldi.
* &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley (demo)&quot;: a demo recording of the classic Who track, this time with the &quot;Irish jig&quot; finale that would later feature a violin solo.

==Live in New York featuring Psychoderelict==
A performance from Townshend&#x27;s first North American solo tour was broadcast live from the theatre of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in August 1993. The concert was in three parts: an opening session of eight songs, a complete performance of &quot;Psychoderelict&quot; and an encore of a further five songs.

The performance was featured by PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot; and directed by Richard Barnes and Bruce Gowers. It was later issued as a double CD called &quot;Pete Townshend Live BAM 1993&quot; and an NTSC all region DVD in 2006, titled &quot;Pete Townshend Live in New York featuring Psychoderelict&quot; ASIN: B000B8TJ6W. The DVD included an interview with Pete Townshend conducted by Barry Barnes recorded specifically for this release in September 2005.

<text>Interstate 475 (I-475) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in Ohio that is a western bypass of Toledo. The southern terminus is I-75 exit 192 near Perrysburg. From the southern terminus to exit 14, I-475 is cosigned with US Route 23 (US 23) and is signed the north–south section of I-475. From exit 14 to the eastern (northernmost) terminus at I-75 exit 204 in central Toledo (north of downtown), it is signed the east–west section of I-475.

Although I-475 crosses I-80/I-90 (the Ohio Turnpike), there is no interchange and one must drive a couple of miles through surface streets between I-475 exit 6 and I-80/I-90 exit 59.

I-475 is named the Rosa Parks Highway in honor of Rosa Parks, who had helped organize the Montgomery bus boycott.

==Route description==

I-475 is a half-beltway bypassing Downtown Toledo on its western side as mostly a north–south segment and a largely east–west segment on the north side of Toledo. It has almost a half-square shape on the map consisting of the top and left sides of the square. It is much less direct than its parent I-75 through Toledo; the entire route of I-475 uses to connect exits apart on I-75.

I-475 parallels what was US 23 on its north–south segment (US 23 has been realigned to it); it has Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a control city northbound (via US 23) and Columbus and Dayton as control cities southbound; it reaches neither of the three cities. On its northern segment it parallels State Route 120 (SR 120) and has Toledo as a control city to the east. Rural when built, it has much suburban-style development along its route.

It has no direct access to the Ohio Turnpike, access to which requires the use of either SR 2 to and from the west, I-75 to or from the east, or surface streets to US 20.

==History==
I-475 was opened in sections with the first opened in 1967 between US 20, at the current I–75 interchange near Perrysburg, and US 24, near Maumee. By 1969, the second portion opened between US 24 and US 23, near Sylvania. In this year, the southern terminus was moved from US 20, near Perrysburg, to the southern interchange with I–75. The final section opened in 1971 and was between US 23 and I-75 near Downtown Toledo.

Between 2010 and 2012, the easternmost sections of I-475 were reconstructed. This included the redevelopment of several overpasses, as well as the removal of an outdated interchange with Central Avenue in favor of an interchange with a newly constructed extension of ProMedica Parkway for easier access. Additional lanes were also added at the I-75/I-475 junction at I-475&#x27;s eastern terminus.

Since July 2015, work has been ongoing along the western stretch of I-475 in Lucas County along its concurrency with US 23 to widen the freeway from two to three lanes in both directions to meet the needs of development in the western suburbs of Toledo. As part of this, two interchanges are being built and a preexisting one has been upgraded. The interchange with US 20 in Sylvania Township was upgraded from a partial cloverleaf interchange to a single-point urban interchange by November 2016. Interchanges at SR 246 and US 20 Alternate (US 20A) in Springfield Township and Maumee are under planning and construction, with the SR 246 interchange, a dumbbell interchange, opened on August 2, 2021, in time for the Solheim Cup. Construction on the US 20A interchange has commenced as of late 2023. 

In Perrysburg, work was completed in late 2017 on upgrading the diamond interchange with SR 25 into a diverging diamond interchange.

<text>Interstate 475 (I-475) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Michigan. I-475 is a bypass route that serves the downtown area of Flint while its parent, I-75, passes through the west side of the city. I-475 starts southwest of Grand Blanc and runs through suburbs of Flint before passing through downtown. There, it intersects I-69 and crosses the Flint River. The freeway turns westerly to connect back to I-75 north of Flint near Mount Morris.

This component freeway of the State Trunkline Highway System was planned in the 1950s and built in the 1970s. The trunkline was first named the Buick Freeway to honor David Dunbar Buick&#x27;s contributions to Flint&#x27;s early automotive industry as founder of Buick Motor Company. I-475 was renamed in 1981 the UAW Freeway, honoring the United Auto Workers, a labor union which was active in Flint. At the same time, the name of I-69 in Flint was changed from the &quot;Chevrolet Freeway&quot; to the &quot;Chevrolet-Buick Freeway&quot;. Since 2001, I-475 has borne both the UAW and Buick names officially.

==Route description==
I-475 starts at a partial interchange with I-75 in Grand Blanc Township, southwest of Grand Blanc. From this start at exit 111, the freeway proceeds northward through a suburban residential area next to a baseball field complex. As I-475 continues northward, it has an interchange with Hill Road near the Crestwood Memorial Gardens cemetery and several commercial properties. North of the Maple Avenue underpass, the freeway crosses into the suburb of Burton where it runs for about before crossing into the city of Flint. The freeway then curves around to the northeast near Thread Lake, crossing over Saginaw Street. I-475 follows the western shore of the lake as it turns northward to run into downtown Flint.
South of the four-level stack interchange with I-69, I-475 crosses over a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of this interchange, the freeway runs more northwesterly as it skirts the eastern edge of downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan–Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it next to an industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by Lake State Railway. North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the west to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange at exit 125 on I-75 and US Highway 23 (US 23).

I-475 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. According to the department&#x27;s surveys in 2010, the highest traffic levels along I-475 were the 57,400 vehicles on average daily north of the I-69 interchange in Flint; the lowest counts were the 18,637 vehicles per day west of the Clio Road interchange. As an Interstate Highway, I-475 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

A freeway along the I-475 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways&quot;, an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.

I-475 was first opened to traffic in the early 1970s. The first section was built between I-75/US 10 northward to M-21/M-78. The second section was built from I-75/US 10/US 23 to Business M-54 (Bus M-54) along the north side of town. These two sections were opened on November 9, 1973, and September 26, 1974, respectively. The final section was opened between them in 1981.

==Memorial highway designations==
I-475 has carried two different memorial highway designations in its history, the Buick Freeway and the UAW Freeway.

David Dunbar Buick was a Scottish-born immigrant who moved to Detroit with his parents at the age of two in 1856–1857. He quit school to supplement the family&#x27;s income after his father&#x27;s 1860 death. In the 1880s, he was a plumbing supplier in the Detroit area, inventing a process that created a cheaper white bathtub. Buick produced a method for permanently coating cast iron with vitreous enamel, which allowed the production of white baths at lower cost. He later sold his plumbing business and the patents to American Standard. Using the profits from this sale, Buick started working on gasoline engines, and later automobiles. He eventually moved his operations from Detroit to the Flint Wagon Works. William C. Durant managed the fledgling Buick Manufacturing Company, making it the number one car-building company in the country by 1908. Durant later built on the foundation of Buick&#x27;s company to create General Motors. In honor of Buick&#x27;s contributions to Flint&#x27;s manufacturing base, the Flint City Commission proposed naming I-475 after Buick. The freeway passed by the city&#x27;s Buick plant and many of the employees would use the new freeway on their commutes to work. The Michigan Legislature passed Concurrent Resolution 22 in 1969 to add the name.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) was founded in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union struggled to gain members until the Flint sit-down strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No. 1 stopped loading tool dies on the night shift, locking themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant sat down on the job; Fisher Plant No. 2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and, on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000 National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No. 4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12 striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.

A local politician wanted to honor not just the automotive pioneers in Flint but the workers that worked in the plants. Since the UAW came to maturity in Flint as a result of the strikes, it was the appropriate location for a memorial highway designation. In 1980, the Michigan Legislature passed House Concurrent Resolution 583, renaming Flint&#x27;s east–west freeway (I-69) the &quot;Chevrolet–Buick Freeway&quot; and I-475 the &quot;UAW Freeway&quot;. I-475 was dedicated with its new name on Labor Day 1981.

Public Act 142 of 2001 consolidated the memorial highway designations of the state. In passing this act, the Michigan Legislature expanded the Chevrolet–Buick Freeway to encompass all of I-69 in Genesee County; the act also restored Buick&#x27;s name to I-475.

==Future==
The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has proposed to MDOT that I-475 should be connected to US 23 in the southern part of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but they were indefinitely postponed in 2011.

<doc id="961429" wikidata="Q2520212" url="?curid=961429" title="Shiki-Jitsu">
<text>, also known as Ritual, is a 2000 Japanese psychological drama film written and directed by Hideaki Anno. It is based on the novella &quot;Tōhimu&quot; by Ayako Fujitani, who also stars alongside Shunji Iwai. 

Like Anno&#x27;s previous film &quot;Love &amp; Pop&quot; (1998), it is an art film with experimental elements diving into the minds of its main characters. &quot;Shiki-Jitsu&quot; takes place over 33 days and follows the relation between an apathetic film director (Iwai) and an odd young woman (Fujitani) who start a bizarre friendship after a chance meeting and they try to work their way out of a collective emotional funk. Michael Ordona of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the film had &quot;dark themes of mental illness and suicidal ideation&quot;. &quot;Shiki-Jitsu&quot; won an award for Best Artistic Contribution at the 13th International Film Festival in Tokyo.

==Story==
The film follows a young Director returning to his home city of Ube in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and an eccentric young Woman he meets, whose quirks include saying &quot;tomorrow is my birthday&quot; every day and wearing very unusual clothing.

But as the days go by, it appears that the Woman has little touch with reality and is constantly escaping into a fantasy world, while the Director himself is a former anime director who is seeking to do a &quot;real film&quot; and embrace reality. The two eventually fall in love.

In the end, the Director confronts the Woman with her mother, allowing the Woman to make the first steps into the real world. The films ends with the Girl circling December 7 as her real birthday and the words &quot;beyond the 33rd day: unknown&quot;.

==Release==
The film was produced by Studio Kajino, an offshoot of Studio Ghibli, run by its former president Toshio Suzuki who served on the film as executive producer. It was given a première at the Tokyo Photography Museum in Ebisu Garden Place on December 7, 2000.

The movie was later released on VHS and DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan July 24, 2003 as part of the &quot;Ghibli Cinematic Library&quot; series. On July 1, 2020, the movie was released to Video on demand by King Records.

<doc id="961436" wikidata="Q4859909" url="?curid=961436" title="Burk's Falls">
<text>Burk&#x27;s Falls is an incorporated village in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound District, Ontario, Canada, located north of Toronto and south of North Bay, Ontario. The village, and the waterfall on the site, were named (for himself) by David Francis Burk of Oshawa, after he selected the land surrounding the waterfall in the Free Land Grant Act. Burk&#x27;s Falls is part of the Magnetawan River waterway.

==Geography==
Located about west of Algonquin Provincial Park in picturesque cottage country, Burk&#x27;s Falls is at the intersection of Ontario Highway 11 and the Magnetawan River. It is an enclave within Armour Township. The area is set amid the fresh-water bodies that make Northern Ontario famous; the largest of which are Horn Lake to the Northwest, Pickerel Lake to the Northeast, Three Mile Lake to the Southeast, and the joined Doe and Little Doe Lakes to the Southwest.

==History==

The area around Burk&#x27;s Falls was first settled by loggers during the 1860s. At that time, the only access to the region was via the Magnetawan River from Georgian Bay, or through the forests of the unsurveyed townships, north of Bracebridge. After 1875 the Rosseau-Nipissing Colonization Road allowed access from Muskoka, to the south. In 1879 steamboat service was established to the foot of the falls, from the historic village of Magnetawan. Railway service came to Burk&#x27;s Falls in 1886, with the opening of Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1888. The Village of Burk&#x27;s Falls was incorporated in 1890.
A rare swing bridge was completed over the Magnetawan, just west of Burk&#x27;s Falls.


===Growth of the village===
This growth has been limited and Burk&#x27;s Falls has not amalgamated with any nearby towns such as Katrine. The population has remained steady over the last decades, standing around 1000. Expansion of Highway 11 as a dual carriageway has prompted a new interchange.

Also located in Burk&#x27;s Falls is the Outward Bound Canadian Base Camp.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Burk&#x27;s Falls had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Transportation==
The village is served by provincial highways 11 and 520.

Intercity motor coach service to Burk&#x27;s Falls is provided by Ontario Northland along its Toronto–Barrie–Parry Sound–Sudbury route&#x27;s local schedule; it is bypassed by express schedules, but still receives twice-daily service northbound and southbound.

<doc id="961437" wikidata="Q598860" url="?curid=961437" title="Congo (film)">
<text>Congo is a 1995 American science fiction action-adventure film based on the 1980 novel by Michael Crichton. It was directed by Frank Marshall and stars Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry. Released on June 9, 1995 by Paramount Pictures, the film tells the story of an expedition team and a mountain gorilla owned by one of its members who go to the Congo jungles to find a missing expedition and the ruins of an ancient civilization where diamonds might be located while encountering the gray gorillas that lurk near there.

It received negative reviews, but performed better than expected at the box office.

==Plot==

Searching for rare blue diamonds that could enable a revolutionary communications laser, TraviCom employees Charles Travis and Jeffrey Weems discover the ruins of a lost city near a remote volcano in the Congo jungle. Karen Ross, Charles&#x27;s ex-fiancée and a former CIA operative, and R.B. Travis, Charles&#x27;s father and the CEO of TraviCom, lose contact with the team while tracking their progress at the company headquarters. A remote camera shows the camp destroyed and strewn with corpses, before a monstrous ape destroys the camera. Travis asks Karen to lead another expedition to the site.

Primatologist Peter Elliott and his assistant Richard teach human communication to a mountain gorilla named Amy, whose sign language is translated into a digitized voice. Peter is concerned by Amy&#x27;s drawings of jungles and the Eye of Providence, and wants to return her to Africa. Karen and Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka join the expedition.

The group flies to Uganda and meets wilderness guide Monroe Kelly. Captain Wanta warns them not to trust Homolka and lets them proceed only upon receipt of a large bribe. On their journey via Tanzania and then Zaire, Monroe reveals that Homolka has led previous, disastrous safaris in search of the &quot;Lost City of Zinj&quot;. Their plane is shot down as they parachute into the jungle.

A native tribe leads them to Bob Driscoll, a wounded member of Charles&#x27;s expedition who dies screaming upon sight of Amy. The group continues by boat and they learn that Homolka believes Amy can lead them to the mine. They find the ruined camp near the City of Zinj. Richard and some porters are killed by a gray gorilla. The group keeps the gray gorillas at bay with automated sentry guns.

At daybreak, they explore the city and surmise from hieroglyphs that the inhabitants bred the gray gorillas to guard the mine, but were overthrown by them. At the mine, Homolka begins collecting diamonds, only to be killed by the gray gorillas. Monroe, Karen, and Peter flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Jeffrey and Charles&#x27;s bodies, with the latter still holding a giant blue diamond. Karen fits the diamond into a portable laser and uses it to kill several gray gorillas. The volcano erupts, and the four escape as lava floods the city killing the gray gorillas.

Karen reports to Travis. Realizing Travis was only interested in the diamond, Karen destroys the TraviCom satellite. They find a hot-air balloon in one of Travis&#x27;s wrecked cargo planes. Seeing Amy with fellow mountain gorillas, Peter bids her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Karen has Peter throw the diamond into the jungle below. Amy watches the departing balloon, then joins the other mountain gorillas.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
After the success of &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;, Crichton decided to write a screenplay specifically for Sean Connery as the character Charles Munro, an archetypal &quot;great white hunter&quot; akin to H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s hero Allan Quatermain. The film was envisioned as an homage to classic pulp adventure tales, and Crichton successfully pitched the movie to 20th Century Fox in 1979 without a fleshed out story. Crichton left the project when he learned that he could not use a real gorilla to portray the character of Amy. It was offered to several directors including Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter. A brief attempt was made to revive the project in the late 1980s. Eventually, Frank Marshall directed the film with little, if any, involvement from Crichton. The film&#x27;s teaser credits John Patrick Shanley and Crichton as co-screenwriters, but the trailer and the film itself credit Shanley alone.

Originally, Delroy Lindo was set to shoot his scene in the Dominican Republic, but ended up shooting it in Pasadena, California.

The gorilla suits for Amy the mountain gorilla and the gray gorillas as well as the hippopotamus puppet were created by Stan Winston&#x27;s company Stan Winston Studio.

==Release==
===Marketing===
A teaser trailer for &quot;Congo&quot; debuted in theaters on November 18, 1994, with the release of &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. It was also attached to the VHS release of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Promotional partners included Taco Bell, Pepsi, and Kenner Products.

===Home media===
&quot;Congo&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 21, 1995. The LaserDisc release is THX certified and consists of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions, while also featuring a Dolby Digital AC-3 track. A widescreen VHS release debuted a year later on September 10, 1996. The DVD was released on July 27, 1999.

In 2024, ahead of the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Vinegar Syndrome announced a 4K Blu-ray release of the film as part of their &quot;Ultra&quot; sub-label, under license from Paramount and newly remastered from the original film elements.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Congo&quot; was estimated to gross $13–$15 million in its opening weekend, but surprised the industry when it grossed $24.6 million for the weekend, placing number one at the US box office ahead of &quot;Casper&quot;. It was overtaken by &quot;Batman Forever&quot; during its second weekend. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $81,022,101. The final worldwide gross was $152,022,101 versus a $50,000,000 budget.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes collected 52 reviews to give the film an approval rating of 23% with a rating average of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Mired in campy visual effects and charmless characters, &quot;Congo&quot; is a suspenseless adventure that betrays little curiosity about the scientific concepts it purports to care about.&quot; Metacritic rated it 22/100 based on 19 reviews, meaning &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 3 out of 4 stars. He called the film a splendid example of a genre no longer much in fashion, the jungle adventure story. It was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film a &quot;Spielberg knockoff...shamelessly lifting themes and ideas from a handful of Steven&#x27;s greatest hits.&quot; He criticized Amy the gorilla as &quot;the most disappointing &#x27;performance&#x27; of all&quot; and opined that the supporting actors, Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson, stood out more than the lead actors.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said &quot;Congo&quot; was full of &quot;goofy pleasures&quot; like &quot;delectably goofy&quot; lasers and &quot;mutant killer apes&quot;, calling it one of the most enjoyable films that came out of the post–&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; period. He said he enjoyed the film more as a campy comedy than as the thriller the trailers made it out to be, and concluded with &quot;Is &quot;Congo&quot; a good film? It&#x27;s certainly a good time.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Other media==
===Video game===
A video game based on the film, &quot;Congo the Movie: The Lost City of Zinj&quot;, was released for Sega Saturn in 1996. A different game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis was in development, but was cancelled. Another adventure game was released for PC and Macintosh called &quot;&quot;.

===Pinball===
A Williams pinball machine named &quot;Congo&quot; was produced in 1995 that was based on the film.

<text>Rouleau is a town in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, on the Canadian Prairies. It lies within census Division No. 6 and Rural Municipality of Redburn No. 130.

As of 2021, the population was 505 (a decrease of 6.5 percent from the 2016 census), in an area of . Rouleau is on Highway 39 and is about southwest of Regina.

The town was notably the filming location of the popular Canadian sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, depicting the fictitious town of Dog River.

== History ==

A post office was established at Rouleau in the provisional District of Assiniboia, North West Territories, as early as April 1, 1895. It incorporated as a village on July 23, 1903.

Rouleau was named after Charles Borromée Rouleau. Rouleau was a magistrate in Battleford from 1883 until 1887 and served in the 1st Council of the North-West Territories.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rouleau had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
== Climate ==

== &quot;Corner Gas&quot; ==

The town is best known as the main filming location for the CTV television series &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. The series&#x27; production team built a full-size mock gas station and coffee shop at the western entrance of the town for filming, causing confusion among visitors thinking Corner Gas and The Ruby were real establishments. The town&#x27;s grain elevator was also repainted with the name &quot;Dog River&quot; as it appears in the background of many episodes of the series.

For an episode which aired in early 2007, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper stopped in Rouleau to play a cameo role in the television show.

The buildings used as sets for the program were allowed to fall into disrepair after the show wrapped up production. They were purchased by an entrepreneur, Sylvain Senecal, who converted them into a museum and souvenir shop. The set was demolished in November 2016.

On 28 September 2014, the building that was used as the FOO[D] MAR[KE]T, the local grocery store in the series, was destroyed in a fire. The grain elevator was destroyed in a fire on November 5, 2021, about two weeks after the building used for depicting Dog River&#x27;s police station collapsed.

<text>196 (one hundred [and] ninety-six) is the natural number following 195 and preceding 197.

==In mathematics==
196 is a square number, the square of 14. As the square of a Catalan number, it counts the number of walks of length 8 in the positive quadrant of the integer grid that start and end at the origin, moving diagonally at each step. It is part of a sequence of square numbers beginning 0, 1, 4, 25, 196, ... in which each number is the smallest square that differs from the previous number by a triangular number.

There are 196 one-sided heptominoes, the polyominoes made from 7 squares. Here, one-sided means that asymmetric polyominoes are considered to be distinct from their mirror images.

A Lychrel number is a natural number which cannot form a palindromic number through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. 196 is the smallest number conjectured to be a Lychrel number in base 10; the process has been carried out for over a billion iterations without finding a palindrome, but no one has ever proven that it will never produce one.

<text>The 50th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored films released in 1977 and took place on April 3, 1978, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 22 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Howard W. Koch and was directed by Marty Pasetta. Actor and comedian Bob Hope hosted the show for the 19th time. He first presided over the 12th ceremony held in 1940 and had last served as a co-host of the 47th ceremony held in 1975. Five days earlier, in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on March 29, the Academy Scientific and Technical Awards were presented by hosts Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck.

&quot;Annie Hall&quot; won four awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;Star Wars&quot; with six awards, &quot;Julia&quot; with three, and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, &quot;Gravity Is My Enemy&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Find a Way&quot;, &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, &quot;Madame Rosa&quot;, &quot;The Sand Castle&quot;, &quot;Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids?&quot;, and &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; with one. In addition, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; were each presented with an additional Special Award. The telecast garnered 48.5 million viewers in the United States.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 50th Academy Awards were announced on February 21, 1978. &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;The Turning Point&quot; tied for the most nominations with eleven each. The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on April 3. Woody Allen became the first person to receive nominations for acting, directing, and screenwriting for the same film since Orson Welles, who previously achieved this feat for 1941&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. With its 11 nominations and zero wins, &quot;The Turning Point&quot; was the most nominated film in Oscar history without a win. By virtue of her win for her role as the titular character in &quot;Julia&quot;, Vanessa Redgrave became the first and only performer to win in a supporting acting category for playing a titular role.

==Ceremony information==
In December 1977, the Academy announced that actor and comedian Bob Hope was chosen to host the 1978 ceremony. As a result of his selection, he became the first person to emcee the Oscars gala solo since the 40th ceremony held in 1968. Oscars gala producer Howard W. Koch explained his decision to hire Hope as host, stating, &quot;The multiple emcee system of recent years is a good one, but we decided this year&#x27;s show called for a single master of ceremonies. And we couldn&#x27;t think of anyone better suited for the role than Bob Hope.&quot;

In celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Academy and the Oscars, AMPAS hosted a dinner reception at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel on May 11, 1977. The gala, which Hope also hosted, took place in the same spot as the organization&#x27;s first meeting, exactly 50 years later. ABC also aired specials prior to the ceremony, highlighting the history of the awards.

===Vanessa Redgrave&#x27;s speech===
Prior to the ceremony, Vanessa Redgrave&#x27;s Best Supporting Actress nomination was met with controversy due to her recent involvement with &quot;The Palestinian&quot;, a documentary chronicling the activities of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The film garnered controversy from several Jewish groups for its anti-Israel commentary. Outside of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on the day of the ceremony, Jewish Defense League protestors burned a statue of the actress, while counter-protestors waved Palestinian flags. After paying tribute to writer Lillian Hellman and the titular character of &quot;Julia&quot; for which she won the Best Supporting Actress award, Redgrave remarked in her acceptance speech, &quot;And I salute you, and I pay tribute to you, and I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you&#x27;ve stood firm, and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums.&quot; She concluded her speech stating, &quot;I salute you and I thank you and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against Antisemitism and fascism.&quot; The comments received both applause and booing amongst the audience. Later during the ceremony, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky prefaced his presentation of the screenplay awards, saying, &quot;I would like to suggest to Miss Redgrave that her winning an Academy Award is not a pivotal moment in history, does not require a proclamation and a simple ‘Thank you’ would’ve sufficed.&quot;

===Critical reviews===
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Charles Champlin wrote, &quot;The Oscar show as a show had more of what it has recently been short of, which is the presence of authentic film stars. It had refreshingly less of what it has sometimes had too much of, which is awkward and underrehearsed cross-talk.&quot; Columnist Aaron Gold of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; remarked, &quot;Howard Koch and Allan Carr deserve Oscars for the work they did in creating an exciting and glamorous show, as they promised. Master of ceremonies Bob Hope... brought the air of dignity and continuity to the show that it lacked last year.&quot; &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; entertainment columnist commented, &quot;If the evening was never as nimble as a dance by Fred Astaire, it was jam-packed with nostalgia, suspense, laughter, a few tears, and production numbers as striking as anything in Oscar&#x27;s history.&quot;

John Huddy of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; observed, &quot;The Redgrave-Chayevsky exchange enlivened a long Oscar night in which there were too many silly songs, too many special awards that nobody gave a hoot about, and too many dreary acceptance speeches by obscure if talented short-subject makers.&quot; &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; columnist Mike Petryni wrote, &quot;Produced this year by Howard Koch, who incidentally co-wrote &quot;Casablanca&quot;, the show seemed, as usual, rather dull, draggy and sluggish. Writing for the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; said, &quot;Monday&#x27;s Academy Awards telecast seemed like one of the dullest in recent years.&quot; He noted that the Best Original Song performance were longer and more ridiculous than in previous, and he lamented that winners Jason Robards and Woody Allen were absent to collect their awards.

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 48.5 million people over the length of the entire ceremony, which was a 22% increase from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. The show drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 36.3% of households watching with a 68% share. The ceremony presentation received five nominations at the 30th Primetime Emmys, but failed to win any of its nominations.

<text>James William Gerlach (born February 25, 1955) is the former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2003 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party. Gerlach retired from Congress after completing his sixth term.

==Early life, education and career==
Gerlach was born in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania to Helen Lorraine (née Fitzgerald) and Jack Allen Gerlach. His father was killed by a drunk driver when he was five years old, leaving his mother to raise three children on her own. He graduated from Dickinson College where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and the Raven&#x27;s Claw Honorary Society, with a B.A. in Political Science. He also earned his J.D. degree from Dickinson School of Law in 1980. During law school, Gerlach worked as a legislative aide in the Pennsylvania State Senate.

In 1985, Gerlach moved back to Ellwood City and worked at the Butler law firm Lindsey &amp; Lutz. In 1986, he challenged Frank LaGrotta in the race for state representative but lost. In 1987, he returned to Chester County to work for the Lamb, Windle &amp; McErlane law firm in West Chester, whose senior partner was then-Chester County Republican Chairman William Lamb.

On March 6, 2020, the board of directors from the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance announced that Gerlach had been named president and CEO of the organization.

==Pennsylvania Legislature==
In preparation for the 1990 election against long time Democratic State Rep. Sam Morris, Gerlach visited 10,000 homes in the 155th District of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, building his campaign around what he saw as the incumbent&#x27;s inattentiveness to suburban sprawl. According to a local newspaper, the Daily Local News, Gerlach charged that his opponent was &quot;out of touch&quot; with his constituency.

Gerlach proposed expanding open-space preservation by using zoning laws to encourage developers to incorporate open space into development projects, along with the creation of environmental protection authorities.

During the election, Gerlach&#x27;s Democratic opponents accused the Western Pennsylvania native of moving to Chester County for the sole purpose of running against Morris. Gerlach denied that accusation and said he moved to Chester County because he and his wife saw it as &quot;a great place to work and raise our kids.&quot; He ultimately defeated Morris by only 23 votes out of 17,000 cast. He was reelected in 1992 with 64 percent of the vote.

Gerlach was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1994, with 67 percent of the vote, in the newly re-formed 44th district. He defeated Democrat Barry Robertson (whose campaign was heavily funded by Sam Morris, Gerlach&#x27;s opponent four years earlier) in that election, and was re-elected in 1998 without opposition. While in the State Senate, he helped change the state&#x27;s welfare laws.

While in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Pennsylvania Senate, Gerlach worked to sponsor legislation making it easier for the commonwealth&#x27;s patchwork of municipalities to work together to preserve open space. Gov. Tom Ridge signed Gerlach&#x27;s legislation into law in 2000.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Gerlach was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2002 from the newly created 6th District, sometimes called the &quot;Pterodactyl District&quot; because of its unusual shape; it twisted and wound its way through the outer western suburbs of Philadelphia. Although the district was reportedly drawn to elect a Republican, he had a somewhat difficult time holding onto it in elections, largely due to the growing Democratic trend in the Philadelphia suburbs.
On January 6, 2014 Gerlach announced that he would not seek reelection, &quot;to spend more time with my wife and family.&quot;

===Legislative action and stances===
====Environment, Conservation and Development====

Gerlach has strongly supported Schuylkill Valley commuter rail. At one point he said of the Bush administration&#x27;s plan to cut federal money for construction costs from 80 percent to 50 percent: &quot;There&#x27;s just not going to be enough state and local funds to do the project. It will be a dead project.&quot;

The farmland-preservation and open-space advocacy that Gerlach became known for during his tenure as a state legislator has continued during his congressional career. On September 27, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Gerlach-sponsored bill H.R. 5313 that would make federal funds available to municipalities around the country to purchase conservation easements. This bill was never acted on by the Senate, and was re-introduced as H.R. 1152 in March 2007.

====Military and Social Issues====

In 2003, Gerlach sponsored a new law mandating a new veterans cemetery in the Philadelphia area within four years. The nearest military cemetery to accept casket burials was located 90 miles from Philadelphia.

In 2009, Gerlach opposed HR 2454, which was designed to amend several laws related to energy and the environment, and included a &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. As Gerlach later explained, &quot;While the bill included some positive provisions to develop alternative and renewable energy our country needs, I voted against this bill because of the devastating effect it will have on working families and the people who create jobs in my district and across Pennsylvania.&quot; The League of Conservation Voters, &quot;a national non-profit organization that works to turn environmental values into national priorities,&quot; rated Gerlach at 44 percent on their National Environmental Scorecard. In his 2010 campaign, Gerlach received $41,250 from the Energy/Natural Resource sector.

Gerlach voted against H. Con. Res. 63, which disapproved of The Surge; he said it was meaningless, fundamentally vague and would damage troop morale.

He was one of four Pennsylvania Republicans (the others were Todd Platts, Charlie Dent, and Phil English) to vote to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the federal hate crimes bill. Mr. Gerlach also opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have amended the constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2007, Gerlach voted against a bill that would have repealed &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell.&quot; In 2010, Gerlach also voted against the &quot;2010-2011 Defense Appropriations Act,&quot; which would have included a repeal of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; after military certification and review. Gerlach defended this vote, saying, &quot;Voting on this issue six months before Defense Secretary Robert Gates is scheduled to issue a thorough review of the policy and how best to implement any changes does nothing to improve the security of our country or the morale of the brave men and women serving in our military.&quot; In 2007-2008, Gerlach received a 64 percent support rating from the Family Research Council, an interest group whose mission statement commits it to being an organization that &quot;shapes public debate and formulates public policy that values human life and upholds the institutions of marriage and the family.&quot;

====Business, Industry and Regulation====

Gerlach has advocated the passage of legislation that would expand federal regulation of so-called &quot;puppy mills,&quot; and cosponsored medical liability legislation.

In 2010, Gerlach voted against the &quot;Health Care and Insurance Law Amendments,&quot; also known as HR 3590 or &quot;The Health Care Reform Bill.&quot; In a statement on the Health Care vote, Gerlach stated that the bill was &quot;written behind closed doors,&quot; and that it &quot;ushers in a new era of big government.&quot; Gerlach also expressed concerns about the bill&#x27;s impact on his constituents, saying &quot;In my district, innovation, investment and jobs in the life sciences and biotechnology sector will be at risk because of a new $2 billion per year tax on items used for cancer screening, knee and hip replacement surgery and other life-saving procedures.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Oversight
** Subcommittee on Health

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional COPD Caucus
* German-American Caucus – Gerlach co-founded the Caucus with Rep. Tim Holden (D-Pennsylvania) 
* House Land Conservation Caucus
* House Land Trust Caucus
* House Ukraine Caucus
* International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Small Brewer Caucus
* Congressional Cement Caucus

==Political positions==
Gerlach is a member of two moderate political groups: the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports government-funded embryonic stem-cell research; and Republicans for Environmental Protection. The liberal Americans for Democratic Action rated Gerlach&#x27;s 2005 voting record at 35 points out of 100; the American Conservative Union ranked him at 56 points, on the same scale. The American Public Health Association scored Representative Gerlach&#x27;s support record at 44 percent in 2009.

===Environmental conservation===
In 2013, Gerlach and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) introduced the Conservation Easement Incentive Act. The act would give tax benefits to property owners who preserve their land for conservation.

===Post-Congress work===
In 2015, Gerlach was announced as the new president and chief executive officer of BIPAC, the Business-Industry Political Action Committee. Prior to joining BIPAC and since leaving Congress, Gerlach had been working at Venable LLP. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Political campaigns==

===2002===
In 2002, he defeated Dan Wofford, son of former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford, by 51.4 percent to 48.6 percent.

In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the &quot;Most Likely to Succeed.&quot;

===2004===
In 2004, Gerlach won a close re-election against Democrat Lois Murphy, by 51.0 percent to 49.0 percent.

===2006===

In their rematch in 2006, Gerlach again beat Murphy by an even narrower margin of 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent (unofficial results as of November 8, 2006). Gerlach was the only member of the &quot;Philly Trio&quot; of vulnerable Republican Congressmen (the others being Curt Weldon and Mike Fitzpatrick) to survive the 2006 election. He overcame a negative political climate that included the then-unpopular war in Iraq, an unpopular president and a well-liked Democratic governor. Geography also played a factor; similar to the previous two cycles Gerlach carried Chester County, Berks County, and Lehigh County by significant margins, while Murphy carried the heavily Democratic Montgomery County portion of the district.

===2008===

In the 2008 election, Gerlach defeated Democratic nominee Bob Roggio to win a fourth term.

In all three contests, Gerlach survived by swamping his Democratic opponents in Chester County, where he resides.

===2010===

In February 2009, Gerlach formed a committee to explore a run for Governor of Pennsylvania in the 2010 election. Gerlach ended his campaign for governor on January 7, 2010.

Gerlach had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the United States Senate seat held by Arlen Specter after John Cornyn, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, contacted him following Specter&#x27;s May 2009 party-switch. However, he ultimately decided not to run for the Senate and instead sought reelection to the House. He faced the Democratic nominee Manan Trivedi, an Iraq war veteran and physician, but won re-election with 57% of the vote.

===2012===

Gerlach was again challenged by Democratic nominee Manan Trivedi. Once again, he prevailed over Trivedi at 57 to 43%. He got a substantial assist from the post-census redistricting. The 6th was pushed to the west, extending a tendril across Berks County to grab much of heavily Republican Lebanon County. While Barack Obama carried the old 6th with 58 percent of the vote in 2008, Obama would have only won the new 6th with 53 percent. Ultimately, Mitt Romney narrowly carried the new 6th with just over 50 percent of the vote.

==Personal life==
Gerlach has three children and three step-children. He currently lives in Chester Springs.

<doc id="961459" wikidata="Q593160" url="?curid=961459" title="Girls Town (1959 film)">
<text>Girls Town is a 1959 American drama film directed by Charles F. Haas and starring Mamie Van Doren, Mel Tormé, and Ray Anthony. Paul Anka also appears in his first acting role. Van Doren stars as a juvenile delinquent who is sent to a girls&#x27; school run by nuns, where she finds herself unable to help her sister. The film capitalizes on the 1950s rebellious-teen exploitation films, with catfights, car races, music from Anka and The Platters, and sexy outfits.

The supporting cast includes the offspring of two major silent cinema stars: Charles Chaplin Jr. and Harold Lloyd Jr. Also featured is James Mitchum (son of Robert Mitchum) and (as a nun) gossip columnist Sheilah Graham. Elinor Donahue of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; also acted in the film. A year after making it she said: &quot;I would just as soon forget the whole thing. In the first five minutes of the picture it was established that I was a good girl, being pushed into being a bad girl. The rest of the picture I spent doing practically nothing but crying and saying, &#x27;Help me, help me!&#x27; It was fun making it, but it was an awful picture.&quot;

&quot;Girls Town&quot; was lampooned in July 1994 on movie-mocking television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. About 15 minutes of the actual film were cut from this version.

==Plot==

The movie opens with a young woman fending off an attempted rape. In the process, the would-be rapist accidentally falls off a cliff to his death. Circumstantial evidence places 16-year-old delinquent Silver (played by a 27-year-old Van Doren) at the scene, and she is sent to Girls Town, a rehabilitation village run by a group of nuns. There, she lives with Serafina (Gigi Perreau) and some experienced juvenile delinquents. Trouble and misunderstandings ensue. Troublemaker Fred (Tormé) saw the cliff incident from a distance and realizes it was actually Silver&#x27;s sister, Mary Lee (Elinor Donahue), who was there. Fred blackmails Mary Lee into being his partner in deadly &quot;hands-off drag racing&quot;, then prepares to take her to Tijuana to sell her into the slave trade. Silver finally wins the respect of her Girls Town friends, and finally they rescue Mary Lee.

A subplot involves delusional Serafina believing famous teen idol Jimmy (Anka) is in love with her. During the film, he sings &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Cry&quot;, &quot;Girls Town Blues&quot;, and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. A scene set in a nightclub features The Platters singing &quot;Wish It Were Me&quot;.

==Cast==
==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $375,000 in the US and Canada and $500,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $65,000.

== Censorship ==
When &quot;Girls Town&quot; was first released in Italy in 1960 the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities imposed the removal of the scene in which Silver is showering while singing &quot;Hey Mama&quot; because it was considered to be offensive to decency. The official document number is: 32004, it was signed on 1 June 1960 by Minister .

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
&quot;Girls Town&quot; was featured in episode number 601 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. The episode debuted July 16, 1994, on Comedy Central. The episode featured the debut of the Umbilicus, a tube or tether connecting the Satellite of Love, where Mike Nelson and his robot pals watched the movie, with Deep 13, where the evil scientists who sent him the movies worked and lived.

The episode was ranked number 72 on the Top 100 list of episodes as voted upon by &quot;MST3K&quot; Season 11 Kickstarter backers. Writer Jim Vorel ranked the episode much higher, placing it at number 20 (out of 191 total &quot;MST3K&quot; episodes). Vorel laughs at the casting of Mel Torme as the movie&#x27;s antagonist, although he appreciates Mamie Van Doren&#x27;s pulchritude, even if she were years older than the juvenile delinquent she was supposed to be playing. Vorel calls the movie &quot;one of the more inherently watchable dramas ever featured on the show&quot;.

The &quot;MST3K&quot; version of &quot;Girls Town&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXXIX&quot; DVD collection, released by Shout! Factory in November 21, 2017. The other episodes in the four-disc set include &quot;The Amazing Transparent Man&quot; (episode #623) and &quot;&quot; (episode #1013). The fourth disc, titled &quot;Satellite Dishes&quot;, collected non-movie segments from &quot;MST3K&quot; episodes that are unlikely to be collected on DVD.

<text>151 (one hundred [and] fifty-one) is a natural number. It follows 150 and precedes 152.

==In mathematics==
151 is the 36th prime number, the previous is 149, with which it comprises a twin prime. 151 is also a palindromic prime, a centered decagonal number, and a lucky number.

151 appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 65, 86, 114; it is the sum of the first two of these.

151 is a unique prime in base 2, since it is the only prime with period 15 in base 2.

There are 151 4-uniform tilings, such that the symmetry of tilings with regular polygons have four orbits of vertices. 

151 is the number of uniform paracompact honeycombs with infinite facets and vertex figures in the third dimension, which stem from 23 different Coxeter groups. Split into two whole numbers, 151 is the sum of 75 and 76, both relevant numbers in Euclidean and hyperbolic 3-space:
*75 is the total number of non-prismatic uniform polyhedra, which incorporate regular polyhedra, semiregular polyhedra, and star polyhedra, 
*75 uniform compound polyhedra, inclusive of seven types of families of prisms and antiprisms,
* 76 is the number of unique uniform compact hyperbolic honeycombs that are solely generated from Wythoff constructions.

While 151 is the 36th indexed prime, its twin prime 149 has a reciprocal whose repeating decimal expansion has a digit sum of 666, which is the magic constant in a formula_1 prime reciprocal magic square equal to the sum of the first 36 non-zero integers, or equivalently the 36th triangular number. 

Furthermore, the sum between twin primes (149, 151) is 300, which in turn is the 24th triangular number.

<text>Jacques Piccard (28 July 19221 November 2008) was a Swiss oceanographer and engineer, known for having developed underwater submarines for studying ocean currents. In the Challenger Deep, he and Lieutenant Don Walsh of the United States Navy were the first people to explore the deepest known part of the world&#x27;s ocean, and the deepest known location on the surface of Earth&#x27;s crust, the Mariana Trench, located in the western North Pacific Ocean.

==Family life==
Jacques Piccard was born in Brussels, Belgium, the son of Auguste Piccard, who was himself an adventurer and engineer. Jacques&#x27; father Auguste twice beat the record for reaching the highest altitude in a balloon, during 1931–1932. The Piccard family thus had the unique distinction of breaking world records for both the highest flight and the deepest dive.
* Jules Piccard (professor of chemistry)
** Auguste Piccard (physicist, aeronaut, balloonist, hydronaut)
*** Jacques Piccard (hydronaut)
**** Bertrand Piccard (aeronaut, balloonist)
** Jean Felix Piccard (organic chemist, aeronaut, and balloonist)
** Jeannette Piccard (wife of Jean Felix) (aeronaut and balloonist)
*** Don Piccard (balloonist)

Jacques&#x27;s father, who had already set altitude records in his balloon, started using the buoyancy technique used in balloons for developing a submersible vehicle, the bathyscaphe. Jacques initially started out his career by teaching economics at University of Geneva while continuing to help his father improve the bathyscaphe to demonstrate its potential for operating in deep waters. During that period Piccard also completed a diploma at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. Together, Piccard and his father built three bathyscaphes between 1948 and 1955, which reached record depths of 4,600 feet and 10,000 feet (the last one was bought by the government). With this success, the younger Piccard abandoned economics to collaborate with his father on further improving the bathyscaphe and demonstrating its practicality for exploration and research and then they collaborated.

Jacques&#x27;s son Bertrand Piccard is continuing his family traditions. He commanded the first non-stop balloon flight around the world in March 1999 and the first solar-powered plane flight around the world in December of 2009.

==Challenger Deep mission==

Jacques sought financial help from the U.S. Navy, which at that time was exploring various ways of designing submarines for underwater research. Jacques was welcomed to the U.S. to demonstrate his bathyscaphe, now named the &quot;Trieste&quot;. Impressed by his designs, the U.S. Navy bought the vessel and hired Piccard as a consultant. Recognizing the strategic value of a workable submersible for submarine salvage and rescue, the Navy began testing the &quot;Trieste&quot; for greater depths.

With his &quot;Trieste&quot; able to reach depths of 24,000 feet, Piccard and his colleagues planned an even greater challenge:—a voyage to the bottom of the sea. On 23 January 1960, Piccard and Lt. Don Walsh reached the floor of the Mariana Trench located in the western North Pacific Ocean. The depth of the descent was measured at 10,916 meters (35,813 feet); later, more accurate, measurements during 1995 found the Mariana Trench to be slightly less deep at 10,911 m (35,797 ft). The descent took four hours. The bathyscaphe carried no scientific equipment and no experiments were conducted; the mission&#x27;s purpose was to prove that the depth could be reached. The descent progressed without incident until 30,000 feet, when the crew heard a loud crack. They continued the dive, however, finally touching down in &quot;snuff-colored ooze&quot; at 35,800 feet.

When they reached the featureless seabed, they saw a flat fish as well as a new type of shrimp. Marine biologists later disputed their observations, claiming that no fish could survive the 17,000 psi pressure at such depths. Upon discovering cracks in the viewing windows, Piccard cut the voyage short. After only a 20-minute stay on the bottom, they began dumping ballast for their return to the surface, and the damaged vessel returned to its escort ships without incident in three hours and 15 minutes.

The historic dive received worldwide attention, and Piccard wrote an account of it, &quot;Seven Miles Down&quot;, with Robert S. Dietz, a renowned geologist who had helped plan the mission. A planned return expedition, however, never occurred. The &quot;Trieste&quot; was expensive to maintain and operate. It was incapable of collecting samples and could not take photographs and so had little scientific data to show for its voyages. 

==&quot;Ben Franklin&quot; mission==
On 14 July 1969, just two days before the Apollo 11 launch, the &quot;Ben Franklin&quot;, also known as the Grumman/Piccard PX-15 mesoscaphe, was towed to the high-velocity center of the Gulf Stream off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida. Once on site, the &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; with its six-man, international crew descended to off of Riviera Beach, Florida, and drifted north with the current for more than four weeks, surfacing near Maine.

The crew consisted of Jacques Piccard as the mission leader; Erwin Aebersold, another Swiss, as Piccard&#x27;s handpicked pilot and main assistant to Piccard and project engineer during the Franklin&#x27;s design and construction. Grumman selected a Navy submariner named Don Kazimir to be captain. The U.S. Navy Oceanographic Office sent Frank Busby to conduct a bottom survey along the drift track over the Continental Shelf and the Royal Navy sent Ken Haigh, an acoustic specialist, who studied underwater acoustics and performed sonic experiments up and down the water column throughout the mission. The sixth man was Chet May from NASA. His specialty was &quot;man working in space&quot;. Wernher von Braun learned about the &quot;Franklin&quot; mission, visited the submarine in Palm Beach, and considered the mission a kind of analogue to a prolonged mission in space, such as on the forthcoming Skylab. He appointed May as a NASA observer to accompany the mission and study the effects of prolonged isolation on the human crew. 

Named for the American patriot and inventor who was one of the first to chart the Gulf Stream, the &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; was built between 1966 and 1968 in Switzerland for Piccard and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation. It has been restored and now resides in the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vancouver, Canada.

==Influence and distinctions==

Ambient artists Matt Ruhlmann and Celer collaboratively released an album called &quot;Mesoscaphe&quot; in 2008, dedicated to the voyage of the &quot;Ben Franklin&quot;.

He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1972.

In 1981, Piccard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

On 1 February 2008, Piccard was honored &quot;Doctor honoris causa&quot; at the Catholic University of Louvain (Louvain-la-Neuve).

==Other activities==
Piccard was the founder of the Foundation for the Study and Protection of Seas and Lakes, based in Cully, Switzerland.

<text>Graciliano Ramos de Oliveira () (October 27, 1892 – March 20, 1953) was a Brazilian modernist writer, politician and journalist. He is known worldwide for his portrayal of the precarious situation of the poor inhabitants of the Brazilian &quot;sertão&quot; in his novel &quot;Vidas secas&quot;. His characters are complex, nuanced, and tend to have pessimistic world views, from which Ramos deals with topics such as the lust for power (the main theme in &quot;São Bernardo&quot;), misogyny (a key point in &quot;Angústia&quot;), and infidelity. His protagonists are mostly lower-class men from northeastern Brazil, which are often aspiring writers (such as in &quot;Caetés&quot;), or illiterate country workers, all of which usually have to deal with poverty and complex social relations.

Like fellow writers Jorge Amado and Erico Verissimo, Ramos was part of Brazil&#x27;s second generation of modernist writers, in what is known as &quot;1930s modernism&quot;. A lifelong supporter of communist ideas, he was affiliated with the original Brazilian Communist Party.

==Life==

Graciliano Ramos de Oliveira was born in the city of Quebrangulo, in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, on October 27, 1892, to Sebastião Ramos de Oliveira and Maria Amélia Ramos. Graciliano was the oldest of the couple&#x27;s 16 children.

He would spend most part of his childhood travelling through different cities of Northeast Brazil. After finishing high school in Maceió, he became a collaborator of the newspaper &quot;Jornal de Alagoas&quot; in 1909, where he published a sonnet called &quot;Céptico&quot; under the pen name Almeida Cunha, and some other texts under many different pseudonyms. He also published texts in the magazine &quot;O Malho&quot;, under the pen name Feliciano de Olivença, and founded a short-lived periodical named &quot;Echo Viçosense&quot; in 1906.

In 1914 he moved to Rio de Janeiro, but had to return to Alagoas in September 1915, in order to live with his father, who became a salesman in the city of Palmeira dos Índios. Also in 1915, he married his first wife, Maria Augusta de Barros, having with her four children. Maria Augusta died in 1920, due to troubles during childbirth.

In 1927, Ramos was elected mayor of Palmeira dos Índios: he took office in 1928 and would abdicate his post in 1930. Mesmerized by the high literary quality of his prefecture reports, Augusto Frederico Schmidt would approach Ramos into publishing his first novel, &quot;Caetés&quot;, that Ramos started to write circa 1925. He would finish &quot;Caetés&quot; in 1930, but did not publish it until 1933. In 1928, he married his second wife, Heloísa Leite de Medeiros, having with her four more children.

From 1930 to 1936 he lived once again in Maceió. In 1934 he published the novel &quot;São Bernardo&quot;, and in the following year, he was arrested due to alleged (but never confirmed) participation in the Communist uprising of 1935. (Graciliano wrote an account of his time in prison named &quot;Memórias do Cárcere&quot;, published a few months after his death in 1953.) After being freed from prison, he publishes with the help of associates such as José Lins do Rego his most famous novel, &quot;Angústia&quot;.

In 1938 he publishes &quot;Vidas Secas&quot; and moves definitely to Rio de Janeiro, where he became in 1945 a member of the Communist Party of Brazil. In the subsequent years, he travelled alongside his wife to countries such as France, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Also in 1945 he published an account of his childhood years, named &quot;Infância&quot;. Beginning in 1952, Graciliano&#x27;s health gradually began to decline. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and, after an unsuccessful surgery, died on March 20, 1953. His wife Heloísa would die 46 years later, in Salvador, Bahia.

Graciliano was survived by six children and his second wife.

==Public domain==
The work of Graciliano Ramos entered the public domain on January 1, 2024, after the 70th anniversary of the author&#x27;s death, according to Brazilian law. However, the family disputed this due to the fact that the author, at the time, still had a living daughter and maintained that, according to the Civil Code of 1916, the work remains protected for as long as she might have lived after 2024. For this reason, they signed a contract with Editora Record that will last until January 2029. However, it is uncertain whether the copyright will continue to be protected and according to Sonia Jardim, President of Record Group, in 2024 &quot;there may be two editions of &quot;Vidas Secas&quot; in the market&quot;. However, the last surviving daughter of Graciliano Ramos died in 2022. At the end of December 2023, the family announced that they would comply with Brazilian law.

<text>Christine &quot;Chris&quot; Melnick (born 1950) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a cabinet minister in the governments led by New Democratic Party (NDP) Premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Melnick received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba and subsequently received a master&#x27;s degree in library and information science from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. She has worked for a variety of businesses in the private and public sectors, with experience such fields as in education, advertising and offshore oil. Prior to entering provincial politics, she was employed as a librarian and researcher at the Canada/Manitoba Business Service Centre and was a trustee for the Louis Riel School Division of southeastern Winnipeg. She was also active in women&#x27;s health, human rights, literacy and environmental issues, and sat on the province&#x27;s Council on Post-Secondary Education.

Melnick was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 2003, succeeding retiring NDP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Linda Asper in the south Winnipeg riding of Riel. She received 4,393 votes, against 3,171 for her Progressive Conservative opponent, Shirley Render, who had previously represented the neighbouring riding of St. Vital from 1990 to 1999. The NDP, then led by Doer, won a landslide victory. Following the election, she was appointed Minister of Family Services and Housing, with responsibility for Persons with Disabilities.

She was re-elected in the provincial elections of 2007 and 2011.

In September 2007, Doer appointed her as Minister of Water Stewardship, succeeding Steve Ashton. In January 2012, Melnick was appointed Minister of Immigration and Multiculturalism. In October 2013, Selinger, who had been party leader and premier since 2009, shuffled Melnick out of cabinet, along with fellow veteran ministers Nancy Allan and Jim Rondeau.

On February 4, 2014, Selinger removed Melnick from the NDP caucus after she claimed she was told to act as a scapegoat for the premier relating to a controversy surrounding invitations issued to a legislative debate.
On November 13, 2014, Melnick was readmitted to NDP caucus, but the leadership refused to let her attend caucus meetings.

In 2018, Melnick was honoured with the Peter Gzowski Award for her contributions to literacy in Canada.

<doc id="961487" wikidata="Q468807" url="?curid=961487" title="Kay Granger">
<text>Norvell Kay Granger (, January 18, 1943) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 12th congressional district from 1997 to 2025. A Republican, Granger chaired the House Committee on Appropriations from 2023 to 2024.

A former teacher and businesswoman, Granger served on the zoning commission of Fort Worth and on the Fort Worth City Council. She was elected as the first female mayor of Fort Worth in 1991 and served in that capacity until 1995. Granger was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996. She is the first Republican woman elected to represent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives and the first Republican woman to chair the House Committee on Appropriations. 

Granger did not seek reelection in 2024. Following several months of absence from the Capitol, she was confirmed in December 2024 to have been residing in a senior living facility in Fort Worth, Texas since July 2024.

==Early life==
Granger was born on January 18, 1943 in Greenville, Texas. She graduated from Eastern Hills High School in 1961 and from Texas Wesleyan University in 1965.

==Early career==
Granger is a former teacher and businesswoman. She served on the zoning commission of Fort Worth from 1981 to 1989 and on the Fort Worth City Council from 1989 to 1991. Granger was elected as the first female mayor of Fort Worth in 1991 and served in that capacity until 1995.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
Granger was first elected to Congress in 1996. She is a Republican. After U.S. Representative Pete Geren announced he would retire in 1996, both the Democratic and Republican parties worked to recruit Granger to run for his seat. Granger represented Texas&#x27;s 12th congressional district from 1997 to 2025.

In 2020, Granger received the endorsement of President Donald Trump for her re-election campaign.

=== Tenure ===
Granger was elected Conference Vice Chair, the fourth-ranking position among House Republicans, in 2006. She served as chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State-Foreign Operations. She also sat on the United States House Committee on Appropriations&#x27;s Subcommittee on Defense (she is the first woman to do so) and the Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Subcommittee. Granger also served as a House Deputy Whip.

Granger was a member of the House Appropriations Committee for 25 years. She served as the ranking member of the Committee. After the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2022 elections, she was named chair of the Committee in January 2023. Granger is the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee. Granger stepped down from the Appropriations Committee chairship in April 2024.

After being diagnosed with COVID-19, Granger was not present at Trump&#x27;s second impeachment on January 13, 2021. She was one of four Republicans who did not vote on the impeachment. Granger stated that she opposed Trump&#x27;s impeachment, however.

==== Retirement ====
On October 30, 2023, Granger confirmed that she would not run for reeelection in 2024. On March 22, 2024, she announced that she would step down as chair of the House Appropriations Committee as soon as the Republican Steering Committee chose her replacement, which took place on April 10. Granger&#x27;s last recorded vote was on July 24, 2024; she was then absent from the Capitol until she returned to Washington in mid-November 2024 for a ceremony celebrating her work on the House Appropriations Committee. 

In December 2024, media reports confirmed that Granger had been residing in a senior living facility in Fort Worth since July 2024; her son said she had &quot;dementia issues.&quot; The incident sparked public backlash and renewed scrutiny of elderly politicians being allowed to serve in spite of advanced age and medical issues.

Republican Craig Goldman was elected to represent Texas&#x27;s 12th congressional district on November 5, 2024.

===Political positions===
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Granger as socially centrist, but fiscally conservative. In 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot;, a nonpartisan organization, gave Granger a composite political ideology score of 73% conservative and 27% liberal. According to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, as of February 2020, she voted with President Trump&#x27;s position on legislative issues about 97% of the time. By October 2021, she voted with President Biden&#x27;s position on legislative issues about 11% of the time.

====Abortion====
Granger formerly supported abortion rights and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. She reversed her position in 2020, asserting that she was anti-abortion, signing an amicus brief that asked the Supreme Court to overturn &quot;Roe&quot;.

Granger&#x27;s abortion reversal was especially significant given the fact that her 1996 campaign had been promoted by The WISH List, a pro-abortion rights PAC. The WISH List had also supported her 2008 campaign. Granger had received mixed ratings from groups that support legal abortion. Prior to 2020, Granger had supported embryonic stem-cell research and voted against banning &quot;chemically induced abortions.&quot; As of 2013, she supported banning abortion after 20 weeks, but asserted that abortion was not her top issue. In 2017, she declined to cosponsor a bill to ban abortion after six weeks. Granger voted for several spending bills that included funding for Planned Parenthood, including some introduced in 2018. In 2018, she also introduced legislation banning federal funding for abortion with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman. In 2019, Granger signed a letter to President Trump urging him to &quot;veto any appropriations bill that weakens current pro-life protections&quot;.

====Other issues====
Granger is known for her support for defense spending.

Granger voted several times in favor of an amendment to the United States Constitution to make it a crime to physically desecrate the American flag. She supported the Federal Marriage Amendment to define marriage as only permitted between a man and a woman, and also opposed letting same-sex couples adopt children. Granger was one of four Republicans in the House not to vote for or against repealing Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell, though she previously voted against other repeal proposals. In 2017, she said she had &quot;no comment&quot; in response to Trump&#x27;s decision to ban transgender troops from the military. She did not vote for or against legislation opposing the ban of transgender troops.

In June 2013, Granger was among the members of Congress to vote for an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 to restrict the Pentagon from entering into new contracts with Russia&#x27;s state arms broker, Rosoboronexport. 
During her tenure, Granger supported more than $50 million in earmarks to infrastructure projects in Fort Worth that benefited the Trinity River Vision Authority, an organization led by her son.
Granger voted for a resolution supporting Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

===Presidential candidate endorsements===
On September 25, 2007, Granger endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the Republican presidential primary. She became national co-chair of the campaign organization Women for Mitt, filling a vacancy left by the death of Jennifer Dunn.

In 2015, Granger opposed Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential candidacy, saying, &quot;He definitely should not be considered to speak for our nation as our president&quot;. In 2020, however, she endorsed Trump and was endorsed by Trump.

<text>Samuel Bruce Graves Jr. (born November 7, 1963) is an American aviator and politician best known for serving in the U.S. House of Representatives for , with him being the dean of Missouri&#x27;s congressional delegation and having held office since 2001. The aforementioned district stretches across most of the northern third of the state, with it including territory from the Kansas border to the Illinois border. The bulk of its population lives in the northern part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

Graves is a member of the Republican Party. He has notably served as the Chair in charge of the influential Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the U.S. House for multiple years, with him being able to exceed the system of American term limits normally enforced by the Republican leadership.

==Early life, education, and career==
Graves is a lifelong resident of Tarkio, a small city in Missouri&#x27;s northwestern corner, not far from the Iowa and Nebraska borders. He is the son of Janice A. (née Hord) and Samuel Bruce Graves. He graduated from the University of Missouri College of Agriculture with a degree in agronomy. He is a member of the Alpha Gamma Sigma fraternity.

==Personal life==
Graves is a general aviation pilot. He owns a Piper PA-11 Cub Special, is restoring a Beech AT-10, and co-owns a North American T-6 Texan and a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Gould Peterson Municipal Airport is named after his uncle, an aviator, and is on his family&#x27;s farm. Graves is a Baptist.

==Missouri legislature==
Graves was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1992. After one term, he was elected to the Missouri Senate in 1994 and reelected in 1998.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Chair)
**As Chair of the Committee, Rep. Graves is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in any subcommittee meeting per the committee&#x27;s rules.

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Cement Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* United States–China Working Group

==Political positions==
===Financial bailouts===
After the September 2008 economic crisis, Graves voted against the proposed bailout of United States financial system, claiming it &quot;neither &#x27;punished the wrongdoers nor adequately protected the innocent taxpayers, investors and retirees&#x27; caught in the Wall Street banking crisis.&quot; In January 2014, Graves introduced the TRICARE Family Improvement Act. The bill would allow dependents of military members to stay on their parents&#x27; TRICARE health plan after turning age 26. The bill would change current law, which requires those dependents to change to a separate health plan after turning 26. The American Conservative Union gave him an 85% evaluation in 2017. As of 2019, Graves has a 4% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters.

===Boeing 737 MAX crashes===
Graves blamed on May 13, 2019, at the House Aviation subcommittee hearing, the 737 MAX crashes (Lion Air Flight 610) on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302) on poor training of the Indonesian and Ethiopian pilots. He stated also that &quot;pilots trained in the U.S. would have been successful&quot; in handling the emergencies on both jets. One month earlier the FAA had issued the Boeing 737 MAX groundings.

===Israel===
Graves voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

==Todd Graves controversy==
Graves is the brother of Todd Graves, former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. In October 2008, U.S. Senator Kit Bond apologized to Todd Graves after a U.S. Justice Department report cited Bond forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Graves. Following the report, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law (dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy).

==Ethics investigation==
In 2009, the House Ethics Committee began an inquiry into whether Graves used his position on the Small Business Committee to invite Brooks Hurst, a longtime friend and a business partner of his wife, to testify at a committee hearing on the federal regulation of biodiesel and ethanol production. Graves had failed to mention the financial link between his wife and Hurst at the hearing, which dealt with federal subsidies for renewable fuels. A review by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics found &quot;substantial reason to believe that an appearance of conflict of interest was created.&quot; Graves said in a statement, &quot;I look forward to a quick review of the facts and answering any questions that the committee may have. I believe that a speedy review will show that all the rules of the House concerning testimony in front of the Small Business Committee were followed.&quot; The Office of Congressional Ethics referred the case to the House Ethics committee, which ended its own investigation in October, and released a report finding no ethical violations, as it asserted there was no standard in place for appearances like Hurst&#x27;s.

==Political campaigns==
Before his congressional career, Graves served eight years in the Missouri General Assembly, winning election to the Missouri House of Representatives once, and to the Missouri Senate twice.


In 2000, Democratic U.S. Representative Pat Danner suddenly retired due to breast cancer. Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. He faced Danner&#x27;s son, Steve Danner, a former state senator, in the general election. Graves called Danner as a &quot;tax and spend liberal&quot; and won the race with 51% of the vote, largely by running up huge margins in the district&#x27;s rural areas. He was arguably helped by George W. Bush carrying the district in the 2000 presidential election, a theory known as the coattail effect.

===2006===


===2008===

In 2008, Graves&#x27; Democratic challenger was former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. She was the first reasonably well-financed Democrat to run in the district since Graves&#x27; initial run. Graves gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting &quot;San Francisco values.&quot; Despite Barnes&#x27; roots in the district (she grew up in St. Joseph and lived in the district&#x27;s share of Kansas City), Graves was reelected handily, with 59% of the vote to Barnes&#x27;s 37%.

<text>The 2018 Winter Olympics (), officially the XXIII Olympic Winter Games (; ) and also known as PyeongChang 2018 (), were an international winter multi-sport event held between 9 and 25 February 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with the opening rounds for certain events held on 8 February, a day before the opening ceremony.

Pyeongchang was selected as the host city for the 2018 Winter Games at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa on 6 July 2011. This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.

The 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: &quot;big air&quot; snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93 teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.

After a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot; (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women&#x27;s ice hockey.

South Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea&#x27;s Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men&#x27;s skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29. Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.

==Bidding and election==

Pyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6 July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting. Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.

This was South Korea&#x27;s third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games. Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.

After winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics. Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Summer Olympics) and Winter Olympics. 

==Development and preparation==

On 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission. On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues. The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village. In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.

The International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012. Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.

The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.
===Medals===
The design for the Games&#x27; medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics&#x27; emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile. Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.
===Torch relay===

The torch relay started on 24 October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9 February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1 November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75 million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.

The torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.

There were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.

===Venues===


Most of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.

====Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)====
The Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics. It was home to the Olympic Stadium, the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.
* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre – ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)
* Alpensia Biathlon Centre – biathlon
* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre – cross-country skiing, Nordic combined
* Alpensia Sliding Centre – luge, bobsleigh, skeleton
* Yongpyong Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)

Additionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:
* Phoenix Snow Park – freestyle skiing, snowboarding

Another stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:
* Jeongseon Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)

====Gangneung (coastal cluster)====
The Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.
* Gangneung Hockey Centre – ice hockey (men&#x27;s competition)
* Gangneung Curling Centre – curling
* Gangneung Oval – long track speed skating
* Gangneung Ice Arena – short track speed skating, figure skating

In addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.
* Kwandong Hockey Centre – ice hockey (women&#x27;s competition)

===Ticketing===
Ticket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from ₩20,000 South Korean won (approx. US$) to ₩900,000 (~US$) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from ₩220,000 (~US$) to ₩1.5 million (~US$). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men&#x27;s ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.

As of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold. However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.

==The Games==
===Opening ceremony===

The opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.

===Sports===
The 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports, making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.
&quot;Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.&quot;

=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===
A record total of 93 teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore. Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru – qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).

Under a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games. The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony. A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women&#x27;s ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018. The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.

On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC&#x27;s doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot; (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.



====Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee====

 Apart from the respective delegations, North Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women&#x27;s ice hockey team.&lt;br&gt;
 Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.
===Event scheduling===
The IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC&#x27;s major sources of revenue. As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.

Conversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.

===Calendar===

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.

==Broadcasting==

Broadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games&#x27; local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024. SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS. NHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies. ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics. This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC&#x27;s Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.

The 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.

On 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery&#x27;s pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery&#x27;s free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain, Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements. Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market; some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks. The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France Télévisions, which run through to the 2020 Games. In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.

Russian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes. Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.

In the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under its long-term contract with the IOC. Its coverage featured several notable changes in format; citing past criticism of its use of broadcast delay during past Olympic Games (especially for viewers in the Western United States; Pyeongchang has a 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time, and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), the prime time block was revamped with a focus on live coverage, and made available live nationwide and on streaming for the first time. in February 2017, long-time studio host Bob Costas also stepped down as host, being replaced by Mike Tirico.

The winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.

==Marketing==
The official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters and —the initial sounds of &quot;Pyeong&quot; and &quot;Chang&quot;—was unveiled on 3 May 2013. In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylised in CamelCase as &quot;PyeongChang&quot;, in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.

New international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new &quot;Mobility&quot; sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid. Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.

==Concerns and controversies==
===North–South Korean relations===

Due to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games. The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.

The next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation. In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an &quot;open question&quot; whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region. However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.

In his New Year&#x27;s address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country&#x27;s participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang. On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women&#x27;s ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.

These moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail. A rap video entitled &quot;The Regret for Pyeongchang&quot; (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the &quot;Pyongyang Olympics&quot;, went viral in the country. Japan&#x27;s foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and not to ease its pressure on the country.

The South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea. In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang. American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.

At the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that &quot;there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.&quot; Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.

===Russian doping===

Russia&#x27;s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation. The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.

By early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General &quot;insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent&quot; and that they would consider an appeal against the court&#x27;s decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.

The eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.

Russian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation. Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to &quot;orchestrate the doping scandal&quot;. 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag, and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting &quot;Russia!&quot; in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.

The IOC&#x27;s decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated. The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov&#x27;s lawyer.

<text>Clarendon is an urbanized, developed neighborhood in Arlington County, Virginia, located between the Rosslyn area and the Ballston area. It was named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, a leading statesman and historian of the English Civil War. The main thoroughfares are Wilson Boulevard (one-way westbound) and Clarendon Boulevard (one-way eastbound).

==Boundaries and geography==
Because of the local street network configuration, many of Clarendon&#x27;s 40-45 blocks resemble triangles rather than squares. The precise dimensions of Clarendon are not defined, and several different sets of boundaries are often used. These include:

* Arlington County&#x27;s Clarendon sector plan area (bounded roughly by Cleveland Street, 11th Street, Kirkwood Street, 13th Street, Highland Street and Wilson Boulevard).
* The boundaries of the civic associations comprising the Clarendon Alliance association including Ashton Heights, Clarendon-Courthouse, Lyon Park, and Lyon Village, and bounded by Lee Highway, Veitch Street, Wilson Boulevard, Arlington Boulevard, Glebe Road, Wilson Boulevard, and Kirkwood Street).
* The area unsuccessfully proposed to be incorporated as a city in the 1930s.
* The boundaries of the Clarendon-Courthouse Civic Association (Wilson Boulevard, N. Courthouse Road, Arlington Boulevard, and N. 10th Street).

The central geographic/cultural/economic features of Clarendon are the Clarendon Metro station (on the Orange and Silver lines of the Metrorail system at Wilson Boulevard and Highland Street), Market Common Clarendon and the Whole Foods Market at Clarendon Boulevard and Edgewood Street. As Clarendon&#x27;s profile both as a popular destination and marketing location have increased, its informal boundaries have expanded west toward Virginia Square and east toward Courthouse, two adjacent Metro station areas.

==History==
First platted in 1900 at the top of a hill on the Georgetown-Falls Church Road (now Wilson Boulevard), Clarendon evolved into Arlington County&#x27;s original &quot;downtown&quot; after the arrival of electric trolleys in 1896. During the early 20th century, two interurban trolley lines converged in Clarendon a short distance west of today&#x27;s Clarendon Metro station (see Northern Virginia trolleys).

One of these trolley lines traveled between Rosslyn and Clarendon along the present routes of Lynn Street, Fairfax Drive and Clarendon Boulevard to a station at the present intersection of Clarendon Boulevard and Washington Boulevard. Metrorail&#x27;s Orange Line now closely follows this line&#x27;s former route.

The other line traveled from downtown Washington, crossed the Potomac River over the Highway Bridge and traveled along Washington Boulevard to reach the Clarendon station. Trolleys from both lines traveled between Clarendon, Ballston and Falls Church along the present routes of Fairfax Drive, I-66 and the Orange Line. Some of these trolleys traveled as far as the towns of Vienna and Fairfax. Like many other interurbans around the country, these lines were to remain in service until the mid-1930s, when they succumbed to the automobile and Depression-era economics.

The village of Clarendon was named and dedicated March 31, 1900. In 1920, the same year in which Arlington County adopted its name, a movement to incorporate Clarendon as a town was defeated in the courts.
Over time, Clarendon became Northern Virginia&#x27;s retail center. Department stores including J.C. Penney and Sears opened stores in Clarendon, and other retailers extended west along Wilson Blvd and Fairfax Drive to Virginia Square, anchored by Kann&#x27;s Department Store, and, farther west, the Parkington Shopping Center anchored by the Hecht Company, which was later enlarged and renamed as the Ballston Common Mall.
Built in 1937, the Arlington Post Office is the first known federal building constructed in the county after the American Civil War that is not within a larger federally-owned property. Previously Arlington&#x27;s mail was handled in Washington, D.C. Lobby murals depicting scenes about Arlington history were painted by Auriel Bessemer in 1939. In 2000, it was named in honor of Joseph L. Fisher, former U.S. representative from Virginia&#x27;s 10th district. The building is a designated Arlington County landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
By early 1975, two Vietnamese grocery stores had been opened in Clarendon, and in ensuing years Clarendon came to be known as &quot;Little Saigon&quot;. Many Vietnamese refugees immigrated to Washington D.C., and Arlington, due to the proximity to the nation&#x27;s capital, and existing social, family, and business connections. This neighborhood was home to commercial uses of Vietnamese grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, cafes, and entertainment to serve the large Vietnamese population. Business was attractive to Vietnamese immigrants in this neighborhood due to the depressed rents during the time of construction of the WMATA Clarendon metro station. Vietnamese restaurants adjacent to Clarendon Metro like Queen Bee, and Cafe Dalat, closed in the end of 2005 and Little Viet Garden closed at the end of 2008. Nam Viet is the only restaurant that remains in 2021.

After the opening of the Clarendon Metro station in December 1979, luxury apartments, office buildings and upscale chain stores were constructed, although some of the original businesses still remain. The former Sears store&#x27;s parking lot and automotive department, briefly considered as a site for a Home Depot, was developed as a mixed residential/commercial project that now includes townhouses, luxury apartments, and national chain retail stores.

At least a half dozen restaurants closed in 2016.

==Clarendon today==
Clarendon is also host to several local and County-wide events each year, including Arlington&#x27;s Neighborhood Day parade (held the second Saturday in May), the Mardi Gras parade and Tax Blues Night. The largest annual event, &quot;Clarendon Day,&quot; is held on a Saturday in mid-October and features four live music stages, local restaurant and coffee house booths, clothing, jewelry, antiques and collectibles sales, children&#x27;s games and rides, an ice-cream eating contest and other local traditions. Additionally, each spring Clarendon is host to the Clarendon Cup, part of the Armed Forces Cycling Classic, one of the largest one-day professional and amateur bicycle races in the U.S.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a farmers market at Clarendon&#x27;s Central Park was held on Wednesday afternoons from spring through mid-December and featured organic produce, baked goods, plants and herbs, homemade soaps and other items for sale.

<doc id="961516" wikidata="Q178944" url="?curid=961516" title="Greg Selinger">
<text>Gregory Francis Selinger (born February 16, 1951) is a former Canadian politician who served as the 21st premier of Manitoba from 2009 until 2016, leading an NDP government. From 1999 to 2009 he was the Minister of Finance in the government of his immediate predecessor, Gary Doer. Selinger was the member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for St. Boniface from 1999 until his resignation in early 2018. His party was defeated by Brian Pallister and the Progressive Conservatives in the 2016 Manitoba general election.

== Early life and education ==
Selinger was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, the son of Margaret Eva (Crawford) and Nicodemus Selinger. He came to Manitoba from Saskatchewan as a child with his single mother, who ran a small clothing store in Winnipeg.

Selinger received a Bachelor of Social Work from the University of Manitoba, a Master of Public Administration from Queen&#x27;s University, and a PhD from the London School of Economics.

Before entering politics, he worked as an associate professor in the Faculty of Social Work at the University of Manitoba, and sat on the boards of the St. Boniface Hospital, the St. Boniface Museum, the Community Income Tax Service Boards, and as president of the Old St. Boniface Residents Association.

== Municipal politics ==
After joining an alliance of progressive municipal politicians called Winnipeg into the &#x27;90s in the late 1980s, Selinger was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1989 as a candidate of the alliance in St. Boniface, defeating incumbent Guy Savoie. During his time as a city councillor, Selinger was a member of the Executive Policy Committee and was the chair of the Committee on Finance and Administration.

In 1992, Selinger ran for Mayor of Winnipeg and came in second place, losing to Susan Thompson. Some have attributed his loss to his refusal to accept corporate and union donations, which he based on principle. The 1992 civic election had 17 nominated candidates running for Mayor which resulted in votes getting split amongst several candidates similarly aligned on the political spectrum.

== Post municipal career ==

Following his failed mayoral bid, Selinger stepped back from politics and returned to teaching at the University of Manitoba.

== Provincial politics ==

=== Minister of Finance ===
Selinger was easily elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1999, defeating his closest opponent, Liberal Jean-Paul Boily, by 5439 votes to 2994 in the Winnipeg riding of St. Boniface.

Selinger was appointed Minister of Finance, after the 1999 election, in Gary Doer&#x27;s first cabinet, and was also given responsibility for French Language Services, the administration of the Crown Corporations Review and Accountability Act and the administration of the Manitoba Hydro Act. In his ten years as Minister of Finance, Selinger balanced every budget. On January 17, 2001, he was also given responsibility for the Civil Service.

Following a cabinet shuffle on September 25, 2002, he was charged with the administration of the Liquor Control Act, while being relieved of his duties for the Manitoba Hydro Act.

In 2003, Selinger supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

Selinger was re-elected in the provincial election of 2003 with almost 75% of the vote in his riding. On November 4, 2003, he was relieved of responsibilities for the Liquor Control Act.

In January 2005, Selinger announced that his government would change its system of accounting for expenditures and revenues. This followed a request from Auditor General Jon Singleton, who criticized the government for listing crown corporation losses and other matters as off-budget spending. Selinger is considered a strong performer in the Doer Cabinet.

He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

On June 28, 2007, Selinger regained responsibility for the administration of the Liquor Control Act and was charged with the administration of The Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act.

=== Premier ===
On September 8, 2009, Selinger resigned from his cabinet position and announced his candidacy for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba. He was running against fellow cabinet ministers Steve Ashton and Andrew Swan until Swan dropped out of the race on September 28. The leadership convention took place on October 17, 2009. Rosann Wowchuk replaced Selinger as interim Minister of Finance. He defeated his leadership rival, Steve Ashton, taking 1,317 votes among delegates, to Ashton&#x27;s 685. Selinger was sworn in as Premier of Manitoba by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on October 19, 2009, the same day that Gary Doer was sworn in as Canadian Ambassador to the United States. Despite predictions of defeat, Selinger led the NDP to its fourth straight majority government in the October 2011 general election, surpassing Doer&#x27;s record and winning 37 seats.

In April 2013, the Selinger government reneged on an earlier promise to not increase sales taxes by implementing a 1% increase in the provincial sales tax rate from 7% to 8%, which resulted in a precipitous decline in popular support for the government and, ultimately, a caucus revolt against Selinger&#x27;s leadership culminating in the resignation of five cabinet ministers. Due, in part, to the unpopularity of the tax increase, the NDP fell far behind the Progressive Conservatives in public opinion polls and never recovered. In the fall of 2014 several cabinet ministers privately asked Selinger to resign in hopes that the party would recover under a new leader, but he declined. In September 2014, during a caucus retreat, several MLAs openly told Selinger he needed to resign but he refused.

A month later, at the end of October Minister of Finance Jennifer Howard (Fort Rouge), Minister of Municipal Government Stan Struthers (Dauphin), Minister for Jobs and the Economy Theresa Oswald (Seine River), Andrew Swan (Minto), Minister of Health Erin Selby (Southdale), and several senior party officials went public with their call for Selinger&#x27;s resignation. Selinger asked ministers, labeled the &quot;gang of five&quot; in the media, to either disavow their public statements or quit. The five resigned on Monday, November 3. The same day Selinger said in a statement he was saddened by their decisions but had made it clear they could either &quot;focus on the priorities of Manitoba families as part of our team, or resign.&quot; Selinger accepted the resignations of the five senior cabinet ministers and installed their replacements hours later. On November 9, Selinger asked the party executive to hold a leadership election during the party&#x27;s annual convention scheduled for March 6–8, 2015, stating his intention to be a candidate. The party executive subsequently agreed. Theresa Oswald, one of the five rebel ex-ministers, challenged Selinger for the leadership as did Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation Steve Ashton who had not protested against Selinger but who resigned from cabinet to enter leadership contest.

At the March 8, 2015 leadership election, Ashton was eliminated on the first ballot and Selinger prevailed on the second ballot with 50.93% of ballots cast, defeating Oswald by 33 votes.

Selinger&#x27;s popularity never recovered after his party raised the PST in 2013. By the time the writs were dropped for the 2016 provincial election, the NDP had been well behind the Tories in opinion polling for almost four years. The NDP was heavily defeated, falling to only 14 seats, its smallest seat count in three decades.

==After politics==
Selinger resigned as party leader following his government&#x27;s defeat and returned to the backbench. Selinger announced on February 20, 2018, that he was resigning his seat in the legislature effective March 7, 2018. He continues to reside in Winnipeg.

<doc id="961517" wikidata="Q160403" url="?curid=961517" title="Andi Herzog">
<text>Andreas &quot;Andi&quot; Herzog (born 10 September 1968) is an Austrian former footballer and manager who most recently was the assistant manager of South Korea. As a player, he played as an attacking midfielder, most notably for Werder Bremen. A full international between 1988 and 2003, he won 103 caps and scored 26 goals for the Austria national team. He represented his country at the 1990 and 1998 FIFA World Cups.

==Club career==
Born in Vienna, Austria, Herzog started his career at local giants Rapid Vienna, but was sent out on loan to city rivals First Vienna during 1987–88. That move proved to be successful and he was soon recalled to Rapid to start the 1988–89 season. He made his name at Rapid in the next years to secure a move to Bundesliga side Werder Bremen where he would spend eight years, divided in two periods by a season at Bayern Munich where he won the 1996 UEFA Cup, beating Girondins de Bordeaux in a two-legged final.

After returning to Rapid in 2002, he decided to end his career with Major League Soccer franchise Los Angeles Galaxy in 2004. Under head coach, Sigi Schmid, Herzog played well but following a mid-season coaching change, he saw his playing time decrease and at the end of the season, Herzog announced his retirement from football on 10 November 2004.

A stylish attacking midfielder, Herzog was well known for his ability to score stunning free-kicks. He captained the Rapid Wien side and was chosen in Rapid&#x27;s Team of the Century in 1999.

==International career==
Herzog made his debut for Austria in an April 1988 friendly match against Greece and was a participant at the 1990 and 1998 World Cups, scoring one goal in the latter tournament, a spot kick against Italy. Herzog surpassed striker Anton Polster&#x27;s appearances record for Austria in May 2002 when winning his 96th against Germany. His last international was an April 2003 friendly match against Scotland. He altogether earned 103 caps, scoring 26 goals, making him Austria&#x27;s most capped player until Marko Arnautović overtook with his 104th Austria cap on 26 September 2022.

==Managerial career==
On 23 January 2015, Herzog was named coach of USA&#x27;s under 23s.

On 1 August 2018, Herzog was announced as coach of Israel&#x27;s national team, a move which was divisive due to his last minute strike to deny them a play off place in their 2002 World Cup qualifier. Famous midfielder Eyal Berkovic said of the appointment, &quot;Whoever made this decision needs urgent psychiatric attention, I can&#x27;t think of any other explanation for the appointment. It&#x27;s a huge disgrace.&quot; On 24 June 2020, he left his position after almost two years in charge, while Israel&#x27;s Sports Director and Austrian colleague of his Willibald Ruttensteiner replaced him as Israel&#x27;s head coach.

==Personal life==
Andreas Herzog is married, has two sons and lives in Breitenfurt bei Wien.

His father is Anton &quot;Burli&quot; Herzog (born 1941), who played in the Austrian Bundesliga between 1961 and 1975 for clubs like Austria Wien, Wiener Sport-Club and Admira/Wacker Mödling. Herzog junior grew up with his family in Vienna-Meidling, where he attended Singrienergasse grammar school.

<text>The Wake Island Device is an award device of the United States military which is presented as a campaign clasp to both the Navy and Marine Corps Expeditionary Medals.

The Wake Island Device is authorized for any sailor or Marine who was awarded the Navy or Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal due to service during the defense of Wake Island during the opening days of U.S. involvement in the Second World War. To be awarded the Wake Island Device, a service member must have been awarded either the Navy Expeditionary Medal, or the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, and must have served on Wake Island between December 7 and December 22, 1941.

The Wake Island Device is worn as a campaign clasp, inscribed with the words “Wake Island”, centered on the upper portion of the Navy or Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal. When wearing the Expeditionary Medal as a ribbon, the Wake Island Device is annotated by a silver “W” device, centered on the decoration.

A total of only 449 Marine Corps and 68 Navy personnel were eligible for the Wake Island Device, making it one of the rarest of United States military awards. As a point of comparison, there were a total of 472 Medal of Honor recipients during World War II.

<doc id="961520" wikidata="Q7498893" url="?curid=961520" title="Shirlington, Virginia">
<text>Shirlington is an unincorporated urban area, officially called an &quot;urban village&quot;, in the southern part of Arlington County, Virginia, United States, adjacent to the Fairlington area. The word &quot;Shirlington&quot; is a combination of &quot;Shirley&quot; (from the Shirley Highway or Interstate 395) and &quot;Arlington&quot;.

Shirlington is billed as &quot;Arlington’s Arts and Entertainment District&quot; and is a largely mixed-use development based on New Urbanist principles. It is mostly middle-class residential, but like most of Arlington County has been experiencing an economic renaissance and is now home to many upscale dwellings and retail and service establishments that also serve the nearby Fairlington, Parkfairfax, Green Valley and Long Branch Creek areas.

==Geography==
Shirlington lies in the valley of Four Mile Run, a tributary of the Potomac River. The land rises toward Fairlington in the south and Green Valley in the north.

The area is bounded by I-395 on the east except for a small section of the Alexandria that lies to the west of the interstate. The only structure in that section, the Shirlington Gateway office building, has an Arlington address and is usually considered a part of Shirlington. To the north and west, starting in the east, Shirlington is bordered by South Glebe Road, 24th Street South, South Shirlington Road, South Four Mile Run Drive, and South Walter Reed Drive. On the west and south, starting in the west, Shirlington is bounded by South Arlington Mill Drive, the Arlington County Environmental Services facility, and the west side of Park Shirlington Apartments.

Most residential, commercial, and retail development lies south of Four Mile Run while the area to the northeast, which is sometimes considered part of neighboring Green Valley, is more light industrial.

==History==
Shirlington began when Joseph Cherner, automobile dealer and banker, established the Shirlington Corporation to build a shopping center for nearby Fairlington and Parkfairfax. He began with a site on which the first store opened in June 1944. In 1959, the Lansburgh&#x27;s department store opened a , $2.5 million store, its second suburban branch. However, by the 1970s, Shirlington was an aging traditional shopping center facing competition from shopping malls.

In the 1980s, Shirlington was partially renovated to create a &quot;traditional main street&quot; along South 28th Street (now Campbell Avenue) with two office buildings at one end and a big box store and a cinema at the other. However, Shirlington remained small.

By 2000, Arlington County authorities, who had previously concentrated on development of areas adjacent to Washington Metro rail lines, began giving more attention to areas not served by Metro, such as the Columbia Pike corridor and Shirlington. The property&#x27;s owner and the county spurred the creation of a Shirlington Phased Development Site Plan (PDSP) and the associated Shirlington Design Guidelines. A conceptual design for the area was established and almost of new mixed-use development was envisioned. Emphasis was placed on making the area pedestrian friendly with automobile parking located behind the commercial buildings. This plan was approved by the Arlington County Board in 2001.

The development, a public-private partnership between developer Federal Realty Investment Trust of Rockville, Maryland (the operator of several other regional town-center-like developments such as Bethesda Row, Pentagon Row, and Rockville Town Center) and the county, began in the mid-2000s. As the plan was implemented, South 28th Street was extended westward and a building to house both the Signature Theatre and the Shirlington Library was constructed. Several new residential and parking structures were added as well.

==Economy==
Shirlington is home to WETA-TV where nationally-broadcast programs such as &quot;PBS Newshour&quot; and &quot;Washington Week&quot; are filmed. WETA-FM radio and some USPTO satellite offices are also located in the town. The non-profit Analytic Services (ANSER) and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International are headquartered there. The design firm HNTB Corporation has major offices in Shirlington as well.

==Transportation==
Shirlington lies on Shirley Highway (I-395) for which the town is named and is accessible from Shirlington Circle (Exit 6 on I-395). The town is served by the Shirlington Bus Station, the only enclosed public bus station in Arlington and the principal transfer point for Metrobus and Arlington Transit (ART) bus service in South Arlington.

Shirlington is the site of the trailhead of the Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park rail trail that travels along the route of a railroad that closed in 1968, Shirlington Park, and Jennie Dean Park.

===Shirlington Circle===
Shirlington Circle or Shirlington Rotary () is a roundabout interchange connecting I-395 (Shirley Highway) with several surface roads in Arlington County and Alexandria. Although the circle is named after Shirlington, roughly half of it is located in Alexandria. The circle resembles roundabout interchanges common in the United Kingdom and Ireland but rare in the US.

The circle includes multiple access points including ramps (slip roads) to and from I-395 (Exit 6) both north and southbound as well as a reversible direction ramp that provides access to and from the reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes that run in the center of I-395. Four surface streets intersect with the circle; going counterclockwise (in the direction of traffic) from the north, they are:
* Shirlington Road, which forms the border between Arlington County and Alexandria to the north of I-395. (The road, however, enters Arlington County just to the north of the interchange.)
* Campbell Avenue (formerly 28th Street South) in Arlington County.
* Quaker Lane (State Route 402), which forms the border between Arlington County and Alexandria to the south of I-395.
* Gunston Road in Alexandria.

Traffic generally follows roundabout rules, i.e., traffic inside the circle has the right-of-way and traffic entering the circle must yield. However, there are also traffic lights and stop signs regulating traffic flow and the I-395 off-ramps enter the circle from the interior of the circle, requiring a left merge into the traffic circle.

The current circle and traffic arrangement have existed since a 1969-1972 reconstruction of Shirley Highway which widened the previous circle to allow for access to the then-proposed the Four Mile Run Expressway.

A high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) project proposed for I-395 in the 2000s would have directed additional traffic onto the circle and required the addition of a new entrance and exit to the circle and six new traffic lights, but the Arlington County portion of the project was cancelled in 2011.

==Services==
===Shopping===

The center of Shirlington is occupied by the extensive Village at Shirlington retail, service, and residential complex which includes a series of buildings along Campbell Avenue (formerly South 28th Street). It was originally opened in 1944, as Shirlington Shopping Center, one of the earliest suburban shopping centers in the United States, and today provides most of the town&#x27;s retail shopping. There are numerous restaurants, saloons, a Harris Teeter grocery store, a public library, a full service station that has been there since the 1940s, and a theater in the complex.

===Entertainment===

Shirlington is home to the Signature Theatre, a Tony-Award-winning regional theater company, Theatre on the Run, and the AMC Loews Shirlington 7 cinema. Public events and festivals include Wags and Whiskers (dog and cat festival) in August, Celtic Festival in September, Oktoberfest in October and Shir-la-la live music and wine tasting on summer Thursdays.

===Library===
Shirlington has been the site of a public library for over 60 years. The first library was called Fairlington Library after the nearby development of Fairlington which predated Shirlington and was opened in 1947 in the Shirlington Trust Building at 2780 South Randolph Street. The library expanded twice in the 1950s until moving to a location purpose-built for Shirlington Library at 2700 South Arlington Mill Drive in the early 1960s.

Plans for a new location for the library were approved in late 2000. In 2001, the Arlington Mill Drive location was razed and the Shirlington Library moved to a temporary location in the lower section of the Village at Shirlington shopping center fronting on Arlington Mill Drive (2786 South Arlington Mill Drive). This location housed the library until a flood in the restaurant above it caused the library to close in November 2006. The current Library, a facility at 2800 South Stafford Street (since changed to 4200 Campbell Ave) underneath the Signature Theater, which was under construction from August 2005 opened in March 2007. The Shirlington Library is a branch of Arlington Public Library.

<doc id="961521" wikidata="Q17125992" url="?curid=961521" title="Fascia (car)">
<text>Fascia () is a term used in the automotive world that refers to the decorative panels of a car&#x27;s dashboard or the dashboard assembly.

Regulations affecting bumper design in the late 1970s saw the increasing use of soft plastic materials on the front and rear of vehicles. &quot;Fascia&quot; was adopted then as the term to describe these soft areas, but is now increasingly used as a general term for a car&#x27;s set of front-end components: grille, headlamps, front bumper, and other details.

A bumper valance panel, a piece that is mounted on top of the bumper, or is right under it, is also considered a part of the vehicle&#x27;s fascia. Carmakers often design the body panels that form the nose of their vehicles to have a unified look across their model line (see the ‘shark’ grille by Mitsubishi, or ‘tiger-nose’ grille by Kia).

The word comes from the Italian word &quot;fascia&quot; (), meaning &quot;stripe&quot;.

<doc id="961522" wikidata="Q8613" url="?curid=961522" title="2016 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 2016 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the XXXI Olympiad () and officially branded as Rio 2016, were an international multi-sport event held from 5 to 21 August 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with preliminary events in some sports beginning on 3 August. Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.

11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team. With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.

These were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America, as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country&#x27;s winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.

The United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the U.S. team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Summer Olympiad immediately after being the host nation. China finished third. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 total medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan, and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).

==Bidding process==


The bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007. The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. 

Nawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.

Many safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.

The final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually be awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==Development and preparations==
On 26 June 2011, it was reported on Around The Rings that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons. Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.

===Venues and infrastructure===

Events took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.

For the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games. Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park. Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.

The largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 75,000-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals. The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos (formerly João Havelange during the Games), which hosted track and field events. The athletes&#x27; village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.

====Olympic Park====

The Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.

The nine venues within the Olympic Park were:

* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)
* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)
* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)
* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)
* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)
* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)
* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)
* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)
* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)

====Football====
As well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and the more distant Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.
===Urban renovations===

Rio&#x27;s historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as &quot;Porto Maravilha&quot;, covering in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center&#x27;s attractiveness, and enhance Rio&#x27;s competitive position in the global economy.

The urban renovation involved of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; of tunnels; of roads; of sidewalks; of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.

The Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.

===Medals===

The medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian National Mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games&#x27; emblem.

In May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.

===Torch relay===

The Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.

The torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District. The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.

===Volunteers===
Unpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site. Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.

===Ticketing===
The ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.

===Sustainability===
As an aspect of its bid, Rio&#x27;s organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a &quot;Green Games for a Blue Planet&quot;. As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio&#x27;s sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay, and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.

The focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames. The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials. The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and &quot;would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate&quot; if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.

The Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools. However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget. Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.

==The Games==
===Opening ceremony===
The opening ceremony took place at Maracanã Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington. The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming. The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.

The ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made &quot;significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport&quot;; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino. The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.

The Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, the men&#x27;s marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC&#x27;s Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race. The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.

Following the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.

===Sports===

The 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events. The number of events in each of 42 discipline is noted in parentheses.

====New sports====

In April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme. Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.

In August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.

The 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme. The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against, and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26. Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.

In May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics, but this decision was reversed in November.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===

All 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete. The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.

As host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.

The 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.

Kuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country&#x27;s Olympic committee. Kuwaiti athletes instead participated as &quot;Independent Olympic Athletes&quot;.


====Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee====

11,238 athletes from 207 NOCs

====Refugee athletes====
Due to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs. On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.

====Independent athletes====

Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.

In November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country. The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for &quot;exceptional eligibility&quot; to participate in the Games as &quot;neutral&quot; athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.

On 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA&#x27;s recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter &quot;does not foresee such &#x27;neutral athletes&#x27;&quot; and that it was each country&#x27;s National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing. As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.

====National houses====
During the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.
===Calendar===

===Records===

Twenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.

===Event scheduling===

A number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016), as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.

===Closing ceremony===
The closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium. As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games&#x27; organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.

The creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães. Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of &quot;&quot; by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.

=== Cost ===

The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.

Indirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics&#x27; cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.
==Medal table==
The top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below. Host nation Brazil finished in 13th place with a total of 19 medals (7 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze).
=== Podium sweeps ===
==Broadcasting==

Olympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games. Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster. NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats. In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers. Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.

In August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, touting that &quot;by working with Brazil&#x27;s leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.&quot;

===Olympic Golden Rings Awards===
In November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo&#x27;s show &quot;Esporte Espetacular&quot; finished third, and CCTV from China feature &quot;A Sequel of Love&quot; came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature &quot;The Most Beautiful Thing&quot;. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.

==Marketing==
===Mascots===

On 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by São Paulo-based animation company Birdo. The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds. According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots &quot;were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games&quot;.

Brand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil&#x27;s culture and people. The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes. At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee&#x27;s call.

===Emblem===
The official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies. The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.

The logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse&#x27;s painting &quot;Dance&quot;. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was &quot;an ancient reference&quot; and &quot;in the collective unconscious&quot;. Gelli cited &quot;Dance&quot; as an influence of the logo&#x27;s concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.
==Concerns and controversies==
The lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil&#x27;s political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics, and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.

=== Political and economic crisis ===

There is no legally legitimate evidence of impropriety in the choice of Rio to host the Olympic games, at least as far as the Brazilian Olympic Committee or the politicians involved in the process are concerned. However, the specialized media raised suspicions about it. In 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters, both anti- and pro-Rousseff. At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.

On 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries. On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes. Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games. In 2024, Nuzman&#x27;s and Cabral&#x27;s conviction in this legal case was overturned by the Court.

=== Zika virus ===

An outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues. Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.

In May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have &quot;an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil&quot;. The WHO dismissed the request, stating that &quot;cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus&quot;, and that there was &quot;no public health justification&quot; for postponing them.

Some athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic. On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.

=== Environmental problems ===

The Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay. However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues. Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio&#x27;s sewage was treated; this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated, at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.

=== Security ===

Rio&#x27;s crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing &quot;big issues&quot; in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.

The governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.

On 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist cell named Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil by arresting 12 people.

===Russian doping scandal===

In December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents. After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a &quot;state-directed failsafe system&quot; using a &quot;disappearing positive [test] methodology&quot; (DPM) from &quot;at least late 2011 to August 2015&quot;.

In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport&#x27;s international federation would make decisions on each athlete&#x27;s individual basis. A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping. In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter. Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.

<doc id="961529" wikidata="Q1750590" url="?curid=961529" title="Tararua District">
<text>The Tararua District is a district near the south-east corner of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island that is administered by the Tararua District Council. It has a population of and an area of 4,364.62 km². The Tararua District Council was created by the amalgamation of the Dannevirke Borough, Eketahuna County Council, Pahiatua Borough Council, Pahiatua County Council and Woodville District Council in the 1989 local government reforms.

The district&#x27;s northwest boundary runs along the top of the Ruahine Range; its south-east boundary is the Pacific Ocean. The catchment of the Manawatu River generally defines the north and south extremities. The catchment is also the reason the majority of the district is in the Manawatū-Whanganui Region, although traditionally many of the people of the district regard themselves as living in either Hawke&#x27;s Bay (in the north) or Wairarapa (in the south).

== Towns and regional government ==
The district&#x27;s chief town is Dannevirke, settled by immigrants from Denmark in the 19th century. It is also the centre for a Community Board. Other towns (from south to north along the main valleys) include Eketāhuna and Pahiatua, which have their own Community Boards, and Woodville, Ormondville, and Norsewood. Near the coast are Pongaroa, Herbertville, Ākitio, and Alfredton.

While the vast majority (98.42% by land area) of Tararua District is part of the Manawatū-Whanganui Region, a small triangle of rural land (1.58% by land area) north of the Owahanga River in the south-east of the district is part of Wellington Region. According to the 2006 Census, this area, known as Mara, has only 3 residents (down from 12 in 1996 and 2001).

=== Dannevirke County Council ===
Dannevirke County Council was formed in 1907 by splitting Waipawa County Council. It lasted until 1987, when it amalgamated with Dannevirke Borough Council to form Dannevirke District Council, which lasted 2 years until becoming part of Tararua District. Norsewood Town Board was added to DCC in 1936, Ormondville Town Board in 1944, Weber County in 1956 and Ākitio County in 1976. In its final form, DCC had five ridings, Ākitio, Weber, Mangapuaka, Norsewood and Ruahine. The County Office was at Barraud Street, Dannevirke. In 1911, it was a single storey, wooden building.

The results were 84.0% European (Pākehā); 26.9% Māori; 2.7% Pasifika; 3.1% Asian; 0.5% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.8% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.6%, Māori language by 5.1%, Samoan by 0.3% and other languages by 4.0%. No language could be spoken by 1.9% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.7%. The percentage of people born overseas was 10.1, compared with 28.8% nationally.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 7,002 (46.9%) people were employed full-time, 2,100 (14.1%) were part-time, and 420 (2.8%) were unemployed.

== &quot;Seventy Mile Bush&quot; ==
When Europeans settled the area, it was almost entirely forested and was called &quot;Seventy Mile Bush&quot;. Industrious clearance has made it a busy pastoral district, although the region close to the Pacific coast is still sparsely populated. The original name lives on in that of the local National Provincial Championship rugby union team, Wairarapa-Bush.

== Economy ==
Agriculture is the district&#x27;s main industry. Other industries include textiles, food processing, and retailing. Commercial forestry is expected to become more important to the district&#x27;s economy in the next few years.

<doc id="961536" wikidata="Q534222" url="?curid=961536" title="Kenny Hulshof">
<text>Kenny Charles Hulshof (; born May 22, 1958) is an American politician and lawyer who represented in the United States House of Representatives. He was the unsuccessful nominee of the Republican Party for Governor of Missouri in the 2008 election.

==Biography==
Hulshof was born in Sikeston, Missouri, and is of Dutch, German, and Irish descent. Hulshof attended the University of Missouri and earned his J.D. from the University of Mississippi School of Law. Prior to serving in Congress, Hulshof worked in the public defender&#x27;s office and as a special prosecutor for the Missouri attorney general&#x27;s office. As a special prosecutor, Hulshof was detailed to capital cases. In 1992, Hulshof sought to be nominated by the Boone County Republican Committee as a replacement for Prosecuting Attorney Joe Moseley, who had won election to a legislative seat and had to resign to take his new post. Hulshof was defeated by Kevin Crane. In 1994, the Ninth District Republican Committee selected Hulshof to replace University of Missouri political science professor Rick Hardy as GOP candidate for Congress.

Despite a late start in the race, Hulshof captured 45% of the vote and nearly beat nine-term incumbent Democrat Harold Volkmer. The district had historically had a character similar to Yellow Dog Democrat districts in the South, but Volkmer was thought to be vulnerable after Hardy nearly unseated Volkmer in 1992 even as Bill Clinton easily carried the state.
Hulshof immediately began preparing to challenge Volkmer again in 1996. Hulshof had to first win the Republican primary against Harry Eggleston. Hulshof won the primary by 168 out of 38,000 votes cast. During the general election, Volkmer attacked Hulshof as being a puppet of Newt Gingrich; Hulshof responded that Volkmer voted twenty times to raise taxes in twenty years. Hulshof won the election by a 49%–47% margin, becoming only the third Republican to win it since 1893. He would never face another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected five more times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote. Hulshof made known his desire to run for Governor of Missouri in 2004, but withdrew in favor of then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt, who won.

Hulshof&#x27;s voting record in the House was conservative. Among other issues, he voted against abortion and same-sex marriage, while supporting the death penalty and the Patriot Act.

Hulshof is Roman Catholic, and is active in the St. Thomas More Newman Center on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Missouri. In 2005, Hulshof joined the all-Congressional band the Second Amendments, to play for U.S. troops stationed overseas during the period between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Hulshof played the drums.

There had been rumors in Washington and back in Hulshof&#x27;s district in Missouri that he might leave Congress to become the University of Missouri System president. Hulshof confirmed the rumors after his candidacy became common knowledge. However, the university&#x27;s board of curators ended up voting to offer the position to another graduate, who declined the offer. The Board selected Gary D. Forsee for the President of the University of Missouri System in 2008.

When Governor Blunt announced he would not be seeking re-election in 2008, Hulshof announced on January 29 that he would run for governor. Hulshof defeated State Treasurer Sarah Steelman in the Missouri Republican Gubernatorial primary, held on August 5, 2008, winning with a margin of 49% to 45%, with Scott Long receiving 5% and Jen Seivers 1%. Hulshof was defeated by four term Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, the Democratic Nominee, in the general election held on November 4, 2008.

Hulshof now works as a lobbyist for Kit Bond Strategies, based in St. Louis, Missouri.

==Court cases==
A 2008 Associated Press investigation found five cases where Hulshof was accused of prosecutorial misconduct, primarily withholding exculpatory evidence. At least two cases in which Hulshof served as prosecuting attorney have been overturned on judicial review and one case in which the judge set aside the conviction.

In the first case Hulshof prosecuted Joshua Keezer for murder. He tried the case without physical evidence, DNA, fingerprints, a murder weapon, or any eyewitnesses. Kezer was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Kezer was set free after a Cole County Circuit judge overturned the conviction. Hulshof publicly stated that he remained convinced of Keezer&#x27;s guilt.

The second case, overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court in January, 2013, involved the 1990 murder of a Livingston County woman in her home near Chillicothe. Mark Woodworth of Chillicothe, then 16 years old, was convicted in the shooting death of 40-year-old Cathy Robertson as well as the wounding of her husband. Hulshof, at the time an assistant Missouri Attorney General, was brought in as a special prosecutor in the original trial.
On June 4, 2011, Hulshof was questioned regarding evidence in the Woodworth case. A special master determined that a series of letters written between the original trial judge and various prosecutors was not offered to Woodworth&#x27;s defense attorneys. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that there was a violation of the Brady v. Maryland evidence rules and overturned the conviction.
In spite of prosecutorial misconduct, the Missouri Bar did not publicly admonish or punish Hulshof for his conduct.

<doc id="961537" wikidata="Q515835" url="?curid=961537" title="Serfaus">
<text>Serfaus is a municipality in the district of Landeck in the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is well known as part of the ski-region &quot;Serfaus-Fiss-Ladis&quot;, which was formed when Serfaus teamed up with the two nearby municipalities of Fiss and Ladis in 1999. Serfaus is also known for its small hovertrain subway system, the U-Bahn Serfaus. With four stations and a length of 1280 m (the second-shortest underground train line in the world) it allows for a complete ban of cars within the town, while at the same time maintaining the village&#x27;s attractiveness to tourists, particularly skiers.

==Geography==
Serfaus is a small town located on a plateau 500m above the upper Inn valley in Tyrol, western Austria. Above the town a high ridge rises, linking Mount Furgler (3004 metres above sea level) with Mount Schönjoch (2491m). On the opposite side of the valley is a 20 km-long ridge named Glockturmkamm with Pfroslkopf peak (3148m).

== History ==

The oldest evidence of civilisation in the region of Serfaus dates from the Bronze Age. The remains of a 3200-year-old fireplace on the Komperdell, a nearby high alpine meadow, indicates that the area was used as a pasture or hunting ground. More archaeological research was undertaken at the &quot;Zienerbichl&quot; (a distinctive hill in the south-west of Serfaus), revealing traces of the period Late Antiquity and from the Middle Ages.

Pre-Roman field names and some traces of the Celts bear witness to the early settlers of this region. Ancient historians described the area as Raetia and its inhabitants as Raeti. However, with the conquest of the area by the Romans in about 15 BC the Roman and Raetic cultures began to mix, creating the Romansh people. The Romansh language, which is still spoken in some parts of the Swiss Canton Graubünden, has survived in many of the regional field names. In the 6th century the German-speaking Bavarii started to inhabit the plateau, gradually displacing Romansh from everyday communication.

The village itself was first officially mentioned in the 11th century. The towns of See and Kappl in the Paznaun valley were partly settled via Serfaus. Up to 1891 See was also part of the rectory of Serfaus, which explains why there is still a graveyard for citizens of See in the village of Serfaus. Other important cultural landmarks include the pilgrimage church of St. Georgen. Built in the Middle Ages it is one of the oldest churches in the region.

During the 19th century tourism started to flourish in Tyrol and after the Second World War tourism became the main source of income for the village.

In 1942 fourteen houses were destroyed by a fire, which left 16 families (a total of 89 people) homeless and caused about worth of damage. The village was rebuilt after the Second World War, also allowing the new buildings more space in contrast to the old layout of a clustered Romansh village.

To cope with the increased traffic due to growing tourism in the region, Serfaus banned private traffic in winter in the 1970s. For the transportation of guests (and especially skiers) a bus service was established. In order to provide an even quieter and more environmentally friendly means of transportation from the entrance of the town through to the cable-car station, the small underground train system, the Dorfbahn Serfaus went into operation in 1985. The use of the underground is free-of-charge and along its 1280m-long route it has four stops (Parkplatz, Kirche, Zentrum (formerly named Raika), Seilbahn) and can transport up to 1500 people per hour.

== Demographics ==
As of January 2020, 1,139 people live in Serfaus. 88.3% are citizens of Austria. More than 90% of the population is Roman Catholic (statistics from 2019). Small minority religions are Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Islam.

== Underground railway Serfaus ==
The U-Bahn Serfaus is an underground air cushion funicular people mover system, it is one of the smallest underground railways in the world.

== Tourism ==

As Serfaus is close to the Via Claudia Augusta and the Reschen Pass people are thought to have traveled through the area for hundreds of years. Moreover, the marian pilgrimage, which has been taking place since the Middle Ages, has caused some travel to and from the mountain village. The Theresian Cadasdre of 1776 lists Johannes Penz as having the &quot;right to operate a tavern&quot;. By 1812 the inhabitants of Serfaus were asked to pay an extra tax for the lodging of foreigners in their taverns or private rooms. This shows that tourism was already present at these times, even if still only in its most basic form.

Shortly after 1900 skiers started to discover the possibilities of the region and in 1912 plans were made to build a little ski hut on one of the high alpine meadows surrounding the village, the &quot;Kölnerhaus&quot; up at the &quot;Komperdell&quot;. However, during the First World War and the following 1920s tourism developed very slowly. Tourism between the two world wars reached its peak in 1931/32 with 30,000 registered guests. As a result, the three taverns could not provide enough accommodation anymore and farmers started to rent out private rooms to guests in the region. Thus Serfaus had 150 registered beds in 1930. In 1940 a cable-car for transporting goods to the &quot;Kölnerhaus&quot; was installed and was turned into an aerial tramway seating five people in 1951. This caused a new increase of tourism in Serfaus and through the constant renewal and expansion of the infrastructure and the connection to the lifts of Fiss-Ladis the ski area now covers 190 km of pistes through 70 lifts. Today the town is one of the most popular ski and holiday areas in Tyrol.

<doc id="961542" wikidata="Q2357448" url="?curid=961542" title="The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies">
<text>The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (sometimes &quot;!!?&quot; is appended to the title and shortened to The Incredibly Strange Creatures) is a 1964 American monster movie produced and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym &quot;Cash Flagg&quot;.

In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble onto a group of occultists and disfigured monsters. Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn&#x27;s Coney Island. The film was billed as the first &quot;monster musical,&quot; beating out &quot;The Horror of Party Beach&quot; by a mere month in release date.

Upon release, the film received negative reviews and is regarded by some critics as being one of the worst movies ever made. The film was lampooned in a 1997 episode of the cult sci-fi TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

== Plot ==
Free-spirited Jerry, his girlfriend Angela, and his buddy Harold head out for a day at a seaside carnival. In one venue, a dance number is performed by Marge, a superstitious alcoholic who drinks before and between shows, and her partner, Bill Ward, for a small audience. Backstage, Marge sees a black cat and, disturbed by its appearance, visits powerful carnival fortune-teller Estrella to find out what it means. In her fortune-telling booth, Estrella predicts death for Marge, who runs out, terrified, past Jerry, Angela, and Harold. The three decide to have their fortunes told. Estrella predicts &quot;a death near water&quot; for someone close to Angela.

After leaving Estrella&#x27;s booth, Jerry sees Estrella&#x27;s sister Carmelita, a stripper who hypnotizes him with her icy stare, and he is compelled to see her act. Angela leaves the carnival, disgusted, with Harold in tow. After the show, Jerry is tricked backstage into Estrella&#x27;s room with a note and she turns Jerry into a zombie by hypnotizing him with a spiraling wheel. Jerry then goes on a violent overnight rampage of which he will have no memory, killing Marge and fatally wounding Bill. The next day, Jerry attempts to strangle his girlfriend Angela as well. It develops that Estrella, with her henchman Ortega, has been turning carnival patrons into zombies by throwing acid into their faces, disfiguring them, and then imprisoning them in her fortune-telling booth.

Interspersed through the film are several song-and-dance production numbers in the carnival&#x27;s nightclub, with songs like &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot; and &quot;Shook Out of Shape.&quot;

Jerry, suspicious of his fragmented memory, confronts Estrella at the carnival. He is hypnotized a second time, and that night stabs a carnival showgirl and barker in the showgirl&#x27;s home. Returning to Estrella, she throws acid in Jerry&#x27;s face and attempts to imprison him, only to have her other zombies escape. The zombies immediately kill Estrella, Carmelita, Ortega, and several performers before being shot by police. Jerry, himself partially disfigured but not completely a zombie, escapes the carnival and is pursued to the shoreline, where the police shoot him dead in front of Angela and Harold. Estrella&#x27;s prediction of &quot;a death near water&quot; for someone close to Angela is fulfilled.

==Production and release==

=== Title ===
At the time of release, &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; was the second-longest titled film in the horror genre (Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent&quot; being the first. It was later parodied by &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&quot;).

This was not, however, the originally intended title of the film. As Steckler relates, the film was supposed to be titled &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures, or Why I Stopped Living and Became a Mixed-up Zombie,&quot; but was changed in response to Columbia Pictures&#x27; threat of a lawsuit over the name&#x27;s similarity to &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;, which was under production at the same time. Steckler later joked that he could have made 5 movies for what they probably spent on lawyers.

The film was originally released by Fairway-International Pictures, Arch Hall Sr.&#x27;s studio, who put it on the lower half of a double bill with one of his own pictures. Dissatisfied, Steckler bought the distribution rights back from Hall and purchased the rights to a Coleman Francis picture that was also featured on &quot;MST3K&quot;, &quot;The Beast of Yucca Flats.&quot; The film was ultimately released in the U.S. as a roadshow theatrical picture. In order to get repeat customers, Steckler retitled the film numerous times, with titles such as &quot;The Incredibly Mixed-Up Zombie&quot;, &quot;Diabolical Dr. Voodoo&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary&quot;.

=== Studio ===
Much of the movie was filmed in an old, long-empty Masonic temple in Glendale, California, owned by actor Rock Hudson. The nine-story building was a series of makeshift &quot;sound stages&quot; stacked floor after floor, some big enough to create the midway scenes indoors. This was the studio that was used that year for the production of &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot;, another low-quality monster movie also spoofed by &quot;MST3K&quot;. The Film Center Studios were popular with non-union producers because they could turn off the elevator to lock out IATSE union agents, who found it difficult to climb the stairs to the seventh-floor main stage.

===Budget===
During the filming of the movie, Steckler was in need of funds, both for the movie and for living costs. Atlas King, who had grown close to Steckler, gave him three hundred dollars out of his own pocket. The station wagon Jerry drives in this movie was the Steckler family car.

=== Notable cast and crew ===
Brett O&#x27;Hara was usually a stand-in for Susan Hayward. Madame Estrella was the only &quot;real&quot; role of her career.

Sharon Walsh was not originally meant to play Angela. Bonita Jade was given the role, but when it was time for her scene, she said she had to leave to meet her drummer boyfriend because he was performing and she always went to his gigs. Steckler was furious, and he pulled Walsh out of the chorus line, telling her she was now the female lead. Walsh had already appeared in several dance numbers during the movie and they had to &quot;disguise&quot; her with a new, &quot;beehive&quot; hairstyle.

The cinematography/camera operation was done by three men who would go on to become major figures in cinematography: Joseph V. Mascelli, author of &quot;The Five Cs of Cinematography&quot;; Vilmos Zsigmond (listed as William Zsigmond), who would later win an Academy Award for his work on &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;; and László Kovács (listed as Leslie Kovacs).

In some screenings, employees in monster masks, sometimes including Steckler himself, would run into the theater to scare the audience (the gimmick was billed as &quot;Hallucinogenic Hypnovision&quot; on the film&#x27;s posters).

== Reception and legacy==

Ever since its release, many critics have considered the film to be one of the worst ever made. The 2004 DVD &quot;The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made&quot; ranked it at No. 1.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Incredibly-Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living, And Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; is a low-budget shocker about carny murders. Okay musical production numbers and good direction overcome weak script and performances. Excellent photography adds visual interest.&quot;

However, the film has since become a cult classic and has been celebrated by fans of B movies, camp or kitsch films. Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars (his most widely used rating), complimenting the film&#x27;s use of colors and haunting atmosphere while criticizing the film&#x27;s acting, dialogue, and simplistic plot. Writing for Turner Classic Movies, critic Richard Harland Smith described the film as &quot;junk drawer cinema at its most impossible to close&quot; and &quot;loose-knit to the point of unraveling,&quot; but opined that &quot;it&#x27;s precisely this threadbare, developed-in-the-bathroom-sink aesthetic that explains the film&#x27;s confounding charm&quot; and that the film is &quot;considerably better than its reputation.&quot;

Rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about &quot;Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot;, in which he tries to explain and justify the movie&#x27;s value: 

It currently has a 20% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The DVD release of &quot;Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot; features commentary tracks by both Steckler and &quot;drive-in movie critic&quot; Joe Bob Briggs.

<doc id="961543" wikidata="Q1154511" url="?curid=961543" title="Council of Five Elders">
<text>In the history of Japan, the was a group of five powerful formed in 1598 by the Toyotomi Hideyoshi, shortly before his death the same year. While Hideyoshi was on his deathbed, his son, Toyotomi Hideyori, was still only five years old and as such Hideyoshi needed to create the council in order to ensure his heir would be able to succeed him after coming of age. They also acted as advisers for the , which had also been established by Hideyoshi to govern Kyoto and the surrounding areas.

== Creation of the Council ==
=== Leading up to the creation of the council ===
Hideyoshi had been slowly changing in demeanor as the invasions of Korea (in attempt to conquer both Korea and China) were failing. Hideyoshi himself had not joined the Korean Campaigns and assigned vassals in his command to head the campaign. He sent his final force of 140,000 to Korea in 1597, but the efforts were fruitless.

Hideyoshi&#x27;s execution of family members were also one of the reasons for questioning his sanity during this period. Before the birth of his son Hideyori, he had adopted his nephew, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, to be his heir in 1591 because Hidetsugu had helped Hideyoshi in his campaigns. Once Hideyori was born, he ordered Toyotomi Hidetsugu to commit ritual suicide on Mount Kōya, this causing Hideyoshi&#x27;s only possible heir to be his infant son Hideyori. The people closest to Hidetsugu, such as his family and retainers, were also put to death.

In 1595 Toyotomi Hideyoshi officially announced five laws and ordinances (Japanese: 御定五ヶ条 &quot;Onkite&quot; &quot;Gokajō&quot;) to maintain the stability of the regime and overcome the upheaval of politics after the removal of Hidetsugu.

On the &quot;fifteenth day of the seventh month&quot;, the senior &quot;daimyō&quot; under order gathered at Maeda Toshiie&#x27;s residence in Fushimi to renew their pledge of loyalty to Hideyori. On the &quot;fifth day of the eighth month&quot;, 13 days before his death (which took place on the 18th day of the 8th month of the third year of the Keichō era, Hideyoshi issued an order to the Elders stating that children of various generals shall go to Osaka Castle, once Hideyori has moved there.

Hideyoshi&#x27;s health started to degenerate after falling ill in the later half of 1598. Realizing he would need to find a way to ensure the installation of his son as heir following his death, he called out to certain trusted &quot;daimyō&quot; to grant his final request:

There are also accounts that when Hideyoshi called upon Ieyasu to become a regent, he asked him to decide if Hideyori is fit to rule when he reaches a ripe age and that Ieyasu rejected this request.

=== Choosing the council ===
The members of the council were all &quot;daimyō&quot; chosen due to their relation to the &quot;taikō&quot; and the amount of power they held in the country. Hideyoshi chose powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; to prevent authority being concentrated on a single &quot;daimyō&quot;. Maeda Toshiie and Ukita Hideie were chosen due to their closeness with Hideyoshi as Maeda Toshiie was Hideyoshi&#x27;s friend who had also served Oda Nobunaga. Maeda Toshiie was also chosen due to the respect he had from the Toyotomi family and Hideyoshi wanted to prevent Ieyasu from holding absolute power among the Five Elders. Ukita Hideie had been adopted under the name of &quot;Yuushi&quot; (Japanese:猶子) by Hideyoshi and his closeness with Hideyoshi also led him to be appointed as a member of the five elders. These &quot;daimyō&quot; had also all served under Hideyoshi for many years in his house administration.

Even before the creation of the council, Hideyoshi treated the five differently from other &quot;daimyō&quot;. One reason for this was the absence of a &quot;Toritsugi&quot; (Japanese: 取次). &quot;Toritsugi&quot; acted as mediators that went between the &quot;daimyō&quot; to help with the communication of orders. This allowed each &quot;daimyō&quot; to talk directly to Hideyoshi, and it also meant that Hideyoshi would not intervene in the business of the &quot;daimyō&quot; in ruling their own domain. For the Shimazu clan, Ishida Mitsunari was appointed as the &quot;toritsugi,&quot; which also meant that Mitsunari and/or Toyotomi had power to intervene in Shimazu&#x27;s domain. Hideyoshi expected the &quot;daimyō&quot; under his control to govern their lands and serve military services.

The larger the domains of the &quot;daimyō&quot; were, the more experienced those &quot;daimyō&quot; were at governing their lands. As such, Hideyoshi treated them differently than smaller &quot;daimyō&quot;, who needed Hideyoshi to intervene in local governance. In the 1588 Sword Hunt Policy (Japanese:刀狩 &quot;katanagari&quot;), it is assumed that Hideyoshi only ordered smaller class &quot;daimyō&quot; to enforce the policy. The larger &quot;daimyō&quot; followed even without orders, but Hideyoshi did not strictly expect them to enforce the policy. Initially the sword hunt was intended to confiscate weapons to restrict formation of military forces, ensuring that no one could take the country by force. Hideyoshi could rely on the large &quot;daimyō&quot;, who were experienced and equipped with large military forces, to suppress local powers if they rebelled. In this way, Hideyoshi&#x27;s treatment of the larger &quot;daimyō&quot;, Tokugawa, Maeda, Mori, and Uesugi, was exceptional.

=== Subgroups related to the council ===
Hideyoshi also appointed the Five Commissioners (Japanese: &quot;Go-Bugyō&quot;) who were tasked to oversee the &quot;basic business of the realm&quot;; while the Elders were tasked to make sure that Hideyori would succeed Hideyoshi. During this time the Five Commissioners were Asano Nagamasa, Mashita Nagamori, Ishida Mitsunari, Natsuka Masaie and Maeda Gen&#x27;i.

The Elders had assistants known as &quot;chūro&quot; (Japanese: 中老) who acted as mediators, the Five Elders and the Five Commissioners. The &quot;chūro&quot; at this time were Nakamura Kazu-uji of Suruga, Ikoma Chikamasa of Takamatsu, and Horio Yoshiharu of Tottori.

=== Oath of Allegiance ===
On the &quot;fifth day of the eighth month&quot;, 1598, the Commissioners and the Regents signed the following articles:

Article 1. That they should serve Hideyori with the same single-minded loyalty they had shown to Hideyoshi.

Article 2. The rules of Hideyoshi&#x27;s house would not be altered. When the Five Commissioners were unable to determine a course of action for administration of public affairs, they were to consult their master (Hideyori) through Ieyasu and Toshiie; or if taking action, they were to consult the Emperor.

Article 3. There were to be no factions among them. Personal considerations and partiality of every kind were to be excluded from their counsel.

Article 4. The Five Commissioners, or overseers, were to strive to work together in the administration of public affairs, suppressing all petty jealousies and differences.

Article 5. In settling matters the opinion of the majority was usually to be followed. But at the same time if the opinion of the minority showed no signs of being dictated by any personal interests, it should be duly considered. If only a few of the overseers were present when a question was settled, the absentees had no right to object unless it was quite evident that the private interests of the Commissioners present at the meeting prejudiced their minds in a wrong direction. In that case another meeting might be called.

Article 6. It goes without saying that all accounts had to be kept in a manner that was above suspicion. There were to be no irregularities and no pressing of personal interests.

Article 7. Whatever Hideyoshi desired to be kept secret, whether it were connected with his private life or with the Government, would not be allowed to leak.

Article 8. If any of the Commissioners or their followers found that unconsciously they had acted contrary to the orders given to them, they would immediately report this to their superior officers, who would then deal leniently with them.

Hideyoshi used a talisman (Japanese: 護符 &quot;Gofu&quot;) called &quot;Kumano-goufu&quot; (Japanese: 熊野牛王府) from Kumano Shrine when making an oath with &quot;daimyō&quot;, and it is said that when Hideyoshi&#x27;s death was near, he made the five elders to write vows to remain faithful to him after his death. This vow is known in Japanese as &quot;Kishomon&quot; (Japanese: 起證文)&quot;.&quot;

=== Origin of the name &quot;Go-Tairō&quot; ===
After the death of Hideyoshi, the five commissioners, including Ishida Mitsunari referred to Ieyasu and the other elders as &quot;Go-bugyoshu&quot; (Japanese:御奉行衆) and referred to the five commissioners as &quot;Toshiyoridomo&quot; (Japanese:年寄共) on &quot;Kishomon.&quot; He purposely used the term &quot;Go-bugyoshu&quot; to remind the elders that their job was to support Hideyori with their lives. On the other hand, Shimazu Yoshihisa referred to the five elders as &quot;Go-rojushu&quot; (Japanese: 御老中衆) and Kato Kiyomasa called them the &quot;Nihon-Gotoshiyorishu&quot; (Japanese: 日本御年寄衆). They both called the five commissioners &quot;Go-bugyoshu&quot; (Japanese: 御奉行衆). People were calling them differently depending on their relationship with the five elders and the five commissioners, but there is no document that gives evidence that the Five Elders were actually called as &quot;Go-Tairo&quot;. The word &quot;Tairo&quot; (Japanese: 大老) was the name of the highest position that was temporarily a higher position than &quot;Roju&quot; (Japanese: 老中), under the Tokugawa Shogunate. It is believed that the Five Elders were referred to as the &quot;Go-Tairo&quot; after the title of &quot;Tairo&quot; was created in the Edo Period.

== The Five Elders ==

=== Tokugawa Ieyasu ===
Tokugawa Ieyasu (Japanese: 徳川 家康) controlled eight provinces in the Kantō region surrounding Edo (present-day Tokyo), and among the Five Elders, held the most power measured in &quot;koku.&quot; He was also entrusted by Hideyoshi with the order of &quot;Soufujirei&quot; (Japanese: 惣無事令) to take control of Kanto and Okuryogoku (Mutsu Province and Dewa Province) in 1587. After the Hidetsugu Incident (Japanese:秀次事件 &quot;Hidetsugu Jiken&quot;) in 1597, Ieyasu was appointed to act as Regent temporarily until Hideyori reached 15 years of age and requested him to reside in Fushimi. Before the establishment of the council, Hideyoshi awarded the province of the Hojo to Ieyasu after the successful Odawara campaigns in the Kanto region. This action demonstrated the power that Hideyoshi had over Ieyasu. 

After the collapse of the Council, Ieyasu became the founder and first &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate, which effectively ruled Japan from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

=== Ukita Hideie ===
Ukita Hideie (Japanese: 宇喜多 秀家) was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Bizen and Mimasaka Provinces (modern Okayama Prefecture). He was a military commander and feudal lord during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Also referred to as &quot;Hachirō&quot; (八郎). At the age of 26, Ukita was elected to be one of the five elders when he returned from the Imjin war, also known as the Japanese invasions of Korea. (Japanese: 慶弔の役 &quot;keicho no eki&quot;). While he was an elder, he was also serving as a &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Warring States period (Japanese: 戦国時代 &quot;Sengoku Jidai&quot;). He was banished to Hachijō Island after the Battle of Sekigahara.

=== Maeda Toshiie ===
Maeda Toshiie (Japanese: 前田 利家) was one of the leading generals of Oda Nobunaga following the Sengoku period of the 16th century extending to the Azuchi–Momoyama period. Referred to as &quot;Chikuzen&quot; in the letters by Hideyoshi. He became one of the Five Elders at the age of 53. Hideyoshi entrusted the province of Kaga and Etchū to Toshiie after taking the province from the &quot;daimyō&quot; Sassa Narimasa. While he was an elder, he also had a position as senior second rank (Japanese: 権大納言 &quot;Gon-Dainagon)&quot; and had the authority to pass his opinions on to the national government. After the death of Maeda Toshiie, his son, Maeda Toshinaga was to succeed him as a member of the Five Elders.

=== Uesugi Kagekatsu ===
Uesugi Kagekatsu (Japanese: 上杉 景勝) was a Japanese samurai and &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Sengoku and Edo periods. He was the primary lord of the feudal domain of Yonesawa. He was elected to be a part of the Five Elders at the age of 43. Since the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he had cooperated with Hideyoshi by aiding him during battles, and he was one of the earliest &quot;daimyō&quot; to render homage to Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi had made alliances with Kagekatsu because he had the potential power to attack Ieyasu from the Echigo province in the north.

=== Mōri Terumoto ===
Mōri Terumoto (Japanese: 毛利 輝元) was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the Edo period. He was a descendant of the feudal lord of the Choshu domain. He became one of the Five Elders at the age of 46.
Terumoto fought against Hideyoshi before the latter&#x27;s rise to power, but lacked enough supporters. Realizing that Hideyoshi would be the next leader of the country, he began to build trust by sending gifts to celebrate Hideyoshi&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Shizugatake and helping him in the Kyushu Campaign in 1587.

He was allied with Ishida Mitsunari at the Battle of Sekigahara and acted as the head general of the Western Army.

=== Kobayakawa Takakage ===
Kobayakawa Takakage (Japanese: 小早川 隆景) was a samurai and &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) during the Sengoku period and Azuchi–Momoyama period. At first he fought against Hideyoshi as he was the one holding the power in the Mōri family, but after the Battle of Shizugatake, he decided to submit to Hideyoshi. Under Hideyoshi&#x27;s rule, he was assigned to be in charge of Chikuzen province, which is modern day Fukuoka. Takakage handed over rule of the family to Hidetoshi (Hideaki) and retired, moved to Mihara. Takakage refurbished Najima Castle (Japanese: 名島城 &quot;Najima Jō&quot;) and made it his own residence. Kobayakawa died on June 12, 1597, at the age of 65. Due to the death of Kobayakawa in 1597, he is often excluded from the list of the Five Elders or referred as the 6th Elder. After his death his nephew, Mōri Terumoto, took his place on the council of Five Elders.

== Roles of the Council Members ==
=== Raising Hideyoshi&#x27;s heir ===
Hideyoshi had given ownership of Osaka castle to his son Hideyori in 1594, Hideyori was just one year old at the time. Maeda Toshiie was given the order to raise Hideyori in Osaka Castle until he came of age to take his place as Hideyoshi&#x27;s successor. Tokugawa Ieyasu was also charged with the role of guardian of Hideyori, as well as to see to Hideyori being appointed to the role of Regent. Ukita Hideie was to be counted on as a loyal member of Hideyori&#x27;s service.

=== Attending to political business ===
Ieyasu was appointed by Hideyoshi to act as Regent (Japanese: 摂政 &quot;Sesshō&quot;) until Hideyori reached maturity and could take his place as leader. Uesugi Kagekatsu and Mōri Terumoto were to be informed and consulted on all political matters as advisers. The Elders were to deal with the administering of punishment to any person who broke the law. All monetary transactions were to be supervised by the Elders, and the elders were tasked with to setting up an account for Hideyori when he came of age.

=== Withdrawal from Korea ===
After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death the Council of Five Elders issued an order for the Japanese army at the Korean Peninsula to return. The Council feared disorder among Hideyoshi&#x27;s troops in Korea if they were to be told of his death and so, his death was not told to the armies in order to preserve their morale. After the withdrawal of Japanese armies which followed a military stalemate, the final peace negotiations to mark the end of war continued for several years.

=== Other roles ===
Ieyasu and Toshiie were to clear up any difficulties in administration encountered by the Five Commissioners, further acting as advisers or mediators in administration matters. The sons of both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Maeda Toshiie (Tokugawa Hidetada and Maeda Toshinaga respectively) were to assist their fathers with work related to the Five Elders, with plan of the latter being appointed as an Elder in the future.

Changes to Oath of Allegiance document

Tokugawa Ieyasu made some changes to Article 2 of the Oath of Allegiance document that no rules shall be amended, and that decisions were to be made by the majority in all cases.

On the Article 6 of the Allegiance Document Ieyasu added the following statements: &quot;No questions concerning landed estate will be dealt with during the minority of Hideyori. No petitions made to him will be sent in; neither will Ieyasu himself ask for any changes to be made in the matter of land-ownership nor will he accept any gifts of land from Hideyori during his minority.&quot;

Maeda Toshiie added the following words &quot;When Hideyori shall have reached his majority, certain representations shall be made to him by the Five Commissioners and by Ieyasu in reference to the bestowal of land on those whose services deserve reward and in reference to the confiscation of land in the case of those who have acted unworthily.&quot;

=== Power balance between the council ===
The power balance between the council depended on the position each members held and the amount of &quot;koku&quot; they held. Ieyasu was entitled with the position of inner minister (Japanese: 内大臣 &quot;Naidaijin&quot;) in the fifth month of 1596. Maeda was acting as counselor of the first rank (Japanese: 大納言 &quot;Dainagon&quot;)and the other three were counselors of the second rank (Japanese: 中納言 &quot;Chunagon&quot;). Ieyasu was in the highest position among the members and his ownership of a great amount of &quot;koku&quot; allowed him to secure his position among other Elders. In general, 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; was believed to be equivalent to having 250 soldiers in one&#x27;s control, so the amount of &quot;Koku&quot; (Japanese: 石) didn&#x27;t only represent the income each &quot;daimyō&quot; has, but show how much military power they held. Hideyoshi himself owned approximately 2,000,000 koku, not including the lands held by his most trusted vassals. Ieyasu was also known as a powerful military commander, and Hideyoshi&#x27;s fear of Ieyasu and riots in favor of Ieyasu also led him to appoint Ieyasu as a member of the Council of Five Elders.

The amount of potential income, measured in &quot;koku&quot;, that each council member held (one &quot;koku&quot; = 4.96 bushels or 278.3 liters of rice):
* Tokugawa Ieyasu: 2,400,000 &quot;koku&quot;
* Maeda Toshiie: 830,000 &quot;koku&quot;
* Ukita Hideie: 570,000 &quot;koku&quot;
* Uesugi Kagekatsu: 1,200,000 &quot;koku&quot;
* Mori Terumoto: 1,120,000 &quot;koku&quot;

== Tokugawa hegemony ==
Ieyasu engaged his sons and daughters into political marriages which became a cause of disagreement between the Elders and Commissioners. Ieyasu married his son Tadateru to Date Masamune&#x27;s daughter Irohahime. The cause for disagreement in these matters were due to statements in ”The wall writings of Osaka Castle&quot; (Japanese: 大阪城中壁書 &quot;Osakajochu-kabegaki&quot;) of 1595 that marriages would need the consultation of both Elders and Commissioners. The Commissioners called for Ieyasu&#x27;s resignation on the grounds of these marriages. One of the retainers, Ishida Mitsunari, complained about this matter to Maeda Toshiie. Ieyasu insisted that it was not a big matter; and this issue was resolved by Horio Yoshiharu, who happened to be a friend of Ieyasu.

=== Rise of conflict ===
After the death of Hideyoshi, friction generated between the council members. Two factions formed, the &quot;Bunchiha&quot; (Japanese: 文治派; those who wished for a state governed by a specialized civil service) and the &quot;Bundanha&quot; (Japanese: 武断派; those in favor of a strong military authority); Tokugawa Ieyasu was part of the &quot;bundanha&quot;. One year after Maeda Toshiie died, Ieyasu saw his chance to take control. The death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599 made Ieyasu the most experienced of the Five Elders. Finally, due to the fact that Uesugi Kagekatsu had been illegally constructing and restoring forts, Ieyasu was able to justify going to battle which led to the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Following the battle, in 1603, Ieyasu became Shōgun while Hideyori was declared &quot;naidaijin&quot;. Ieyasu sent his granddaughter, Senhime to Osaka to marry Hideyori in order to stabilize the relationship between the two families.
Tokugawa Ieyasu rose to power while originally working in the name of Toyotomi Hideyori. Ieyasu&#x27;s power seemed to be threatened by Hideyori in a long series of plots both against Ieyasu and Hideyori occurred followed by the multiple battles of the Siege of Osaka (1614–15). Tokugawa Ieyasu was victorious against the Toyotomi clan, eliminating them completely, thus cementing his place as ruler of Japan.
Following the Tokugawa victory at the Siege of Osaka in 1615, Ieyasu was not satisfied with destruction of Hideyori alone, but in order to make sure the Toyotomi clan would not be able to return to power in the future, he had as many as possible of the Toyotomi family killed, or in the case of Hideyori&#x27;s daughter, placed in a nunnery. Ieyasu had Hideyori&#x27;s son Kunimatsu, then 8 years old, killed at the Rokujō riverbed (Rokujō-Gawara) in Kyoto.

== In popular culture ==
The Council of Five Elders can also be seen in Japanese historical drama, &quot;Taiga Drama&quot;, which is broadcast by NHK. This topic is briefly mentioned in &quot;Gunshi Kanbei&quot; and &quot;Tenchijin&quot;, and more in detail in &quot;Sanadamaru&quot;. In the 31st episode of &quot;Sanadamaru&quot;, a brief explanation of why the Council of Five Elders didn&#x27;t work out as Hideyoshi expected is explained and we can also see that Elders were referred as &quot;Otonashu&quot;(Japanese: 老衆). The drama also shows that early death of Maeda Toshiie had led to Ieyasu gaining more power, and Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s lack of popularity among the Toyotomi family caused a lot people to support Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara.

<text>Yevgeny Yakovlevich Perepyolkin (; 4 March 1906 – 13 January 1938) was a Soviet astronomer. He headed the astrophysics department of the Pulkovo Observatory until he was arrested on 11 May 1937 for counter-revolutionary agitation. He was sent to a penal labour camp in Krasnoyarsk Krai, and was executed on 13 January 1938.

He worked at the Pulkovo Observatory when he led the observation of the proper motion of stars with respect to extragalactic nebula.

A crater on Mars and another on the Moon were named in his honor.

<text>Scott Smith (born 1959) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as New Democratic Party from 1999 to 2007, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Doer.

==Early life and career==

Smith was born and raised in Brandon, Manitoba, and worked as a firefighter for twenty years before entering provincial politics. He was elected to the Brandon City Council in 1995, defeating an incumbent councillor in the city&#x27;s seventh ward. He also ran for Mayor of Brandon in a by-election two years later, and finished third against Reg Atkinson in a close three-way contest. Smith continued to sit as a councillor during the mayoral campaign, and was re-elected without opposition in 1998. While on council, he served as chair of Brandon&#x27;s poverty task force, grants review committee and taxi review committee.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==

===Government backbencher===

Smith was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1999 provincial election, defeating longtime Progressive Conservative MLA and sitting Minister of Education and Training James McCrae in the division of Brandon West. The NDP won a majority government provincially, and Smith entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Gary Doer&#x27;s government. He served as Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Mines.

===Cabinet minister===

;Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs

Smith was promoted to cabinet on January 17, 2001 as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for administration of the Liquor Control Act. In this capacity, he defended his government&#x27;s support for rent control over opposition from landlord groups. He increased the maximum rent increase from 1.5% to 2% for 2002, but lowered it to 1% for 2003.

In May 2002, Smith introduced legislation giving investors the right to seek financial compensation from advisers who mismanage funds through violations of the Manitoba Securities Act. Maximum compensation was set at $100,000. This legislation was the first of its kind in Canada. Smith also introduced legislation to protect customers from negative option billing, and reformed provincial laws concerning reverse mortgages.

;;Liquor Control Act

As Minister responsible for the Liquor Control Act, Smith indicated that his government would not expand the number of private wine stores in the province. He oversaw a tax break for Manitoba&#x27;s microbrewery industry in April 2001, when the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission reduced its mark-up rates.

In June 2001, Smith announced that Manitoba&#x27;s liquor laws would be reformed to allow liquor stores, beverage rooms, vendors and private clubs to open on Sundays. Municipalities were allowed to pass by-laws exempting themselves from the legislation. Due in part to extra revenue from this change, the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission&#x27;s net profits increased by $4.7 million in the 2001-02 year.

;;Other responsibilities

Smith was appointed to the influential Treasury Board of cabinet on March 24, 2001, replacing Oscar Lathlin. Following the September 11 attacks, he was appointed to an all-party task force on provincial security. In December 2001, he introduced steps to prevent the spread of false or forged birth certificates.

;Minister of Transportation and Government Services

Premier Gary Doer shuffled his cabinet on September 25, 2002, and appointed Smith as Minister of Transportation and Government Services with responsibility for Emergency Measures and administration of the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act.

;;Transportation

In October 2002, Smith instructed drivers of the province&#x27;s fleet vehicles to purchase environmentally friendly ethanol fuel in areas where it was reasonably available. He said that the Doer government wanted to see ethanol made more widely available across the province, and hoped his decision would provide an incentive for retailers. Provincial ethanol purchases increased dramatically in the last three months of the year. Smith also unveiled two hybrid electric cars for the provincial fleet in December 2002, and said that he planned to double the number of environmentally friendly vehicles in provincial service.

In February 2003, Smith introduced a plan to have the Trans-Canada Highway twinned as far as the Saskatchewan border over a period of four years. The plan was conditional on financial aid from the federal government. In the same year, he joined with federal cabinet minister Rey Pagtakhan to announce significant upgrades to Manitoba&#x27;s highway system.

Smith also introduced a number of measures to improve driving safety in Manitoba. In September 2003, he indicated that repeat drunk drivers would be required to install ignition-interlock devices in their cars, requiring them to pass a breathalyzer test before the car could be started. He introduced tougher penalties for seatbelt violations, and sought to introduce high-technology drivers&#x27; licenses with biometric information.

;;Government Services

Smith announced in November 2002 that the Doer government would expedite the tendering process for provincial capital construction, indicating that 80% of projects would be tendered by January. Many contracts had not been not tendered until the spring or early summer in previous years, and some in the industry complained that the delays led to market confusion.

Smith was also in charge of the provincial government&#x27;s efforts to maintain economic viability for the financially troubled port city of Churchill in northern Manitoba. The government pledged one million dollars to find new markets and new products for the city in early 2003.

Smith presided over a memorial ceremony for the victims of the September 11 attacks at the International Peace Garden in September 2003. He drew attention to his own background as a firefighter in paying tribute to those who died in the New York City attacks.

;Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines

Smith was re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, winning an unexpectedly easy victory over former Brandon Mayor Reg Atkinson. He was promoted to Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines on November 4, 2003, retaining responsibility for Emergency Measures and the Manitoba Lotteries Act. He was also given responsibility for the Liquor Control Act a second time.

Smith helped oversee the controversial expansion of Manitoba&#x27;s pharmaceutical sector, and defended local retailers who profited from the sale of medicine to American buyers.

Smith also worked with Manitoba beef farmers through the summer of 2004, in an effort to purchase a new slaughterhouse with thorough bovine spongiform encephalopathy testing procedures. The value of Canadian cattle had declined dramatically in previous months, when the American border was closed to trade after BSE was found in a single Canadian cow. Many farmers argued that a more comprehensive testing system would be necessary to reopen the American border.

As Minister of Mines, Smith oversaw the expansion of Manitoba&#x27;s burgeoning gold sector. The province announced $1.4 million in tax credits for the mining industry in spring 2004.

;Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade

Smith was promoted again on October 12, 2004 to Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade. He retained responsibility for Emergency Measures, Lotteries and the Liquor Control Act, and also became minister responsible for International Relations Coordination.

Shortly after his appointment, Smith announced that the Doer government would not proceed with a series of controversial changes to the provincial Planning Act. Farmers and environmental groups had criticized the changes, arguing that they would remove municipal oversight from the expansion of hog farms. Smith argued that the proposed changes were no longer necessary, due to the Water Protection Act being developed by his government. He introduced a revised set of changes in 2005, which received cautious support from advocacy groups.

In November 2004, Smith introduced an amendment to the City of Winnipeg&#x27;s charter allowing the city to provide business tax relief for selected neighbourhoods. Previous rules had mandated a uniform rate for the entire city. The following year, Smith introduced greater property tax flexibility for all Manitoba municipalities. He introduced the Capital Region Partnership Act in the same period, requiring Winnipeg and the surrounding municipalities to cooperate in the development of regional lands.

The federal government distributed gas tax revenues to the provinces in 2005, and gave provincial governments discretion over how the monies would be divided. Following discussions with the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, Smith announced that the money would be distributed to different parts of the province on a per capita basis. Representatives from major cities brought forward an alternate proposal, wherein 90% of the funds would be made available on a per capita basis and 10% put directly toward public transit in urban centres.

Smith approved the Doer government&#x27;s proposal to create the Waverley West subdivision of Winnipeg in April 2005, notwithstanding concerns that his membership in the government created an inherent bias. In time, the suburb is expected to become larger than Brandon. In 2006, Smith announced $200,000 for emergency programs in north and west-end Winnipeg.

;;Emergency Measures

Smith and the Broadcasters Association of Manitoba introduced a new public emergency notification system in late 2003, ensuring that details of an emergency will be conveyed by radio and television within 15–30 minutes of its occurrence.

In November 2003, Smith designated Selkirk as the first city in Manitoba to have exceeded its emergency preparedness requirements. In March 2005, he introduced legislation allowing Manitoba to sign mutual agreements for emergency preparedness with other provinces, American states, and countries. He also coordinated flood relief for various parts of Manitoba over a period of several years.

;;Other responsibilities

Smith served as acting Highways Minister in the summer of 2006. He indicated that Manitoba would consider raising its speed limit to 110 km/hour for selected twinned highways, putting Manitoba policy in line with American states and other provinces.

;Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade

After another cabinet shuffle on September 21, 2006, Smith was designated as Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade while retaining responsibility for Lotteries and the Liquor Control Act. He continued to defend Manitoba&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry against criticism from the Canadian Pharmacists Association, arguing that Manitoba companies have a proven track record of providing a safe and secure product to buyers. Smith presided over a continued expansion in Manitoba&#x27;s manufacturing sector, with Statistics Canada reporting the creation of 3,000 new jobs in January 2007.

;;Liquor Control Act

Smith announced modernizing reforms to the Liquor Control Act in late 2004, giving private wine stores the right to sell drinks such as brandy and cognac. He also indicated that Manitobans would be allowed to re-seal half-empty wine bottles ordered in restaurants, and bring them home. Most restaurateurs supported this change.

;;Lotteries

Smith defended the use of Video Lottery Terminals as a source of government revenue, and rejected a 2003 proposal from Progressive Conservative MLA John Loewen to phase out most terminals from the province. Loewen argued that the machines brought a huge social burden upon Manitoba; Smith responded that the province had taken steps to combat gambling addiction and was introducing machines with responsible gaming software. He also noted that Manitoba received $232 million annually from lottery revenues, and argued that the money was necessary to fund social programs.

Smith rejected a proposal to allow Automated Teller Machines into casinos in January 2004, although he approved a plan to allow Sunday gambling in hotels, bars and lounges.

In April 2004, Smith indicated that his government would review a Manitoba Lottery Corporation regulation that mandated English as the only language permitted at gambling tables (Manitoba recognizes English and French as official languages). As a short-term measure, he announced that both of Winnipeg&#x27;s casinos would hire a French-speaking card dealer.

The Manitoba Lotteries Corp. posted a profit of $146.2 million for the first half of 2006, a $6.4 million increase over the previous year.

;;Leadership ambitions

Prior to the 2007 provincial election, Smith was the only member of Gary Doer&#x27;s cabinet to openly contemplate running for the party leadership after Doer retires. A &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; writer argued that many party members considered him to be too right-wing for the position.

;2007 election

Smith was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Rick Borotsik, a popular former mayor, in the 2007 provincial election. He was the only New Democratic Party incumbent to lose his seat in the election.

==Federal politics==

Smith supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 2003.

==Trivia==

*Smith defeated Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz in a friendly competition in the 2006 Winnipeg marathon. Smith finished the 26-mile marathon in three hours and fifty-four minutes, while Katz took four hours and thirty-seven minutes.

==Table of offices held==



*Ashton was designated as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
*Mihychuk was designated as Minister of Industry, Trade and Mines.

<doc id="961547" wikidata="Q2118140" url="?curid=961547" title="Al Freeman Jr.">
<text>Albert Cornelius Freeman Jr. (March 21, 1934 – August 9, 2012) was an American actor, director, and educator. A life member of The Actors Studio, Freeman appeared in a wide variety of plays, ranging from Leroi Jones&#x27; &quot;Slave/Toilet&quot; to Joe Papp&#x27;s revivals of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and films, including &quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, as well as television series and soap operas, such as &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;.

==Life and career==
Al Freeman was born in San Antonio, Texas, to Lottie Brisette (née Coleman) and Albert Cornelius Freeman, a jazz pianist. Taking a hiatus from college, Freeman enlisted in the Air Force in 1951 to serve in the Korean War.

He starred opposite Frank Sinatra in the 1968 Gordon Douglas film &quot;The Detective&quot;, before taking his most recognized acting role as police captain Ed Hall on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1972 through 1987, with recurring appearances in 1988 and 2000. He won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor for that role in 1979, the first actor from the show as well as the first African-American actor to earn the award.

After leaving &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, Freeman appeared in the 1998 motion picture &quot;Down in the Delta&quot;. His Broadway theatre credits include &quot;The Hot L Baltimore&quot; and &quot;Look to the Lilies&quot;. His portrayal of Elijah Muhammad, the Nation of Islam leader, in the film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; earned him the 1992 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. He had played Malcolm X in the 1979 miniseries, &quot;&quot;. In the 1990s he had a recurring guest role as the manipulative Baltimore deputy police commissioner James Harris in &quot;&quot;. In 1991 Freeman joined the Department of Theatre Arts at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and served for six years as department chairman.

Al Freeman Jr. also appeared on Broadway in 1970 as Homer Smith in &quot;Look to the Lilies&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, opposite Shirley Booth. The show ran for 25 performances and 31 previews.

==Death==
Freeman died on August 9, 2012, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 78.

On September 10, 2012, a memorial service was held for Freeman at Howard University. In 2014, the Environmental Theatre Space at the Howard University Fine Arts Building was renamed The Al Freeman Jr. Environmental Theatre Space in his honor.

<doc id="961552" wikidata="Q1455606" url="?curid=961552" title="Television channel frequencies">
<text>The following tables show the frequencies assigned to analog broadcast television channels in various regions of the world, along with the ITU letter designator for the transmission system used. The frequencies shown are for the channel limits and for the analog video and audio carriers. The channel itself usually occupies 6, 7 or 8 megahertz of bandwidth depending on the television transmission system in use. For example, North American channel 1 occupies the spectrum from 44 to 50 MHz. See Broadcast television systems for a table of signal characteristics, including bandwidth, by ITU letter designator. Analog television broadcasts have been phased out in most regions, having been replaced by digital television broadcasts.

== International normalization for analog TV systems ==

International broadcasting television frequencies are divided in two part of the spectrum; the Very high frequency or &quot;VHF“ band and the Ultra high frequency or &quot;UHF“ band.

==VHF==
===Americas (most countries), South Korea, Taiwan, Myanmar, and the Philippines===
During World War II, the frequencies originally assigned as channels 13 to 18 were appropriated by the U.S. military, which still uses them to this day. It was also decided to move the allocation for FM radio from the 42-50 MHz band to a larger 88-106 MHz band (later extended to the current 88-108 MHz FM band). This required a reassignment of the VHF channels to the plan currently in use.

====Assignments since February 25, 1946====
* System M 525 lines (most countries in the Americas and Caribbean, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines)
* System N 625 lines (used in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay)
* FM channel 200, 87.9 MHz, overlaps TV 6. This is used only by K200AA.
* TV 6 analog audio can be heard on FM 87.75 on most broadcast radio receivers as well as on a European TV tuned to channel E4A or channel IC, but at lower volume than wideband FM broadcast stations, because of the lower deviation.
* Channel 1 audio is the same as European Channel E2 audio and the video is the same as European Channel E2A. Channel 2 video is the same as European Channel E3 video.

===Japan===
* The frequency spacing for each channel is 6 MHz as the countries above, except between channels 7 and 8 (which overlap).
* Channels 1 through 3 are reallocated for the expansion of the FM band.

===United Kingdom, Ireland, and Hong Kong ===


====Ireland====

* Channel A was never used terrestrially. The only System I Band I transmitter on Channel B was RTÉ One from the Maghera, Co. Clare transmitter during 1963–1999. Channel A was initially intended for use at Maghera but Channel B was used instead because of the risk of interference to (overspill) reception of BBC 405 line transmissions. It was moved to Channel E due to interference from distant transmitters on channel E3 and Italian channel IA via certain atmospheric conditions and other reasons. Channel C was used by a relay transmitter in Glanmire, Co. Cork. 
* Channel B video is the same as Italian Channel IA video and Channel C audio is the same as Channel E4 audio.
* There are currently no Band I Channels used in Ireland (except on cable TV, and these have mostly been phased out for DOCSIS use) and no plans to resume using them.
* Most Irish Cable TV systems do not follow the above channel plan as their analogue (video) carriers are usually at multiples of 8 MHz (i.e. 176, 184, 192 MHz etc. in Band III)

===Western Europe; Greenland; and most countries in Asia, Africa, and Oceania===

* Channels 1 and 1A were used for early experimental broadcasts and are no longer allocated.
* Channels 15 and 16 are allocated for use in the African Broadcasting Area only.
* Channel 2A was only ever used in Austria for the Sendeturm Jauerling to avoid interferences with neighboring Eastern European TV stations.
* Channel 3 in Belgium, RTBF 1 broadcast from the Liège transmitter with 100 kW until the switchover to DVB-T.
* Channel 12 was reserved by the military in some countries (like Germany (West Germany only)) so only relay transmitters operated on this frequency.
* Channel 4A audio carrier&#x27;s frequency is very close to US Channel 6 audio carrier and overlaps the FM band in Europe.

===France===
* Channel 1 used an earlier 441-line system and was discontinued in 1956.

===French overseas departments and territories and former French African colonies===
===Italy===
* Channels A through H are indicated in many European TVs as Channels 13–20.
* Channels B, C, D, H, H1, and H2 are identical to Channels E4, E4A, E5, E10, E11, and E12, respectively.
* Channel A video carrier is the same as Channel E2 audio carrier and thus it used to be common that the audio from a distant TV station on channel E2 received via Sporadic E interferes with Channel A video and vice versa.
* Channel C audio carrier&#x27;s frequency falls into the FM band in Europe, and is also identical to American A6 channel audio.

===Eastern Europe, North Korea===


===East Germany (former DDR)===
In its very early days DFF made some test transmissions using the D/K standard (6.5 MHz audio) before reverting (around 1957) to System B/G (5.5 MHz audio) but using some unique frequencies.

* From 1960 onwards (West) European standard channels were adopted.

===Morocco===
===Australia===
* Channels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5A are no longer used since the transition to digital television.
* With the introduction of digital TV in 2001, the last two channels were moved up by 1 MHz (some existing services affected - one example is AMV11 in the Upper Murray region of Victoria, Australia and VTV-11 in Western Victoria, due to the introduction of digital television at the time in regional Victoria) to allow a full 7 MHz for a new channel 9A and channel 12 was added following the new channel 11.

===New Zealand and Indonesia===

* VHF analog TV ceased in New Zealand on 1 December 2013.
* Channels 10 and 11 weren&#x27;t added until the late 1980s.
* VHF analog TV channel 1A is only used in Indonesia.
* VHF is currently no longer used for television in Indonesia (except in some regions until 2022) and only UHF is used for both analog and digital television, as in the UK.

===Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa===
===China===

=== Vietnam ===
==UHF==

===Americas (most countries), South Korea, Taiwan, Burma (Myanmar) and the Philippines===

For frequencies used in the Americas (most countries), South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, refer to Pan-American television frequencies.

;Notes:
* The frequencies used by UHF channels 70 through 83 were reallocated to the Land Mobile Radio System (Public Safety and Trunked Radio) and mobile phones in a CCIR worldwide convention in 1982, and thus were never used for digital TV but are highlighted in cyan and listed here for theoretical use.
* In certain metropolitan areas of the United States, Channels 14 through 20 have been allocated to Land Mobile Radio (LMR) use.
* Channels 52 through 69 in the United States have been reallocated now that conversion to digital TV was completed on June 12, 2009. These channels are highlighted in yellow. Channels 70 through 83 in the United States and Canada were re-allocated to AMPS cellular phone use in 1983.
* On August 22, 2011, the United States&#x27; Federal Communications Commission announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51, to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band. Later that year (on December 16, 2011), Industry Canada and the CRTC followed suit in placing a moratorium on future television stations using Channel 51 for broadcast use, to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band.
* Not all countries listed use ATSC, which has a single VSB carrier wave. Other countries use COFDM modulation for DVB-T (Taiwan, Colombia, Panama) or ISDB-Tb (Philippines and Latin America), which has dozens of carriers within the channel. Burma (Myanmar) uses DVB-T2 on 8 MHz channel spacing on Western Europe / Asia DTV frequency along with Southeast Asian countries (except Philippines).
*ISDB-Tb frequency DTV channel 14 uses 473.142857 MHz, but ATSC 3.0, DVB-T/DVB-T2, and DTMB, use 473.0 MHz.
* Channel 37 is reserved for radio astronomy in the United States, Canada, Bermuda, Belize, and the Bahamas, thus there are no television stations assigned to it. Mexico also informally observes a ban on transmitters using this channel.
*Due to the FCC repack in the United States, all TV stations that had been broadcasting from channels 38 to 51 were required to move on or below channel 36 by July 3, 2020. As a result, channels 38-51 are highlighted in magenta. These frequencies would later be used by U.S. mobile carriers like T-Mobile on Band 71.

===Japan===

Frequency spacing for each channel in Japan is the same as in the countries listed above, but the channel numbers are 1 lower than in those countries; for example, channel 13 in Japan is on the same frequency as channel 14 in North and South America (most countries), South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

Channels 13-62 are used for analog and digital TV broadcasting.

===United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, Macau, Falkland Islands and Southern Africa===
* Channels 21 to 60 used for DVB-T Digital TV broadcasting in the UK, with the exception of Channel 38, which is used for programme making and special events. Channels 61 to 69 used for 4G LTE.
* Channel 69 was not used for TV broadcasting in the UK, it was used by the MOD and until 2012 for programme making and special events.
* PAL I was withdrawn from broadcasting use in the UK during 2012 and 2013.

===Western Europe, Greenland, most countries in Asia and Africa, and most of Oceania===

* Former channels 14 to 18 renumbered as 21 to 25 in 1961.
* Channels 70 to 81 no longer allocated to television. They were only used in Italy.

===France, Eastern Europe, Former Soviet Union, French overseas territories and former French colonies in Africa, North Korea, Vietnam===
*Some cable television providers in Vietnam may use System G.

===DVB-T/DVB-T2/DTMB/ISDB-T Digital television frequencies (Western Europe, Eastern Europe most countries Asia, Africa and Oceania)===
===Australia===
Channels 52–69 had been progressively phased out since the introduction of digital television and rationalisation of the spectrum

===China===

<doc id="961557" wikidata="Q619896" url="?curid=961557" title="Catholicos">
<text>A catholicos (plural: catholicoi) is the head of certain churches in some Eastern Christian traditions. The title implies autocephaly and, in some cases, it is the title of the head of an autonomous church. The word comes from ancient Greek ( ), derived from (, &quot;generally&quot;) from (, &quot;down&quot;) and (, &quot;whole&quot;), meaning &quot;concerning the whole, universal, general&quot;; it originally designated a financial or civil office in the Roman Empire.

The Church of the East, some Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic churches historically use this title; for example the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the Church of the East, the title was given to the church&#x27;s head, the patriarch of the Church of the East; it is still used in two successor churches, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, the heads of which are known as catholicos-patriarchs. In the Armenian Church there are two catholicoi: the supreme catholicos of Ejmiadzin and the catholicos of Cilicia. The title &quot;catholicos-patriarchs&quot; is also used by the primate of the Armenian Catholic Church. In India, an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox Church and the regional head of Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church (an autonomous Church within Syriac Orthodox Church) use this title. The first is the catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan, and the latter the catholicos of India, but unequally same according to the constitution of the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church.

== Origin of the title ==
The earliest ecclesiastical use of the title &quot;catholicos&quot; was by the Bishop of Etchmiadzin, head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in the 4th century while still under the Patriarchate of Antioch. Among the Armenians, catholicos was originally a simple title for the principal bishop of the country; he was subordinate to the See of Caesarea in Cappadocia.

Sometime later, it was adopted by the Grand metropolitans of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Persia, who became the designated heads of the Church of the East. The first claim that the bishop of Selucia-Ctesiphon was superior to the other bishoprics and had (using a later term) &quot;patriarchal&quot; rights was made by Patriarch Papa bar Aggai (c. 317 – c. 329). In the 5th century this claim was strengthened and Isaac (or &quot;Ishaq&quot;, 399 – c. 410), who organized the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, used the title of &quot;bishop of Selucia-Ctesiphon, Catholicos and Head over the bishops of all the Orient&quot;. This line of Catholicos founded the Church of the East and the development of the East Syriac Rite.

At the beginning of the fourth century, Albania and Georgia (Iberia) were converted to Christianity, and the principal bishop of each of these countries bore the title of catholicos, although neither of them was autocephalous. They followed the Armenians in rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. At the end of the sixth or beginning of the seventh century, the Georgian catholicos asserted his independence and accepted Eastern Orthodoxy. Henceforward the Georgian Church underwent the same evolutions as the Greek. In 1783 Georgia was forced to abolish the office of its catholicos, and place itself under the Most Holy Synod of Russia, to which country it was united politically in 1801. The Albanian catholicos remained loyal to the Armenian Church, with the exception of a brief schism towards the end of the sixth century. Shortly afterwards, Albania was assimilated partly with Armenia and partly with Georgia. There is no mention of any catholicos in Albania after the seventh century. It is asserted by some that the head of the Abyssinian Church, the abuna, also bears the title of catholicos, but, although this name may have been applied to him by analogy, there is, to our knowledge, no authority for asserting that this title is used by the Abyssinian Church itself.

==Catholicos in various churches==

===Autocephalous churches of East ===
The following are autocephalous churches of East Syriac Rite that claim succession to the Catholicos of the East of Selucia-Ctesiphon of the Church of the East. Referred to as &quot;Nestorianism&quot; in Western texts, the term Nestorian was formally renounced in 1976 by Mar Dinkha IV.

====Assyrian Church of the East====

, Awa III is the catholicos-patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. One of the oldest Christian churches, it is a modern successor of the historical Church of the East. It traces its origins to the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in central Mesopotamia, which tradition holds was founded by Thomas the Apostle as well as Mari of Edessa and Addai of Edessa in the year 33 as asserted in the Doctrine of Addai.

It is one of the three churches of the East that hold themselves distinct from Oriental and Eastern Orthodoxy. It is often called the Chaldean Syrian Church in India. The church declares that no other church has suffered as many martyrdoms as the Assyrian Church of the East.

The founders of Assyrian theology were Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who taught at Antioch. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551–628) and is distinct from the accusations directed toward Nestorius. Babay&#x27;s main Christological work is called the &quot;Book of the Union&quot; and in it, he teaches that the two (essences or hypostases) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the or hypostatic union.

====Ancient Church of the East====
, Addai II is the catholicos of the Ancient Church of the East, which split from the Assyrian Church of the East in the 1960s.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Georgian Orthodox Church====
The title of catholicos is also used in the Georgian Church, whose head carries the title Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia.
* Catholicos of Georgian Orthodox Church
** Ilia II is the current (as of 22 February 2012) Catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

=== Oriental Orthodox Churches ===
==== Armenian Apostolic Church ====
In the Armenian Church there are two catholicoi: the supreme catholicos of Etchmiadzin and the catholicos of Cilicia. The Catholicos of Etchmiadzin presides over the Supreme Spiritual Council of the Armenian Apostolic Church and is the head of the world&#x27;s 7 million Armenian Apostolic Christians. The primacy of honour of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia.
* Catholicos of Etchmiadzin (Catholicos of All Armenians) of the Armenian Apostolic Church
** Karekin II is the current catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
* Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, residing in Antelias, Lebanon (historically based in Sis in Cilicia)
**Aram I is the present catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia.
Until the 19th century, there were also two other high-ranking Armenian clergymen who held the title of catholicos: the Catholicos of Albania (also known as the Catholicos of Gandzasar) and the Catholicos of Aghtamar.

====Syriac Orthodox Church====
In the seventh century, the Syriac Orthodox Christians who lived in Persia began using the title for its catholicos / maphrian, who was originally the head of the Syriac Orthodox Christian community in Persia. This office ranked second in the Syriac Orthodox church hierarchy after the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, until it was abolished in 1860 and reinstated in the India of the East on 1964.

Today, the title is known as Catholicos / Maphrian of India or Catholicos of India of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church headquartered at Puthencruz near Kochi in Kerala is an integral branch of Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch headed by Ignatius Aphrem II Patriarch of Antioch. The current catholicos of the church is Baselios Thomas I.

====Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church====
According to the constitution of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (Indian Orthodox Church) the head or primate bears the title Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan. The church is based at Devalokam near Kottayam in Kerala. As of 2021, the current head is Baselios Marthoma Mathews III. He is currently the 9th catholicos of the East since it was relocated to India and 92nd Primate on the Apostolic throne of Saint Thomas.

====Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church====
In 1959, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria granted autocephaly to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Abuna Basilios was consecrated the first patriarch-catholicos of the Ethiopian Church by the Coptic Pope Cyril VI at St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral in Cairo on 28 June 1959. The title is &quot;Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia, Ichege of the See of St. Tekle Haymanot, Archbishop of Axum&quot;.

===Catholic Church===
Some Eastern Catholic Churches use the title &quot;Catholicos&quot;.

==== Armenian Catholic Church ====
The leader of the Armenian Catholic Church (of Armenian Rite), in full communion with the Pope, uses the title &quot;Catholicos&quot;.

As of March 14, 2022, Raphaël Bedros XXI Minassian is the catholicos-patriarch of the Armenian Catholic Church. His full title is officially &quot;Catholicos-Patriarch of the House of Cilicia&quot;.

====Chaldean Catholic Church====
The Chaldean Catholic Church (of East Syriac Rite) is in full communion with the Pope. Although derived from the historical Church of the East, whose leader was initially styled Major Metropolitan and Catholicos and later Patriarch (see Church of the East#Organisation and structure), it seems to use only the title of &quot;Patriarch&quot;.

, Louis Raphaël I Sako is the Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans.
==== Syro-Malankara Catholic Church ====
The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church of West Syriac Rite in full communion with the Pope is a major archiepiscopal church, a rank granted to the Eastern Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II on 10 February 2005. Accordingly it is headed by Major Archbishop Moran Mor Cardinal Baselios Cleemis Catholica Bava since 2007.

He is referred to as catholicos of the Syro Malankara Catholic Church. In this context, the use of the title &quot;Catholicos&quot; indicates parity between him and his peers in the autocephalous Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and in the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, which remains part of the Syriac Orthodox Church.

<text>Deep Creek Lake State Park is a public recreation area occupying more than on the northeast side of Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County, Maryland, in the United States. The park features water activities, camping facilities, and recreational trails and is located about south of Interstate 68 on U.S. Route 219.

==History==
Although settlers arrived in the area in the 1700s, it was the massive logging operations of the 20th century that stripped the land of its virgin forest. The park&#x27;s forest of oaks and hickories was regenerated from the original timber stand.

The Deep Creek Lake reservoir was created on a tributary of the Youghiogheny River with completion of the Deep Creek Dam by the Pennsylvania Electric Company in 1925. The state took charge of recreation on the lake in 1980, then purchased the land underlying the lake and buffer zone properties for $17 million in 2000.

In September 2010, the Appalachian Regional Commission provided $20,000 in funding for a study of potential development at Deep Creek Lake. An official tourism website promoting Deep Creek Lake was launched soon after by the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce.

==Activities and amenities==
Lake activities include motor boating, water skiing, swimming, fishing, and canoeing. A campground has 112 campsites, 26 with electricity. Trails are used for hiking and mountain biking. The park&#x27;s Discovery Center offers exhibits on local plants and wildlife, including the American black bears occasionally seen in the campground, the lake and its watershed, conservation issues, and local coal and logging activities in addition to the daily educational programs about nature and the environment presented by naturalists, rangers, and volunteers.

===Johnny&#x27;s Bait House===
Johnny&#x27;s Bait House was a business and facility that operated on the shore of Deep Creek Lake from 1955 to 2003. It was owned and operated by Johnny Marple and his wife Elaine. Johnny promoted and supported the fishing industry at Deep Creek Lake. In the early years, Johnny&#x27;s was open year-round, supporting all fishing, including ice fishing, but eventually started closing during the winter months. Johnny&#x27;s provided the Deep Creek Lake Fishing Report to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and many publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Baltimore Sun, Field and Stream Magazine and Star Democrat.

Johnny&#x27;s partnered with the Garrett County Promotion Council and founded the Garrett County Fishing Contest, a weekly event that continues to this day. The establishment also managed the official Deep Creek Lake Fishing records through 2003. During that time, multiple Maryland state freshwater fishing record catches were registered. Johnny assisted the State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources in the monitoring of fish population and the registration of fish tagged for population studies. Many items from the collection of mounted fish from that time period are still on display in the Discovery Center of the Deep Creek Lake State Park. The former location of Johnny&#x27;s is currently occupied by Bill&#x27;s Outdoor Center.

<doc id="961559" wikidata="Q240076" url="?curid=961559" title="Farley Granger">
<text>Farley Earle Granger Jr. (July 1, 1925 – March 27, 2011) was an American actor.

Granger was first noticed in a small stage production in Hollywood by a Goldwyn casting director, and given a significant role in &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943), a controversial film praising the Soviet Union at the height of World War II, but later condemned for its political position. Another war film, &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944), followed, before Granger&#x27;s naval service in Honolulu, in a unit that arranged troop entertainment in the Pacific. Here he made useful contacts, including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also where he began exploring his bisexuality, which he said he never felt any need to conceal.

His role in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot;, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case of 1924, earned him much critical praise though the film got mixed reviews. Hitchcock cast him again in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, as a tennis star drawn into a reciprocal murder plot by a wealthy psychopath; he described this as his happiest film-making experience.

Granger continued to appear on stage, film and television well into his 70s. His work ranged from classical drama on Broadway to several Italian-language films and major documentaries about Hollywood. For his contribution to television, Granger has a star located at 1551 Vine Street on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Granger was born in San Jose, California, the son of Eva (née Hopkins) and Farley Earle Granger Sr. He lived at 1185 Hanchett Avenue in the Hanchett Residence Park neighborhood.

His wealthy father owned a Willys-Overland automobile dealership, and the family frequently spent time at their beach house in Capitola on Monterey Bay. Following the stock market crash in 1929, the Grangers were forced to sell both their homes and most of their personal belongings and move into an apartment above the family business, where they remained for the next two years. As a result of this financial setback and the loss of their social status, both of Granger&#x27;s parents began to drink heavily. Eventually the remainder of their possessions were sold at auction to settle their debts, and the elder Granger used the last car on his lot to spirit away the family to Los Angeles in the middle of the night.

In the 1930s, the family lived in a small apartment in a seedy part of Hollywood, and Granger&#x27;s parents worked at various temporary jobs. Their drinking increased, and the couple frequently fought. Hoping he might become a tap dancer, Granger&#x27;s mother enrolled him at Ethel Meglin&#x27;s, the dance and drama instruction studio where Judy Garland and Shirley Temple had started.

Granger&#x27;s father found work as a clerk in the North Hollywood branch of the California Department of Unemployment, and his salary allowed him to put a small down payment on a house in Studio City, where their neighbor was actor/dancer Donald O&#x27;Connor. At his office, Granger&#x27;s father became acquainted with comedian Harry Langdon in the early 1940s, who advised him to take his son to a small local theatre where open auditions for &quot;The Wookey&quot;, a British play about Londoners struggling to survive during World War II, were being held. The 17-year-old Granger&#x27;s use of a Cockney accent impressed the director, and he was cast in multiple roles. The opening night audience included talent agent Phil Gersh and Samuel Goldwyn casting director Bob McIntyre, and the following morning Gersh contacted Granger&#x27;s parents and asked them to bring him to his office that afternoon to discuss the role of Damian, a teenaged Russian boy in the film &quot;The North Star&quot;.

Granger auditioned for producer Goldwyn, screenwriter Lillian Hellman and director Lewis Milestone. Hellman was trying to convince Montgomery Clift to leave the Broadway play in which he was appearing, and when her efforts proved to be futile, the role was given to Granger. During the 1940s, Goldwyn signed him to a seven-year contract for $100 per week.

==Early career==
The studio publicity department was concerned audiences would confuse Granger with British actor Stewart Granger, so they suggested he change his name and offered him a list from which to choose. &quot;The names were all interchangeable, like Gordon Gregory and Gregory Gordon. I didn&#x27;t want to change my name&quot;, Granger later recalled. &quot;I liked Farley Granger. It was my father&#x27;s name, and his grandfather&#x27;s name. They kept bringing me new combinations, and finally I offered to change it to Kent Clark. I was the only one who thought it was funny.&quot; Eventually the studio issued a press release announcing Farley Granger, a senior at North Hollywood High School, had been cast in &quot;The North Star&quot; after he responded to an ad in the local paper. &quot;I thought that was a really dumb story&quot;, said Granger. &quot;The truth was much more interesting.&quot;

Making the film proved to be a fortunate start to Granger&#x27;s career. He enjoyed working with director Milestone and fellow cast members Dana Andrews, Anne Baxter, Walter Brennan and Jane Withers, and during filming he met composer Aaron Copland, who remained a friend in later years. When released in 1943, when the Soviet Union was still an American ally in World War II, the film was savaged by critics working for newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst, a staunch anti-Communist who felt the movie was Soviet propaganda.

For Granger&#x27;s next film, he was loaned out to 20th Century Fox, where Darryl F. Zanuck cast him in &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944), in which he was directed by Milestone and again co-starred with Dana Andrews. Still a teenager, Granger became a close friend of supporting cast member Sam Levene, a character actor from New York City who took him under his wing. He also became a friend of Roddy McDowall and found himself linked with June Haver in gossip columns and fan magazines.

Upon completion of &quot;The Purple Heart&quot;, Granger enlisted in the United States Navy. Following U.S. Navy Recruit Training in Farragut, Idaho, he sailed from Treasure Island in San Francisco to Honolulu. During the 17-day crossing, he suffered from chronic seasickness and lost 23 pounds, and upon arrival in Hawaii he was admitted to the hospital for several days of rehydration. As a result, the remainder of his military career was spent onshore, where he first was assigned to the cleanup crew at an enlisted men&#x27;s club situated at the end of Waikiki Beach and then to a unit in Honolulu that worked with Army Special Services that was commanded by classical actor Maurice Evans, who put together and arranged entertainment for all the troops in the Pacific. It was here that he had the opportunity to meet and mingle with visiting entertainers such as Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr, Gertrude Lawrence, and many others.

It was during his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger had his first sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club and the other with a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night. He was startled to discover he was attracted to both men and women equally, and in his memoir he observed,I finally came to the conclusion that for me, everything I had done that night was as natural and as good as it felt ... I never have felt the need to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group ... I was never ashamed, and I never felt the need to explain or apologize for my relationships to anyone ... I have loved men. I have loved women.

Granger returned to civilian life and was pleased to discover his parents had curbed their drinking and were treating each other more civilly. Goldwyn increased his weekly salary to $200 and presented him with a 1940 Ford Coupe. The actor was introduced to Saul Chaplin and his wife Ethel, who became his lifelong mentor, confidante and best friend. Through the couple, Granger met Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein and Gene Kelly, who invited him to join his open house gatherings that included Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen and Stanley Donen. Most influential among his new acquaintances was director Nicholas Ray, who cast Granger in his film noir, &quot;The Twisted Road&quot; (working title). The film was nearing completion in October 1947 when Howard Hughes acquired RKO Radio Pictures, and the new studio head shelved it for nearly a year before releasing it in 1948 under the title &quot;They Live by Night&quot; in a single theater in London. Enthusiastic reviews led RKO to finally release the film in the States in late 1949. During the two years it had remained in limbo, it had been screened numerous times in private screening rooms, and one of the people who saw it during this period was Alfred Hitchcock, who was preparing &quot;Rope&quot;.

Granger was in New York City when he was summoned to return to Hollywood and discuss &quot;Rope&quot; with Hitchcock. The night before their initial meeting, Granger coincidentally met Arthur Laurents, who had written the film&#x27;s screenplay, which was based on the 1929 play &quot;Rope&#x27;s End&quot; by Patrick Hamilton, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case of 1924. It was not until he began reading the script that he connected its author with the man he had met the previous night. Granger and Laurents met again, and Laurents invited the actor to spend the night. He declined, but when the offer was extended again several days later, he accepted. It proved to be the start of a romantic relationship that lasted about a year and a frequently tempestuous friendship that extended for decades beyond their breakup.

In &quot;Rope&quot;, Granger and John Dall portrayed two intellectuals who commit a murder simply to prove they can get away with it. The two characters and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, were supposed to be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews in 1948, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy to be part of the experience, but wondered &quot;what the film would have been like had [Hitchcock] shot it normally&quot; and &quot;had he not had to worry about censorship&quot;.

Upon the completion of &quot;Rope&quot;, Goldwyn cast Granger, Teresa Wright, David Niven, and Evelyn Keyes in &quot;Enchantment&quot; (1948), which was panned for a weak script and indifferent direction by Irving Reis. It failed at the box office, as did his next project, &quot;Roseanna McCoy&quot; (1949), during which he and Laurents parted ways. While filming &quot;Side Street&quot; (1950) on location in 1949 Manhattan for Anthony Mann, Granger briefly became involved with Leonard Bernstein, who invited him to join him on his South American tour. By the time Granger completed the film, the composer/conductor had married Costa Rican pianist and actress Felicia Montealegre. The two men remained friends until Bernstein&#x27;s death.

==Leading roles==
In November 1949, Granger, who had two years to go on his contract with Goldwyn, signed a new five-year contract with the producer.

Granger&#x27;s next two films for Goldwyn in 1950, &quot;Edge of Doom&quot; and &quot;Our Very Own&quot;, were unpleasant working experiences, and the actor refused to allow the producer to loan him to Universal Pictures for an inferior magic carpet saga. When he was placed on suspension, he decided to accompany Ethel Chaplin (who had separated from her husband) and her daughter on a trip to Paris. At the last moment, they were joined by Arthur Laurents, who remained behind when the group departed for London to see the opening of the New York City Ballet, which had been choreographed by Jerome Robbins. He and Granger engaged in a casual affair until the actor was summoned to return to New York to help publicize &quot;Edge of Doom&quot; and &quot;Our Very Own&quot;, both of which received dreadful reviews. Goldwyn cancelled the nationwide openings of the latter, hoping to salvage it by adding wraparound scenes that would change the focus of the film, and Granger refused to promote it any further. Once again placed on suspension, he departed for Europe, where he spent time in Italy, Austria, and Germany with Laurents before being contacted about an upcoming film by Alfred Hitchcock.
The project was &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), in which Granger was cast as tennis player and aspiring politician Guy Haines. He is introduced to psychopathic Bruno Anthony, portrayed by Robert Walker, who suggests they swap murders, with Bruno killing Guy&#x27;s unfaithful wife and Guy disposing of Bruno&#x27;s overbearing father. As with &quot;Rope&quot;, there was a homosexual subtext to the two men&#x27;s relationship, although it was toned down from Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s 1950 original novel. Granger and Walker, whose wife Jennifer Jones had recently left him for David O. Selznick, became close friends and confidantes during filming, and Granger was devastated when Walker died from an accidental combination of alcohol and barbiturates prior to the film&#x27;s release. It proved to be a box office hit, the first major success of Granger&#x27;s career, and his &quot;happiest filmmaking experience&quot;.

On December 31, 1950, Granger picked up close friend Shelley Winters to escort her to Sam Spiegel&#x27;s traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve gala. The actress kept him waiting for nearly two hours, and they argued while en route to the party. Once there, they went their separate ways, and Granger met Ava Gardner. The two left to hear Nat King Cole perform at a nearby nightclub and then went to Granger&#x27;s home, where they began an intense affair that lasted until Gardner began filming &quot;Show Boat&quot; a month later.

Having reconciled, Granger and Winters went to New York City, where they audited classes at the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. Winters subscribed to the concept of method acting, but Granger felt an actor &quot;had to be faithful to the text, not adapt it to some personal sense memory&quot;, and their disagreement triggered more arguments. Their plan to pursue individual training programs was disrupted when both were called back to Hollywood. Goldwyn cast Granger in &quot;I Want You&quot;, a 1951 drama about the effect the Korean War has on an American family still trying to recover from World War II. Granger thought the screenplay by Irwin Shaw was &quot;not only dull, but felt dated&quot;, but welcomed the opportunity to work with Dana Andrews and Dorothy McGuire. Goldwyn expected the film to be as successful as &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; &quot;(1946), but it proved to be as &quot;tepid and old-fashioned&quot; as Granger feared and, opening after cease-fire negotiations with Korea had begun, no longer topical, and it died at the box office. His subsequent projects – a screwball comedy with Winters called &quot;Behave Yourself!&quot; (1951), and the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; segment of the anthology film &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot; (1952) – were no more successful. During the filming of the latter, he appeared on set in a Camel commercial. The following musical film, &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952), with Danny Kaye, on the other hand, did well internationally at the box office.

Eager to work with Vincente Minnelli, Granger accepted a role opposite Leslie Caron and Ethel Barrymore in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, one of three segments in the 1953 MGM film &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot;. The film&#x27;s producer, Gottfried Reinhardt, also directed the other two segments, and he mercilessly edited &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; to give his stories more screen time. Unhappy with the direction his career was taking, Granger sought solace with Shelley Winters, who was separated from Vittorio Gassman, and the two friends resumed their love affair, which at one point nearly had culminated in marriage. Their relationship was complicated, but Granger felt &quot;it works for us.&quot;

Granger&#x27;s next project was &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1953), a musical with Jane Powell, Ann Miller, and Bobby Van. Upon its completion, he bought his release from Goldwyn, a costly decision that left him with serious financial difficulties. Granger was determined to move to Manhattan to study acting and perform on stage, but his agent convinced him to accept a role in &quot;Senso&quot; (1954), directed by Luchino Visconti and co-starring Alida Valli. Filming in Italy lasted nine months, although Granger frequently was idle during this period, allowing him free time to explore Italy and even spend a long weekend in Paris, where he had a brief affair with Jean Marais. During his time in Venice, Granger renewed his friendship with Peggy Guggenheim, whom he had met during his earlier trip to Italy with Arthur Laurents, and he met Mike Todd, who cajoled him into making a cameo appearance as a gondolier in his 1956 epic &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. He finally returned to Hollywood exhausted, but happy about the experience.

Upon his return to the States, Darryl F. Zanuck offered Granger a two-picture deal, and in quick succession he made &quot;The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing&quot; co-starring Ray Milland and Joan Collins, in which he portrayed tycoon Harry Kendall Thaw, and &quot;The Naked Street&quot;, a melodrama the actor thought was &quot;preachy, trite and pedestrian&quot;, although he welcomed the opportunity to work with Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft. Both films were released in 1955.

The same year, Granger moved to New York and began studying with Bob Fosse, Gloria Vanderbilt, James Kirkwood, and Tom Tryon in a class taught by Sandy Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. During this period, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Carefree Tree&quot;, a play with music based on an old Chinese legend. The cast included Janice Rule as Granger&#x27;s love interest, and Alvin Ailey, Frances Sternhagen, Jerry Stiller, and Sada Thompson in supporting roles. The play closed after only 24 performances, but shortly after its demise, Rule moved in with Granger, and before long they were making wedding plans. They gradually realized the love their characters had felt on stage actually had not carried over into real life, and the two went their separate ways, although they remained friends until her death in 2003.

With both his film and theatrical career foundering, Granger turned to television. His dramatic TV debut came when he appeared in &quot;Splendid With Swords&quot;, an episode of &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; in 1955. He starred in &quot;Beyond This Place&quot; (1957), an adaptation of the A.J. Cronin 1950 novel of the same title, with Shelley Winters and Peggy Ann Garner, and joined Julie Harris for a 1961 remake of &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949). He also was featured in episodes of &quot;Climax Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, and in later years &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, among others.

In 1959, Granger returned to Broadway as Fitzwilliam Darcy opposite Polly Bergen as Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;First Impressions&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; with a book and direction by Abe Burrows. The tryout in New Haven was a disaster, and reviews were mixed. Things improved slightly during the Philadelphia run, but by the time the production reached New York, Bergen – who was fighting bitterly with co-star Hermione Gingold – was experiencing serious vocal problems, and some of her songs would be cut during each performance, creating confusion for the rest of the cast. Only two of seven critics wrote favorable reviews, Bergen was replaced by understudy Ellen Hanley, and the musical closed in less than three months. Later that year, he was cast in &quot;The Warm Peninsula&quot;, a play by Joe Masteroff. Co-starring Julie Harris, June Havoc, and Larry Hagman, it received fair reviews but closed after only 86 performances.

==Later career==
Despite his three unsuccessful Broadway experiences, Granger continued to focus on theater in the early 1960s. He accepted an invitation from Eva Le Gallienne to join her National Repertory Theatre. During their first season, while the company was in Philadelphia, John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The President had attended NRT&#x27;s opening night and post-performance gala in the nation&#x27;s capital, so the news hit everyone in the company especially hard. Granger had become a close friend of production supervisor Robert Calhoun, and although both had felt a mutual attraction, they never had discussed it. That night they became lovers.

Granger finally achieved some success on Broadway in &quot;The Seagull&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, and &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. He starred opposite Barbara Cook in a revival of &quot;The King and I&quot; at the off-Broadway New York City Center, and in 1979 he was cast in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. In 1986 he won the Obie Award for his performance in the Lanford Wilson play &quot;Talley &amp; Son&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Granger and Calhoun moved to Rome, where the actor made a series of Italian language films, most notably the Spaghetti Western &quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; (1970) and the giallo film &quot;What Have They Done to Your Daughters?&quot; (1974), alongside Mario Adorf, which was directed by Massimo Dallamano. He appeared in an episode of the ABC police drama &quot;Nakia&quot; in 1974 and also appeared on several soap operas, including &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1976, on which his portrayal of Will Vernon garnered him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; in 1979, and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1987–1988, produced by Calhoun.

Later he appeared in several documentaries discussing Hollywood in general and Alfred Hitchcock in particular. In 1995, he was interviewed on camera for &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, discussing the depiction of homosexuality in film and the use of subtext in various films, including his own.

In 2003, Granger made his last film appearance in the documentary &quot;&quot;. In it, he tells the story of leaving Hollywood at the peak of his fame, buying out his contract from Samuel Goldwyn, and moving to Manhattan to work on the Broadway stage.

In 2007, Granger published the memoir &quot;Include Me Out&quot;, co-written with domestic partner Robert Calhoun (born November 24, 1930). In the book, named after one of Goldwyn&#x27;s famous malapropisms, he freely discusses his career and personal life.

==Death==
Granger died of natural causes in his Manhattan apartment on March 27, 2011, at age 85. His body was cremated and his ashes given to family after a service at The Riverside restaurant.

==Legacy==
For his contribution to television, Granger has a star located at 1551 Vine Street on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>The Texas Air National Guard (TX ANG) is the aerial militia of the U.S. state of Texas. It is a reserve of the United States Air Force and part of the Texas National Guard, alongside the Texas Army National Guard. No element of the Texas Air National Guard is under United States Air Force command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Texas through the office of the Texas Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Texas Air National Guard is headquartered at Camp Mabry, Austin, and its chief of staff is Brigadier General Matthew Barker.

Under the &quot;Total Force&quot; concept, Texas Air National Guard units are considered to be an Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Texas ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Texas Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.

Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Texas ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense.

==History==

The Texas Air National Guard origins date to 14 August 1917 with the establishment of the 111th Aero Squadron as part of the World War I United States Army Air Service. The 111th served at Kelly Field, San Antonio, then after the 1918 Armistice with Germany was demobilized in 1919.

The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on organization of National Guard air units.

The unit was reorganized with the establishment of a permanent air service in 1920, forming in the old Houston Light Guard Armory. The 111th Observation Squadron received Federal Recognition on 29 June 1923, as part of the 36th Division, Texas Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 111th Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 25 November 1940 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II.

On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.

The modern Texas ANG received federal recognition on 27 January 1947 as the 136th Fighter Group at Love Field Airport, Dallas. It&#x27;s 181st Fighter Squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. Other units assigned to the 136th in 1947 were the 111th Fighter Squadron at Ellington Field, Houston, and the 182d Fighter Squadron at Kelly Field, San Antonio. They were also equipped with F-51D Mustangs. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Texas Air National Guard&#x27;s official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act.

On 1 July 1957 the 111th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Houston was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 147th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. On 1 August 1961 the 182d FIS in San Antonio was expanded to become the 149th Fighter-Interceptor Group.

Today, the 136th Airlift Wing (136 AW) provides global airlift for Air Mobility Command; the 147th Attack Wing (147 AW) flies the MQ-9 Reaper reconnaissance/strike RPA and the 149th Fighter Wing (149 FW) flies the Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon tactical fighter-bomber.

From 2001 through 2007, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Texas were activated in support of the Global War on Terror. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Qatar, Israel, and other locations throughout Southwest Asia. Additionally, in 2005 elements of all the units were activated to provide relief after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.

<doc id="961567" wikidata="Q437667" url="?curid=961567" title="Jo Ann Emerson">
<text>Jo Ann Emerson (née Hermann; born September 16, 1950) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1996 to 2013. The district consists of Southeast and South Central Missouri and includes the Bootheel, the Lead Belt and the Ozarks. Emerson is a member of the Republican Party. On January 22, 2013, Emerson resigned her seat in Congress to become the president and chief executive officer of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. She was CEO until August 2015.

With the defeat of Congressman Ike Skelton, Emerson became the dean of Missouri&#x27;s congressional delegation in 2011.

==Early life, education and career==
She was born Jo Ann Hermann in Bethesda, Maryland. She was a daughter of Al Hermann, who played for the Boston Braves baseball team from 1923 to 1924 and was executive director of the Republican National Committee. She graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government (Chairwoman)
** Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch (Vice Chair)

===Other memberships===
* Vice President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly
** Vice Chair of the Subcommittee on Democratic Governance
* Vice Chair of the Center Aisle Caucus
* Honorary and Life Trustee of Westminster College
* Co-chair of the board of directors for the Congressional Hunger Center
* Founding Member of the Bipartisan Congressional Retreat

Emerson, whose voting record in Congress has established her as one of the more moderate Republicans, has a history of bipartisanship while in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was a member of the moderate Republican groups the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Tuesday Group.

On May 24, 2005, Emerson was one of 50 Republicans to vote in favor of overturning President George W. Bush&#x27;s ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. She cast her &quot;yea&quot; vote the day after her mother-in-law died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, one of the illnesses for which scientists believe they can create better treatments from stem cell research.

On July 12, 2007, Emerson was one of only four Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008.

On September 15, 2009, Emerson was one of seven House Republicans to vote in favor of the Democrats&#x27; proposed resolution to condemn U.S. Representative Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) for shouting &quot;You lie!&quot; in the middle of President Barack Obama&#x27;s joint address to the U.S. Congress on health care reform.

Her margins of victory in the district have always been higher than those of GOP presidential candidates George W. Bush and John McCain as well as Republican gubernatorial candidates Kenny Hulshof, Matt Blunt and Jim Talent.

Emerson announced in early December 2012 her plans to retire from Congress in February 2013 to assume a position with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) as its president and chief executive officer.

==Political campaigns==
When her husband Bill died in 1996, Jo Ann announced she would run for his vacant seat. However, Missouri state law prohibited her from filing in the Republican primary for the general election. She thus had her party membership suspended. In November, Jo Ann Emerson competed in two elections on the same day. She ran as a Republican against Democrat Emily Firebaugh in the special election to finish the last two months of her late husband&#x27;s eighth term, and as an independent against Democrat Firebaugh and Republican Richard Kline in the general election for a full two-year term. She won both elections easily, and was then reelected seven times without serious difficulty. She is the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. Congress from Missouri. She served the last two months of her husband&#x27;s term as a Republican, then as an independent caucusing with the Republicans before officially becoming a Republican again at the onset of the new Congress in 1997. She was briefly the first independent elected to federal office in Missouri in 122 years and is the first, and so far only, woman to be elected and serve in Congress as an independent or third party member.

==Post-political career==
In August 2015, Emerson took a leave of absence from the NRECA for medical reasons and was succeeded by her former congressional chief of staff and chief operating officer, Jeffrey Connor, in an interim capacity in November, effectively stepping down. In June 2016, fellow former U.S. House colleague Jim Matheson was named to succeed Emerson as CEO and took over her post in July. In March 2017, Emerson received the Clyde T. Ellis Award, the highest honor bestowed on an individual by America&#x27;s electric cooperatives. On her behalf, her husband, Ron Gladney, accepted the award.

==Personal life==
Hermann married future U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, a Republican from Cape Girardeau, on June 22, 1975. They had two daughters; Jo Ann also has five stepdaughters and a stepson. Bill was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1980 from Missouri&#x27;s 10th Congressional District and, subsequent to redistricting, was reelected in 1982 from the 8th District. He died from cancer on June 22, 1996, a few months before the end of his eighth term. The Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge, which links Missouri to Illinois across the Mississippi River, was dedicated to commemorate his efforts to obtain federal funding for its construction.

Following Bill&#x27;s death, Jo Ann married Ron Gladney in 2000. From this marriage she gained two stepdaughters and a stepson.

In 2015, Emerson had a stroke, leaving her paralyzed from the neck down. In April 2020, while living in a retirement community in Washington, D.C., she tested positive COVID-19 amid the pandemic and has recovered since.

<doc id="961575" wikidata="Q978959" url="?curid=961575" title="Edwin O'Connor">
<text>Edwin Greene O&#x27;Connor (July 29, 1918 – March 23, 1968) was an American journalist, novelist, and radio commentator. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1962 for his novel &quot;The Edge of Sadness&quot; (1961). His ancestry was Irish, and his novels concerned the Irish-American experience and often dealt with the lives of politicians and priests.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Connor was born to a medical doctor in Providence, Rhode Island, but was raised in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He was an alumnus of La Salle Academy and the University of Notre Dame. After graduation, he served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. 
In 1946 he began working as a freelance author, selling his stories and reports to numerous magazines, including &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

==Writing career==
During the 1950s O&#x27;Connor began a career as a television critic for two Boston newspapers, a profession he would follow for the remainder of his life. He also published his first novel, &quot;The Oracle&quot; (1951).

Soon afterward, he published the novel for which he is most remembered, &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1956). The novel concerns a Boston Irish politician, Frank Skeffington, as related by a nephew whom he invites to accompany him on what is an eventually unsuccessful reelection campaign. Skeffington has a gentlemanly manner, lacing his talk with literary quotations. He is slightly corrupt but delivers service to his constituents. He is an expert at balancing the claims of the various Boston-area ethnic groups. However, his time has passed, and he loses the election. While it is not a roman à clef, there is some similarity between the novel&#x27;s Skeffington and the real life Boston Mayor James Michael Curley. The novel was adapted for film in 1958, with John Ford directing a screenplay by Frank S. Nugent. Starring Spencer Tracy, Jeffrey Hunter, and Donald Crisp, the film was not a commercial success. However, as Charles Fanning notes, &quot;The windfall profits from &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; made O&#x27;Connor for the first time financially secure.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1962 for his next novel, &quot;The Edge of Sadness&quot; (Little, Brown, 1961). It is the story of a middle-aged priest in an unnamed New England city with a cathedral that is probably modeled on Providence, his birthplace.

&quot;I Was Dancing&quot; (1964) is a novel about an aging vaudevillian who tries to become reacquainted with his son after twenty years of casual neglect.

His last novel, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, appeared in 1966. (It has no relation at all to the later television series of the same name.) It is a story of a Massachusetts family with a father who has political ambitions for his sons. As with &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;, it is not a roman à clef but the clan is certainly reminiscent of the Kennedy family. &quot;Edwin O&#x27;Connor, the author of &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;, summed up the era in his final novel, &quot;All in the Family&quot;: &#x27;Corruption here had a shoddy, penny-ante quality it did not have in other states...Here everything was up for grabs and nothing was too small to steal...In our politics there seemed to be a depthless cushion of street-corner cynicism, a special kind of tainted, small-time fellowship which sent out a complex of vines and shoots so interconnected that even the sleaziest poolroom bookie managed, in some way, however obscure, to be in touch with the mayor&#x27;s office or the governor&#x27;s chair.&#x27;&quot;

O&#x27;Connor died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1968.

==Legacy==
Published posthumously in 1970 was &quot;The Best and the Last of Edwin O&#x27;Connor&quot;, which included excerpts from his published novels, fragments of unpublished works, articles written by him, and a lecture transcript. The book&#x27;s introduction was written by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.

He is remembered for coining the phrase &quot;the last hurrah&quot;. The Omni Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts features a bar named &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;.

<text>An inspector general is an investigative official in a civil or military organization. The plural of the term is &quot;inspectors general&quot;.

==Australia==
The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (Australia) (IGIS) is an independent statutory office holder who reviews the activities of the six Australian intelligence agencies under IGIS jurisdiction.

The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force conducts internal reviews of administrative action, investigates Service Police professional standards breaches and other significant incidents including Service deaths, and reviews and audits the operation of the military justice system independently of the chain of command. The Inspector-General Australian Defence Force is appointed by the Minister for Defence.

==Bangladesh==
The chief of police of Bangladesh is known as the inspector general of police. He is from the Bangladesh Civil Service police cadre. The current inspector general of police is Dr. Benazir Ahmed, and his predecessor was Dr. Javed Patwary. There is another temporary post of inspector general of police, known as &quot;Pulish Shômônnoyôk&quot; () or &quot;police coordinator&quot;, currently held by Bivuti Vooshon Choudhury.

==Canada==
Before 1867, the position of Inspector General of Canada existed as the minister responsible for finances and government spending in the Province of Canada. After 1867 the position was assumed as the Minister of Finance. Alexander Galt served as the last Inspector General from 1858 to 1867 and the first Minister of Finance in 1867.

==Colombia==

Colombia&#x27;s inspector general is a unique post with broad powers to investigate government malfeasance and to bar public officials from running for office.

==France==

In the French Civil Service, an inspector general (&quot;inspecteur général&quot;) is a member of a body of civil servants known as &quot;inspection générale&quot;, generally of a high level, charged with a nationwide mission to inspect some specific services and provide government officials with advice regarding that service. Most ministries have their own inspectorates general, including for instance:
* &quot;Inspection Générale des Finances&quot; (IGF; Ministry of Finances)
* &quot;Inspection Générale des Affaires Sociales&quot; (IGAS; Social Security)
* &quot;&quot; (IGA; various administrative departments, e.g. prefectures)
* &quot;Inspection générale de l&#x27;Éducation, du Sport et de la Recherche&quot; (Ministries of National Education, Youth and Sport, and Higher Education and Research)

The &quot;inspection générale des Finances&quot; is particularly prestigious as a job appointment after studies at the &quot;École Nationale d&#x27;Administration&quot;. In recent decades, many of its members have occupied various high positions in lieu of their traditional mission of inspection. The corps has come under increased criticism for this.

Within the uniformed services, &quot;inspector general&quot; can refer to both a rank (especially within the police) and a job title within an inspectorate general, the best known of which are:

* Within the &quot;Inspection générale des Armées&quot; (Inspectorate General for the Armed Forces):
** the Inspector General of the Gendarmerie (&quot;Inspecteur général de la gendarmerie nationale&quot;);
** the Inspector General of the Army (&quot;Inspecteur général de l&#x27;Armée de Terre&quot;);
** the Inspector General of the Navy (&quot;Inspecteur général de la Marine&quot;);
** the Inspector General of the Air Force (&quot;Inspecteur général de l&#x27;Armée de l&#x27;air et de l&#x27;espace&quot;);
** the Inspector General of Armament (&quot;Inspecteur général de la Direction générale de l&#x27;armement);&quot;
** the Inspector General of the Health Service (&quot;Inspecteur général du Service de santé des Armées&quot;)
* Within civilian uniformed services:
** the Inspector General of Police (&quot;Inspecteur général de la Police nationale&quot;);
** the Inspector General of Civil Defence (&quot;Inspecteur général de la Sécurité civile&quot;).

Despite often similar names and an apparently similar structure, different inspectorates general often have significantly differing roles.

==Germany==
During World War II, Colonel General Heinz Guderian was appointed inspector general of armoured troops on 1 March 1943, reporting directly to Adolf Hitler.

Since the reestablishment of German armed forces after World War II, the inspector general of the federal armed forces (&quot;Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr&quot;) has been the highest-ranking soldier (four star or full general in rank), responsible for the overall military planning and the principal military advisor to the federal minister of defense and the federal government. As professional head of the Armed Forces, his position is broadly equivalent to that of the British Chief of the Defence Staff.

In the system of German police forces (Bundespolizei, Landespolizei, and the German Parliament Police), the highest-ranking riot police officer is called inspector of the federal police (&quot;Inspekteur der Bereitschaftspolizeien der Länder&quot;), although this position is a more coordinating than commanding one. All of the sixteen German state police forces have an inspector, usually as the highest-ranking uniformed police officer. The state police commanders-in-chief (&quot;Landespolizeipräsidenten&quot;&#x27;) are very often not genuine police officers but recruited from administrative personnel. The competence for police services in Germany is in general assigned to the federal states of Germany. The federal police is a coordinating police department with a number of narrowly defined competences, e.g. in border control, airport and trial security as well as protection of German embassies abroad.

In the scope of responsibility of the state police departments, the federal police can only act with permission, or request of the local state police.

==India==

During the British rule in India, in 1861, the British Government introduced the Indian Councils Act 1861. The act created a new cadre of police, called Superior Police Services, later known as the Indian Imperial Police. The highest rank in the service was the Inspector General.

Currently, in modern India, the inspector general of police or joint commissioner of police is a two-star rank officer and one of the most senior officers in the state police forces. All inspectors general and joint commissioners in state police forces are Indian Police Service officers. They are in some states the commissioner of police for the city, that is they head a police force for a particular city. Inspectors general in Central Armed Police Forces (BSF, CISF, CRPF, SSB, ITBP) are either Indian Police Service (IPS) officers or directly appointed gazetted officers (DAGOs), who are directly appointed Assistant Commandants (through UPSC entrance test from the year 2005 onwards). The rank insignia of an inspector general of police or joint commissioner of police is one star above a crossed sword and baton.

The Indian Coast Guard also has the rank of inspector general. The coast guard regions are commanded by officers of the rank of inspector general.

==Norway==
The army&#x27;s inspector general (&quot;generalinspektøren for hæren&quot;—GIH) is the immediate superior of the commanding officer of special forces FSK.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the inspector general of police or provincial police officer is a three-star rank who heads the police force of a province. The inspector general of police (IGP) is a Police Service of Pakistan officer, appointed by the federal government with consent of the provincial chief minister. The rank insignia of an inspector general of police is the national emblem or one pip containing the national emblem above a crossed sword and baton worn on both shoulder flashes.

==Poland==
The office of General Inspector of the Armed Forces existed in the Second Polish Republic and was held by, among others, Józef Piłsudski.

==Romania==
In Romania, inspector general is the title given to the head of the Romanian Police, Romanian Border Police, Romanian Gendarmerie and the Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations (whose central commands are called &quot;general inspectorates&quot;). The rank of &quot;General inspector&quot; was also used by the Royal Romanian Air Force during World War II.

==Russia/Soviet Union==
The Office of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was established in 2008, and consists of around thirty retired senior officers. The main task of the office is &quot;to promote the organization of combat and operational training of troops, the construction and further development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the development of the theory and history of military art, and the education of personnel.&quot; It is the successor to the Soviet Armed Forces&#x27;s Group of Inspectors General, which was dissolved in 1992.

==Sweden==
In the Swedish Armed Forces the inspector general (&quot;generalinspektör&quot; or &quot;truppslagsinspektör&quot;) was the highest official for a military branch or combat arm. The first arm to have an inspector general was the artillery where the Master-General of the Ordnance had this function since 1634. Inspector general of the cavalry and inspector general of the service troops was founded in the 19th century. The infantry did not get an inspector general until 1914. The engineer troops and signal troops followed in 1937 and a surgeon general in 1941. In 1941 the commander of the coastal artillery was also renamed inspector general of the coastal artillery.

In 1998 the previous inspectors general were abolished and the commanders of the major branches (army, air force and navy) was renamed &quot;inspector general&quot;, renamed again to &quot;branch inspector&quot; in 2003 to resume the title commander in 2014.

== Turkey ==
In Turkey the office of an Inspector General was created in 1927 and disestablished in 1952. He ruled with martial law and over all military, juridical and civilian matters.

==United Kingdom==

===Military===
In the British tradition, an inspector general is usually a senior military officer responsible for the inspection of military units to ensure that they meet appropriate standards of training and efficiency. Unlike American inspectors general, they do not usually have an investigative or law enforcement function.

For many years the Royal Air Force maintained a post of inspector general.

===Police===
The commanding officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary (and later of the Royal Ulster Constabulary until replaced by chief constable) and many Commonwealth police forces also bore the title of inspector general of police and it is still used in India and some other former British territories.

The inspector general is also the name given to the chief executive officer of the Insolvency Service.

Inspector and variants of it are rank titles of officers in the police of Britain and most Commonwealth countries.

==United States==

In the United States, an inspector general leads an organization charged with examining the actions of a government agency, military organization, or military contractor as a general auditor of their operations to ensure they are operating in compliance with generally established policies of the government, to audit the effectiveness of security procedures, or to discover the possibility of misconduct, waste, fraud, theft, or certain types of criminal activity by individuals or groups related to the agency&#x27;s operation, usually involving some misuse of the organization&#x27;s funds or credit. In the United States, there are numerous offices of inspector general at the federal, state, and local levels; the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Army is a military example.

The framework of offices of inspector general within the United States government was established with the Inspector General Act of 1978.

==Vatican City==
In the Vatican City State, the inspector general is the commanding officer of the state police force, the Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City. He is also the chief bodyguard for the pope, and accompanies the pontiff when he visits foreign countries.

<text>United States Lines was an organization of the United States Shipping Board&#x27;s (USSB) Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC), created to operate German liners seized by the United States in 1917. The ships were owned by the USSB and all finances of the line were controlled by the EFC. Among the notable ships of this period was , a contender for largest ship in the world for a time.

Eventually the line was sold and went private to continue operating as a transatlantic shipping company that operated cargo services from 1921 to 1989, and ocean liners until 1969—most famously, .

==1920s==

United States Lines was the trade name of the United States Shipping Board&#x27;s Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) organization created to operate the large German liners seized by the United States in 1917. By 1925 the corporation operated ex-German liners &quot;Leviathan&quot;, , , and the USSB built ships and in service between New York and Europe. On 15 November 1921 the line began operating from piers 3 and 4 at the USSB&#x27;s Hoboken Terminal which had been the Hamburg America Line facilities in Hoboken, New Jersey seized by the United States and, during the war, operated by the Army as the Hoboken Port of Embarkation. The USSB engaged in advertising of the line and its ships through agencies using a &quot;coupon&quot; system to collect names and addresses of interested persons for direct mailings. All the line&#x27;s funds were managed by the USSB Treasurer.
The line started with three ships from the tonnage of the failed United States Mail Steamship Company. One of the founders was Kermit Roosevelt, son of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Two of the ships, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot;, were originally German vessels that had been seized during World War I and kept as reparations. Both &quot;America&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot; made New York–Bremen runs, while &quot;Centennial State&quot; ran from New York to London.

The line became well known in the 1920s when two valiant historic rescues were made using their ships &quot;President Roosevelt&quot; in 1926 and &quot;America&quot; in 1929 by Captain George Fried.

More ships were acquired in 1922 and renamed after US presidents. The 52,000-ton , formerly &quot;Vaterland&quot; and one of the largest liners in the world, was acquired in 1923.

Throughout the 1920s, the line accumulated debt, and in March 1929, the line was sold to P.W. Chapman Company, and reorganized as the &quot;United States Lines Inc.&quot; of Delaware. The stock market crash made matters worse, and in 1931, the remaining ships were sold to &quot;United States Lines Company&quot; of Nevada. Later in 1931, United States Lines was acquired by the Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine Company, which had been formed earlier in the year from the merger of the Roosevelt Steamship Company and International Mercantile Marine Co.

==1930s==
In 1932, , at a cost of approximately $21 million, became the first ship actually built for the line, followed the next year by . In 1940, a new joined them.

In 1932, United States Lines had offered to build a new passenger liner, called &quot;U.S. Express Liner&quot;, which would also double as a mail ship, and would dramatically decrease the time of delivery for trans-Atlantic mail by catapulting an aircraft when it was within range. Congress refused to give a guarantee on trans-Atlantic postal rates and it was never built.

During the 1930s, United States Lines&#x27; ailing parent company, Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine, began winding down its other operations and merging several of its divisions into United States Lines. United States Lines absorbed the American Line in 1932, the Baltimore Mail Line in 1937, and the American Merchant Line in 1938.

==1940s==
The decade started with United States Lines absorbing the Roosevelt Line in 1940, leaving United States Lines as Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine&#x27;s sole operating business. Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine Company finally changed its name to &quot;United States Lines Inc.&quot; in 1942, reflecting its new focus.

In World War II, the ships were converted into troopships. &quot;Manhattan&quot; became , and &quot;Washington&quot; became . The flagship &quot;America&quot; became the After the war, the company began to build smaller and cheaper ships, and operated a number of cargo ships, all named beginning with &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Pioneer&quot;.

===Duquesne Spy Ring===

In 1941, two Nazi spies, Franz Joseph Stigler and Erwin Wilhelm Siegler, worked for United States Lines as members of SS &quot;America&quot;″s crew. While on &quot;America&quot;, they obtained information about the movement of ships and military defense preparations at the Panama Canal, observed and reported defense preparations in the Canal Zone, and met with other German agents to advise them in their espionage pursuits. They operated as couriers, transmitting information between the United States and German agents aboard. Stigler worked undercover as the chief butcher. Both remained on &quot;America&quot; until the US Navy converted her into USS &quot;West Point&quot;.

Stigler and Siegler, along with the 31 other German agents of the Duquesne Spy Ring, were later uncovered by the FBI in the largest espionage conviction in US history. Stigler was sentenced to serve 16 years in prison on espionage charges with two concurrent years for registration violations; Siegler was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on espionage charges and a concurrent 2-year term for violation of the Registration Act.

==Expansion and bankruptcy==
With a government subsidy for her construction, entered service in 1952. She holds the record as the largest ocean liner built in the United States and the fastest ocean liner ever built. She immediately set transatlantic speed records, capturing the Blue Riband from . But competition from airliners brought the glory days to an end; in 1964, &quot;America&quot; was sold to Chandris Line, and &quot;United States&quot; was withdrawn from service in 1969.

After the termination of passenger services, United States Lines continued to operate as a container ship line, being bought by containerization pioneer Malcom McLean in 1978. By the 1980s, the line operated 43 vessels and was a leader in international shipping. It spent over billion in rapidly expanding its fleet and acquiring two competitors, Moore-McCormack Lines and Delta Steamship Lines. In expectation of a worldwide surge in oil prices, United States Lines borrowed heavily to construct a new class of 12 fuel-efficient container ships known as the Jumbo Econships that, at over 57,000 gross tons, were the largest cargo ships yet built. Just as the new vessels were delivered, international freight rates fell and oil prices collapsed to near historic lows. The giant and slow Econships left United States Lines overcapacity, deeply in debt, and unable to compete with faster ships that were once again economically viable. Straining under the debt accumulated by the fleet expansion, the company filed for bankruptcy on 24 November 1986 in one of the largest bankruptcies in US history at the time. Most of the vessels were sold to pay creditors and in the reorganization plan filed on 5 July 1988, the company was formally liquidated by 1992.

==Legacy==
Pursuant to the revised reorganization plan approved by the bankruptcy court in 1989, United States Lines Inc. was restructured as Janus Industries Inc. in November 1990, with its shares distributed to United States Lines creditors and the court-managed bankruptcy trust fund. The company&#x27;s new management spent several years searching for new business opportunities, finally acquiring Pre-Tek Wireline Service Company, a provider of services to the oil, gas, and logging industries in 1996. In 1997, Janus acquired a number of hospitality assets from companies affiliated with the investors Louis S. Beck and Harry Yeaggy, gaining ownership of 6 hotels, an 85% interest in a 7th hotel, a management company operating another 21 hotels, a fee-sharing joint venture with another management company on another property, and control of two mortgaged-backed loans. Beck and Yeaggy gained control of 43% of Janus Industries, and the former United States Lines decided to concentrate exclusively on the hotel business. Pre-Tek Wireline was spun off to its management in 1998 and Janus Industries changed its name again to Janus Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. in 1999.

United States Lines&#x27; successor company now controls hotels and resorts in 21 states.

The name &quot;United States Lines&quot; was revived briefly in 2000 and 2001, as a brand name of American Classic Voyages, operating cruises in Hawaii with a single ship, MS &quot;Patriot&quot;, formerly Holland America Line&#x27;s &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;. Construction had begun in 2000 on the future , and a 72,000-ton sister ship as part of Project America, but in October 2001, the company filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. The two unfinished vessels were acquired by Norwegian Cruise Line for their new NCL America division, while &quot;Patriot&quot; was repossessed by Holland America.

A new container shipping services company called US Lines LLC (Not related to the original company in any way) was established in Santa Ana, California in 2003 by CMA CGM. However, the company announced on December 6, 2016, that US Lines would be phased out and re-branded as ANL.
Several piers in New York City remain as artifacts left behind by the company. Pier 76, United States Lines Terminal, was constructed as a cargo pier on West Side Highway at what was then the foot of 36th Street, and is now in use by Classic Car Club Manhattan, who took over the pier&#x27;s lease from the NYPD in April 2016. Neon letters spelling &quot;United States Lines&quot; are located on the west side of the pier, facing New Jersey. One letter, &quot;I&quot;, on the sign was working until sometime in the 2000s. The sign can be seen by the arriving NY Waterway ferry passengers or those taking the New York Circle Line water tour of Manhattan. The pier head building facing the street is also marked with the Line&#x27;s name, at each end. Pier 86, United States Lines&#x27; passenger pier, still exists, although the pier building has been demolished. The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum is now based there, with permanently berthed at the pier. In Newport News, Virginia, where many of the United States Lines ships were built, one of the huge propellers from &quot;United States&quot; is on display at the entrance of the Mariners&#x27; Museum.

On February 4, 2016, Crystal Cruises announced a proposal to re-activate the former flagship of the United States Lines, SS &quot;United States&quot;, for passenger service. Crystal signed a purchase option for the ship and will cover docking costs in Philadelphia for nine months while it conducts a feasibility study. However, Crystal Cruise backed out in August 2016 due to challenges.

On December 10, 2018, the conservancy announced an agreement with the commercial real estate firm RXR Realty, of New York City, to explore options for restoring and redeveloping the ocean liner. In 2015, RXR had expressed interest in developing an out-of-commission ocean liner as a hotel and event venue at Pier 57 in New York. The conservancy requires that any redevelopment plan preserve the ship&#x27;s profile and exterior design, and include approximately for an onboard museum. RXR&#x27;s press release about the &quot;United States&quot; stated that multiple locations would be considered, depending on the viability of restoration plans.

<text>David Walter Chomiak (born February 15, 1953) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Greg Selinger.

Chomiak was born in Winnipeg and grew up in East Kildonan, graduating from Miles Macdonell Collegiate; he lives in the West Kildonan area. He worked as a lawyer before entering politics, and was a member of the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre, the Canadian Shield Foundation and the Big Brother&#x27;s Association of Manitoba.

Chomiak was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1990 provincial election, in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate David Langtry by 210 votes; Progressive Party leader Sidney Green finished fourth. After the election, Chomiak joined with 19 other NDP MLAs as the official opposition to Gary Filmon&#x27;s government.

Chomiak was re-elected in the 1995 election, defeating Tory Robert Praznik 5812 votes to 3624. He again increased his margin of victory in the 1999 election, defeating PC candidate Shannon Martin by 6101 votes to 2542. The NDP won this election, and Chomiak was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Health and Minister responsible for Sport. He was relieved of responsibility for Sport on January 17, 2001.

In 2003, Chomiak supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

In 2003, he was re-elected in the once-marginal riding of Kildonan with over 70% of the vote. On October 12, 2004, he was appointed as Manitoba&#x27;s Minister of Energy, Science and Technology, with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act and the Manitoba Hydro Act. Chomiak had been the longest-serving health minister in Canada prior to this shuffle, and there were rumours that he requested a transfer to a less stressful portfolio.

In September 2006, Chomiak was appointed as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, and to the Manitoba Public Insurance and Manitoba Gaming Control Commission in Gary Doer&#x27;s new cabinet.

Chomiak is anti-abortion, but as health minister never sought to criminalize abortions. He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

In the 2016 provincial election, he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Nic Curry.

<doc id="961586" wikidata="Q1624406" url="?curid=961586" title="Tawa, New Zealand">
<text>Tawa is the northernmost suburb within the Wellington city boundary, located roughly 15 km north of Wellington&#x27;s CBD between Churton Park and Porirua in the North Island of New Zealand. It takes its name from the broadleaf tree, which was once prolific throughout the area, although its most famous tree is the Bucket Tree, a large macrocarpa with the topiary of an upside-down bucket. Tawa is also known for its large number of churches, representing a wide range of Christian denominations.

Within Tawa, there are a number of named areas: Lindenvale, Westhaven, Redwood and Southgate to the west and Linden, Greenacres and Sundale to the east of the central Tawa area.

==Geography and transportation==
Tawa lies in a wide section of a roughly north/south valley which opens up on the north into the Porirua Basin. The valley is about 4.5 km in length (north-south) and 2.5 km wide (east-west). The Belmont range, to the east, separates the Tawa valley from the Hutt Valley, while the Ohariu Valley is located to the west of Tawa. The northern entrance to Tawa is where Kenepuru Drive becomes Main Road, and its southern entrance is the Tawa exit of the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway (State Highway 1). The Porirua Stream flows northwards along the valley, fed by a number of tributaries, including the Takapu Stream.

Loosely following the path of the Porirua Stream through the valley is the North Island Main Trunk line; the Kapiti Line of the Wellington suburban railway, operated by Transdev Wellington (under the trading name Metlink). Slightly to the east, the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway, a dual-carriageway section of State Highway 1, follows a similar path. Both have played an important role in the suburb&#x27;s development and in providing access. The literally named Main Road runs down the centre of the suburb and provides access to the smaller suburban streets. Main Road and Kenepuru Drive were part of State Highway 1 before the building of the motorway in the 1950s.

Tawa has five suburban passenger railway-stations: Kenepuru, Linden, Tawa, Redwood and Takapu Road. A significant number of commuters travel daily by train into the Wellington CBD to work. As a result, trains are a significant component of Tawa&#x27;s public transport, but the suburb is also served by a bus route linking Porirua and Johnsonville. Despite these bus and train services, a substantial area on Tawa&#x27;s fringes remains over 400 metres from public transport, particularly in Redwood, Greenacres and Linden. Measured this way, while the parts of Tawa near the railway and Main Road are among the best-served suburbs in Wellington in terms of public transport, these areas on the fringes are among the worst served. As a result, park-and-ride facilities provided at Takapu Road, Redwood, and Tawa railway stations are normally full on weekdays and parking near Linden station is at a premium, with all on-street parks close to the station occupied.

In 2009 the Wellington City Council commenced work on a shared pedestrian/cycle trail through Tawa to Porirua City Centre. The trail comprises a combination of new paths following the Porirua Stream and rail corridor, and some widened existing footpaths. The Wellington City section of the trail, between Takapu Road railway station in the south and Kenepuru railway station in the north, was completed in 2013. The Porirua City section of the trail was built on an existing unsealed trail and completed about March 2014.

==Name origin and local government==
Before 1959, &quot;Tawa&quot; was known as &quot;Tawa Flat&quot;, thought to be a reference to the Tawa trees that grew there and the flat and arable floor of the valley as it widened out in the Tawa area. The first known use of the name &quot;Tawa Flat&quot; was by John Woodman who used it as his address in the electoral roll for the Wellington Country District, published in the &quot;Wellington Provincial Gazette&quot; of 28 August 1854. As others living in the area gave their address in the 1854 roll as &quot;Porirua Road&quot;, it is possible that John Woodman was the originator of the name.

When New Zealand became a separate Colony from New South Wales in 1841, the royal charter established three provinces. The Tawa area became part of New Munster which included that part of the North Island south of the Patea River and the whole of the South Island. In 1846 the British Parliament passed the first constitution act, the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 which reformed the provinces and the Tawa area became part of New Ulster which now included all of the North Island. The provinces were reformed again with the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 which established six provinces with Tawa included in the Wellington Province. Provincial Government was abolished in 1876 and replaced with 36 borough councils and 63 county councils. The Tawa area became part of the Porirua Riding of the Hutt County, formed in 1877. The Hutt County covered all the area south of the Waikanae River and West of the Remutaka Ranges that lay outside of Wellington City. As the population of local areas grew, a number of local boroughs were split off from the Hutt County. In 1908, a smaller Makara County with offices in Porirua was formed from the Mākara and Porirua Ridings or the south-western part of the Hutt County. The new Makara County included Porirua, Tītahi Bay, and Tawa Flat, and all of the area to the south lying to the west of Wellington City outside the areas covered by Wellington City and the new and independent boroughs of Miramar, Karori, Onslow, and Johnsonville.

In 1939, northern Tawa valley residents seeking to give a separate name to the northern part of the Tawa district met. They chose &quot;Linden&quot;, from &quot;Linden Vale&quot;, the name of the home of Mr Stuart Duncan, but originally named by Mr. Charles Duncan, a nurseryman. The name &quot;Linden&quot; was adopted in 1940 and the first Linden railway station was opened on 30 April 1941. In 1948, the Tawa Flat and Linden Progressive Associations and Porirua interests, led by Arthur Carman and Percy Clark, made a representation to the Local Government Commission asking for a single borough covering the whole of the Porirua Basin.

The commission did not accept this proposal but responded by giving the Tawa Flat-Linden area the status of a town district able to elect its own town board. A roll of 1,700 electors was compiled and on 16 May 1951 the first town board was elected. Urbanisation and population growth continued in the Tawa valley and in 1953 the population had reached 3,900, sufficient for an upgrade of the town district to a borough. The upgrade to the Borough of Tawa Flat was approved in October 1953.
Starting at the time of the Tawa Flat School and Tawa Flat District Centennial in 1955, there was a popular move to change the name of the &quot;Borough of Tawa Flat&quot; to the &quot;Borough of Tawa&quot; as more people now lived in the hilly areas on the sides of the valley or in Linden and only a minority lived in the area previously known as Tawa Flat. The New Zealand Geographic Board decided on 24 November 1958 &quot;that on and after the 23rd of February 1959 the name of the Borough of Tawa Flat shall be Borough of Tawa.&quot; From 1959, the area became known as Tawa and usage of Tawa Flat has been discontinued.

In 1988 the Local Government Commission proposed that Tawa amalgamate with Porirua City or Wellington City with no option to remain an independent borough allowed. The proposal was opposed by the Tawa Borough Council and a majority of residents. Despite efforts by Porirua City to entice Tawa residents to amalgamate with Porirua City many Tawa citizens indicated a preference for amalgamation with Wellington City. On 3 October 1988, the Local Government Commission decreed that the Borough of Tawa would amalgamate with Wellington City. The Tawa Community Board was set up in 1989 to replace the Borough Council.

Tawa now contributes, as part of Wellington city&#x27;s Northern Ward, to elect three Wellington city councillors. Tawa retains a community board, which represents the suburb in matters of local and community affairs. The former Mayor of Wellington, Kerry Prendergast, originally came on to the Wellington City Council following time as a Tawa Borough councillor.

As of the 2022 local elections the Tawa Community Board members are:

==History==

===Early history===
The iwi with mana whenua in Tawa are Ngāti Toa Rangatira and Taranaki Whānui. Ngāti Toa Rangatira have had parcels of land in Tawa and Linden returned to them as part of a housing partnership with the Crown.

Though Māori people had not previously settled in the Tawa valley, they would have passed through it when travelling between the centuries-old established populations at Porirua and Te Whanganui a Tara. A Māori track, later developed in the 1840s for the Old Porirua Road, ran between the two harbours, while another such track ran from Willowbank to the Horokiwi Ridge and Petone.

As with the rest of Wellington, Tawa was colonised by the New Zealand Company in the mid-19th century under the direction of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The Company claimed to have purchased the land from local Māori - this claim &quot;did not take into account of Maori existing land use, and was further undermined by the New Zealand Company and later by the government.&quot; It was divided into 100-acre blocks, providing some of the 100-acre &quot;in the country&quot; blocks that accompanied the one-acre &quot;in town&quot; (i.e., central Wellington) blocks, similar to other Company settlements. Much of the eastern side of the Tawa valley came to be owned by a single family until the demand for housing land overtook the benefits of farming the land. In 1951, a Town District was established covering Tawa and Linden. Within two years this had become Tawa Flat Borough.

===Development===
The development of Tawa, like many population centres, has been strongly tied to the development of transportation networks. It was initially a rural settlement established along the Old Porirua Road. During construction of the road in 1846-47, the road-making soldiers used two stockades, built a kilometre apart from each other, to sleep in and for protection from potential attacks. The initial settlers had to clear the surrounding heavy forests before they could begin building and farming on the land. 

In 1851 the first church opened, and in 1855 the first school opened, but Tawa remained predominantly rural into the 20th century. While there were early efforts at housing subdivisions, first in 1896 and in 1906 with the establishment of the Tawa Land Company, they failed to attract much interest. Tawa didn&#x27;t grow significantly until just before World War II, when it began to lose its semi-rural character.

A single-track railway line built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company connected Tawa to Wellington from September 1885, and to Palmerston North from November 1886. It followed a circuitous route from Wellington via the Ngaio Gorge and Johnsonville. This line was incorporated into the New Zealand Railways Department network in December 1908. Tawa&#x27;s first railway station, Tawa Flat station, opened on 24 September 1885. The station was located on the hillside above the valley floor on what is now Duncan Street, on the straight section of road about 180 metres north of the intersection of Duncan Street with the junction of Tawa Street and Tawa Terrace.

====1930s and 40s: The Tawa Flat deviation====
From June 1937, the double-tracked Tawa Flat deviation diverted the North Island Main Trunk railway from Thorndon through Kaiwharawhara and two significant new tunnels to the Tawa valley to provide a shorter faster rail route with easier grades and higher speed curves. The new deviation reduced the travel time between Wellington and Tawa by 15 minutes. The old and new routes diverged in Thorndon and merged again north of the present-day Tawa Railway Station near the front entrance to Tawa College. Part of the old rail route through Tawa, from Tawa Street to Tawa College, became the southern part of Duncan Street while the old railway alignment from Tawa Street to Takapu Road remained as a pleasant walking track.

The new deviation provided two new railway stations that opened on 20 June 1937, one at Takapu Road and a new Tawa Flat Railway Station on an island platform built on the valley floor, below and 400 metres north of the old railway station. A crossing loop was provided at Tawa Flat with crossovers north and south of the station to allow trains to terminate at Tawa Flat and return to Wellington or Porirua. A siding was provided to support local businesses. The new Tawa Flat station was equipped with an enclosed waiting room, toilets for men and women, and a stationmaster&#x27;s office with a ticket sale window opening to the waiting room. A miniature lever frame allowed signals to be locally controlled. Trains between Kaiwharawhara and Tawa ran on double line automatic signalling. The tablet system remained in use on the single line section from Tawa to Porirua.

With the completion of the deviation, the railway connection between Johnsonville and Tawa was severed on 19 June 1937. The original line from Wellington to Johnsonville was electrified and reopened as the Johnsonville Branch. The railway line from Tawa to Porirua remained single track with no stations between Tawa and Porirua until the new Linden station opened on 28 July 1940.

Electrification of the North Island Main Trunk was completed from Wellington to Paekakariki in 1940 and a modern automatic signalling system was installed to enable trains to operate at frequent intervals. From 1940, the shorter and faster train service to Wellington using passenger cars hauled by electric locomotives made Tawa a more desirable place to live.

Arohata Women&#x27;s Prison, located at the southern end of Tawa, was built in 1944 and was originally a women&#x27;s borstal. It became a youth prison in 1981 and a women&#x27;s prison in 1987.

====1950s and 60s: improved train service, motorway opening, rapid population growth ====

A much improved, faster, and more frequent, rail service resulted from the Tawa Flat deviation in the late 1930s, electrification of the railway line with an automatic signalling system in 1940, and the arrival of additional electric multiple units in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The first multiple units operated on the line from 5 September 1949 but electric locomotive-hauled trains continued to operate in peak periods as there were insufficient multiple units until the arrival of the first Ganz Mavag EM/ET units in 1982. 

It was now quicker and easier for residents of Tawa to commute to Wellington to work in the central Wellington area. Travel time by rail from Tawa to central Wellington was now less than from many Wellington City suburbs and the fares were competitive. 

On 15 December 1957, the duplication of the railway line from Tawa to Porirua was completed and a new Linden railway station on an island platform replaced the old shelter. With the duplication to Porirua, double line automatic signalling was extended from Tawa to Porirua and the tablet system was removed. The miniature lever frame controlling the signalling in Tawa could now be &quot;switched-out&quot; to automatic double-track operation or &quot;switched-in&quot; when required for shunting of goods trains or other movements requiring the use of the crossovers. This meant that Tawa station only require manning for occasional train movements. 

Two new railway stations were built in the 1960s to meet the growing demand for rail services: Kenepuru station opened on 8 April 1963 and Redwood station on 15 December 1963. Tawa was now served by five railway stations. A feature of the new Redwood station was the staggering of the platforms north and south of the level crossing at Tawa Street to avoid the excessive operation of the warning lights and bells and barrier arms at the Tawa Street level crossing.

During the 1950s, the high-speed Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway was built through Tawa on the eastern side of the valley. The first section that broadly followed the line of the old North Island Main Trunk railway from Johnsonville to the Tawa turnoff at Takapu Road at the southern entrance to Tawa was opened on 15 December 1951. The second section, from Takapu Road to Porirua, was opened about five years later and the Johnsonville bypass connecting the south end of the motorway to the top of Ngauranga Gorge about the same time. The first section, from Johnsonville to Takapu Road, reduced road travel times and considerably improved access to Wellington by eliminating the need to use the narrow winding road through the bottom of the valley and Glenside. The second section allowed through traffic to bypass Tawa reducing traffic on the Main Road in Tawa. The southern and northern accesses to Tawa were improved by straightening and widening narrow sections of the Main Road at Takapu Road and Kenepuru Drive between Linden and Porirua.

Demand for new housing diminished in the 1930s and early 1940s, but from the mid-1940s a country-wide surge in marriage and birth rates occurred. With a shortage of suitable new housing areas in Wellington City, and with Tawa now more accessible with improved road and rail access, Tawa became a popular place for new private housing. Land was at a premium in the steep terrain of the Wellington region and the flat areas and moderate hills of Tawa were attractive. The Tawa microclimate, sometimes up to five degrees Celsius warmer than Wellington when the foehn effect occurs at the tail end of a southerly wind, was an added attraction. It could be fine and warm in Tawa when Wellington was cold and overcast. New subdivisions followed and the population expanded rapidly. Tawa became one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. State housing subdivisions at Kenepuru and Hampton Hill in the late 1950s and early 1960s added to the population growth.

Population growth and a need to ensure primary schools were within walking distance for children led to the opening of new schools. A new public primary school was opened in Linden in 1952 to take the pressure off the long-established Tawa School. Tawa College was opened in 1960, eliminating the need for Tawa students to travel to Porirua or Wellington for Secondary Education. Tawa College was built on land that straddles the motorway, with the main school campus west of the motorway and additional playing fields to the east. A subway under the motorway links the two parts of Tawa College and provides public access. St. Francis Xavier School, a Catholic primary school, opened in Redwood in 1960. The demand for new primary schools continued in the 1960s: Hampton Hill School was opened in 1965 and Redwood School in 1966.

====1970s to present day====

During the 1970s, Tawa experienced significant residential growth, Redwood and parts of Sundale in particular expanded outward. To meet the growth, Greenacres primary school opened in 1972 and Tawa Intermediate in 1975. The opening of Tawa Intermediate took the pressure off the primary schools by catering for year 7 and 8 education that was previously provided by the primary schools.

Since the 1990s, Tawa has been expanding more slowly. By the turn of the 21st Century, most of the greenfield residential growth in Tawa has occurred to the east of the Motorway, mainly spreading eastward up toward the parallel Takapu Valley in the direction of the Belmont Range.

Whilst greenfield residential growth has slowed, there has been significant infill housing as property owners, particularly owners of older quarter acre sections, subdivide their properties. Along with infill housing, the turn of the 21st century has seen the redevelopment of some of Tawa&#x27;s previously industrial areas including the development of Dress Smart - an outlet shopping centre - and the retirement village, Redwood village. Tawa&#x27;s latest retail development is located on what is colloquially known as &quot;Takapu Island&quot;; a site located alongside the Tawa motorway off-ramp where a new supermarket was opened in September 2012. Conversely, one of Tawa&#x27;s other shopping centres, Tawa Junction, closed in 2008 after a lengthy period with few occupants and has since been mooted as a location for another retirement village.

On 27 November 1999 Tawa, along with Mount Eden and Mount Roskill, became the last place in New Zealand to vote in favour of becoming &quot;wet&quot; in local restoration polls. Voting to become &quot;wet&quot; allowed the purchase of alcohol within the suburb for the first time and since then several pubs and bars have opened.

<text>Randall Leo Jones (born January 12, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Junkman&quot;, is an American former professional baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. Jones won the Cy Young Award with San Diego in 1976. The Padres retired his 35.

Jones attended Brea-Olinda High School in Brea, California, and Chapman University in Orange, California. He was known for his sinker and the large number of ground-ball outs he induced. He was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame.

==Professional baseball career==
Jones was selected by the San Diego Padres in the fifth round of the 1972 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on June 16, 1973.

In 1974, Jones went 8–22 with a 4.45 ERA. He was able to turn it around in 1975 when he won 20 games and led the National League with a 2.24 ERA, earning &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Comeback Player of the Year Award. He felt that he should have been a contender for the 1975 Cy Young Award but lost out due to a lack of exposure from the media. His best season was in 1976, where he survived a car crash, went 22–14 with a 2.74 ERA, started the All-Star Game, won the National League Cy Young Award, and was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; NL Pitcher of the Year. He was selected as the left-handed pitcher on The Sporting News NL All-Star Teams after the 1975 and 1976 seasons. At the All-Star break in July , Jones&#x27; record was 16–3. a win total that no one has equaled since. He also had the most complete games and had pitched over 300 innings in the 1976 season.

Jones owns the distinction of recording a save for the NL in the 1975 All-Star Game and being the starting and winning pitcher the next year. During his last start of the 1976 season, he injured a nerve in his pitching arm that required exploratory surgery, and he was never quite able to regain his Cy Young form.

Jones pitched effectively for San Diego through the 1980 season. On December 15, 1980, he was traded to the New York Mets for José Moreno and John Pacella. After two years, Jones was released by the Mets, and signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was released by the Pirates before the 1983 season started, thus ending his playing career.

His career win–loss record was just ; he remains the only starting pitcher to win a Cy Young Award but retire with a losing record. He was named an All-Star in 1975 and 1976. After his retirement, Jones&#x27; uniform No. 35 was retired by the Padres on May 9, 1997.

==Post-playing career==

After retiring from Major League Baseball, Jones has coached young pitchers. His most prominent pupil was Barry Zito, a former Major League pitcher and the 2002 Cy Young Award winner while with the Oakland Athletics.

In 1996, Jones was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame. He was inducted as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.

<doc id="961604" wikidata="Q1329792" url="?curid=961604" title="Ukita Hideie">
<text>was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Bizen and Mimasaka Provinces (modern Okayama Prefecture), and one of the council of Five Elders appointed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Son of Ukita Naoie, he married Gōhime, a daughter of Maeda Toshiie. Having fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara he was exiled to the island prison of Hachijō-jima, where he died.

==Biography==
Hideie&#x27;s father Ukita Naoie was &quot;daimyō&quot; of Bizen province and initially opposed, but later sided with Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Naoie died in 1582, and Hideie became the head of the Ukita clan. As Hideie was still young (10 years old), it was Hideie&#x27;s uncle (Ukita Tadaie) who acted as leader of the Ukita army until Hideie coming of age, in particular, Tadaie served on behalf of Hideie as a commander in numerous battles (under Toyotomi Hideyoshi). However, during the siege of Bitchū Takamatsu Castle in 1582, Nobunaga was assassinated on June 2 of that year, but the siege continued until the castle fell two days later. Hideyoshi raced back to Kyoto, leaving the Ukita clan in charge of Bizen, Mimasaka and newly taken parts of Bitchū Province. The Ukita were also to keep watch on Mōri Terumoto to the west.

In 1585, Hideie&#x27;s forces under Ukita Tadaie led 23,000 men Toyotomi&#x27;s forces in the Shikoku campaign against Chosokabe Motochika.

In 1586, Hideie was married to Hideyoshi&#x27;s adopted daughter, Gōhime. (She had been adopted by Hideyoshi from Maeda Toshiie). 
Later, he participated in the Kyushu Conquest in 1587.

In 1590, Hideie joined Hideyoshi&#x27;s military campaigns in the Odawara campaign against Hōjō Ujimasa. 

Following the unification of Japan under Hideyoshi, in 1592, Hideyoshi appointed Hideie as field marshal at First Korean campaigns, he command &quot;Reserves Division&quot;.

Later in 1597, Hideie became a &quot;Chief Commander Army of the Left&quot; in the Second Korean campaigns, returning in 1598 to serve as one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s five counselors (Council of Five Elders) along with Maeda Toshiie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, Mōri Terumoto, and Tokugawa Ieyasu.

=== Ukita clan riot ===
In 1599, a riot occurred within the Ukita clan, as several of Ukita clan vassals such as Togawa tatsuyasu, Sadatsuna Oka, and others rebelled against Hideie. The reason was Hideie&#x27;s favoritism towards Nakamura Jirobe, which further escalates into an armed rebellion which even Hideie could not resolve.

In response, Sakakibara Yasumasa and Ōtani Yoshitsugu, were appointed as inspectors to mediate this incident. In the end, Yasumasa successfully reconciled the case, and the armed riot was resolved without bloodshed. However, the aftermath of this incident caused many of Hideie retainers to defect from Hideie&#x27;s clan. Some retainers, such as Sakazaki Naomori, changed their allegiance into the master of Yasumasa, which is Ieyasu Tokugawa. These defections caused massive setback for the Ukita clan politically and militarily while strengthening the Tokugawa clan.

==Battle of Sekigahara==

After Hideyoshi died in 1598, leaving his five-year-old son Hideyori as his successor and Tokugawa Ieyasu moved to take control. As he was very close to Hideyoshi, Ukita naturally sided with the Toyotomi loyalists under Ishida Mitsunari (the Western army). He took 17,000 men to fight in the Battle of Sekigahara. In the field, his army fought against Fukushima Masanori, what is said to have been one of the bloodiest confrontations in the Sekigahara battle. In early battle, Ukita&#x27;s troops were winning the battle and pushing back Masanori&#x27;s army, however, being unaware that his allies stationed nearby had made a secret deal with the enemy, his momentum was halted, when his allies attacked and together with turncoats. Later, Masanori&#x27;s army took control of, and eastern army won the battle. 

One of the defectors, Kobayakawa Hideaki, was granted Okayama Castle and surrounding Ukita territories by the Tokugawa as a reward for his betrayal, which is believed to have been the decisive factor in the Tokugawa victory. 
Hideie was angered by the betrayal and initially intended to hunt down Kobayakawa for a man-to-man duel but was stopped by his advisors. After escaping the battle, he went into hiding in Satsuma Province where his former allies protected him for several years.

==Exile==

In 1603 however, Shimazu Tadatsune informed the Tokugawa shogunate of Hideie&#x27;s location. Tadatsune and Hideie&#x27;s relative Maeda Toshinaga, however, negotiate with Ieyasu and he escaped the death penalty, and he was confined in Mt. Kuno in Suruga Province instead. Later, he was forced to appear before Tokugawa himself where he was sentenced to exile on the island of Hachijō-jima, along with several supporters, including his two sons. Gohime, (Hideie&#x27;s wife) sought refuge with the Maeda clan and was able to correspond and send gifts (rice, sake, clothing) to her husband and sons from there.

Hideie eventually outlived his wife and all of the Sengoku Jidai era samurai except Sanada Nobuyuki. He was offered a conditional pardon after Ieyasu&#x27;s death, but declined and never returned to the mainland. His wife had died, the Toyotomi were defeated, there was no place to return to, his sons had fathered children on Hachijojima, and the Shogunate was to be inherited by members of the Tokugawa clan.

There is no evidence to suggest that Hideie fathered any further children himself, but many of his sons&#x27; descendants emigrated back to the Japanese mainland when a full pardon was granted at the end of the Edo era.

<text>Aces II (Advanced Concepts in Electronic Structure Theory) is an ab initio computational chemistry package for performing high-level quantum chemical ab initio calculations. Its major strength is the accurate calculation of atomic and molecular energies as well as properties using many-body techniques such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and, in particular coupled cluster techniques to treat electron correlation. The development of ACES II began in early 1990 in the group of Professor Rodney J. Bartlett at the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) of the University of Florida in Gainesville. There, the need for more efficient codes had been realized and the idea of writing an entirely new program package emerged. During 1990 and 1991 John F. Stanton, Jürgen Gauß, and John D. Watts, all of them at that time postdoctoral researchers in the Bartlett group, supported by a few students, wrote the backbone of what is now known as the ACES II program package. The only parts which were not new coding efforts were the integral packages (the MOLECULE package of J. Almlöf, the VPROP package of P.R. Taylor, and the integral derivative package ABACUS of T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen J. Olsen, and H.J. Aa. Jensen). The latter was modified extensively for adaptation with Aces II, while the others remained very much in their original forms.

Ultimately, two different versions of the program evolved. The first was maintained by the Bartlett group at the University of Florida, and the other (known as ACESII-MAB) was maintained by groups at the University of Texas, Universitaet Mainz in Germany, and ELTE in Budapest, Hungary. The latter is now called CFOUR.

Aces III is a parallel implementation that was released in the fall of 2008. The effort led to definition of a new architecture for scalable parallel software called the super instruction architecture. The design and creation of software is divided into two parts:

# The algorithms are coded in a domain specific language called super instruction assembly language or SIAL, pronounced &quot;sail&quot; for easy communication.
# The SIAL programs are executed by a MPMD parallel virtual machine called the super instruction processor or SIP.

The ACES III program consists of 580,000 lines of SIAL code of which 200,000 lines are comments, and 230,000 lines of C/C++ and Fortran of which 62,000 lines are comments. The latest version of the program was released on August 1, 2014.

<text>Nicholas Biddle (September 10, 1750 – March 7, 1778) was one of the first five captains of the Continental Navy, which was raised by the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1750. He began sailing at the age of 13 and joined the Royal Navy when he was 20. In 1773, he sailed the Arctic with Constantine Phipps and Horatio Nelson. When the Revolutionary War began in 1775, Biddle joined the Continental Navy and commanded several ships. In 1778 off the coast of Barbados, Biddle confronted , a 64-gun British warship. After a twenty-minute battle, Biddle&#x27;s ship suddenly exploded, killing him and most of his men. Four ships of the U.S. Navy have been named in his honor.

==Early life==
Nicholas Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1750, one of nine children to William Biddle (1698–1756) of the Biddle family, and Mary Scull (1709–1789). Biddle went to sea at the age of thirteen, as a ship&#x27;s boy aboard a merchant vessel trading in the West Indies. In 1770, he joined the Royal Navy and served three years until resigning in 1773 to accompany Captain Constantine Phipps on his expedition to the Arctic Sea. While on this voyage, Biddle became acquainted with Horatio Nelson, the future British admiral and fellow member of Phipps&#x27; expedition.

==American Revolutionary War==
In 1775, Biddle, sympathizing with colonists who were opposed to British rule, returned to North America to offer his services to the State of Pennsylvania. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety placed Biddle in command of the armed galley . In December 1775, Biddle was commissioned into the newly established Continental Navy and made captain of the 14-gun brig . Biddle participated in the expedition against New Providence and fought in the Continental Navy&#x27;s action with on April 6, 1776. Biddle was highly critical of the action, noting that the lack of signaling by his superior, Commodore Esek Hopkins, led to a &quot;helter skelter&quot; action. Biddle quickly developed a reputation as an able captain by capturing numerous vessels, including British troopships, on later cruises.

One of his most exceptional campaigns occurred during a cruise of the Newfoundland Banks; Biddle&#x27;s crew was so successful in the taking of ships that by the time they returned to port, only five sailors were steering Biddle&#x27;s flagship; the rest were crewing the prizes taken during the cruise. On June 6, 1776, Biddle was appointed by the Continental Congress to command , a 32-gun frigate then being built in Philadelphia as part of a plan to drastically expand the size and power of the American naval fleet. She was launched near the close of the year and sailed early in 1777. In September 1777, &quot;Randolph&quot; attained her first success by capturing HMS &quot;True Briton&quot; and her three-ship convoy.

On March 7, 1778, off Barbados, &quot;Randolph&quot; engaged the British 64-gun ship of the line . Rather than trying to flee from the more heavily armed opponent, &quot;Randolph&quot; sailed into battle so the merchant fleet it was escorting could escape. An eyewitness reported the frigate held her own in the twenty-minute engagement, appearing, &quot;to fire four or five broadsides to the &quot;Yarmouth&quot;″s one.&quot; After Biddle was wounded, &quot;Randolph&quot; blew up suddenly, killing all but four of the 305 souls on board, including Biddle. The loss of &quot;Randolph&quot; was a serious blow to the fledgling Continental Navy. His body was lost at sea and never recovered.

His brother, Edward Biddle, was a staunch advocate for American independence, and his nephew, Nicholas Biddle, was an esteemed banker. Four ships of the United States Navy have been named in his honor. Cyrus Townsend Brady&#x27;s book &quot;For Love of Country&quot; is based partly on the life of Nicholas Biddle, in particular the action between the &quot;Randolph&quot; and the &quot;Yarmouth&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Nicholas Biddle appears in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; as the primary target of the &quot;Naval Missions&quot;. A secret member of the Templar Order, Biddle is revealed to be conspiring with fellow Templars in the Royal Navy to stage attacks on American shipping near Nantucket as a means of pressuring Congress to name him an Admiral, thus giving the Templars further control over the nation&#x27;s fledging naval service. As per historical record, he dies aboard the in 1778 after being bested in combat by Connor Kenway. Biddle demands the right to go down with his ship and is subsequently killed when the &quot;Randolph&quot; is destroyed in an explosion of its gunpowder stores. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

<text>Lewis Edward Lawes (September 13, 1883 – April 23, 1947) was a prison warden and a proponent of prison reform. During his 21-year tenure at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, he supervised the executions of 303 prisoners.

==Biography==
Lawes was born on September 13, 1883, in Elmira, New York. He was the only child of Henry Lewis Lawes (died 1925) and Sarah Abbott. His father worked as a prison guard at the New York State Reformatory, now called the Elmira Correctional Facility.

Lawes ran away at 17 and joined the United States Coast Artillery. 

Afterwards, he worked at an insurance company before beginning his prison career as a guard at Clinton Prison in Dannemora, New York, on March 1, 1905. On September 30, 1905, he married Katherine Stanley. He subsequently worked at first at Auburn Prison, then at Elmira Reformatory. In March 1915 he was named Superintendent of the City Reformatory on Hart Island in New York City. Lawes became warden of the Massachusetts State Prison in 1918. New York Governor Al Smith asked him to take over as warden of Sing Sing. Lawes took charge on January 1, 1920.

He was featured on the cover and in an article of &quot;Time&quot; magazine issue of November 18, 1929.

His wife, Kathryn (1887-1937), died on October 31, 1937, at Ossining Hospital after she fell at the Cortlandt, New York, end of the Bear Mountain Bridge. The heel of her shoe got caught between two boards, which caused her to fall and break her leg. She was not found until nighttime and died from hypothermia.

Characters based on Lewis and Kathryn Lawes may be found in David Pietrusza&#x27;s 2014 historical novel &quot;Dance Hall: A Novel of Sing Sing&quot;.

He served as warden of Sing Sing for twenty-one years, instituting reforms, until he retired on July 16, 1941. He was replaced by Robert J. Kirby.

Lawes became the president of the Boy Rangers of America in 1941.

Lawes died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 23, 1947, at age 63 in Garrison, New York. He was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Writings==
Lawes wrote several books. Several of his works were made into films. His most famous book, &quot;Twenty Thousand Years in Sing Sing&quot;, was made into a 1932 movie under the same title, starring Spencer Tracy, and again in 1940 as &quot;Castle on the Hudson&quot;, featuring John Garfield. &quot;Over the Wall&quot; was produced in 1938 based on the life of one of his inmates, Alabama Pitts. &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot; in 1939, with George Raft, was based on his novel of the same name, while Humphrey Bogart starred in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get Away with Murder&quot; in 1939, an adaptation of &quot;Chalked Out&quot;, a play Lawes co-wrote.

His papers are archived in the Special Collections of the Lloyd Sealy Library, John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

==Radio series==
From January 22, 1933 to April 21, 1939 Lawes narrated an NBC radio series (Red and Blue networks) which was also titled &quot;Twenty Thousand Years at Sing Sing&quot; and was based on his famous book. The show offered various stories based on the lives of the 2000 inmates at the prison, some with positive outcomes and others with negative results.

<text>Alexander Koshetz (12 September 1875 – 21 September 1944) was a Ukrainian choral conductor, arranger, composer, ethnographer, writer, musicologist, and lecturer. He helped popularize Ukrainian music around the world. His name is sometimes transliterated as Oleksandr Koshyts ().

At one time, a performance of Koshetz&#x27;s Ukrainian National Chorus held the world record for audience attendance, excluding sporting events.

Koshetz was born in the village of Romashky in Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (now Obukhiv Raion, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine). He graduated from the Kiev Theological Academy in 1901, then studied in the Lysenko School of Music and Drama, 1908–1910. He taught choral music at Kiev&#x27;s Imperial Conservatory of Music, conducted the Sadovsky Theatre Orchestra, served as conductor and choirmaster of the Kiev Opera.

He also collected Ukrainian folk songs from central Ukrainian areas (notably around Kiev itself) as well as from the modern Russian area of Kuban, where he specially set out to see whether musical traditions of the Dnieper Cossacks are still present in their descendants, the Kuban Cossacks, who resettled there following the dissolution of the Zaporozhian Sich. In the latter case, he too managed to collect a number of songs.

From 1911 the directorate of the Imperial Music School invited him to lead a choral singing class at the school and later at the conservatory. In 1912, Mykola Sadovsky invited Oleksandr Koshyts to be the conductor of his theater, where he staged operas by Mykola Lysenko, Denis Sichynsky, Pietro Mascagni, and others. The Tale of the Old Mill” by Spiridon Cherkasenko and others.

From 1916 to 1917 he was choirmaster and conductor of the Kyiv Opera.

=== Ukrainian Republic Capella and emigration ===

After World War I, Koshetz was the co-founder and conductor of the Ukrainian Republic Capella (later renamed Ukrainian National Chorus). The choir toured Europe and the Americas in 1919–1924 and 1926–27, in support of the international Ukrainian community.

In 1917 Koshetz married a former student and singer in his choirs Tetyana Koshetz (1892–1966) who was later to become a vocalist in the Ukrainian National Chorus, voice teacher, and after 1944 curator of the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre in Winnipeg.

It was Koshetz who introduced the song &quot;Shchedryk&quot; by Mykola Leontovych, at a concert in Kyiv in 1919. Eventually the song became a Christmas classic under the name &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;.

He moved to New York City in 1922 where he collected liturgical music, arranged and popularized Ukrainian folk music. Koshetz also documented the choir&#x27;s travels in the memoir &quot;With Song, Around the World&quot; (&quot;З піснею через світ&quot;).

In 1926, he settled in New York and worked in the United States and Canada to educate new conductors: he conducted music courses for conductors, etc. He composed church music (5 liturgies, some chants), and arranged folk songs. In New York, he continued to popularize Ukrainian music with his compositions, arrangements, and gramophone recordings, and the music publishing house Witmark &amp; Son published massive editions of forty-two Ukrainian folk songs arranged by Oleksandr Koshyts in English.
From 1941 Koshetz spent the summer months teaching in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he died in 1944 at age 69. His body is buried at Glen Eden Cemetery, West St. Paul, Manitoba.

== Commemoration ==
The O. Koshetz Choir in Winnipeg is named in his memory.

A unique concert titled the &quot;Unknown Koshetz&quot; was produced at the University of Manitoba on 26 March 2006. The concert featured the Olexander Koshetz Choir of Winnipeg performing Koshetz &quot;choral orchestrations&quot; of music of Hawaii, Scotland, Afro-Americana, and First Nations, sung in both English and Ukrainian translations.

On his 130th birthday, a commemorative concert was held in Uspenskyi Cathedral of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra by the best graduates of the Tchaikovsky National Music Academy under patronage of President Yuschenko and under blessing of Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

The personal archives of Alexander and Tetyana Koshetz remain at the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

== Music ==
Although Koshetz was mostly known as a conductor, he also did his share of composing and arranging music. In the 1920s, after the creation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Koshetz composed his liturgy, the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, as well as ten Ukrainian religious chants. Later in emigration, he composed much more religious music.

<text>Alison Stewart Lurie (September 3, 1926December 3, 2020) was an American novelist and academic. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her 1984 novel &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Although better known as a novelist, she wrote many non-fiction books and articles, particularly on children&#x27;s literature and the semiotics of dress.

==Life==
Alison Stewart Lurie was born on September 3, 1926, in Chicago, and raised in White Plains, New York. Her father Harry Lawrence Lurie was a sociologist, and her mother Bernice Lurie (&quot;née&quot; Stewart) was a journalist and book critic. Her father was born in Latvia and her mother was born in Scotland. Her father was the first executive director of the National Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds. Due to complications with a forceps delivery, she was born deaf in one ear and with damage to her facial muscles. She attended a boarding school in Darien, Connecticut, and graduated from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1947 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and literature.

Lurie met literary scholar Jonathan Peale Bishop while in college, and they married in 1948. Bishop later taught at Amherst College and Cornell University, and Lurie moved along with him. They had three sons and divorced in 1984. She then married the writer Edward Hower. She spent part of her time in Hampstead, London; part in Ithaca, New York; and part in Key West, Florida.

In 1970, Lurie began to teach in the English department at Cornell, where she was tenured in 1979. She taught children&#x27;s literature and writing. In 1976, she was named the F. J. Whiton Professor of American Literature at Cornell, and upon retirement, professor emerita. In 1981, she published &quot;The Language of Clothes&quot;, a non-fiction book about the semiotics of dress. Her discussion in &quot;Language of Clothes&quot; has been compared to Roland Barthes&#x27; &quot;The Fashion System&quot; (1985).

Lurie died from natural causes while under hospice care in Ithaca on December 3, 2020, at age 94.

Lurie&#x27;s personal papers are archived at Cornell University.

==Themes==
Lurie&#x27;s novels often featured professors in starring roles, and were frequently set at academic institutions. With their light touch and focus on portraying the emotions of well-educated adulterers, her works bear more resemblance to some 20th-century British authors (such as Kingsley Amis and David Lodge) rather than to the major American authors of her generation. A 2003 profile of Lurie, styled as a review of her &quot;Boys and Girls Forever&quot;, a work of criticism, observed that Lurie&#x27;s works are often &quot;witty and astute comedies of manners&quot;. Lurie noted that her writing was grounded in a &quot;desire to laugh at things&quot;. The author also incorporated some of her own experiences into her fiction. In &quot;The Nowhere City&quot;, there is a character based on actress Sheree North. &quot;I did have a job answering her fan mail,&quot; Lurie recalled. Lurie also used some of Sheree&#x27;s friends as characters but &quot;tried to change them all a little, so as not to annoy anybody.&quot;

Literary critic John W. Aldridge gave a mixed assessment of Lurie&#x27;s oeuvre in &quot;The American Novel and the Way We Live Now&quot; (1983). He notes that Lurie&#x27;s work &quot;has a satirical edge that, when it is not employed in hacking away at the obvious, is often eviscerating&quot;, but also remarks that &quot;there is … something hobbled and hamstrung about her engagement in experience&quot;.

Although better known as a novelist, she wrote many non-fiction books and articles, particularly on children&#x27;s literature and the semiotics of dress.

<doc id="961611" wikidata="Q1518347" url="?curid=961611" title="Lip balm">
<text>Lip balm or lip salve is a wax-like substance applied to the lips to moisturize and relieve chapped or dry lips, angular cheilitis, stomatitis, or cold sores. Lip balm often contains beeswax or carnauba wax, camphor, cetyl alcohol, lanolin, paraffin, and petrolatum, among other ingredients. Some varieties contain dyes, flavor, fragrance, phenol, salicylic acid, and sunscreen.

==Overview==
The primary purpose of lip balm is to provide an occlusive layer on the lip surface, sealing in moisture and protecting the lips from external exposure. Dry air, cold temperatures, and wind all have a drying effect on skin by drawing moisture away from the body. Lips are particularly vulnerable because the skin is so thin, and thus they are often the first to present signs of dryness. Occlusive materials like waxes and petroleum jelly prevent moisture loss and maintain lip comfort while flavorings, colorants, sunscreens, and various medicaments can provide additional, specific benefits. Lip balms are produced from bee wax and natural candelilla and carnauba waxes. 

Lip balm can be applied by a finger to the lips, or in a lipstick-style tube from which it can be applied directly.

In 2022, the global lip balm market was valued at US$732.76 mln. The market is predicted to grow at a rate of 9.28% within the next five years and is likely to reach US$1247.74 mln by 2027.

=== Production ===
Production for lip balms includes the following stages:
* Raw materials are checked for its quality (cosmetic products must comply with strict safety standards)
* The ingredients are dosed, melted, and mixed (this stage involves special equipment)
* This mixture is treated in a vacuum to remove bubbles
* The mixture is crystallized for about 48 hours
* The mixture is then remelted
* The mixture is cut into pieces which are shaped as required
* The lip balm is packaged into a casing

== History ==

=== Early lip balms ===
Since 40 BC, the Egyptians made treatment for lip care, which was made with a mixture of beeswax, olive oil, and animal fat.

=== United States ===
In the 1800s, Lydia Maria Child recommended earwax as a treatment for cracked lips in her highly-popular book, Child observed that, &quot;Those who are troubled with cracked lips have found this earwax remedy successful when others have failed. It is one of those sorts of cures, which are very likely to be laughed at; but I know of its having produced very beneficial results.&quot; The invention of the lip balm was first formally invented in the 1880s by physician Charles Brown Fleet though its origins may be traced to earwax. Fleet later named his lip balm product &quot;ChapStick&quot;.

In 1872, chemist Robert Chesebrough discovered and sampled a new petroleum jelly, initially describing it as a &quot;natural, waxy ingredient, rich in minerals from deep within the earth&quot; which could be used as a solution for skin repair. He then distributed his product under the name &quot;Wonder Jelly&quot; before shortly changing it to &quot;Vaseline&quot;.

In the early 1880s, Charles Brown Fleet created ChapStick. However, due to the lack of sales, Fleet sold his formula and rights to ChapStick to John Morton in 1912 for $5, who saw the marketing potential in the brand. After making the purchase, Morton commissioned Frank Wright, Jr. to create a design for the logo of ChapStick for $15 in 1936. In 1972, ChapStick tubes concealing hidden microphones were used during the Watergate scandal.

In 1937, Alfred Woelbing created Carmex to treat cold sores in Milwaukee, though the occurrence of World War 2 would slow the production and sales due to the lack of lanolin. In 1980, Carmex underwent a product change by converting its packaging into squeezable tubes.

In 1973, Bonne Bell created the first flavored lip balm and marketed the company as Lip Smackers. The company would later collaborate on various different-flavored lip balms including Dr. Pepper in 1975, The Wrigley Company in 2004, and The Coca-Cola Company in 2006. Bonne Bell also collaborated with Disney to produce lip balms with various princess characters in 2010.

In 1991, Burt Shavitz and Roxanne Quimby created their first beeswax based lip balm solution through their company, Burt&#x27;s Bees. In 2020, it was reported that Burt&#x27;s Bees had used 50 percent of recycled material to package various products and that 100 percent of the products were recyclable.

In 2011, Evolution of Smooth (or commonly known as EOS) created a spherical-shaped lip balm as well as describing its 95% organic ingredients.

=== Cannabis infused lip balms ===
With the gradual legalization of cannabis in the United States, some companies have produced lip balms containing doses of THC or CBD oil. The lip balms were infused with a low dosage of THC in order to prevent the occurrence of any psychoactive or related effect. 

== Notable brands ==
* Burt&#x27;s Bees
* Blistex
* Carmex
* ChapStick
* Labello 
* Lip Smacker
* Lypsyl
* EOS
* Vaseline
* Aquaphor
* Nivea

== Dependency ==

=== Addictive ingredients ===
Some physicians have suggested that certain types of lip balm can be addictive or contain ingredients that actually cause drying, the accuracy of which has been debated by many professionals. Lip balm manufacturers sometimes state in their FAQs that there is nothing addictive in their products or that all ingredients are listed and approved by the FDA. Snopes found the claim that there are substances in Carmex that are irritants necessitating reapplication, such as ground glass, to be false. However, some experts such as dermatologist Dr. Cynthia Bailey state that some ingredients in lip balm directly causes sensitive lip skin which may lead to addiction. Dermatology professor Marcia Driscoll also adds onto this argument by stating that aroma ingredients found in flavored or scented lip balms have the potential to irritate skin.

=== Causes for Dependency ===
According to a report, professor Brad Rohu states that it is natural for the lips to feel dry. The exposure to environments with cold, dry, or windy weather can directly cause the chapping of the lips as well as behaviors such as lip licking or mouth breathing. These factors may directly contribute to an increased amount of lip balm usage. According to dermatologist Amy Derick, those who have expressed dependencies on lip balm have developed a desire of how the lips feel after application. She also mentions that the variety of lip balm flavor may also directly cause lip balm dependency as a person may want to lick their lips to taste the flavor, which may consequentially remove the lip balm coating from the lips. This may also leave saliva on the lips which can dry up and make the lips feel even more dry than they initially were.

== Effects on lip barrier ==
The human lips have an inadequate capability of holding moisture as well as an imperfect lip barrier function. The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology performed a study in order to determine whether consistent use of lip balm would enhance the overall quality of the lips. The study used 32 female participants within the ages of 20 to 40 years and the participants had mild to moderate dried lips without any history of health-related complications. The participants underwent a procedure in which no lip treatment was provided on the first 3 days, then 2 weeks of consistent lip balm usage, and then a period of no treatment for 3 days. The study determined the quality of the lips based on the physical details and appearance throughout the study. The study showed a direct improvement of the physical details of the lips except for lip cracking during the second week of treatment and after the period of no treatment. The study also showed that hydration of the lips lasted for approximately 8 hours after usage and the lip balm improved the lip barrier function despite discontinued usage. The study concluded that lip balms assist the hydration of the lips which consequentially improves the lip barrier function and the quality. This study was completely funded by Burt&#x27;s Bees, a lip balm company.

== Mineral oil ==
In 2015, German consumer watchdog Stiftung Warentest analyzed cosmetics containing mineral oils. After developing a new detection method they found high concentrations of Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons (MOAH) and even polyaromatics in products containing mineral oils with Vaseline products containing the most MOAH of all tested cosmetics (up to 9%). The European Food Safety Authority sees MOAH and polyaromatics as possibly carcinogenic. Based on the results, Stiftung Warentest warns not to use Vaseline or any product that is based on mineral oils for lip care.

== Lip balm market ==

=== United States ===
In 2019, a research report conducted by the Statista Research Department concluded that ChapStick was the leading lip balm brand in the United States with an approximate unit sale of 55.8 million. Carmex was the second leading brand with approximately 35.2 million units sold and Burt&#x27;s Bees being the third leading brand with approximately 32.3 million units sold.
== Trends ==

=== Beezin&#x27; ===

Beezin&#x27; is a trend dating back to 2013 in which a person applies Burt&#x27;s Bees brand lip balm onto the eyelids. The practice is done in order to feel a sensation of being high or drunk, and even to increase the desired effects of alcohol and other substances. In 2022, Beezin&#x27; became a viral trend on the social media platform TikTok. Some ingredients, including peppermint oil, are known to be eye irritants which can cause an unintentional inflammatory response which may require treatment and may also cause dermatitis on the eyelids.

<text>Psi is an ab initio computational chemistry package originally written by the research group of Henry F. Schaefer, III (University of Georgia). Utilizing Psi, one can perform a calculation on a molecular system with various kinds of methods such as Hartree-Fock, Post-Hartree–Fock electron correlation methods, and density functional theory. The program can compute energies, optimize molecular geometries, and compute vibrational frequencies. The major part of the program is written in C++, while Python API is also available, which allows users to perform complex computations or automate tasks easily.

Psi4 is the latest release of the program package - it is open source, released as free under the GPL through GitHub. Primary development of Psi4 is currently performed by the research groups of David Sherrill (Georgia Tech), T. Daniel Crawford (Virginia Tech), Francesco Evangelista (Emory University), and Henry F. Schaefer, III (University of Georgia), with substantial contributions by Justin Turney (University of Georgia), Andy Simmonett (NIH), and Rollin King (Bethel University). Psi4 is available on Linux releases such as Fedora and Ubuntu.

==Features==

The basic capabilities of Psi are concentrated around the following methods of quantum chemistry:
* Hartree–Fock method
* Density functional theory
* Møller–Plesset perturbation theory
* Coupled cluster
* CASSCF
* multireference configuration interaction methods
* symmetry-adapted perturbation theory

Several methods are available for computing excited electronic states, including configuration interaction singles (CIS), the random phase approximation (RPA), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), and equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CCSD).

Psi4 has introduced the density-fitting approximation in many portions of the code, leading to faster computations and reduced I/O requirements.

Psi4 is the preferred quantum chemistry backend for the OpenFermion project, which seeks to perform quantum chemistry computations on quantum computers.

In Psi4 1.4, the program was adapted to facilitate high-throughput workflows and can be connected to BrianQC to speed up calculations for Hartree-Fock and Density functional theory methods.
