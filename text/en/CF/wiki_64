<text>Argentine tango is a musical genre and accompanying social dance originating at the end of the 19th century in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. It typically has a or rhythmic time signature, and two or three parts repeating in patterns such as ABAB or ABCAC. Its lyrics are marked by &quot;nostalgia&quot;, sadness, and laments for lost love. The typical orchestra has several melodic instruments and is given a distinctive air by the bandoneon. It has continued to grow in popularity and spread internationally, adding modern elements without replacing the older ones. Among its leading figures are the singer and songwriter Carlos Gardel and composers/performers Francisco Canaro, Juan D&#x27;Arienzo, Carlos Di Sarli, Osvaldo Pugliese, Elvira Santamaría, and Ástor Piazzolla.

==History of tango==

The origins of tango are unclear because little historical documentation from that era exists. In recent years, a few tango aficionados have undertaken a thorough research of that history and so it is less mysterious today than before. It is generally thought that the dance developed in the late 19th century in working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina and was practiced by Argentine dancers, musicians, and immigrant laborers. Unlike other Latin American countries, Argentine elites rejected a racial mixture with darker skin colored Argentines. Argentines repeated stereotypes that were common in Europe in the colonial era: non-caucasian people were forced into ghetto cohabitation. Tango was practiced in streets and patios, particularly dark street corners. Additionally, Afro-Argentines played important roles in evolution both musically and choreographically in the early stage of tango. The term &quot;tango&quot; was originated from Afro-Argentine dance forms, and black people are still connected to tango well into the 20th century. Tango developed with expression of political struggles by black community and was loved by many immigrants who lived in shanty town and wished to change their socio-economic situation.

Argentine elites viewed tango as dangerous association and gathering place for lower-class people. However, as famous tango stars such as Alberto Castillo gained popularity in Argentina, the positive image of blackness related to tango started to widely share in Argentina&#x27;s mass culture during the 1930s to 1950s. Tango lyrics often challenge the images of Argentina made by foreigners: The true Argentina was the country with both black and white people who originated the tango, not the rich people who danced the foxtrot. Additionally, Argentine tango lyrics presented humility as main theme and mass culture promoted tango to encourage humility as national identity. The Buenos Aires city government and the federal government started actively promoting tango by establishing a federal law to build Academia Nacional del tango. The law &quot;Ley Nacional del Tango&quot;, which recognized tango as an Argentine cultural tradition, was passed in 1996. At the beginning, Argentine tango was rejected by the middle and upper classes who were engaging in ballroom dances including the Viennese waltz. Only in the decade between 1910 and 1920, Argentine tango started becoming fashionable in the major European capitals such as Paris, Berlin, Rome and Vienna. Within the European society, the feelings towards this new dance were mixed. In Rome, Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy banned Argentine tango from the balls in Quirinal Palace. Kaiser Wilhelm II, the King of Bavaria and Kaiser Franz Joseph forbid their officers in uniform to dance this new rhythm. In the Austrian capital Vienna, Argentine tango was deliberately excluded from the program of the &quot;23rd ball of the City of Vienna&quot; (year between 1920 and 1930) according to historical documents. Only in 2017, Argentine tango has entered the traditional Viennese balls through the prestigious Technische Universität Ball (Technical University Ball), which now includes a milonga in its program. In conclusion, early tango was developed by black community and supported by immigrants who wished social mobility. Tango was much not accepted by elites in its early stages, and was actively repressed. However, tango gained recognition by the government and elites during 1930s to 1950s, and became unique national identity of Argentina. At the same time, the tango which was eventually embraced by elites may have obscured the fact that tango was invented by black people in Argentina. It is important to acknowledge the origins of tango and understand its unique history and influence in Argentina&#x27;s national identity.

==Music==

Argentine tango music is much more varied than ballroom tango music. A large amount of tango music has been composed by a variety of different orchestras over the last century. Not only is there a large volume of music, there is a breadth of stylistic differences between these orchestras as well, which makes it easier for Argentine tango dancers to spend the whole night dancing only Argentine tango. The four representative schools of the Argentine tango music are Di Sarli, d&#x27;Arienzo, Troilo and Pugliese, all four descendent from Italian immigrant families. They are dance orchestras, playing music for dancing. When the spirit of the music is characterized by counterpoint marking, clarity in the articulation is needed. It has a clear, repetitive pulse or beat, a strong tango-rhythm which is based on the 2x4, 2 strong beats on 4 (dos por cuatro). Ástor Piazzolla stretched the classical harmony and counterpoint and moved the tango from the dance floor to the concert stage. His compositions tell us something of our contemporary life and dancing it relates much to modern dance.

While Argentine tango dancing has historically been danced to tango music, such as that produced by such orchestra leaders as Osvaldo Pugliese, Carlos di Sarli, Juan d&#x27;Arienzo, in the &#x27;90s a younger generation of tango dancers began dancing tango steps to alternatives to tango music; music from other genres like, &quot;world music&quot;, &quot;electro-tango&quot;, &quot;experimental rock&quot;, &quot;trip hop&quot;, and &quot;blues&quot;, to name a few. Tango nuevo dance is often associated with alternative music, see nuevo tango, but it can be danced to tango as well.

List of tango bandleaders during the Golden Age of tango:
==Resurgence outside Argentina==

===France===
In 1983, the dance show &quot;Tango Argentino&quot;, staged by Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzolli, opened in Paris, France, starring dancers Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves, Nélida y Nelson, Eduardo y Gloria, María y Carlos Rivarola, Norma y Luis Pereyra, Mayoral y Elsa Maria, Carlos y Inés Borges, Pablo Veron, Miguel Zotto and Milena Plebs, and Virulazo and Elvira.

===United Kingdom===

Argentine tango dancing in the UK began in the early 1990s in response to the hugely popular internationally touring shows &quot;Forever Tango&quot; and &quot;Tango Argentino&quot;. Enthusiastic Anglo-Argentine milonguero (dance hall tango dancer) Andrew Potter who had followed &quot;Forever Tango&quot; to London and stayed for its extensive run, got together with some Londoner friends to start the city&#x27;s first-ever tango milonga (tango dance party/hall) in The London Welsh Centre at 157 Grays Inn Road, known as &quot;Tango The Argentine Way&quot; which would pack out every Friday night. From that moment, the tango dances and classes proliferated throughout the capital and then throughout the rest of the UK.

===United States===
In 1985, the French dance show &quot;Tango Argentino&quot; transferred to Broadway in New York City. Cast members gave classes to a number of students, including Robert Duvall. Paul Pellicoro provided a dance center for the performers to teach new students. At the same time, Danel and Maria Bastone were teaching tango in New York, and Orlando Paiva was offering tango classes in Los Angeles. For further lessons, Duvall sought out Nestor Ray, a dancer who Duvall had seen perform in the documentary film &quot;Tango mio&quot;.

In 1986, Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher visited San Francisco, coming from La Paz, Entre Ríos and Buenos Aires aboard a cruise ship where they were dancing tango and chacarera professionally. Al and Barbara Garvey took tango classes from them as well as from Jorge and Rosa Ledesma from Quilmes, Buenos Aires; all in the style of choreographed show tango. In 1987, the Garveys traveled to Buenos Aires to discover the traditional improvisational social dance style at a large milonga (Centro Akarense) filled with older dancers in Villa Urquiza. Upon returning home to Fairfax, California, the Garveys continued tango lessons and began organizing milongas around the San Francisco Bay Area. They co-founded the Bay Area Argentine Tango Association (BAATA) and published a journal.

In 1986, Brigitta Winkler appeared in her first stage performance, &quot;Tangoshow&quot; in Montreal. Though based in Berlin, Winkler traveled often to teach at tango festivals in North America throughout the following two decades. Winkler was a seminal influence of Daniel Trenner. Montreal&#x27;s first tango teachers, French-born Lily Palmer and her Argentine friend, Antonio Perea, offered classes in 1987.

The Dinzelbachers settled in San Francisco in 1988, in response to the demand for tango teachers following a visit to San Francisco by the touring production of &quot;Tango Argentino&quot;. Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher taught a core group of students who would later become teachers themselves, including the Garveys, Polo Talnir and Jorge Allende.

In 1989, the Dinzelbachers were invited to Cincinnati by Richard Powers, to introduce and teach Argentine tango at a weeklong dance festival. The following year, Richard moved his festival to Stanford University and asked the Dinzelbachers back. Unfortunately, Raul Dinzelbacher, 40 years old, collapsed and died at the end of the third day of the festival. Nora Dinzelbacher was devastated but threw herself into her work, forming a dance performance troupe and teaching. She asked a student, George Guim, to become her assistant. They taught at a week-long dance festival in Port Townsend, Washington.

Throughout 1990, Luis Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Forever Tango&quot; played in eight West Coast cities, increasing viewer&#x27;s interest in learning the tango. Carlos Gavito and his partner Marcela Duran invented a dramatically different tango embrace in which both dancers leaned forward against each other more than was traditionally accepted. Gavito&#x27;s ultimate rise to fame came from this starring appearance in &quot;Forever Tango&quot;.

It is a very little-known fact, but Luis Bravo debuted Forever Tango in 1990 when Tango Argentino was on a break. He took 3 couples from the show &amp; Gloria and Eduardo to be the artistic directors. The show went on a hiatus until 1994 when it re-opened in San Francisco and then hit Broadway in 1996/1997.

In 1991, Richard Powers started The Stanford Tango Weeks, inviting Nora Dinzelbacher and two others to teach with him. Realizing there were no other alternatives and wanting to keep interest in Argentine Tango alive, Richard directed 8 more Tango Weeks in the years to come. The Stanford Tango Weeks became a popular annual event with 32 instructors teaching at the Roble Dance Hall at Stanford University over the course of its 7-year run. Juan Carlos Copes and Pablo Veron, both well-known teachers from Buenos Aires and actors in Argentine Tango inspired movies showed up to teach. Nora taught at each of the 9 Stanford Tango Weeks. The Stanford Tango Weeks have been credited by Tango dancers and teachers for being an essential catalyst for the growth of Argentine Tango in the United States. Richard produced the last Stanford Tango Week in 1997 and the same year the Tango Congress in Florida was being organized.

In 1998, with Bob Moretti, a retired USAF Lt. Col. and one of her students, Nora Dinzelbacher began a new festival in the same vein: &quot;Nora&#x27;s Tango Week&quot;, held in Emeryville, California. Moretti would continue to co-produce the festival until his death on June 22, 2005, just days before that year&#x27;s Tango Week.

In the first half of 1994, Barbara Garvey&#x27;s BAATA mailing list grew from 400 to 1,400 dancers. Garvey places the critical mass of the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s tango resurgence at this point. The number of regional milongas went from three per month to 30.

&quot;Forever Tango&quot; returned to the United States late in 1994, landing in Beverly Hills, then San Francisco, where it ran for 92 weeks. From there the show went to New York where it became the longest-running tango production in Broadway history.

In June 1995, Janis Kenyon held a tango festival at Northwestern University. Kenyon had attended Stanford Tango Week in 1993, where she met Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves. The pair were invited to teach at Kenyon&#x27;s 1995 Chicago event. The next year, Kenyon moved her festival to Columbus, Ohio, where she featured Osvaldo Zotto. In February 1997, Clay Nelson (a two-time attendee at Stanford Tango Week) organized his first ValenTango festival in Portland, Oregon; &quot;Tango Fantasy on Miami Beach&quot; was formed by Jorge Nel, Martha Mandel, Lydia Henson and Randy Pittman as Florida&#x27;s first tango festival; and the Portland October Tangofest was launched, again by Clay Nelson. 1999 saw a split in Miami: Nel and Mandel scheduled their &quot;United States Tango Congress&quot; to open a month prior to the Tango Fantasy event.

Daniel Trenner has been credited with bringing improvisational social Argentine tango to the United States. Like the Garveys, he first went to Buenos Aires in 1987, where he went to a milonga in Palermo and saw the traditional improvisational style being danced. Trenner was introduced to Miguel and Nelly Balmacera, a couple who would become his first tango teachers. Being fluent in both Spanish and English he was able to study with many Argentine tango masters, including Gustavo Naveira
and Mingo Pugliese. He made video tapes of the lessons he took and translated the Spanish instruction into English. In the late 1980s, Trenner brought his newfound appreciation of traditional tango back to New York and conducted classes. In 1991, Trenner began working with Rebecca Shulman in performing and teaching tango. (Shulman would go on to be a co-founder and director of TangoMujer in New York and Berlin.) In 1995, Trenner taught for ten weeks in Colorado, followed by some 15 of those students accompanying him to Buenos Aires. Out of this experience, &quot;Tango Colorado&quot; was formed by Tom Stermitz and other tango aficionados from Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins, and a twice-yearly tango festival was organized in Denver. Trenner had planted the seed and moved on. In this way, Trenner has been called the Johnny Appleseed of tango.

In 2002, the Folias Duo group is formed through their work as Argentine tango dance band leaders. In February 2009, the popular ABC series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; announced that the Argentine tango would be added to the list of dances for its eighth season, following the initiative by its British parent show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; the previous year.

There are numerous tango festivals in the United States: Seattle Tango Magic, Denver Memorial Day, Portland Valentango in Portland, Oregon, Denver Tango Festival in Denver, Colorado, Boston Tango Festival in Boston.

<text>Joe Don Baker (born February 12, 1936) is an American retired actor, known for playing &quot;tough guy&quot; characters on both sides of the law. He established himself as an action star with supporting roles the Westerns in &quot;Guns of the Magnificent Seven&quot; (1969) and &quot;Wild Rovers&quot; (1971), before his breakthrough role as real-life Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser in the film &quot;Walking Tall&quot; (1973).

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Baker found success playing both leading and supporting roles, including a mafia hitman in &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; (1973), a brute force detective in &quot;Mitchell&quot; (1975), a legendary baseball player in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), a police chief in the Chevy Chase comedy &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), and a morally dubious private investigator in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991). He played both a villain and an ally in three James Bond films: as Brad Whitaker in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987) with Timothy Dalton, and as CIA agent Jack Wade in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995) and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) with Pierce Brosnan.

For his portrayal of offbeat CIA agent Darius Jedburgh in the BBC television serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1985), he was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing Alabama governor Big Jim Folsom in the made-for-television film &quot;George Wallace&quot; (1997).

== Early life and education ==
Baker was born in Groesbeck, Texas, the son of Edna (née McDonald) and Doyle Charles Baker. He was raised by his aunt Anna Thompson after the death of his mother when he was 12. He played basketball and football (as linebacker and co-captain) at Groesbeck High School, and attended North Texas State College in Denton on a sports scholarship, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1958.

After serving in the United States Army for two years, Baker moved to New York City to study at the Actors Studio, of which he is a life member. He cited Robert Mitchum (whom he&#x27;d work with in &quot;Cape Fear&quot;) and Spencer Tracy as his inspirations.

== Career ==

=== Early roles ===
During the 1963–64 Broadway season, he appeared on stage in &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; at the ANTA Theatre in New York City. His career had its roots in television, though he did appear in several movies, including an uncredited part in the 1967 film &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;. He appeared in many television series, graduating to featured guest roles in such series as &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (in which he played a Harvard-educated Native American with a penchant for fighting) and &quot;Mod Squad&quot; (where he appeared as an illiterate vending machine robber). He was the title character in the 1971 TV movie &quot;Mongo&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;, starring Telly Savalas.

Standing at 6&#x27;2&quot; tall (189 cm), Baker&#x27;s physical prowess and stereotypical Texas drawl would prove perfect in Westerns, both on film and television. While working regularly on television on shows such as &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, he appeared in supporting roles in such films &quot;Guns of the Magnificent Seven&quot; (1969) and Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;Wild Rovers&quot;, but his film career did not quicken until he scored the role of Steve McQueen&#x27;s younger brother in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Junior Bonner&quot;, a film about a contemporary rodeo cowboy, which was released in late 1972.

=== &quot;Lancer&quot; ===
Baker appeared in the pilot episode of 1968&#x27;s &quot;Lancer&quot;, titled &quot;The High Riders&quot;, as the main villain, &quot;Day Pardee&quot;. This role was later fictionalized in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;—changed to &#x27;Decoteau&#x27; and played by Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton. He went on to appear in a later episode as Clovis Horner in 1970.

=== &quot;Walking Tall&quot; and stardom ===
In 1973, Baker had his breakthrough playing sherriff Buford Pusser in the biographical vigilante action film &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, directed by Phil Karlson. Released in February as a regional exploitation picture, &quot;Walking Tall&quot; connected with audiences and became an unexpected hit, circulating for national distribution with a new TV ad campaign using the slogan, &quot;When was the last time you stood up and applauded a movie?&quot; The film eventually earned $23 million at the box office. His performance was praised by influential film critic Pauline Kael, but he decided not to star in the sequel.

Later that year, his work in &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; helped solidify Baker&#x27;s reputation. He also co-starred with Robert Duvall in the 1973 crime film &quot;The Outfit.&quot;

He starred in the 1974 adventure film &quot;Golden Needles&quot;. In 1977 he had leading roles in &quot;Checkered Flag or Crash&quot; opposite Susan Sarandon and &quot;The Shadow of Chikara&quot; with Ted Neeley and Sondra Locke.

In 1975, he starred in the Phil Karlson&#x27;s final film, &quot;Framed.&quot;

On April 10, 1978, the two part television program &quot;To Kill a Cop&quot; premiered. In it Baker is paired with Louis Gossett Jr. as police detective. Baker co-starred with Karen Black in the miniseries &quot;Power&quot; (1980), a scarcely-disguised story of labor leader Jimmy Hoffa.

Baker played the Whammer, a baseball player modeled on Babe Ruth, in the 1984 baseball drama &quot;The Natural&quot;, which starred Robert Redford. In 1985, he portrayed the corrupt Chief Jerry Karlin in &quot;Fletch&quot;. In the UK, he played CIA agent Darius Jedburgh in the BBC Television drama serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. He was nominated for Best Actor by the British Academy Television Awards, losing to his co-star Bob Peck. Martin Scorsese directed him as a private detective in the 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, hired by protagonist Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) to protect his family from psychopathic ex-convict Max Cady (Robert De Niro).

Baker received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of North Texas in 1994.

While actor Carroll O&#x27;Connor was undergoing coronary bypass surgery, Baker took his place on the television series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. Baker appeared as Captain Tom Dugan, a retired police captain who substituted while O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s character was away at a police convention. More recently, he appeared in &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, and &quot;Strange Wilderness&quot;.

In 2009, Baker delivered another performance in &quot;The Cleaner&quot; on A&amp;E, playing an alcoholic military veteran attempting to help a friend cope with the loss of his son. He hires William Banks (played by Benjamin Bratt) to help him start back down the road to sobriety. Baker played King in &quot;Mud&quot; (2012).

===James Bond series===
In 1987, Baker played the villainous arms dealer Brad Whitaker in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, starring Timothy Dalton as 007. In 1995 and 1997, Baker returned to the series, this time playing a different character, CIA agent Jack Wade, in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. Baker is one of four actors to appear as both a Bond ally and a villain, the others being Charles Gray, who appeared as Henderson in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; and Ernst Stavro Blofeld in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;; Walter Gotell, who appeared as Morzeny, the SPECTRE Island trainer, in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; and as General Gogol, the chief of the KGB, in six films between 1977 and 1987; and Richard Kiel as Jaws, in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;, becoming Bond&#x27;s ally against villain Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) in the latter film.

<text>Ernst Leonard Lindelöf (; 7 March 1870 – 4 June 1946) was a Finnish mathematician, who made contributions in real analysis, complex analysis and topology. Lindelöf spaces are named after him. He was the son of mathematician Lorenz Leonard Lindelöf and brother of the philologist .

He was secretary of the Finnish Society of Science and Letters (societas scientiarum Fennica) in its centenary year, 1938. 
==Biography==
Lindelöf studied at the University of Helsinki, where he completed his PhD in 1893, became a docent in 1895 and professor of Mathematics in 1903. He was a member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters.

In addition to working in a number of different mathematical domains including complex analysis, conformal mappings, topology, ordinary differential equations and the gamma function, Lindelöf promoted the study of the history of Finnish mathematics. He is known for the Picard–Lindelöf theorem on differential equations and the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle, one of several refinements of the maximum modulus principle that he proved in complex function theory. He was the PhD supervisor for Lars Ahlfors at the University of Helsinki.

<text>When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up is the second studio album by Northern Irish–Scottish alternative rock band Snow Patrol, released on 5 March 2001 in the United States and 24 April in the United Kingdom.

The album charted at number 129 in the UK and failed to sell well upon its initial release, but its re-release saw it eventually go gold in the UK.

==Background==
The album was to be titled &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, and by June 2000, newer material like &quot;Chased By... I Don&#x27;t Know What&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; and &quot;One Night Is Not Enough&quot; was making its way into live performances. However, the album&#x27;s release was held over for six months. Gary Lightbody used this time to write more songs. &quot;Run&quot;, &quot;Chocolate&quot; and &quot;Spitting Games&quot; were written during this period, and later appeared on the next album &quot;Final Straw&quot;. On the tour following the release in March 2001, the band introduced &quot;Run&quot; to their audience, who received it very positively. In Lightbody&#x27;s words: &quot;I remember people&#x27;s jaws dropping, and the applause going on for longer than any of our other songs.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Hot Press&quot;″ Fiona Reid&#x27;s review of the album was extremely favourable, who found the album had plenty of &quot;magical moments&quot;. She felt that the album &quot;reaches a quiet place within the chaos&quot;, and declared it was a &quot;classic&quot;. She rated the album 11 out of 12. It was ranked #50 in CMJ New Music Top 75 in August 2001. Scott Juba of the website &quot;The Trades&quot; also praised the album, describing it along with its predecessor &quot;Songs for Polarbears&quot; as &quot;wonderful&quot;, giving special acclaim to the track &quot;An Olive Grove Facing the Sea&quot;.

<text>The Idaho Statesman is the daily newspaper of Boise, Idaho, in the western United States. It is owned by The McClatchy Company.

==History==
The paper was first published as the &quot;Idaho Tri-Weekly Statesman&quot; on July 26, 1864, by James S. Reynolds; it began publication from a log cabin on the current site of Boise City Hall. Reynolds owned and operated the paper for its first eight years, selling to Judge Milton Kelly in 1872. Kelly&#x27;s 17-year run ended in 1888, with the expansion to daily publication, and a name change: The &quot;Idaho Daily Statesman&quot;.

That summer, Kelly sold the paper to the Cobb family, which went on to run the paper for 70 years. Calvin Cobb published the &quot;Statesman&quot; until his death in 1928, when control was transferred to his daughter Margaret Cobb Ailshie. The paper&#x27;s history site says, &quot;Ailshie insisted on a lively editorial policy, deploring &#x27;a dull newspaper.&#x27;&quot;

Cobb Ailshie died in 1959, and general manager James Brown took control of the paper. Federated Publications bought the &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; in 1963. It joined five other publications in Washington, Indiana, and Michigan. Federated merged with Gannett in 1971. The paper then relocated operations to Curtis Road in Boise in 1972.

===Fire===
In the early morning of March 21, 2004, the &quot;Statesman&quot;″s pressroom caught on fire, which left two of the newspaper&#x27;s nine press units severely damaged and two units partially destroyed. Newspapers from other cities chipped in and helped deliver papers to Boise.

===Sale===
After 34 years of ownership, Gannett agreed to sell the &quot;Statesman&quot; to Knight Ridder on August 3, 2005, along with &quot;The Bellingham Herald&quot; and &quot;The Olympian&quot; newspapers in western Washington; McClatchy bought Knight Ridder the following year. On February 13, 2020, parent company McClatchy filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As of that date, they owned 30 newspapers nationwide.

===Outsourced printing===
In 2008, the &quot;Statesman&quot; entered into a strategic partnership with the Idaho Press to print the newspaper in Nampa, west of Boise. This partnership allowed the &quot;Statesman&quot; to reduce expenses amidst declining revenues. A decade later in 2018, printing moved to the in southeast of Boise.

Publications:
* &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; - daily newspaper
* &quot;Scene&quot; - weekly entertainment tabloid
* IdahoStatesman.com - online news
* &quot;Treasure Magazine&quot; - quarterly lifestyle magazine
* &quot;Business Insider&quot; - weekly business publication

=== Delivery changes ===
Beginning Oct. 9, 2023, the paper will decrease the number of print edition days to three a week (Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays). The week day papers will be delivered via the U.S. Mail.

==Notable people==
*E. L. &quot;Shorty&quot; Fuller was a photographer for the Statesman from 1937–1942. An archive of his work is found in the Idaho State Historical Society containing 3,000 of his negatives, prints and scrapbooks.

<text>Candice Sue Miller (née McDonald; born May 7, 1954) is an American politician serving as the Public Works Commissioner of Macomb County, Michigan since 2017. A member of the Republican Party, Miller previously served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2017, the Michigan Secretary of State from 1995 to 2003, and the Macomb County Treasurer from 1993 to 1995. She also served as the Harrison Township Supervisor. She was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2015.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
* United States House Committee on Administration (chairman)
In the 113th Congress, Representative Miller was appointed to serve as chairman of the Committee on House Administration (CHA), and in the 114th Congress she continued to serve as the committee&#x27;s chair. CHA was established in 1947 and is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives.The committee ensures that the House of Representatives runs in an effective and efficient manner. It also has jurisdiction over the federal election process.

Under her leadership as chair, the U.S. House received consecutive &quot;clean&quot; audits. She also played a major role in advancing legislation to end the practice of using millions of dollars in taxpayer funding to host political party conventions and, instead, redirected that funding for pediatric research. Working with House officers, she helped to increase the availability of low-cost digital tools used by the House to improve the House&#x27;s daily functions and reduce operating costs. She also oversaw the Committee&#x27;s review of the report generated by the Bauer-Ginsberg Commission, which focused on using local governance over elections and made recommendations to help locals election administrators improve upon their own voting processes.
* Committee on Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security
Representative Miller has served on the House Committee on Homeland Security since March 2008. She served as vice chair of the full House Committee on Homeland Security from January 2011 until December 2016 and served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security from 2011 until February 2016. She is also a member of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. The committee is charged with oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, Representative Miller initiated legislative efforts to ensure the nation&#x27;s borders are adequately secured against international terrorist organizations, illegal immigration, drug and human smuggling, and exploitation of the legitimate visa process.

During the 113th Congress, Representative Miller sponsored legislation to formally authorize Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and clarify the security mission of the agency for the first time since the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002. The legislation passed the House on July 28, 2014. She also advocated for ways to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s ability to identify and stop terrorists with western passports, authoring legislation in that would allow DHS to suspend a country&#x27;s participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it fails to provide the U.S. with pertinent traveler information related to terror threats. Representative Miller also crafted legislation to increase oversight of the maritime security mission of DHS, as well as to strengthen domestic maritime security connected to U.S. trade with its trusted partners.

Michigan&#x27;s 10th Congressional District is a border district. It is home to the Blue Water Bridge, the second-busiest border crossing on the northern tier; Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which has expanding missions in the area of homeland security; Coast Guard stations at Selfridge, Port Huron, and Harbor Beach; it borders Chemical Valley, which is one of the largest collections of petro-chemical operations in North America; the CN Rail Tunnel, the busiest rail artery in the U.S. Two important trade arteries, interstates I-94 and I-69, also originate in Michigan.

Miller focused her efforts on building a stronger presence of homeland security assets at Selfridge, enhancing the security of airways, roadways, railways, and waterways, and securing domestic food and water supplies by enhancing Northern Border security.

The Committee on Homeland Security was established in 2002 to provide congressional oversight for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and better protect the nation against a possible terrorist attack. Many of the programs at Selfridge and the armed service reserves throughout the 10th Congressional District fall under the purview of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Committee on Homeland Security provides oversight for the department and handles issues dealing with transportation security, border and port security, critical infrastructure protection, cyber security, and science and technology, emergency preparedness, emerging threats, intelligence and information sharing, investigations, and management and procurement.
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
** Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment

In 2007, Representative Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. She is also a member of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, as well as the Subcommittee on Aviation. Representative Miller is the only member from Michigan serving on this committee.

In 2014, Representative Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure&#x27;s Public-Private Partnership Special Panel. As the only Michigan Member, she focused her involvement on innovative ways that P3s can benefit infrastructure projects in Michigan like the expanded Customs and Border Plaza at the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron.

The committee&#x27;s broad oversight portfolio includes many federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard, Amtrak, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the General Services Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and others.

Throughout her career in public service, protecting the Great Lakes has been one of Representative Miller&#x27;s priorities. During the 113th Congress, as the only member of the committee from the state of Michigan, Miller advocated for the Great Lakes during House and conference negotiations of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) which included her provision designating all ports and harbors on the Great Lakes as a single, comprehensive navigation system (the Great Lakes Navigation System) for budgeting purposes. This created a unified front for Great Lakes ports and harbors for purposes of federal funding.

For the 110th Congress Miller was appointed to continue her service on the House Armed Services Committee and was added to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over not only surface transportation but also water quality issues related to the Great Lakes. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Miller was a member of the Armed Services committee, and part of a &quot;war room&quot; team that relayed information from the Bush administration to Republican members, the news media, and the public.

==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==
During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.

==Political positions==
Miller is a signatory of Grover Norquist&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which commits her to oppose tax increases.

Miller sat on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and has praised President Obama for his stance on off-shore oil exploration. She supports selling oil and gas leases to help fund the research and development of alternative energy projects.

In December 2010, Miller complained about the leak of US diplomatic cables, and called WikiLeaks a terrorist organisation.

On April 26, 2012, Miller voted for the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. It passed the House of Representatives, but did not become law.

===Sponsored legislation===
In June 2013, Miller introduced legislation, the Great Lakes Navigation System Sustainability Act of 2013 (), to redefine how the Great Lakes are treated in competing for United States government harbor maintenance funding, and to create an opportunity for recreational harbors to vie for federal funding.

Miller, along with Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, introduced , the Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2013. The bill would implement a biometric exit system that would monitor the exit of foreign visitors. The bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a biometric exit system for ten airports and ten seaports, test the system for two years, and then implement the system nationwide.

Miller also introduced, on November 14, 2013, , To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act to extend through 2018 the authority of the Federal Election Commission to impose civil money penalties on the basis of a schedule of penalties established and published by the commission, to expand such authority to certain other violations, and for other purposes. The bill would allow the FEC to continue to use a fee schedule to impose small fines on things such as late filings.

On January 10, 2014, Miller introduced the United States Customs and Border Protection Authorization Act (H.R. 3846; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its mission and direct the CBP in the United States Department of Homeland Security to establish standard procedures for addressing complaints made against CBP employees and to enhance training for CBP officers and agents. Miller said that &quot;Today, the House passed legislation that provides the necessary statutory authorization that will protect the agency&#x27;s mission by providing our officers and agents proper authorities to carry out their important work.&quot;

Miller also introduced a bill, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015 which has been criticized for casting US citizens of Arab, Iranian, and Muslim descent as second-class citizens in their own country – a &quot;legislation that will effectively create two classes of Americans – Americans with Middle Eastern or Muslim background, and Americans without that background&quot;.

Miller was ranked as the 71st most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

===Opposed legislation===
The bill Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress) passed in the House on March 4, 2014. The bill delayed indefinitely some of the reforms to the deeply indebted National Flood Insurance Program. The primary issue what the premiums should be on home and business owners located in flood zones. Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should. Miller suggested insurance premiums of being decided by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that &quot;too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater.&quot;

==Political campaigns==
===1986===
Miller was elected Harrison Township Supervisor in 1980, becoming the first woman and the youngest person ever to be elected to the position. In her first bid for federal office, Miller lost to 5-term incumbent Democrat David Bonior for Michigan&#x27;s 12th congressional district. Candace Miller was first elected to the Harrison Township board of commissioners.

===1992===
She was the first woman ever elected to the positions of Macomb County Treasurer and Secretary of State. Her 1992 upset of Democratic incumbent County Treasurer Adam Nowakowski was the first win for a Republican county-wide in Macomb County in more than 60 years.

===1994===
Miller was elected Michigan Secretary of State, unseating 6-term incumbent Richard H. Austin. She was the first Republican to serve as secretary of state in Michigan in 40 years since Owen Cleary left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including Wayne County, home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and the Reform Party&#x27;s Perry Spencer by 1 million votes, the largest margin of victory for a candidate running statewide in Michigan.

===2000===
Following her re-election it was reported in June 1999 that Miller, who was term-limited as Secretary of State, was considering running for Congress again, seeking a probable re-match against Bonior. She was also rumored to be considering running for the Republican nomination for governor, to succeed three-term Republican Gov. John Engler, who was term-limited. She ultimately passed on both races.

===2002===
After the 2000 United States Census, the Michigan Legislature reconfigured the state&#x27;s congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term Democrat David Bonior. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the Thumb. In the process, the legislature moved Miller&#x27;s home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior&#x27;s home in Mount Clemens to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior subsequently opted to run for the governor of Michigan rather than run for re-election to the USA House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary unopposed, and later in the general election in November she handily beat Democrat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a &quot;Hubert Humphrey Democrat&quot;, and Miller called herself a &quot;George W. Bush Republican.&quot; She outraised Marlinga, and secured the Teamsters Union (but not AFL–CIO) endorsement.

===2006===
Miller faced no opposition in the Republican primary, and was acclaimed as the Republican candidate on August 8, 2006. In the general election Miller was challenged by Democrat Robert Denison and three third-party candidates. Miller defeated Denison 178,843 to 84,574 votes.

===2008===

Miller was reelected against Democratic candidate Robert Denison, Libertarian candidate Neil Kiernan Stephenson, and Green candidate Candace Caveny.

During the 2008 Presidential election, Miller endorsed Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, &quot;When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation.&quot;

Miller spoke on behalf of Senator John McCain and was a vocal supporter of Governor Sarah Palin. She was a member of Gov. Palin&#x27;s &quot;truth squad&quot; leading up to the 2008 presidential election.

===2010===

Miller was challenged by Democratic nominee Henry Yanez, a Sterling Heights firefighter and paramedic. He is currently the chairman of the 10th District Democrats and was a delegate to the 2004 and 2008 Democratic National Conventions. Miller won reelection November 3, 2010 with nearly 72% of the vote, beating Yanez, two minor party candidates, and a write-in.

===2012===

Miller&#x27;s choice for chairman of Michigan&#x27;s 10th congressional district Republican committee lost to her former assistant secretary of state, Stanley Grot, a local Tea Party activist. Grot is chairman of the district committee, clerk of Shelby Township, and formerly a constituent relations representative in the Michigan Attorney General&#x27;s office. He has been president of the American Polish Cultural Center.

===2014===

Miller was challenged by Democratic nominee Chuck Stadler and Green nominee Harley Mikkelson, but she won reelection with 68.7% of the vote.

==Post-congressional career==
===Macomb County Public Works Commissioner===
In March 2015, Miller announced she would not seek re-election to Congress, and resigned at the end of the 114th Congress. Even though she was leaving Congress, Miller insisted that her career in public service was not over.

In March 2016, Miller announced she would seek the Republican nomination for the position of Macomb County Public Works Commissioner, challenging six-term incumbent Democrat Anthony Marrocco.

Miller defeated Marrocco in the general election, taking 55 percent of the vote. Marrocco is the third 24-year incumbent that Miller has defeated in her political career, after Nowakowski and Austin. She resigned her seat in the House on December 31, 2016, in order to take office as Public Works Commissioner the next day.

On January 1, 2017, her first day as Public Works Commissioner, Miller held a press conference at the site of a sinkhole in Fraser, Michigan. Miller, alongside County Executive Mark Hackel, announced she had spoken with Gov. Rick Snyder about obtaining emergency funds from the state and said that she believed Snyder would tour the site.

Miller&#x27;s first act upon taking office was placing Dino Bucci, who was a top deputy to Marrocco, on administrative leave, as he became the subject of a federal investigation along with Marrocco.

In May 2017, Miller confirmed that 10 employees from the public works department had been subpoenaed by the FBI to testify before a grand jury in a wide-ranging investigation into public corruption in Macomb County. Miller said the corruption that occurred under Marrocco was pervasive and widespread and that people used the office&#x27;s resources for personal use. In November 2017, Bucci was indicted on 18 felony counts including bribery, extortion, mail fraud, money laundering and embezzlement for his role in a decade-long conspiracy alleging a &quot;pay-to-play&quot; scheme under Marrocco. Bucci faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted On May 27, 2020, Marrocco was indicted on two counts of extortion and one count of attempted extortion for allegedly using Bucci and other county employees to force contractors and business people who wished to do business with the Public Works Department to buy tickets to his fundraisers. Bucci pleaded guilty the next day in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, admitting his role in Marrocco&#x27;s corrupt acts.

Miller announced plans to run for re-election in June 2018 and won the GOP nomination uncontested in August 2020 and faced Democratic nominee, Toni Moceri, a former Macomb County Commissioner in the general election. Miller won re-election in a landslide, taking more than 61 percent of the vote.

She received 1 vote in the second ballot of the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election from John James. Miller, along with Texas Republican Representative Kay Granger, is the first woman to receive a vote from a Republican during a Speakership election.

===Possible gubernatorial campaigns===
Miller has long been courted by the Michigan Republican Party to run for governor, with speculation on her gubernatorial aspirations dating back to 1999. Miller was considered one of the leading contenders for the Republican nomination in Michigan&#x27;s 2018 gubernatorial election to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Snyder She ultimately passed on the race and announced on September 23, 2017, that she was endorsing Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, saying &quot;...I think he&#x27;s actually going to be the next governor.&quot;

Following her re-election as Public Works Commissioner, Miller was again at the top of the Michigan GOP to run for governor in 2022 to challenge Democratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In December 2020, former Republican Lt Gov. Brian Calley said Miller was the &quot;dream candidate&quot; for many in the Republican Party. In January 2021, Miller announced that she would not run for governor.

==Personal life==
She is a graduate of Lake Shore High School of St. Clair Shores, Michigan.

Miller&#x27;s husband Donald Miller served as Circuit Court judge in the 16th Circuit Court for Macomb County. He was a fighter pilot, flew combat missions in Vietnam, commanded the Selfridge Air National Guard Base and retired from the Air National Guard as a colonel. He died in January 2019 at the age of 80. Their daughter is a member of the United Auto Workers Union.

<doc id="960678" wikidata="Q7737715" url="?curid=960678" title="Great Devonian Controversy">
<text>The Great Devonian Controversy began in 1834 when Roderick Murchison disagreed with Henry De la Beche as to the dating of certain petrified plants found in coals in the Greywacke stratum in North Devon, England. De La Beche was claiming that since Carboniferous fossils were found deep in the Greywacke stratum, which itself was older than the Carboniferous period, this method of dating rocks was not valid. Murchison, in contrast, claimed that De La Beche had not placed the fossils correctly, as they were occurring quite near the top of the stratum as opposed to deep within it. De La Beche soon agreed with Murchison&#x27;s argument as to the placing of fossils but maintained that since a layer of Old Red Sandstone, present in other formations, was missing between the layer of older rock and this new formation, there was still insufficient evidence to suggest the formation was not part of the older Silurian strata.

There followed much debate and some extensive investigations which ranged as far as Russia, where in 1840 Murchison discovered a layer similar to the one found in Devon placed between well-defined Silurian and Carboniferous deposits. This discovery put an end to the controversy and led to the definition of a new period called Devonian.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Traditional World Music Album was an honor presented to recording artists between 2004 and 2011 for quality traditional world music albums. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The Grammy Award for Best World Music Album was first presented at the 34th Grammy Awards in 1992. The category remained unchanged until 2004, when it was split into separate awards for Best Traditional World Music Album and Best Contemporary World Music Album. The first award for Best Traditional World Music Album was presented to the Sherab Ling Monastery at the 46th Grammy Awards for the album &quot;Sacred Tibetan Chant&quot;. In 2011, a major overhaul of the Grammy categories resulted in the merge of the two awards to a single Best World Music Album category beginning in 2012.

<text>Robert Mason &quot;Bob&quot; Carlisle (born September 29, 1956) is an American Contemporary Christian singer and songwriter. He performed with several bands, most notably Allies and Billy Thermal, before launching a solo career where he received a Grammy Award and four Dove Awards.

==Career==

Carlisle is best known for his hit song &quot;Butterfly Kisses&quot;, which appeared on his third solo album. That album, originally titled &quot;Shades of Grace&quot;, was later re-released as &quot;Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace)&quot;, because of the success of the single. He co-wrote this song with his songwriting partner from Allies, Randy Thomas, and for this, they won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Country Song and three Dove Awards, including Song of the Year. This song was also a country chart single that same year for Jeff Carson and the Raybon Brothers. After &quot;Butterfly Kisses,&quot; Carlisle continued to record for movie soundtracks and with other artists, but could not match the success of his surprise hit.

<doc id="960702" wikidata="Q544490" url="?curid=960702" title="Alekhine's Defence">
<text>Alekhine&#x27;s Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

:1. 

Black tempts White&#x27;s pawns forward to form a broad , with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White&#x27;s imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian observes of Alekhine&#x27;s Defence in &quot;MCO-15&quot; (2008), &quot;The game immediately loses any sense of symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting players.&quot;
== History ==
The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament in games against Endre Steiner and Fritz Sämisch. Four years later, the editors of the Fourth Edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;MCO-4&quot;) wrote: Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the &#x27;hypermodern school&#x27; than the bizarre defence introduced by Alekhine ... . Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his King&#x27;s Knight to be driven about the board in the early stages of the game, in the expectation of provoking a weakness in White&#x27;s centre pawns.

Alekhine did not consider himself part of a hypermodern revolution, however, and was quoted as referring to the hypermodern school of thought as &quot;this cheap bluff, this shameless self-publicity&quot;, preferring to view such moves as adjustments or exceptions to the standard chess theory of central placement and control. 

In addition to Alekhine, another early exponent of the defence was Ernst Grünfeld.

== Use ==
Alekhine&#x27;s Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Bobby Fischer used it in two games against Boris Spassky in the World Chess Championship 1972, and Viktor Korchnoi also included the defence in his , leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine&#x27;s Defence is not so common at the top level. De Firmian observes, &quot;The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good.&quot; The opening&#x27;s current highest-rated proponent is Grandmaster (GM) Vassily Ivanchuk, although Lev Alburt played it at grandmaster level almost exclusively during his career and was responsible for many contributions in both theory and practice. Currently, GMs Alexander Shabalov and Artashes Minasian use the opening with regularity, while Levon Aronian, Michael Adams, and Hikaru Nakamura will use it on occasion. Magnus Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently but he has used it occasionally in competitive games, most notably to defeat the former world chess champion Veselin Topalov at Linares 2008.

A game by Napoléon Bonaparte from the 19th century shows one of the oldest-known examples of Alekhine&#x27;s Defence being employed in a game. Napoléon won the game.

== Main line: 2.e5 Nd5 ==
After the usual 2.e5 Nd5, three main variations of Alekhine&#x27;s Defence use 3.d4, but there are other options for White at this point. Two of the main lines are the Exchange Variation and the Four Pawns Attack. The Exchange Variation continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6. White has some advantage. Black can capitalise on the half-open centre with ...g6, ...Bg7 with ...Bg4 eventually being played. The Four Pawns Attack continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4. White has a somewhat larger space advantage though the centre is not fixed. Black has a number of options. Black can play ...Qd7 with ...0-0-0 and ...f6 putting pressure on White&#x27;s d-pawn. Black can play ...Nb4 with ...c5 with idea to exchange the d-pawn. Finally, Black can play ...Be7 with ...0-0 and ...f6 attacking the centre. Minor variations include O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Gambit, 3.d4 b5 (intending 4.Bxb5 c5 5.dxc5 Qa5+), and 3.d4 d6 4.Bc4, the Balogh Variation.

=== Four Pawns Attack: 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4 ===
 
The Four Pawns Attack is White&#x27;s most ambitious line against the Alekhine&#x27;s, and the variation which perhaps best illustrates the basic idea behind the defence: Black allows White to make several tempo-gaining attacks on the knight and to erect an apparently imposing pawn centre in the belief that it can later be destroyed. The game can become very since White must either secure an advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. In addition, while White has built a crushing centre, it also becomes undesirable to advance further – c5 can give the Black knight the d5-outpost, while d5 is usually undesirable due to it critically weakening e5. While the main target of Black is d4, the pawn on c4 also can be pressurized considerably via ...Na5. The Four Pawns Attack is not particularly popular because many White players are wary of entering a sharp tactical line that Black may have prepared. The main line continues 5...dxe5 6.fxe5 Nc6 (attacking d4) 7.Be3 (7.Nf3 allows 7...Bg4! when the pressure on d4 is very tough) Bf5 (first developing before ...e6) 8.Nc3 e6. White now usually plays 9.Nf3 to protect e5, thus preparing a potential d5 advance, and since 9...Bg4!? would cost Black a tempo, though it is still an option for Black, as it adds pressure against d4, though after an exchange with ...Bxf3 gxf3 White would get the and an even stronger centre with the f-pawn. The main line is 9...Be7, preparing ...f6 to break apart White&#x27;s centre. White used to automatically play 10.d5 in response to counter this, which can lead to complex and sharp play. However, a recent development has been 10.Be2 0-0 11.0-0 f6 12.exf6 Bxf6 13.Qd2 (preparing Rad1 and also connecting rooks) Qe7 (Black in turn connecting rooks and also preparing ...Rad8) 14.Rad1 Rad8 15.Kh1! which in Robson–Naroditsky, US Championship 2021, led to a win for White in 48 moves. The point of this move is that it prevents the ...e5 push, with the extra point of moving the king out of the a7–g1 diagonal. Black also has a weakness in the form of the isolated e6-pawn, while White still has a space advantage. An alternative move is 9...Qd7, which has become popular recently aiming to castle and attack White&#x27;s , while 9...Bb4 is another line that tries to be more active than ...Be7, but the c3-knight has little role in the defence and thus the line is less popular than the others.

An alternative is 5...g5, the sharp Planinc Variation (also known as the Cambridge Gambit). If White slips up with 6.fxg5, then 6...dxe5 wrecks White&#x27;s centre and pawn structure. The line is named after GM Albin Planinc, who championed it in the 1970s. It was then taken up in the 1990s by correspondence player Michael Schirmer, whose games were noted in a recent book on Alekhine&#x27;s Defence by British GM and Alekhine exponent Nigel Davies.

Alternative moves for Black after 5.f4 are 5...g6, the Fianchetto Variation, and 5...Bf5, the Trifunovic Variation.

=== Exchange Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 ===
The Exchange Variation is less ambitious than the Four Pawns Attack. White trades pawns, accepting a more modest spatial advantage. Black&#x27;s main decision is whether to recapture with the solid 5...exd6, which will lead to a fairly strategic position, or the more ambitious 5...cxd6 when Black has a preponderance of pawns in the centre. The third recapture 5...Qxd6 is also possible since the fork 6.c5 can be answered by 6...Qe6+, but the line is considered inferior since Black will sooner or later need to deal with this threat.

In the sharper 5...cxd6 line, Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. To do this, a usual plan involves a fianchetto of the to g7, playing the other bishop to g4 to remove a knight on f3 which is a key defender of d4, while black knights on b6 and c6 bear down on the white pawns on c4 and d4. Cox gave the game Jainy Gomes–Guillermo Soppe, São Paulo 2001 to illustrate Black&#x27;s intentions.

A popular setup from White to prevent Black&#x27;s plan is the Voronezh Variation (named after the Russian city Voronezh, where the line was invented, by players such as Grigory Sanakoev). The Voronezh is defined by the opening sequence 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 cxd6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Be3 Bg7 8.Rc1 0-0 9.b3. White&#x27;s setup delays kingside so that Black has trouble developing pieces in a fashion that harasses White&#x27;s pieces and assails the centre pawns; for instance there is no knight on f3 which can become a target after ...Bg4, and no bishop on d3 which may be a target after ...Nc6–e5. While 9...Nc6 is Black&#x27;s most common reply according to ChessBase&#x27;s database, after 10.d5 Ne5 Black&#x27;s knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2–f4, and this line has scored very poorly for Black. The main line in the Voronezh, and the second most common reply, is 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.c5 N6d7 (this retreat is forced since 12...Nd5?? loses the knight due to the 13.Rd1 pin) when Black must play carefully to unentangle and challenge the white pawn on c5. Other lines against the Voronezh include 9...f5 leading to sharp play. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7, ...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible as well. According to John Cox, the 9...e5 line is adequate, but Black needs to know the line well.

The Voronezh was recommended by John Emms and noted as a big problem by Nigel Davies, leading many players to opt for the more solid 5...exd6 line. However, the line offers Black less opportunity for counterplay. In this line Black usually develops the king bishop via ...Be7 and ...Bf6, because Bg5 can be bothersome against a fianchetto setup with ...g6 and ...Bg7, e.g. 6.Nc3 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Bg5.

Although the 5...exd6 structure resembles the Exchange French, Black can make several attempts to imbalance the position. First, Black should play 6...Nc6 against almost any White move to prevent White from establishing an ideal Nc3, Bd3, Nge2 setup. If White attempts this, Black can strike the d3-bishop with ...Nb4. Second, Black should castle and maneuver ...Be7–f6. After sufficient preparation, a common Black plan is to push ...d5. If White replies with c5, Black can respond with the unusual-looking ...Nc8 with the idea to maneuver the knight ...Nc8–e7–f5 to strike at the weak d4-pawn.

=== Modern Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 ===
The Modern Variation is the most common variation of the Alekhine Defence. As in the Exchange Variation, White accepts a more modest spatial advantage with the expectation of maintaining it. There are a number of possible Black responses:
*4...Bg4, pinning the knight is the most common response, which White usually parries with 5.Be2. Black will often voluntarily surrender the bishop pair by ...Bxf3 because the white knight is a fairly strong piece, and capturing it undermines the white centre pawns. Champions of this line include Lev Alburt, Vlatko Kovačević and the late Vladimir Bagirov.
*4...g6, preparing to fianchetto a bishop to oppose White&#x27;s central pawn mass, is also often seen. This variation was played in the thirteenth game of the Match of the Century between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. (The nineteenth game of the same match featured the more common 4...Bg4.) Alburt has also played this line frequently. White usually replies with 5.Bc4, the Keres Variation.
*4...dxe5 (the Larsen Variation) eliminates the advanced pawn, but brings forward the white knight after 5.Nxe5. Challenging this knight immediately with 5...Nd7 can lead to the sharp sacrificial line 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qh5+ Ke6. The sacrifice is, at the very least, good enough to draw after 8.Qg4+; Larsen tried the suicidal 8...Kd6? against Fischer during the Santa Monica Blitz tournament in 1966, and lost quickly after 9.c4. Black should therefore acquiesce to the perpetual check with 8...Kf7 9.Qh5+ Ke6 etc. Instead, 8.c4 can be played if White is aiming to win. White can also simply retreat the knight with 6.Nf3. If Black does not want to allow the sacrifice, other options after 5.Nxe5 are 5...g6 (the Kengis Variation) and 5...c6 (the Miles Variation). The idea behind both moves is to challenge the e5-knight with ...Nd7 only after the sacrifice on f7 has become unsound. The Kengis Variation looks more natural but White has several sharp ideas such as 6.c4 and the wild 6.Qf3!?. Therefore, 5...c6 has become more common; despite the passive look this waiting move discourages White&#x27;s most ambitious continuations. Now 6.c4 can be met with the very interesting 6...Nb4!? while 6.Bc4 can either transpose to quieter lines of the Kengis or give rise to independent variations in which Black avoids the king&#x27;s bishop fianchetto. White&#x27;s most popular move is 6.Be2 (6.Bd3!?) when Black continues with either the immediate 6...Nd7 or 6...Bf5. Against the latter an aggressive possibility (introduced by Kasparov against Short and then improved by Judit Polgar) is 7.g4!?. In top-level chess, the line with 5...c6 has largely displaced 4...Bg4 as the main line.
*4...c6 is passive but solid, creating a position that is difficult to attack.
In most variations, Black can play ...Bg4 to transpose into the 4...Bg4 line.
=== Balogh Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.Bc4 ===
The first recorded use of this variation was Canal–Colle, Karlovy Vary 1929. White resigned after Black&#x27;s 40th move.

Unlike several other sidelines, 4.Bc4 is fairly popular. The line contains some traps that can snare the unwary. For example, 4...dxe5 5.dxe5 Nb6?? loses the queen to 6.Bxf7+ Instead, the main line is 4...Nb6 5.Bb3, when Black has usually played 5...dxe5 6.Qh5 e6 7.dxe5 (the &quot;old main line&quot; according to Cox) or 5...Bf5 when White can among other things try the obstructive pawn sacrifice 6.e6. In either case, White obtains attacking chances, and so Taylor recommends 5...d5 followed by 6...e6 to reach a position akin to the French Defence.

=== Two Pawns Attack: 3.c4 Nb6 4.c5 ===
The Two Pawns Attack (also known as the Lasker Attack or the Chase Variation) is also an ambitious try. White may gain attacking prospects, but it might cost a pawn to do so. White&#x27;s pawns on c5 and e5 secure a spatial advantage, but the d5-square has been weakened. Unlike the Four Pawns Attack, the white centre is not as fluid and the game takes on a more strategic character.

Aesthetically, 4.c5 looks positionally suspect, since White&#x27;s pawn advances have severely weakened the d5-square. White&#x27;s intention is to grab space and mobility so that those strategic deficiencies are of little consequence.

Black must play 4...Nd5, whereupon White will usually challenge the knight with moves like Bc4 and Nc3. Black can defend the knight with ...c6 or ...e6, sometimes playing both. Typically, Black then challenges White&#x27;s pawns on e5 and c5 with moves like ...d6 and ...b6.

The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black&#x27;s main defences scoring at least 50%.
=== Two Knights Variation: 3.Nc3 ===
In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately accepts doubled pawns after 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. Although the line after 4...d6, challenging the e-pawn often can lead to fairly dull positions, the position remains open and Black can quickly succumb with poor defence (for example 5.Bc4 dxe5?? loses the queen to 6.Bxf7+!). After 4.bxc3 White&#x27;s compensation for the doubled pawns is a big centre that can be used as a basis for a kingside attack. The resulting pawn structure leads to a position similar to that of the Winawer Variation of the French Defence.

If Black does not want to defend against White&#x27;s attacking opportunities against 3...Nxc3 4.dxc3, then 3...e6 is a reasonable alternative that was Alekhine&#x27;s choice when meeting the Two Knights, and this defence has been advocated by Taylor. If White plays 4.d4, then 4...Nxc3 forces White into the bxc3 line reminiscent of the French. If 4.Nxd5 exd5, Black will quickly dissolve the doubled pawns with ...d6, and the resulting position will tend to be drawish.
=== Minor sidelines after 2.e5 Nd5 ===

In Steiner–Alekhine, Budapest 1921, the first high-level game with the Alekhine Defence, White played 3.d4 d6 4.Bg5. Cox recommends 4...h6 5.Bh4 dxe5 6.dxe5 Bf5, followed by ...Nc6 and ...Ndb4, targeting c2.

Another rare line, but one that scores well in practice is 3.d4 d6 4.Be2, preventing Black from playing 4...Bg4 while retaining the option of making the pawn advance f2–f4.
After 3.c4 Nb6 4.a4 (the Emory Tate line), White can aim at chasing the black knight away followed by a pawn sacrifice that impairs Black&#x27;s development, for example by 4...d6 5.a5 N6d7 6.e6, but this leaves Black with a strong centre and an almost-winning position, though the threat of a5 still looms. Black can prevent this with 4...a5. White&#x27;s main continuation is to deploy the for duties on the kingside with 5.Ra3, followed by Rg3 at some point when the attack on g7 is supposed to inhibit the development of Black&#x27;s bishop to e7. However, after 5...d6 6.exd6 exd6 7.Rg3 Bf5, Black can carry through with 8...Be7 anyway, since after 9.Rxg7 the rook would be trapped and lost to 9...Bg6 and 10...Bf6. The idea for this unusual early &quot;rook lift&quot; probably originated with the American International Master Emory Tate. Women&#x27;s World Champion GM Mariya Muzychuk, World Junior Champion GM Lu Shanglei and GM Nazar Firman have experimented with this line and achieved some success with it.
=== Alternatives to 2...Nd5 ===
After 2.e5, 2...Nd5 is almost universally played. The two other knight moves that do not it to the queen on d1 are 2...Ng8 and 2...Ne4.

*2...Ng8, undeveloping the knight, was named the &quot;Brooklyn Defence&quot; in honour of his hometown by GM Joel Benjamin, who calls this his &quot;pet line&quot;. Although Black might be said to be giving odds of three moves, White only has a small advantage according to theory. The first recorded use of this line was in 1905 in Vienna where Aron Nimzowitsch with white checkmated Adolf Albin on the 34th move.
*Very dubious is 2...Ne4?, which John L. Watson and Eric Schiller dub the &quot;Mokele Mbembe&quot;. They analyse 3.d4 f6 4.Bd3 d5 5.f3 Ng5 6.Bxg5 fxg5 7.f4! g6! 8.Nf3! g4 (they also analyse 8...gxf4 9.Ng5! e6 10.Qg4! Qe7 11.0-0 and 8...Bg4 9.h3, both leading to a large advantage for White) 9.Ng5 Bh6 10.Nxh7 Rxh7 11.Bxg6+ Rf7 12.Qd3 Bf8 13.f5 e6 14.f6 Qd7 15.h3! g3 16.Qxg3, with a winning advantage for White. &quot;Nunn&#x27;s Chess Openings&quot; concludes that White gets a large advantage with 3.d4 f6 (or 3...e6 4.Nh3 h6 5.Qg4 d5 6.f3 h5 7.Qf4 g5 8.Nxg5 Nxg5 9.Qxg5 Be7 10.Qg7) 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qh4 d5 6.Bd3.

== 2.Nc3 ==
Instead of chasing Black&#x27;s knight, White may defend the e4-pawn, either directly or through tactical means.

2.Nc3 is by far White&#x27;s most common alternative to 2.e5; in fact Cox noted that he saw this move in over half his games with the Alekhine. It is often played by amateurs and those wishing to avoid a theoretical battle on territory more familiar to their opponents. Cox wrote that many White players are bluffing, however, and in fact know nothing about either the Vienna Game or the Four Knights Game, to which the game can easily transpose if Black plays 2...e5, citing one book which recommended 2.Nc3 while assuring readers that 2...e5 is uncommon. Another transposition Black may enter is 2...d6, which usually leads to the Pirc Defence.

The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. After 2...d5, 3.exd5 Nxd5 4.Bc4, 4...Nb6 or 4...Nxc3 is considered roughly , while 4...e6 is solid but blocks in the light-squared bishop. 4.g3 has been played by the Danish correspondence player Ove Ekebjaerg, when Harald Keilhack recommends 4...Nxc3 5.bxc3 Qd5! 6.Qf3! (6.Nf3 Qe4+ is awkward in light of 7.Be2 Bh3 or 7.Qe2 Qxc2) Qe6+! 7.Qe2 (&quot;on 7.Be2 or 7.Ne2, 7...Bd7 is unpleasant&quot;) Qxe2+ 8.Nxe2 Bd7! 9.Bg2 Bc6 10.0-0 Bxg2 11.Kxg2 Nc6 12.d3 g6 13.Rb1 0-0-0 14.c4 Bg7, when &quot;Black has a rather comfortable position&quot;, as in Ekebjaerg–Alcantara Soares, corr. 1989.

More combative after 2...d5 is 3.e5, when Black can choose among 3...d4, 3...Nfd7 (transposing to the Steinitz Variation of the French Defence after 4.d4 e6, but 4.e6!? is a sharp alternative), 3...Ne4!?, and even 3...Ng8. After 3...d4 can follow 4.Nce2 Ng4, or 4.exf6 dxc3 5.fxg7 cxd2+ leading to quick castling for White.

While most grandmasters play the mainline 2.e5, Jonny Hector regularly plays 2.Nc3 against the Alekhine, and has scored well against the 2...d5 variation. His ideas have left White with a theoretical edge. Textbook authors of the Alekhine Defence, including Davies, Cox, and Taylor, have therefore encouraged 2...e5 over 2...d5.

== Other 2nd moves for White ==
*2.d3, the Maroczy Variation, is less common. Although , 2.d3 blocks in White&#x27;s light-squared bishop, so the variation is considered somewhat passive. If White fianchettoes that bishop, transposition to a King&#x27;s Indian Attack is likely. Lev Alburt and Eric Schiller call 2.d3 &quot;insipid&quot; and recommend 2...d5 (or 3.Nd2 e5 with a reversed Philidor&#x27;s Defence) 3.e5 Nfd7 4.f4 (4.d4 c5 5.c3 Nc6 leaves Black a tempo up on the French Defence) c5 5.Nf3 e6 6.g3!? Nc6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.0-0 b5 with equality.
*2.Qe2 e5 with an equal game. 
*2.Bc4, the Krejczik Variation, is rarely seen, since it allows Black to gain the bishop pair and seize space in the . Alburt and Schiller write that after 2...Nxe4 3.Bxf7+ (the Krejcik Gambit) Kxf7 4.Qh5+ Kg8 or 4...g6 5.Qd5+ e6 6.Qxe4 Bg7 7.Qf4+ Ke8! &quot;Black has nothing to worry about.&quot; Playable alternatives include 2...e5 (transposing to the Bishop&#x27;s Opening), 2...d5, and 2...e6.
*2.Bd3 aims to transpose into a Kopec System.
*2.c4 gambits the e4-pawn in favour of superior development after 2...Nxe4 3.Nf3. While very rare, the line has been played a few times in grandmaster play, including a transposition to the King&#x27;s Indian Defence after 2...g6 3.Nc3. 
*2.f3 is also rare, but players who like to play the Black side of the Latvian Gambit can in effect wind up playing it after 1.e4 Nf6 2.f3 e5 3.f4!?.
*2.Nf3, the John Tracy Gambit, is a poor choice, leading to the loss of the for doubtful compensation.

== &quot;ECO&quot; ==
The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; has four codes for Alekhine&#x27;s Defence, B02 through B05:
*B02: 1.e4 Nf6
*B03: 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 (including the Exchange Variation and Four Pawns Attack)
*B04: 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 (Modern Variation without 4...Bg4)
*B05: 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 Bg4 (Modern Variation with 4...Bg4)

<doc id="960705" wikidata="Q6772452" url="?curid=960705" title="Marple, Greater Manchester">
<text>Marple is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is on the River Goyt, south-east of Manchester, north of Macclesfield and south-east of Stockport. At the 2021 census, the built up area had a population of 12,970.

It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. The town lies along the Peak Forest Canal, which contains the Marple Lock Flight and Marple Aqueduct. The Roman Lakes, to the south-east of the town centre, attracts anglers and walkers. The town is served by two railway stations: Marple and Rose Hill Marple, providing access to the rail network in Greater Manchester and beyond. It is also close to the Middlewood Way, a shared use path following the former Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway line south from Rose Hill to Macclesfield.

==History==

===Etymology===
The first reference to Marple in written history was to &quot;Merpel&quot;, believed to be derived from the Old English &quot;maere pill&quot;, meaning &#x27;the stream at the boundary&#x27;.

===Early history===
Scientists estimate that the earliest residents of the area settled several millennia ago. There are clues to their existence around the Ludworth area where there are standing stones and tumuli. This was confirmed around 1998 when an archaeological dig in Mellor revealed many clues about the existence of Marple&#x27;s earliest residents.
The area was predominantly within the Macclesfield Forest, and was omitted from the Domesday Book survey. The first mention of the area was in 1122 in a deed for the sale of land. In 1220 the land passed to the Vernon family where it remained for several generations.
The pre–Industrial Revolution inhabitants of the village mostly worked on small farms and others specialised in linen weaving and hatting. After 1790, Samuel Oldknow transformed much of this lifestyle, with the construction of lime kilns and mills as part of the Industrial Revolution. The population of the village began to rise, with the construction of terraces to house mill workers and the formation of a village centre filled with private businesses.

Samuel Oldknow also played a large role in the development of the town in addition to his mills; there is still a street named Oldknow Road in Marple today. He built workers&#x27; cottages and churches, introduced aspen trees to the area, and assisted in the constructions of the Macclesfield and Peak Forest Canals. Marple Aqueduct, which opened in 1800, carries the Peak Forest Canals over the River Goyt, was designed by Benjamin Outram, a pioneer in the building of canals and tramways. Seven men lost their lives during its construction. Samuel Oldknow died in 1828; his mill was destroyed by fire in 1892. These navigations accelerated Marple&#x27;s growth, but eventually declined into disrepair when the railway arrived in 1865. They have since been restored for use by leisure narrowboats, now forming part of the Cheshire Ring.

===Recent history===

In the early 1900s the town prospered from the success of cotton in nearby Stockport and Manchester; the canals in the area served as a link with other industrial towns. Marple grew as a residential suburb of Stockport after the arrival of frequent bus and rail services in the 1920s.

==Geography==
The area, close to Derbyshire, covers just over of countryside, ranging from heavily wooded valleys to hill-top moorland. It rises from around above sea level at the River Goyt to at Cobden Edge. On a clear day it is possible to view the Beetham Tower in Manchester as well as the city centre, the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the surrounding counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire and West Yorkshire and the mountains of North Wales from the top of these hills.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Marple, at metropolitan borough level: Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. Two wards for council elections are named after Marple: Marple North and Marple South and High Lane. For national elections, Marple forms part of the Hazel Grove constituency.

===Administrative history===
Marple was historically a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Marple also became a civil parish.
In 1875, Marple was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1922, Marple Urban District Council bought Hollins House to serve as its headquarters; the grounds of the house were gifted to the council at the same time by the Carver family for converting into Marple Memorial Park, being Marple&#x27;s war memorial.

The urban district was significantly enlarged in 1936 to take in the area of the two neighbouring parishes of Ludworth (which included Marple Bridge) and Mellor. Ludworth and Mellor were on the east bank of the River Goyt, and had been in Derbyshire prior to being transferred into Marple.

Marple Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester.

===Public services===
Water is supplied to the area by United Utilities. The nearest NHS hospital is Stepping Hill in Stockport, which is run by the Stockport NHS Foundation Trust. Marple has a police station, served by Greater Manchester Police, close to the library and Memorial Park. It also has a fire station, run by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, located behind the Asda supermarket in the town centre.

==Culture and community==

Since 1932, Marple has had a cinema in a building designed in 1878 as a place of worship or refuge. The building was purchased in 1932 by the &#x27;Marple Cinema Company&#x27; and became the Regent Cinema. It remains open as one of the few independent cinemas in the UK.

The town has two brass bands: the Marple Band and the Hawk Green (Marple) Band.
Marple is twinned with the town Motril in the province of Granada in Spain.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by Salford-based BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West and Your FM, a community-based station which broadcast from Stockport.

The town is served by the local newspaper the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

===Film appearances===
In 2008, Marple was used as the setting for the BBC drama &quot;Sunshine&quot;.

Marple featured in a 2010 BBC documentary on Dr Beeching which described the long-term effects of axing much of the UK railway network in the 1960s. The programme highlighted the transport issues and how getting a direct train from Marple to Stockport was now impossible and the road traffic made the journey one of the most difficult in the UK.

==Landmarks==

Marple is notable for its series of 16 canal locks, known as Marple Lock Flight, close to the village centre. The Peak Forest Canal skirts the village, north running alongside Marple Memorial Park and Brabyns Park until it reaches the Marple Aqueduct and on to Dukinfield Junction, and south towards Bugsworth Basin. Macclesfield Canal meets the Peak Forest Canal at Marple Junction, and heads towards Birmingham. The two canals form part of the Cheshire Ring canal system; the canals served as a vital link during the Industrial Revolution. Nowadays they provide an area of relaxation for walkers, anglers and boaters.

The Roman Lakes leisure complex, in the valley bottom close to Strines, is popular with walkers, anglers, nature lovers and horse riders. The area was named in the Victorian era as an attraction to tourists, not because it had links with the Romans (also true of Roman Bridge, a packhorse bridge over the Goyt). In the area closest to the river there was a mill built by Samuel Oldknow and destroyed by fire in 1892. In 2011, volunteers uncovered the wheelpit and entrance footings to the mill and are currently seeking funds to continue the exploration. The wheelpit, which when built was the largest in the world, is now viewable.

The Middlewood Way is a 10-mile walking and cycling path between Marple and Macclesfield, following the line of the former Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway.

===Marple Hall===

Marple Hall was close to where Marple Hall School now stands. The remains of the hall can be explored, though very little remains. The hall was the ancestral home of the Bradshaws and passed to the Isherwoods. It was demolished in 1959 after it was offered to the council in 1954 by the writer Christopher Isherwood, who had inherited it. By this time the hall had been ransacked by vandals and looters. Much of the estate is now residential housing or the school. The old hall foundations can be seen on the corner of Marple Hall Drive. There is a plaque on a piece of stone, the only remaining lintel from the house. The shutters from its windows are restored and on display in Marple Library. The hall overlooked the River Goyt and it is still possible to walk from there to the river following a pathway which once led to the Dooley Lane entrance to the estate. Nearby Brabyn&#x27;s Hall suffered a similar fate. Wyberslegh Hall, now in private ownership, stood ruined for a time.

In a letter, Agatha Christie explained to a fan that while she was staying with a sister in Cheshire (her elder sister Margaret &quot;Madge&quot; had married Sir James Watt of Abney Hall) they went to a sale at Marple Hall. There Christie bought two Jacobean oak chairs which she still possessed at the time of writing and, wanting a name for her old-maid character in &quot;The Thirteen Problems&quot;, she thought of Jane Marple.

==Transport==
The town falls within the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive area, with public transport provided by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM).

===Railway===
The town is served by two railway stations: Marple and Rose Hill Marple; both are on the Hope Valley Line. Marple station hosts regular services between Manchester Piccadilly, New Mills Central and Sheffield. Rose Hill was originally on the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway, which was closed in 1970, and is now at the end of a spur providing services to Manchester Piccadilly, via the Hyde loop.

The Agatha Christie character Miss Marple is often incorrectly thought to be named after the railway station, at which Christie was once delayed. Her grandson, Matthew Pritchard, cleared that up in July 2015 by bringing a letter to the station&#x27;s 150th anniversary, which was, coincidentally, the 125th anniversary of the author&#x27;s birth. The actual source of the name was Marple Hall, as discussed in the Marple Hall section above.

===Buses===
The town has many bus services, which are operated primarily by Stagecoach Manchester and High Peak. Key routes include:
* 358: Stockport–Marple–New Mills–Hayfield
* 375: Stockport–Stepping Hill Hospital–Marple–Hawk Green
* 383: Stockport–Offerton–Marple–Romiley–Bredbury–Stockport circular
* 384: the reverse route of the 383
* 394: Glossop–Marple–Stepping Hill Hospital

===Roads===
The town lies along the A626, which runs between Glossop and Heaton Chapel. It has a junction in the centre of Marple with the B6101, which heads south to New Mills.

==Education==
Education in Marple is run by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council.

There are two primary schools, the secondary Marple Hall School which occupies the site of the ancestral home of the Bradshaw-Isherwood family. Marple Sixth Form College (formerly Ridge Danyers College) offers courses to young people and adults. There is also an independent school and nursery, Brabyns Preparatory School.

==Sport==
Marple Rugby Club has three adult teams, and a &quot;Marple Minis Rugby&quot; outfit with teams from age 7 to 17.

Marple Cricket Club was formed in 1900 and has been based at Bowden Lane since 1951. The club is a member of the ECB Cheshire County Cricket League. The club runs five senior teams: the first, second and ‘2A’ teams play on Saturdays and the third and fourth teams on Sundays. The club also has a junior section.
The cricket club built a squash section in the 1970s, which has three courts and four teams playing regular club squash.

Brabyns Tennis Club has four clay courts and three floodlit artificial grass courts, enabling year-round play. The club has several men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; teams in the Slazenger North East Cheshire League and mixed teams in the East Cheshire Winter League. There is a junior section and extensive coaching programme.

Marple Golf Club, founded in 1892, is in Hawk Green, Marple. It is an 18-hole private members&#x27; course.

<text>The Battle of Lissa (or Battle of Vis) () was a naval battle between an Italian and an Austrian fleet during the Third Italian War of Independence. It took place on July 20, 1866, near the island of Vis (then Lissa), which is now part of Croatia. The Kingdom of Italy intended to capture Habsburg Venetia and break Austria&#x27;s naval dominance in the Adriatic. However, the Imperial Austrian Navy managed to secure victory despite the numerical and technical superiority of the Italian fleet by employing ramming tactics. This battle was the first naval engagement in which newly developed ironclad warships were used on a significant scale. Both naval forces at Lissa exhibited notable technical deficiencies, while the Italian Navy also suffered from severe rivalries within its command staff and inadequate training of its crews.

==Background==
In order to seize the last areas of the Apennine Peninsula that were still in the hands of the Habsburg Empire, the then Kingdom of Italy entered into an alliance with Prussia. War broke out between Prussia and Austria in mid-June 1866. Italy also declared war on Austria and had its troops march into Veneto. Although the Italian army outnumbered the Austrians, it was defeated at Custozza on June 24 and forced to retreat.
Shortly before the Italians were ready to resume the offensive, Napoleon III telegraphed on the night of July 4 that Austria had offered to cede Veneto to him on the basis of an armistice in order to return it to Italy. However, Napoleon III&#x27;s own plans were thwarted by his defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz. The emperor&#x27;s telegram was followed three days later by the threat that he would return Venice to Austria if the armistice was rejected and perhaps enter into an alliance with it. This put the Italians in a terrible dilemma. Risking a break with France was too great a risk.
The Italians replied to the Emperor that they could not conclude an armistice without Prussian consent and made acceptance conditional on the immediate surrender of the Venetian fortresses and French support for their claims to Trieste. In the meantime, Italy wanted to use the time to occupy Istria and later use it as a bargaining chip in the peace negotiations.

==Prelude==
Admiral Persano had already been instructed on June 10, 1866 to clear the Adriatic of enemy warships and merchant ships and to make Ancona an operational base in the Adriatic, but not to attack Trieste and Venice for the time being. After Austria officially declared war on Italy on June 20, the Italians initially planned to occupy the Austrian coastal land on the Adriatic. After von Tegetthoff was informed of the declaration of war, he immediately took the necessary measures to take offensive action against the enemy fleet when a favorable opportunity arose. In order to obtain information about the strength and movements of the Italians, von Tegetthoff sent the steamer Stadium on the same day to reconnoitre the coast from Ancona to Bari. On June 23, the Stadium returned with the news that no enemy warships had been sighted.
Assuming that the Italians had only assembled part of their fleet in the roadstead at Ancona, the rear admiral quickly decided to undertake a reconnaissance voyage from Fasana to Ancona. On June 24, von Tegetthoff asked Archduke Albrecht whether he would be permitted to take the offensive and carry out reconnaissance missions on the Italian coast. In the meantime, von Tegetthoff had held a council of war with all the ship commanders and weighed up the chances of an operation against Ancona and a possible attack on the Italian ships anchored there. The Archduke&#x27;s reply arrived on June 26 and was as follows: No obstacle in the way of the free action of the escadre, only not beyond Lissa; keep an eye on the mouths of the Po and the coast of Venice. With the approval of the High Command, von Tegetthoff set sail from Fasana on the evening of June 26 with the armored frigate Archduke Ferdinand Max.

After the Italian coast came into sight at dawn, the Austrians set course for Monte Conero. At around 4:00 a.m., the lookout on the Archduke Ferdinand Max sighted smoke in the direction of the course. Soon afterwards, at around 4:20 a.m., a steamer was sighted by the Elisabeth. The Elisabeth was immediately ordered to reconnoitre. When the Elisabeth had approached the foreign steamer to within about , the ship - the Radaviso Esploratore under the command of Marchese di Orengo - hoisted the Italian flag. This was answered by the Elisabeth by hoisting her own flag and firing a few shots, whereupon the Esploratore immediately turned and headed for Ancona.

The Elisabeth tried to cut off the Italian ship, but the Esploratore soon got out of range due to her greater speed. At 5:30 a.m. she was about from Ancona. Contrary to expectations, the enemy fleet was almost completely anchored on the Rede. The Italians, alerted by the Esploratore, then set off. At around 6:30 a.m., four armored ships approached Monte Conero in their wake, followed at intervals by other Italian ships. Several wooden ships formed a second wave between the armored ships.

Due to the superiority of the proximity of the shore batteries and a possible naval mine belt, Rear Admiral von Tegetthoff decided to retreat to Fasana at 7:30 a.m.Admiral Persano cruised the latitude of Lissa from July 9 to 11, but without taking any action against the Austrians. His passive behavior was increasingly criticized and the Minister of the Navy ordered him to finally take some kind of promising action. It was therefore decided to occupy the island of Lissa. The aim was to create a maritime base of operations so that the Italian land force could later land in Dalmatia relatively safely.

==Opposing fleets==
===Italy===
The and the were both built in New York. They had a displacement of each, thick armour and were equipped with powerful artillery. However, they were not good seagoing vessels as they lacked buoyancy and maneuverability, and their rudders were unprotected. Italy also had the , a turret ship built in Great Britain in 1866. The ship had armor and was equipped with two 300-pounder Armstrong guns and an 26 ft-long ramming spur. According to an article in the London Times, it was capable of destroying the Austrian fleet single-handedly if necessary. 

However, the &quot;Affondatore &quot;also had serious design flaws. The , the , the , the and the were also armored and had a continuous armored belt on the waterline. The two smaller ironclads and , each with a displacement of , were built in France. They had thick armor and were equipped with guns. Two armored gunboats, the and the , each carried two Armstrong 150-pounders and several smaller guns. 
Behind these twelve ships, which formed the first line of the Italian fleet, were nine wooden frigates and corvettes with steam propulsion, but of the older type that armor had made obsolete. Dissatisfied with the state of his fleet, Persano repeatedly pointed out a number of deficiencies to the responsible naval minister, General Diego Angioletti. Persano estimated that he would need at least another month to get the fleet into fighting condition. On June 20, Angioletti was replaced by Agostino Depretis, who ordered Persano to sail immediately and assemble the fleet at Ancona.

===Austria===
The Austrians had the ironclads , , , , , , and . Each had thick armor) and a large number of obsolete muzzle-loading guns at their disposal. In addition, the fleet consisted of the ship-of-the-line with ninety-one guns, the frigates , , , , and , as well as ten gunboats (&quot;Narenta&quot;, &quot;Kerka&quot;, &quot;Hum&quot;, &quot;Vellebich&quot;, &quot;Dalmat&quot;, &quot;Seehund&quot;, &quot;Wal&quot;, &quot;Streiter&quot;, &quot;Reka&quot;, &quot;Andreas Hofer&quot;, &quot;Kaiserin Elisabeth&quot;, &quot;Greif&quot;, and &quot;Stadion&quot;). 
After the naval battle at Heligoland in the German-Danish War, Rear Admiral Wilhelm Freiherr von Tegetthoff, who was extremely popular with his subordinates, was considered one of the most experienced and creative naval commanders in Europe, especially when it came to compensating for the Austrian fleet&#x27;s lack of combat power via emergency solutions.

==Battle==
===Lissa===
The island of Lissa is located in the middle of the Adriatic Sea about 34 miles from the Croatian coast and 80 miles from the Italian coast. The island has several bays and harbors, which were equipped with batteries for defense. On the north-eastern side is Vis with the port of San Giorgio. To the south are the bays of Carober, Gradac, Portochiave and Travna. On the south-eastern side: the bays of Milna and Ruda and the port of Manego. After Austria came into possession of the island of Lissa in 1815, the existing fortifications were strengthened and new works added. At that time, 1,833 Austrian soldiers under the command of Colonel David Freiherr von Urs de Margina and around 100 cannons were available for the defense of the rugged and densely wooded island. There was also a police station on the 639 yd-high hill of Hum, which was in telegraphic contact with the Dalmatian mainland via the neighboring island of Lesina.

===Order of Battle===
Rear Admiral von Tegetthoff was not entirely free in his choice of attack formation. The planned attack required the armored division to form the vanguard and to simultaneously adopt a formation that enabled it to steam full speed at the enemy. However, since the Austrian ships did not all achieve the same speed, he decided against the line-ahead formation. In this formation, there was a risk that the faster ships might collide with the slower ones when breaking out of the line. For this reason, and to ensure optimal utilization of his combat strength, he opted for a wedge formation. 
Admiral Persano divided his armored ships into three divisions. The first division, under Rear Admiral Giovanni Vacca, consisted of the &quot;Principe di Carignano&quot;, the &quot;Castelfidardo&quot;, and the &quot;Ancona&quot;. The second division, under Admiral Persano himself, included the &quot;Re d’Italia&quot;, the Palestro, and the San Martino. Finally, the third division, under Captain Riboty, comprised the Re di Portogallo, the Varese, the Maria Pia, the &quot;Terribile&quot;, and the &quot;Formidabile&quot;. Rear Admiral Giovanni Battista Albini’s squadron consisted of four frigates, one corvette, five scouts, three gunboats, a hospital ship, and two troop transports.

===Attack===
Admiral Persano set sail on the afternoon of July 16. The fleet initially took a north-easterly course in order to conceal the target. During the night of July 16–17, the Messaggero, sailing under a (false) British flag with Chief of Staff d&#x27;Amico on board, approached the coast to reconnoitre the positions of the coastal batteries and fortresses. Persano&#x27;s plan was to bombard San Georgio with most of his fleet, destroy the Comisa forts with a smaller detachment so that a later arriving force could land there, and land the expeditionary force he had with him at Manego. 
The gunboats were sent to Lesina on the island of Hvar to cut the telegraph cable to Lissa and destroy any boats that could transmit information to the mainland. One scout was sent to cross between the islands of Pelagosa and St. Andrea, another to Punta Planca on the mainland. This division exposed the Italians to the risk of being destroyed by locally superior Austrian units. Moreover, so much time had been lost in issuing orders that should have been given before the fleet left that the Italians did not reach their position until after 10 a.m. on July 18. Thanks to this delay, the Austrians had had enough time to telegraph the arrival of the Italians to Tegetthoff. At 10:30 Persano gave the order to attack.

The first division under Rear Admiral Vacca approached the batteries at Komiža under fire up to 1,600 yards and then opened fire on the Austrian positions. However, at up to 273 yards above sea level, the coastal batteries were too high for the Italian guns. Consequently, after a few hours of useless shelling, Vacca decided to drive to Manego and support Rear Admiral Albini. Albini, who had received orders to destroy the batteries at Nadpostranje and land troops in the bay of Rukavac, reached his position at around 11:15. Shortly afterwards, the Austrian cannons opened fire on the approaching Italians.

Albini was faced with the same problem as Rear Admiral Vacca and also decided to cease firing. Albini then sent the corvette &quot;San Giovanni&quot; to San Giorgio to ask Persano for further orders. After Vacca had reached Manego at around 14:00, Albini informed him of the situation, whereupon Vacca decided to continue on to San Giorgio. Meanwhile, Admiral Persano had approached San Giorgio from the north and Captain Riboty from the south. While Persano intended to attack Fort George, Riboty was to attack Fort Wellington. After most of Fort George&#x27;s guns had been silenced by 15:00, Persano ordered the Maria Pia and the San Martino to enter the harbor at 16:00 and destroy the inner gun batteries. 
As the two Italian ships entered the harbor, they came under fire from both the eastern guns of Fort Wellington and the inner gun batteries. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Vacca had appeared at about 16:45 and had received immediate orders to support Riboty in his attack on Fort Wellington. By 17:00, Fort George had ceased firing after half of its guns had been destroyed and a fifth of its soldiers had fallen. Only Fort Wellington was still resisting. In this situation, Persano decided to break off the battle and allow his men to rest. 
During the night of July 19, Persano received the news that von Tegetthoff had been informed of the attack. However, Admiral Persano decided to continue the attack, as he expected that if von Tegetthoff had indeed sailed, he would not arrive before the evening of July 19. The Austrians worked throughout the night to repair the damage caused by the Italians and restore their defensive capabilities. At dawn, the Affondatore arrived with the frigates Carlo Alberto and Principe Umber, bringing a further 2,600 men with them. The two ships Terribile and Varese were ordered to attack Comisa, while Albini was to cover the disembarkation of the troops.

At the same time, the &quot;Formidabile&quot;, supported by the three ships from Vacca, was to enter the port of San Giorgio, while Persano himself wanted to attack the outer fortresses again. The Austrian fortifications again withstood the bombardment and the Italian divisional commanders proved too timid to land the troops. By 20:00, the Italian fleet had again broken off the attack and retreated north of San Georgio. After receiving further telegrams from Lesina about the presence and activities of the Italian fleet, Tegetthoff decided to leave his safe position in the northern Adriatic with his escadre immediately in order to relieve the hard-pressed garrison on Lissa. The entire Austrian fleet, three divisions, sailed out of the Fažana Channel at around 13:30 on July 19 and headed south at full steam. 
Von Tegetthoff had formulated his instructions for the attack precisely. The Panzerschiff-Abteilung was to break through the Italian line, ram their ships and concentrate their fire. The wooden ships were to attack one or other wing of the enemy line or be deployed as they saw fit. The gunboats were to split into three groups and support the wooden ships in their action.
The Italians were sighted at 06:40 on the morning of July 20. Shortly after 9:00 a.m., the order “prepare for battle” was given. This was followed by the signals “close up” and “full speed” and finally at 10:35 a.m. to the armored ships: “attack and sink the enemy”. After the Italians had sighted the Austrians, Persano gave a number of signals.

First he ordered the &quot;Terribile &quot;and the &quot;Varese &quot;to join him, then he had his own ships and those of Vacca deploy in line of bearing to the northwest. He gave Albini the signal to leave the boats and men ashore and at the same time ordered him to position his wooden ships behind the armored line. When he realized a few minutes later that his line was pointing in the wrong direction, Persano gave the signals: “Steer northeast for one minute”, then “Close up” and “Attack the enemy”.

The ironclads were very slow to reach their positions and the Re di Portogallo and Castelfidardo reported engine failures. After some repairs, they finally took their places. The &quot;Formidabile &quot;immediately steamed off to Ancona after signaling to Persano that he could not fight. Shortly after the Italians had formed up, Persano changed his mind and ordered a keel line formation to be formed. First came the Carignano, then the Castelfidardo and the Ancona, which formed the vanguard. They were followed by the &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot;, the &quot;Affondatore&quot;, the &quot;Palestro&quot;, the &quot;San Martino&quot; in the center and, in the rear, the &quot;Ribotti&quot;, the &quot;Re di Portogallo&quot; and the &quot;Maria Pia&quot;. The &quot;Terribile &quot;and the &quot;Varese &quot;were still several nautical miles away to the south, so that the entire line covered a space of .
At around 10:00, Persano decided that he needed a fast, maneuverable ship to monitor the fighting outside the battle line. Since the &quot;Re d&#x27; Italia &quot;was neither fast nor maneuverable, he decided to switch to the &quot;Affondatore&quot;. Unfortunately, the &quot;Affondatore &quot;only had a vice admiral&#x27;s flag, not an admiral&#x27;s flag, and no signal was sent to the rest of the fleet announcing this change. The stopping of the Re d&#x27;Italia also created a significant gap in the line of Italian armored ships. The Italian armored line was therefore only closed at the front. In the center, the &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot; was isolated, and at the end, the gaps between the ships were much wider than they should have been according to the order. 
Von Tegetthoff recognized his chance and broke through the enemy line between the &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot; and the &quot;Ancona &quot;at 10:50. The Austrians engaged in an exchange of fire with Vacca&#x27;s division, but the Italian shells missed the Austrian ships due to the heavy swell. Whether because of the smoke from their own guns or because the Italians had maneuvered well, the Austrians were unable to ram any Italian ships during this first attack. After the Austrians had passed the gap, Vacca had broken off to port with his three ships to attack the weaker Austrian rearguard.

However, he executed the movement very slowly, so that the rearguard had pushed through the gap before Vacca had completed his turn. Led by the &quot;Kaiser&quot;, the &quot;Novara&quot;, the &quot;Friedrich Max&quot;, the &quot;Radetzky&quot;, the &quot;Adriatic&quot;, the &quot;Schwarzenberg &quot;and the &quot;Donau &quot;now sailed south to attack the Italian wooden ships. The &quot;Kaiser &quot;was initially confronted by the &quot;Affondatore&quot;, which opened fire on the &quot;Kaiser&quot;, killing six men and causing minor damage. The &quot;Kaiser &quot;returned fire and after the other Austrian ships also concentrated their fire on the &quot;Affondatore&quot;, the ship withdrew to the west. Shortly afterwards, Ribotti&#x27;s division, reinforced by the &quot;Varese&quot;, opened fire on the &quot;Kaiser&quot;. 
The &quot;Portogallo &quot;then came into view off the port bow and Commodore Petz was determined to ram it despite his wooden ship. Petz dropped slightly to starboard and with a sharp turn to port he managed to hit his opponent abeam. The &quot;Kaiser &quot;grazed along the side of the &quot;Portogallo&quot;, shattering part of its armor, the crane beams, tearing all the port side port portlights and the shrouds of the foremast in two. The &quot;Kaiser &quot;itself suffered equally severe damage. The bowsprit and the stay were torn away and the foremast crashed over the side onto the funnel. Despite her condition and the Italian gunfire, the &quot;Kaiser &quot;was able to fire at least two concentrated broadsides at close range, causing so much damage above and below the waterline that the &quot;Portogallo &quot;subsequently drifted away and was lost in the smoke of battle. 
In the meantime, von Tegetthoff had attacked Persano&#x27;s division. The entire seven Austrian armored ships had concentrated on the &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot;, the &quot;Palestro&quot; and the &quot;San Martino&quot;. The battle had now developed into a dense mêlée that allowed each combatant only a brief glimpse of the other. The Austrian ships were painted black, while the Italians were painted light gray. In addition, the Austrians had painted the funnels of the ships different colors so that they could easily identify their own armored ships. Tegetthoff&#x27;s order was clear: &quot;Ram everything that is gray!&quot;. The hard-pressed Italian center was now attacked from the front, flanks and rear. The &quot;Palestro &quot;and the &quot;San Martino&quot; were covered with massive gunfire, whereupon they withdrew to the north and south-west after several hits.

While the &quot;Kaiser&quot;, badly battered, with her rigging on fire and many gunners killed or wounded, sailed on, the &quot;Affondatore &quot;emerged from the smoke, steaming on a course that crossed that of the &quot;Kaiser &quot;at right angles. The &quot;Affondatore &quot;approached as if to ram the ship. When the collision was imminent, Persano suddenly gave the order to take evasive action and spare the ship. Perhaps he feared that his ramming spike would get caught in the hull of the &quot;Kaiser &quot;and his own ship would go down with the enemy. Meanwhile, the battle reached its climax. As the Austrians approached the now encircled &quot;Re d &#x27;Italia&quot;, a ship actually hit her sternpost and tore away the rudder, rendering her virtually helpless.
In this extremely critical situation, von Tegetthoff ordered the &quot;Ferdinand Max&quot; to ram the ship at full speed. The &quot;Re d Italia&quot; heeled heavily to starboard when she was hit. The ship immediately began to fill up and sank within just three minutes. While von Tegetthoff attempted to launch some boats to rescue the Italians, the ships of the vanguard and rearguard arrived, whereupon von Tegetthoff withdrew. The loss of the &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot; and the withdrawal of the &quot;Palestro &quot;reduced the Italian armored squadron to nine ships. Nevertheless, Persano was determined to continue the fighting. The &quot;Ancona &quot;and the &quot;Varese &quot;were preparing for a new attack on Petz&#x27;s division when they collided and remained wedged together for several minutes. During these minutes, the Austrians were able to gain an advantage and escape. The losses aboard the Kaiser were heavy.

One of the Affondatore&#x27;s 300-pound shells had hit the hull of the ship, killing or wounding twenty men. In total, she had suffered twenty-four dead and seventy-five wounded. But the &quot;Kaiser &quot;was not yet safe. The &quot;Maria Pia&quot; had now appeared and opened fire from a distance of 874 yards. The &quot;Kaiser &quot;tried to return fire, but many of the guns were disabled, while the fire spread through the rigging to the entire ship. The steam ran out and the steering gear was damaged. The other wooden ships had also been badly damaged. One ship was only kept afloat by the pumps, another was on fire, and the crew of the guns on another had been decimated. Petz withdrew his division from the operation and headed for San Georgio. Nevertheless, the &quot;Kaiser &quot;had proven that even a wooden ship could attack an ironclad and escape destruction. 
By 12:20 p.m., the two fleets had separated and the Austrian ironclads moved toward San Georgio in support of their unarmored ships. After his fleet had regrouped, the Austrian admiral formed them into three columns to the northeast, between the Italian armored ships and the land, his own armored ship column seaward. Halfway through, when the gun smoke had cleared, Persano saw that Albini&#x27;s division was still on the coast, while his armored ships were in column to the west. Persano then gave the signal for general pursuit. However, as his captains did not know that Persano was on the Affondatore, they paid no attention to the signals.
Persano was now obviously losing track of the battle, as he repeatedly sent out contradictory flag signals such as: The fleet should chase the enemy. The commander wants the orders given to be carried out quickly, any ship that is not fighting is not at its post. He then learned by signals that the Re d&#x27;Italia had sunk, the Palestro was doomed by fire and the San Martino was almost incapable of fighting. Together with his wooden ships and the Terrible, Persano put his column in the lead and steamed west. The two fleets watched each other until nightfall, with the Italians zigzagging but keeping a respectful distance from von Tegetthoff. At dusk, Persano set course for Ancona and von Tegetthoff for Pola. 

== Aftermath ==
That same evening, von Tegetthoff sent a telegram to Vienna:
&quot;This morning near Lissa, encountered the enemy fleet. After a two-hour battle, drove the enemy away. Lissa relieved.&quot;
The decisive factors in the Italian defeat were the scattered starting positions of their ships during the landing operations, the disorganized command caused by disputes and misunderstandings, Persano&#x27;s change of flagship, the gap in their formation that this caused, and the hesitant counterattack after the Austrians had breached the gap. The Austrian fleet was able to win the battle because orders were issued without delay, the battle plan was well-prepared and carefully thought out, and, above all, their crews were exceptionally well-trained. A significant part of the success was also due to Tegetthoff&#x27;s determined and unconventional approach. 

The Battle of Lissa was the first naval engagement in European warfare to feature the use of ironclad warships. However, too much emphasis was placed on ramming tactics during the battle. The Austrians attacked a fleet that was completely disorganized, giving them the best opportunities to employ the ram. Even so, they succeeded in sinking only one ship using this weapon. With the development of even more powerful and longer-range cannons, which could sink ships before they came close enough to ram, this tactic soon became obsolete. While the Italians had a numerically superior and technically more advanced fleet compared to the Austrians, they were unable to capitalize on this advantage.

For Italy, the defeat was a national tragedy. Admiral Persano was removed from his post and dishonorably dismissed from naval service. Tegetthoff, on the other hand, was promoted to Vice Admiral by Emperor Franz Joseph – practically on the battlefield – for his efforts. Shortly thereafter, he was also awarded the Maria Theresa Order with Commanders&#x27; Cross. In Vienna and numerous other cities of the empire, he was declared an honorary citizen. Additionally, a congratulatory letter from his former superior, Ferdinand Maximilian, now Emperor of Mexico, reached him. The postmaster of Lesina, Bräuer, was also decorated for his services, and the local priest, Plancic, was gifted a valuable monstrance for his church.

The Italians recorded 700 dead and wounded and 19 prisoners. The Austrians suffered a total of 176 men wounded and killed. Some foreign newspapers incorrectly reported that the liner SMS Kaiser had also been sunk. Several ironclads from both parties were slightly damaged. The badly damaged Affondatore sank off Ancona three days later.

<text>Joseph Kastl Knollenberg (November 28, 1933 – February 6, 2018) was an American politician from Michigan. From 1993 to 2009, he was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing and .

In his congressional term, Knollenberg was known as a staunch supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, President George W. Bush&#x27;s stance on protecting manufactured goods and for voting against expanding SCHIP in the later years of his career.

He was defeated by Gary Peters in the 2008 election by a margin of 52% to 43%.

==Early life==
Knollenberg was born in Mattoon, Illinois, the son of Helen E. (née Kastl; 1903–1990), a teacher and William Herman Knollenberg Jr. (1902–1975), a farmer. He was raised a Catholic and grew up on a farm along with 12 siblings. He graduated from Eastern Illinois University in 1955, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

After graduation, he served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957 as a corporal in Germany, where he specialized in petroleum chemistry. He then spent more than three decades as an insurance agent. Initially working for New York Life Insurance Company as an assistant manager and later for Sears, he founded his own agency, Knollenberg Agency in the late 1980s. He served as chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party from 1978 to 1982.

==Congressional career==
In 1992, Knollenberg signed on as campaign manager for Congressman William Broomfield, who had represented most of Oakland County in Congress since 1957. However, at a meeting with Knollenberg and other advisers, Broomfield announced he would not run for a 19th term. He then asked Knollenberg to run in his place in the 11th District, which had been renumbered from the 18th District after the 1990 census.

Despite being the only candidate in the three-way Republican primary not holding elected office, Knollenberg won the nomination by over 13 points. As the 11th was one of the most Republican districts in Michigan and the nation at the time, he was virtually assured of becoming only the third person to represent the district. He was reelected six times without serious difficulty, never dropping below 55 percent of the vote.

Knollenberg was re-elected to his seventh term in 2004 with 58% of the vote. In 2006, however, Knollenberg faced a tough campaign against Democrat Nancy Skinner, a liberal talk show host in the Detroit area, ultimately winning by six points. Two years later, in a more difficult election cycle for Republican candidates, Knollenberg lost re-election to former state senator Gary Peters.

Generally, Knollenberg&#x27;s voting record was conservative. He supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and led the campaign against President George W. Bush&#x27;s steel tariffs. In 2002 he was awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal by the president of Armenia. On September 29, 2008, he voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

===2006 election===

Knollenberg was challenged in the 2006 Republican primary by moderate Republican Patricia Godchaux. Democratic candidate Nancy Skinner, a popular former radio-talk show host in the Detroit area, was her party&#x27;s nominee for the 9th district. Matthew R. Abel of the Green Party and Adam Goodman of the Libertarian Party were third-party candidates also in the race.

Prior to 2006, Knollenberg&#x27;s election was widely considered to be relatively easy given the traditionally Republican leanings of Troy, the largest city in his district. The 2000s round of redistricting made Knollenberg&#x27;s district much friendlier to Democrats. While the district lost heavily Democratic Southfield, it picked up equally Democratic Pontiac and lost a Republican-leaning spur of Wayne County.

In the 2006 election, Knollenberg was nearly defeated, taking only 52 percent of the vote to Skinner&#x27;s 46 percent. Abel received .9%, and Goodman received 1.3%. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 48 years; in 1958 Broomfield only won a second term by 5.5 points.

Knollenberg spent $2.7 million in his campaign.

===2008 election===
In January 2006, Congressman Knollenberg announced his intent to seek re-election in 2008. The narrowness of his 2006 reelection bid, combined with his district&#x27;s changing demographics led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to target him for defeat. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee targeted Congressional Districts where Republicans garnered less than 55% of the vote.

The Democratic nominee was Gary Peters, the former state lottery commissioner. Skinner initially made plans for a rematch, but bowed out to clear the field for Peters. In March 2008, Jack Kevorkian announced that he would challenge Knollenberg as an independent candidate. The Libertarian nominee was Adam Goodman and the Green nominee was Douglas Campbell. Kevorkian, Goodman and Campbell each raised and spent less money than the mandatory reporting threshold.

On November 4, 2008, Knollenberg was defeated, garnering 43 percent of the vote to Peters&#x27; 52 percent. Knollenberg&#x27;s candidacy was likely hurt by a heavy Democratic tide in the Detroit area; Barack Obama carried Oakland County by a 15-point margin, six percentage points more than Peters&#x27; margin over Knollenberg. A potential factor in Knollenberg&#x27;s defeat was a series of advertisements criticizing his vote against expanding SCHIP.

==Personal life and death==
Knollenberg had two sons, Stephen and Martin with his wife, Sandra &quot;Sandie&quot; Moco, whom he married in September 1962 at St Frances Cabrini Church in Allen Park, Michigan. His son, Martin, was elected in November 2006 by a 58%-42% margin to the Michigan State House of Representatives from the 41st District.

Knollenberg died on February 6, 2018, due to complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at a care facility in Troy, Michigan at the age of 84.

<text>Kent Douglas Graham (born November 1, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish before transferring to the Ohio State Buckeyes. After college, Graham had a lengthy career in the NFL with the New York Giants in two separate stints, as well as starting for the Arizona Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers. He finished his career in 2002 with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

==Early life==
Graham attended Wheaton North High School in Wheaton, Illinois, where he was awarded the National High School Quarterback of the Year honor by The National Quarterback Club in 1986. Recruited by Notre Dame, he won his first career start for the Irish as a freshman against Boston College in 1987. However, the option-run offense implemented by coach Lou Holtz was an imperfect fit for the drop-back passer, and after his sophomore year he transferred to Ohio State, where he was the starter for the 1991 campaign in which the Buckeyes finished 8–4.

==Professional career==
Graham began his NFL career with the Giants in 1992, after the team selected him in the eighth round of that year&#x27;s NFL draft. Due to injuries to starters Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, Graham was forced into the starting lineup and started three games before he too was injured. He stayed with the team for two more years, only getting one more start, before leaving to play with the Detroit Lions in 1995. After not seeing any action, he signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 1996, where he eventually became the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. In two separate stints as Cardinals quarterback, Graham threw for a combined 3,032 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.

Graham returned to the Giants in 1998 to serve as backup to Danny Kanell, who had led the team to the NFC East title the previous year. He moved into the starting lineup in Week 12 after Kanell had led the Giants to a 3–7 record in the first ten games. Graham led the Giants to two wins in his first three starts, then secured a major upset over the then-undefeated and eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in Week 15 by throwing a late touchdown pass to Amani Toomer to clinch the victory. Graham finished the season 5–1 as the team&#x27;s starter, and won his final four starts.

Graham started the 1999 season as the starter ahead of offseason acquisition Kerry Collins. He held a winning record in his nine starts, finishing 5–4, but struggled most of the year. After back-to-back ineffective performances he was benched during a Week 11 game against the Washington Redskins in favor of Collins. He did not see another snap as a Giant. Graham was released during the off-season (February 10, 2000) due to his lack of consistency and to create room under the salary cap.

In February 2000 Graham was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on a $5.1 million deal over three years to replace Mike Tomczak, who had been released in the off-season, as the backup for Kordell Stewart. In the wake of Stewart, who was having to cope with drastic changes to the offensive team members (including Tomczak, who had served as his mentor), having a mediocre 1999 season and a competitive first training camp, Steelers coach Bill Cowher assigned Graham as the starting quarterback for the start of the 2000 season. Despite solid efforts, Graham performed less than impressive, beginning the season 0–3 due to Pittsburgh&#x27;s defensive weaknesses. In the third game of the season vs. the Tennessee Titans, Graham threw for 254 yards in one of the best offensive showings for the Steelers in over two seasons before injuring his hip late in the game and being replaced by Stewart, who went on to lead the team to two straight victories as Graham recovered. This built a quarterback controversy among fans and media, as many of the Steeler faithful supported Graham ahead of Stewart despite Stewart&#x27;s recent successes with the team (having led the team to the playoffs twice in his first two full years as starter). However, Graham struggled mightily upon his return to the Steelers and eventually lost whatever playing time he had earned. After platooning with Graham, Stewart returned to the starting position and Graham was cut at the end of the year.

In 2001, he was signed by the Redskins. After initial starter Jeff George was cut, Graham became the team&#x27;s second stringer for much of the season. In 2002, Graham was picked in the expansion draft by the Houston Texans to be their third-string quarterback. He never played again.

==Personal life==
His son, Taylor Graham, attended the New York Giants rookie minicamp in 2015 tryouts. His nephew, Bo Richter, is an outside linebacker for the Minnesota Vikings.

<text>James Fitzpatrick (born 1944) is an Irish artist. He is best known for elaborately detailed work inspired by the Irish Celtic artistic tradition. However, his most famous single piece is a two-tone portrait of Che Guevara created in 1968, based on a photo by Alberto Korda.

== Early life ==
Jim Fitzpatrick was born in December 1944 to James and Elizabeth Fitzpatrick (née O&#x27;Connor). His parents had married in the north Dublin suburb of Cabra in June 1943. During a period of childhood sickness, Fitzpatrick read and drew in bed, as well as his mother and great-aunt telling him stories of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Cú Chulainn and Fionn MacCumhaill. He was educated at the Franciscan College Gormanston, County Meath, just north of Dublin. His father was a photo-journalist and he is a grandson of political cartoonist Thomas Fitzpatrick.

== Career ==
Fitzpatrick&#x27;s earliest work was the graphic portrait of Che Guevara, which was based on the photograph by Alberto Korda, entitled Guerrillero Heroico, was taken on 5 March 1960. Fitzpatrick met Guevara 5 years earlier in Kilkee during Guevara&#x27;s visit to trace his Irish ancestry. Having initially tried to distribute the poster himself, Fitzpatrick chose to remove copyright from the image so that is could be used freely by left wing groups, stating that &quot;I literally wanted it to breed like rabbits. I wanted it to spread.&quot;

In 1978, he wrote and illustrated a book called &quot;The Book of Conquests&quot;, the retelling of a cycle of Irish myths, the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;. The book is a retelling of the legends of the coming of the Tuatha dé Dannan to Ireland and their fight with the Fir Bolg. The illustrations include intricate Celtic scroll work and knotwork, for which Fitzpatrick has become known. A second book, &quot;The Silver Arm&quot;, is based on the deeds of Nuada of the Silver Arm and Lugh in their fight with the Formor.

Fitzpatrick has produced artwork for bands such as Thin Lizzy, providing the portraits of the band for their &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot; album, then going on to illustrate the logo for 1975 album &quot;Fighting&quot; (frequently displayed onstage thereafter and used on compilation albums and merchandise) and their &quot;Jailbreak&quot; album in 1976, for Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Faith and Courage&quot;, for The Darkness&#x27; 2003 single &quot;Christmas Time (Don&#x27;t Let the Bells End)&quot;, Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone&#x27;s 2013 album cover &quot;The Underground Resistance&quot;, and took the photograph for the cover of Louise Patricia Crane&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Deep Blue&quot;. He was commissioned by CityJet in 2007 to create images reflecting Ireland&#x27;s culture, mythology, history and landscapes.

In 2011, Fitzpatrick announced that he intended to copyright the iconic red and black Che Guevara graphic. He cited &quot;crass commercial&quot; use of the image for his decision and planned to hand over the copyright and all rights, in perpetuity, to the family of Guevara in Cuba. The image remains available for free through Fitzpatrick&#x27;s website for non-commercial usage. An Post released a stamp featuring Fitzpatrick&#x27;s image of Guevara in 2017 to mark 50 years since its publication.

In June 2023, Fitzpatrick released &quot;Ancient Ireland, Land of Legend&quot;, his first portfolio in 40 years.

== Meeting Guevara in Ireland ==
According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at Gormanston College he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in Kilkee, the town of his mother&#x27;s birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans. He asked Fitzpatrick what he should drink, and was recommended an Irish whiskey with water. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the Cuban Revolution. Knowing about the Irish diaspora and history in Argentina, Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from Galway, with other family being from Cork.Guevara&#x27;s father also bore the Norman-Irish surname &quot;Lynch.&quot; Fitzpatrick describes Che as &quot;curious&quot; about Ireland &quot;from a revolutionary point of view&quot; and remarks that Che proclaimed his &quot;great admiration&quot; for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to &quot;shake off the shackles of the British Empire&quot;. Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to Cuba and had touched down at Shannon Airport, where the Soviet airline Aeroflot had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an &quot;unofficial&quot; visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia.

In December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the Shannon Development, announced plans to commemorate Guevara&#x27;s visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in Limerick. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara&#x27;s visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a &quot;permanent mark&quot; symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel&#x27;s – White House pub in Shannonside. Fitzpatrick explained the initiative by remarking &quot;we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here … this probably was Che&#x27;s last hurrah.&quot;

==Personal life==
Fitzpatrick was partnered and married to Deirdre for over twenty years; they later divorced. Fitzpatrick has lived on the Burrow Road in Sutton on the Howth peninsula since the 1970s, in an apartment which later became his studio, in a converted schoolmasters&#x27; house, and then back in the apartment. The Fitzpatricks had three children, two of whom are in business with the artist. His younger son, Redmond, issues prints of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s work from California, while his daughter has produced a line of scarves, Lile, named for his grandmother and printed with his artwork.

<text>Hard Promises is the fourth studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released on May 5, 1981, on Backstreet Records.

==History==
Its working title was &quot;Benmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, referring to keyboard player Benmont Tench. The album features guest vocals from Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac on the duet &quot;Insider&quot;. The Heartbreakers also recorded the hit &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot; for Nicks&#x27; album &quot;Bella Donna&quot; around the time &quot;Hard Promises&quot; was recorded.

This was the second Tom Petty album on the Backstreet Records label. The album&#x27;s release was delayed while Petty and his distributor MCA Records argued about the list price. The album was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot; and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack. This so-called &quot;superstar pricing&quot; was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album or naming it &quot;Eight Ninety-Eight&quot; were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase. The final title comes from a line in the chorus of &quot;Insider.&quot;

&quot;Hard Promises&quot; is the last full album to feature the original Heartbreakers lineup, as bassist Ron Blair left after the album&#x27;s release. He returned on &quot;Mojo&quot;, and he would make guest appearances on &quot;Long After Dark&quot; and &quot;Southern Accents&quot; and, after rejoining the band in 2002, played on select tracks on &quot;The Last DJ&quot;. He was replaced by Howie Epstein, who continued to play until his removal in 2002 due to deteriorating health.

In 2000 it was voted number 968 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

===John Lennon tribute===

During the recording of the album, John Lennon was scheduled to be in the same studio at the same time. Petty was looking forward to meeting him when he came in. The meeting never occurred, as Lennon was murdered before the date of his planned visit to the studio. Petty and the band paid tribute to the slain former Beatle by etching &quot;WE LOVE YOU J.L.&quot; in the runout deadwax on early U.S. and Canadian pressings of &quot;Hard Promises&quot;.

<doc id="960738" wikidata="Q251856" url="?curid=960738" title="Atholl Highlanders">
<text>The Atholl Highlanders is a Scottish private infantry regiment. A ceremonial unit, it acts as the personal bodyguard to the Duke of Atholl, chieftain of the Clan Murray, a family that has lived in Perthshire for roughly seven centuries. Although it has no official military role, this hand-picked body of local men are armed with Lee–Metford rifles, and the regiment includes a pipe band. Joining the Highlanders is by invitation-only from the Duke, who specially selects men with ties to the estate or the local area. 

The regiment is not part of the British Armed Forces but under the command of the Duke of Atholl, and based at Blair Castle, Blair Atholl.

==History==
===First raising as a regular regiment in the British Army===
The regiment was raised in Perthshire by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl as the 77th Regiment of Foot (or Atholl Highlanders, or Murray&#x27;s Highlanders) in December 1777. The regiment was formed as a relief for other regiments serving in North America, and spent most of its existence in Ireland. The terms upon which the regiment was raised stated that the men were to be employed for either three years or the duration of the war in America. In 1781, the original three-year term ended, and the men expected the regiment to be disbanded. However, the regiment was transported to England and marched to Portsmouth to be embarked for service in India. Upon learning of this, the men mutinied, and the embarkation orders were countermanded. The regiment was marched to Berwick, where it disbanded in 1783.

===Second raising as a private regiment of the Duke of Atholl===
More than 50 years later, in 1839, George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl, as Lord Glenlyon, re-formed the regiment as a bodyguard which he took to the Eglinton Tournament at Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire. Three years later, in 1842, the regiment escorted Queen Victoria during her tour of Perthshire and, in 1844, when the Queen stayed as a guest of the Duke at Blair Castle, the regiment mounted the guard for the entire duration of her stay. In recognition of the service that the regiment provided during her two visits, the Queen announced that she would present the Atholl Highlanders with colours, thus giving the regiment official Scottish regiment status, in perpetuity. The regiment&#x27;s first stand of colours was presented by Lady Glenlyon in 1845. It received new colours in 1979 from Myra Butter, the wife of the Lord Lieutenant of Perth and Kinross. A third stand of colours was presented in 2006 by the Duchess of Atholl.

Under John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke, the regiment regularly provided guards for royal visitors to Blair Castle (which was a convenient stopping point on the journey to Balmoral). The regiment also attended the Braemar Gathering, while the annual Atholl Gathering was held in the first week in September in which the regiment paraded, then participated in various trials of strength and stamina. Following the First World War, parades of the regiment became fewer, although it did provide guards when the Crown Prince of Japan and King Faisal of Iraq visited Blair Castle in 1921 and 1933 respectively.

After many years of inactivity the regiment remained in abeyance until in 1966, when it was reformed by Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl. The 10th Duke made the decision to revive the regiment’s annual parade. To this effect eight local men mostly estate employees and all with previous military service training were invited to join, seven accepted. They paraded on 8 April 1966 at Blair Castle for the first time in 33 years. They marched past the Duke led by two Atholl Highlander pipers. In 1973 the regiment returned to the Braemar Gathering and took part in a march past in front of the Queen and other members of the royal family. The Atholl Gathering was re-introduced at Target Park in June 1984.

It was feared that the regiment would be disbanded following the 10th Duke&#x27;s death in 1996, until his successor, John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl, wrote to the estate trustees insisting that he would continue his traditional role. The 11th Duke, although resident in South Africa, visited Blair Atholl almost every year to inspect the regiment&#x27;s annual parade until his death. The 12th Duke continues this tradition.

The Atholl Highlanders continue with the current Duke of Atholl, as their Colonel-in-Chief.

White attacks Black&#x27;s pawn from the , which may occasion 2...dxc4. White may couple this plan with a kingside fianchetto (g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in the .

The opening is named after Czechoslovakian chess player Richard Réti (1889–1929). The opening is in the spirit of the hypermodernism movement that Réti championed, with the center being dominated from the wings rather than by direct occupation. If White fianchettoes both bishops, castles kingside, and refrains from occupying the center with pawns, the result may be described as the Réti System.

In the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;, the opening is found in codes A04–A09, where it is closely associated with the King&#x27;s Indian Attack.
==History==
According to Réti, the opening was introduced into master play in the early part of 1923. Réti used the opening most famously to defeat José Raúl Capablanca, the reigning World Chess Champion, in a game at the 1924 New York tournament. Alexander Alekhine played the Réti in the 1920s, but at that time almost any game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the Réti. Réti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit of hypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and a clearer distinction between it and other openings.

Hans Kmoch called the system of attack employed by Réti in the game Réti–Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1923, &quot;the Réti Opening&quot; or &quot;the Réti System&quot;. Savielly Tartakower called the opening the &quot;Réti–Zukertort Opening&quot;, and said of 1.Nf3: &quot;An opening of the past, which became, towards 1923, the opening of the future.&quot;

==Classic method: 2.c4 ==
In modern times the Réti refers only to the configuration Nf3 and c4 by White with ...d5 by Black, where White fianchettos at least one bishop and does not play an early d4.

After 2.c4 (&quot;ECO&quot; code A09), Black&#x27;s choices are:
* 2...e6 or 2...c6 (holding the d5-pawn)
* 2...dxc4 (giving up the d5-pawn)
* 2...d4 (pushing the pawn)

If Black takes the pawn, then in the same manner as the QGA, 3.e3 or 3.e4 regains the pawn with a slight advantage to White, as Black is left somewhat undeveloped. 3.Na3 and 3.Qa4+ are also good, and commonly played. This variety of White options limits the popularity of 2...dxc4. Trying to protect the pawn with 3...b5 allows 4.a4 leaving White with a superior position. The alternatives 2...d4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are more common, with the latter two generally leading to a Queen&#x27;s Gambit type of position, and 2...d4 typically being answered with 3.e3 or the interesting 3.b4

==Transpositions==
After 2.c4 e6 ():
* 3.d4 transposes to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. 
* 3.g3 Nf6 is the Neo-Catalan Opening; after 4.Bg2, Black may play ...Be7 or ...dxc4. 
** After 4...Be7, 5.d4 transposes to a Closed Catalan. 
** After 4...dxc4, White&#x27;s most common reply is 5.Qa4+, and this will not correspond to a 1.d4 line.

After 2.c4 c6:
* 3.d4 transposes to the Slav Defense.
* After 3.e3 Nf6:
** 4.d4 transposes to the Slow Slav. 
** After 4.Nc3 e6, 5.d4 transposes to the Semi-Slav. A separate option for White is 5.b3.

<text>The South Western Football League was an English association football league composed of clubs from Cornwall and west and north Devon. It consisted of a single division at the eleventh overall tier of the English football league system, the seventh and lowest &quot;Step&quot; of the official National League System. The East Cornwall League and Cornwall Combination ranked below the South Western on the overall pyramid, and in turn have feeder leagues of their own.

Champions of the South Western League, whose last principal sponsor was the &quot;Carlsberg&quot; beer brand via St. Austell Brewery, were eligible for promotion to the lower division of the Western League, but the difficulties Cornish teams have travelling further afield have discouraged applications for promotion. Truro City took this step in 2006. The lowest-ranked clubs in the 2004–05 FA Cup all came from the South Western League, no other clubs from leagues at that pyramid level having been accepted. Among them were St. Blazey, whose record for longest unbeaten streak in league football anywhere in the United Kingdom (75 games) stood until it was broken by AFC Wimbledon in 2004.

The league was formed in 1951 but foundation dates of the member clubs range from the 1880s to 1980s. The league disbanded in 2007, with a merger with the Devon County League to form a new competition covering the whole of Devon and Cornwall called the South West Peninsula League. The new competition&#x27;s top division is at Step 6 of the National League System, feeding directly into the Premier Division of the Western League.

The League ran a representative team; it played a match against a Football Association Amateur XI on , losing 7–3 at Home Park, Plymouth.

<doc id="960768" wikidata="Q697733" url="?curid=960768" title="Keying (official)">
<text>Keying (21 March 1787 – 29 June 1858), also known by his romanized Mandarin Chinese name Qiying or Ch&#x27;i-ying (Wade–Giles) and his Manchu name Kiyeng, was a Manchu statesman during the Qing dynasty of China. An imperial clansman of the house of Aisin Gioro, he began his career in the Imperial Clan Court. He conducted several peace treaties with Western powers, beginning with the Treaty of Nanking, which ended the First Opium War with Britain in 1842. Keying was sent to negotiate again in 1858 to settle the Arrow War with Britain and France, but the settlement was repudiated by the Xianfeng Emperor and he was forced to commit suicide.

== Early career ==
Keying was born on 21 March 1787. A descendant of Nurhaci&#x27;s ninth son Babutai (Duke Kexi of the First Rank), Keying was a member of the imperial house of Aisin Gioro, and belonged to the Manchu Plain Blue Banner in the Eight Banners. He held several prominent posts in the Qing government and was demoted several times because of corruption in office, but managed to regain his position as a leading official in the Qing court.

== Opium Wars ==

In 1842, the Daoguang Emperor entrusted Keying to conclude a peace treaty with Britain following the First Opium War, and he was chiefly responsible for negotiating and signing the Treaty of Nanking. The following year, he signed the Treaty of the Bogue to supplement the Treaty of Nanking. He also concluded the Treaty of Wanghia (1844) with the United States, the Treaty of Whampoa (1844) with France, and the Treaty of Canton (1847) with Sweden-Norway. This is the first group of what the Chinese later called the &quot;unequal treaties&quot;. In November 1845, Keying was well received in Hong Kong.

In 1858, the Xianfeng Emperor ordered Keying to negotiate a peace treaty with Britain and France to conclude the Second Opium War. During the negotiations, the British interpreters Horatio Nelson Lay and Thomas Francis Wade sought to expose Keying&#x27;s duplicity by producing documents the British had captured in Guangzhou, in which Keying expressed his contempt for the British. Humiliated, Keying promptly left the negotiations in Tianjin for Beijing and he was later arrested for having left his post in contravention of imperial order. He was sentenced to death by the Imperial Clan Court, but was allowed to commit suicide instead.

<text>Sonoma Valley is a valley located in southeastern Sonoma County, California, in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Known as the birthplace of the California wine industry, the valley is home to some of the earliest vineyards and wineries in the state, some of which survived the phylloxera epidemic of the 1870s and the impact of prohibition in the early 20th century. Today, the valley&#x27;s wines are promoted by the U.S. federal government&#x27;s Sonoma Valley and Carneros AVAs (or American Viticultural Areas).

Sonoma Valley offers a wide range of year-round festivals and events, including the Sonoma International Film Festival. Points of interest include the Quarryhill Botanic Garden, Mission San Francisco Solano, Jack London State Historic Park, Sonoma State Historic Park and the Blue Wing Inn of 1840.

==Geography==

The valley is located in southeastern Sonoma County between the Mayacamas Mountains and Sonoma Mountains. It stretches from San Pablo Bay in the south to the city of Santa Rosa in the north. Sonoma Creek flows down the valley to the bay. The area includes the incorporated city of Sonoma and part of the city of Santa Rosa, as well as numerous unincorporated communities, including Kenwood and Glen Ellen near Santa Rosa and, near Sonoma, El Verano, Boyes Hot Springs, Fetters Hot Springs, and Agua Caliente.

==History==
Once a valley of the coastal Miwok, Pomo and Wintun peoples, called the &quot;Valley of the Moon&quot; in their legends, the valley was selected by the Franciscan order of Spain as the site to build the Mission San Francisco Solano, the northernmost mission in their chain of twenty-one missions built in Alta California. Established in 1823 and named to honor St. Francis Solanus, Mission Solano was the sole California mission established under the rule of a newly independent Mexico. Within two generations of the Spaniards&#x27; arrival, however, the indigenous societies of the region were dispossessed of their land and decimated by diseases to which Europeans were resistant. Soon after the Sonoma mission was built, it was secularized by the Mexican government, and, under the orders of Lieutenant, later General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, el Pueblo de Sonoma (the town of Sonoma) was laid out in the standard form of a Mexican town, centered around the historic plaza, which is still the town&#x27;s focal point.
Also known as &quot;Valley of the Seven Moons&quot;
The raising of the first California Bear Flag and Vallejo&#x27;s arrest in 1846 by a band of Americans claiming to act on the orders of Col. John C. Fremont was the initial act that founded the Bear Flag Republic. Vallejo later transferred his allegiance with US statehood (1850), and with his amassed land holdings guided the development of the town and dispensed large ranches throughout the valley. California&#x27;s first wineries were established here, including Buena Vista Winery (1857) and Gundlach Bundschu (1858).

The other communities in the valley, such as Kenwood, Glen Ellen, Schellville, and Boyes Hot Springs, were founded later in the 19th century, some as resorts centered on the geothermic hot springs that still well up from deep within the earth. Boyes Hot Springs and Agua Caliente were popular health retreats for tourists from San Francisco and points beyond until the middle of the 20th century. Today the Sonoma Mission Inn in Boyes Hot Springs remains as a main destination resort, and the wineries, the historic sites, and the area&#x27;s natural beauty are the main tourist attractions.

In October 2017, Sonoma Valley was badly affected by the Tubbs Fire.

==Origin of the name==

The phrase &quot;Valley of the Moon&quot; was first recorded in an 1850 report by General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo to the California Legislature.

According to Jack London, who had a ranch there, the Native American word &quot;Sonoma&quot; means &quot;valley of the moon&quot;. He used it for his book of the same name. But there are several other possible translations for Sonoma (see Sonoma County, California). According to the Miwok tribes that lived in the valley, and the Pomo, it meant &quot;valley of the moon&quot; or &quot;many moons&quot;. Settlers may have accidentally translated the words &quot;many moons&quot; into &quot;valley of moons&quot;. Miwok legends say that the moon seemingly rose from this valley, or was &quot;nestled&quot; in the valley, or may have even sprung up multiple times in one night.

In the native languages there is also a constantly recurring ending &quot;tso-noma&quot;, from &quot;tso&quot;, the earth; and &quot;noma&quot;, village; hence &quot;tsonoma&quot;, &quot;earth village&quot;. Other sources say Sonoma comes from the Patwin tribes west of the Sacramento River, and their Wintu word for &quot;nose&quot;. Per &quot;California Place Names,&quot; &quot;the name is doubtless derived from a Patwin word for &#x27;nose&#x27;, which Padre Arroyo (Vocabularies, p. 22) gives as &quot;sonom&quot; (Suisun).&quot; Spaniards may have found an Indian chief with a prominent protuberance and applied the nickname of &quot;Chief Nose&quot; to the village and the territory. The name may have applied originally to a nose-shaped geographic feature.

==Geology==
The Sonoma Valley is part of the Coast Range Physiographic province. Basement rocks that make up the valley at great depth are the Great Valley Sequence shale, sandstone and conglomerate deposited in a continental slope- to abyssal plain environment via turbidite flows. The Cretaceous Great Valley Sequence overlies and contacts the Franciscan Complex along the Coast Range Thrust. The Jurassic-Cretaceous Franciscan Complex includes crumpled, uplifted terranes that have resulted from the subduction of the former oceanic Farallon Plate under the North American continent. During late Miocene-Pliocene time (~10 to ~4 million years) the area was attended by volcanism (Late Miocene Tolay Volcanics and Late Miocene - Pliocene Sonoma Volcanics) which are interbedded with the late Miocene-Pliocene Petaluma Formation. The (~9 to 4 million year old) Petaluma Formation was a fresh-water river system flowing from east to west and through the volcanics.

At that time, volcanic lava flows and river sands and gravels were actively deposited together, hence &quot;interbedded lavas and gravels&quot;. The volcanoes may have been similar to island arcs. The Petaluma Formation is found in outcrop from Sears Point to Santa Rosa (through Sonoma Mountain) and as far west as Cotati where it interfingers with a marine sandstone called the Wilson Grove Formation. Gravels in the Petaluma Formation did not come from rocks located in Napa, but have been sourced to mountains east of San Jose, California. This does not mean rivers flowed northward from San Jose to Sonoma; rather, strike-slip movement along the Hayward-Sonoma Valley-Carneros fault system has dislocated present-day Sonoma County north and away from the mountains in San Jose where the basin formed.

The valley is drained by Sonoma Creek, whose headwaters rise in Sugarloaf Ridge State Park and discharge into the San Pablo Bay at the Napa Sonoma Marsh. Some of the principal tributaries to Sonoma Creek are Yulupa Creek, Graham Creek, Calabazas Creek, Bear Creek, Schell Creek and Carriger Creek.

=== Hydrogeology ===
In spring 2006, the United States Geological Survey in conjunction with the Sonoma County Water Agency completed a comprehensive basin-wide groundwater study to characterize groundwater resources in the Sonoma Valley. The report can be obtained on the USGS publications website. Currently, a Basin Advisory Panel, composed of stakeholders from agriculture, environmental groups, domestic well owners, municipalities and government is working to develop a groundwater management plan to protect groundwater resources in the valley.

<text>The Caro–Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
:1. 

The Caro–Kann is a common defence against 1.e4. It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.

Black prepares to contest the with 2...d5. Unlike the similarly motivated French Defence, the Caro–Kann does not hinder the development of Black&#x27;s light-squared bishop. It comes at the cost of a tempo, however, because Black has to play 1...c6 before the pawn to c5, whereas Black can push c7–c5 in one move in the French Defence. White can combat the Caro–Kann in several different ways, often gaining a space advantage; additionally, Black has less mobility and can lag in . 

The Caro–Kann remains a popular opening in top level chess, being employed by among others Alireza Firouzja, Vladislav Artemiev and Ding Liren.
==History==
The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian player Marcus Kann, both of whom analysed it in 1886. Kann scored an impressive 24-move victory with the Caro–Kann Defence against German-British chess champion Jacques Mieses at the 4th German Chess Congress in Hamburg in May 1885:


==Main line: 2.d4 d5==
After 2. the most common moves are 3. (Classical and Modern variations), 3., 3. (Exchange Variation), and 3. (Advance Variation).
===3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2===
3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2 usually transpose into each other after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4. Since the 1970s, 3.Nd2 has increased in popularity to avoid the Gurgenidze Variation (3.Nc3 g6) and to retain the option of 4.c3.

====Classical Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 ====

The most common way of handling the Caro–Kann, the Classical Variation (often referred to as the Capablanca Variation after Cuban world champion José Raúl Capablanca), is defined by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5. This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro–Kann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White&#x27;s pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.

Much of the Caro–Kann&#x27;s reputation as a defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely c6–c5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black castling gave the Caro–Kann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling and even leaving his king in the . These variations can be and dynamic.

Here is a illustrating White&#x27;s attacking chances when the players castle on opposite sides in the Classical Variation:

====Modern Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 ====

Another solid line, this variation is characterised by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7. It has been played by and named after the first, seventh, and twelfth world champions Wilhelm Steinitz, Vasily Smyslov and Anatoly Karpov, but is now most commonly known as the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black&#x27;s position.

Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. This freedom comes at a cost, however, as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5 where Black&#x27;s development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous last game of the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov rematch where Kasparov committed a known blunder and lost was played in this line. Black must also beware of the quick mating for White, 5.Qe2 Ngf6 6.Nd6#, but after 5... Ndf6, Black enjoys a solid position.
====3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+====

=====Bronstein–Larsen Variation: 5...gxf6 =====

Black has voluntarily opted for an inferior pawn structure and a practical necessity of castling queenside, while gaining dynamic compensation in the form of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro–Kann. It is generally considered somewhat unsound, though world championship challenger David Bronstein and former world championship candidate Bent Larsen employed it with some success.
=====Korchnoi (or Tartakower) Variation: 5...exf6 =====

Viktor Korchnoi played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black&#x27;s 5...exf6 is regarded as sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the Bronstein–Larsen Variation and offers Black rapid development, though also ceding White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects (Black has to be cautious that the d-pawn is now a potential passed pawn in the endgame).
====Gurgenidze Variation: 3.Nc3 g6 ====

The Gurgenidze Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 g6. Black prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7, creating pressure against White&#x27;s d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 Bg7 White usually plays 5.h3 to prevent the ...Bg4 pin. This variation, originated by Bukhuti Gurgenidze, led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do because of a dark squared pawn chain. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4.
====3.Nc3 a6====
Black is waiting for an opportunity to develop his queenside bishop without giving up his d5-pawn: 4.Nf3 Bg4, often switching into a &quot;French&quot; structure after moves like 5.Be2 e6 6.0-0 Nf6 7.e5 Nfd7 followed by c5, Nc6 and Qb6. Other options for White are the transpositions into the Exchange or the Advance Variation (with Nc3 and ...a6).

===Advance Variation: 3.e5 ===

The variation that follows 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.

The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.g4) or the Van der Wiel Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian grandmaster (GM) Alexei Shirov, or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English GM Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s. Another less popular but aggressive line is the Tal variation (4.h4 h5), popularised by GM Mikhail Tal.

The variation that follows 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match versus Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik – two draws and a loss). The line was christened the &quot;Arkell/Khenkin Variation&quot; in the leading chess magazine &quot;New in Chess&quot; yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation. In comparison to the French Defence, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on 1...e6; however, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central with 4.dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.
===Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 cxd5 ===
The Exchange Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5.

====Main line: 4.Bd3====

The Exchange Variation begins with 4.Bd3 (to prevent ...Bf5 while still developing) 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 Bg4 7.Qb3. This line is considered to offer White a slightly better game and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5), with colours reversed.
====Panov–Botvinnik Attack: 4.c4 ====

The Panov–Botvinnik Attack begins with the move 4.c4. It is named after Vasily Panov and the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This system often leads to typical (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black&#x27;s main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the Nimzo-Indian Defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5.
===Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 ===
The Fantasy Variation, formerly known as the Tartakower or Maróczy Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3...g6 has been tried by Yasser Seirawan. GM Lars Schandorff and GM Sam Shankland both prefer 3...dxe4 4.fxe4 e5 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nd7 7.0-0 Ngf6 8.c3 Bd6 with play being sharp and double-edged, though recent theory suggest that 7.c3! is more critical, giving a small objective advantage for White. Interesting, though probably insufficient, is 3...e5. This so-called &#x27;Twisted Fantasy Variation&#x27; aims to exploit White&#x27;s weaknesses on the a7–g1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by Baadur Jobava. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by Sir Stuart Milner-Barry, and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3 (von Hennig).

==Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) ==

The Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by Bobby Fischer in his youth, but has since declined in popularity. White&#x27;s intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain options regarding the d-pawn. Black&#x27;s logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is but Black must be careful. In Noteboom–Mindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4 9.h5! dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose .

This variation sets a trap: playing along the lines of the Classical Variation gets Black in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6 () 9.Bc4! e6 (9...gxh5 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead, Lasker–Radsheer, 1908 and Alekhine–Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7!

After the moves 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Qf3!? (Goldman Variation), White&#x27;s position is sound according to Graham Burgess.
==Other lines==
2.c4, the Accelerated Panov Attack, is an effective move for White. Black will probably play 2...d5 (see ). This can transpose to the Panov–Botvinnik (B14, given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4) or Caro–Kann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5, the Open Variation (see ). The 2.c4 line can also arise by transposition from the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4.

The Hillbilly Attack, 1.e4 c6 2.Bc4?!, is most often played by weaker players unfamiliar with the Caro–Kann Defence. If 2...d5 3.exd5 cxd5, Black has simply gained a tempo on the bishop. Nevertheless, GM Simon Williams has experimented with this move, following it up by gambiting the pawn with 2...d5 3.Bb3!?

A relatively unknown try is 1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.Ne5!?, sometimes referred to as the Apocalypse Attack. Despite its oddity, this line carries a deceptive amount of venom, e.g. 4...Bf5? immediately runs into trouble after 5.Bb5+, when Black must lose a tempo and the bishop pair with 5...Bd7 (5..Nd7?? 6.Qf3 is disastrous for Black). The game can continue 6.Qh5 g6 7.Nxd7! Nxd7 (7...gxh5?? 8.Nf6#) 8.Qxd5, where White wins a pawn and enjoys a strong initiative. This variation is similar to the traditional Exchange Caro–Kann (in which playing Ne5 is one of White&#x27;s goals) with the added benefit that the pin ...Bg4 has been sidestepped entirely. After 3...Nc6, White may proceed with d4 and Bb5, responding to ...Qb6 with c4 (the Neo-Panov-Botvinnik Attack) and to ...Bd7 with Nxd7 to acquire the two bishops, or he may play in a Stonewall fashion with d4, c3, Bd3, and f4 in some order. While 3...e6 is a perfectly acceptable Black response—and appears to be the most often played—the response 3...g6! is critical, allowing Black flexibility in fighting for e5.

Other lines are ineffective or doubtful. These include 2.d3, the Breyer Variation; 2.b3, the Euwe Attack; 2.b4, the Labahn Attack; 2.g4, the Spike Variation; and 2.Ne2, the Bohemian Attack.

<text>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a disorder that results in recurrent attacks of severe swelling. The swelling most commonly affects the arms, legs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. If the intestinal tract is affected, abdominal pain and vomiting may occur. Swelling of the airway can result in its obstruction and trouble breathing. Without preventive treatment, attacks typically occur every two weeks and last for a few days.
There are three main types of HAE. Types I and II are caused by a mutation in the &quot;SERPING1&quot; gene, which encodes the C1 inhibitor protein, and type III now called HAE with Normal C1 esterase(HAE nl C1). Six known mutations are described in the literature under the type 3 HAE. The result is increased levels of bradykinin, which promotes swelling. The condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or occur as a new mutation. Triggers for an attack may include minor trauma or stress, but attacks often occur without any obvious preceding event. Diagnosis of types I and II is based on measurement of C4 and C1-inhibitor levels.
Management of HAE involves efforts to prevent attacks and the treatment of attacks if they occur. During an attack, supportive care such as intravenous fluids and airway support may be required. C1 inhibitor medications can be used for both prevention and treatment, while ecallantide and icatibant can be used to treat acute attacks.
HAE affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people. The condition is typically first noticed in childhood. Type I and II affects females and males equally, while type III affects females more often than males. When the airway is involved, without treatment, the risk of death is about 25%. With treatment, outcomes are generally good. The condition was first described in 1888 by Canadian physician William Osler.

==Signs and symptoms==
People diagnosed with Hereditary Angioedema have recurrent swelling in the extremities, genitals, face, lips, larynx or GI tract.

Swelling involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems can cause significant risk and distress. Involvement of respiratory structures, such as the throat or larynx, can cause difficulties in breathing and life-threatening airway obstruction. Episodes that attack the gastrointestinal tract can cause a number of complications including vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration.

Some people may experience prodromal symptoms, including tingling, fatigue or weakness at the site of impending edema with one third of people experiencing an erythematous rash (erythema marginatum) as the prodromal symptom. Urticaria is usually not seen in hereditary angioedema, as compared to other causes of angioedema such as histamine induced symptoms.

== Genetics ==
Because HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, there is no sex difference in transmission and both sexes are equally likely to receive the mutated gene from their parents. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with regards to hereditary angioedema requires receipt of only one copy of the mutated C1 inhibitor gene to have symptomatic disease. Further, hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency types 1 and 2 have complete penetrance, meaning all of those who inherit the dysfunctional gene will have symptomatic disease. However, hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor levels (Type 3 disease) has incomplete penetrance, and men may be asymptomatic carriers despite inheriting a mutated gene.

With regards to the mutations in the SERPING1 gene that is seen in hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 (hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency), 75% of the cases are due to an autosomal dominant inheritance of a mutated gene and 25% of cases are due to de novo mutations of the egg or sperm, or early in embryological development. Hereditary angioedema type 3 (hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor levels) is associated with mutations in genes for Factor XII, angiopoietin 1, plasminogen or kininogen 1.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to bradykinin mediated angioedema in hereditary angioedema have been described. C1 inhibitor usually acts as an inhibitor of the plasma contact system. However, in hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency, C1 inhibitor is either reduced in quantity and function (type 1) or dysfunctional (type 2), this leads to bradykinin disinhibition and bradykinin mediated activation of bradykinin B1 receptor and bradykinin B2 receptor on endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels). This activation leads to vascular endothelial cadherin (a type of cell adhesion molecule) phosphorylation, internalization and degradation. Cadherin degradation leads to actin cytoskeleton contraction and increased pore size of the vascular endothelial cells. Adherens junctions are also reduced due to bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor activation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is also activated. The degradation of these endothelial intercellular barrier junctions mediated by histamine leads to increased vascular permeability, leading to vascular leakage into surrounding tissues and thus causing the characteristic swelling seen in hereditary angioedema. The bradykinin B1 receptor (unlike the B2 receptor) is slowly and only partially desensitized after binding the bradykinin agonist, thus remaining constitutively active long after initial bradykinin exposure which can explain the protracted swelling seen in hereditary angioedema as compared to other causes of angioedema.

==Diagnosis==

Recognizing HAE is often difficult due to the wide variability in disease expression, with the diagnosis often delayed for years. The course of the disease is diverse and unpredictable, even within a single patient over their lifetime. This disease may be similar in its presentation to other forms of angioedema resulting from allergies or other medical conditions, but it is significantly different in cause and treatment. When HAE is misdiagnosed as an allergy it is most commonly treated with steroids, epinephrine or anti-histamines, drugs that are usually ineffective in treating a HAE episode. Other misdiagnoses have resulted in unnecessary exploratory surgery for patients with abdominal swelling and other HAE patients report that their abdominal pain was wrongly diagnosed as psychosomatic or malingering.

HAE accounts for only a small fraction of all cases of angioedema. To avoid potentially fatal consequences such as upper airway obstruction and unnecessary abdominal surgery, the importance of a correct diagnosis cannot be overemphasized.

==Types==
There are three types of hereditary angioedema (HAE). HAE types I and II are both caused by a deficiency of complement C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), a plasma protein that is an important inhibitor of several serine proteases, specially of the complement system and the contact activation/kallikrein-kinin pathway, but also the fibrinolytic system.

In HAE type I, there is a quantitative C1-inhibitor deficiency, antigenic as well as functional C1-inhibitor levels in plasma are decreased. This type accounts for approximately 85% of HAE cases with C1-inhibitor deficiency.

In HAE type II, there is a qualitative deficiency, with normal - sometimes even elevated - C1-inhibitor protein levels, but decreased functional C1-inhibitor measurements. This type is seen in approximately 15% of HAE cases with C1-inhibitor deficiency.

C1-inhibitor deficiency is caused by mutations of the SERPING1 gene, the gene encoding complement C1-inhibitor. More than 700 different mutations have been described. The SERPING1 gene shows a considerable tendency for de novo mutations. As a result, it is not uncommon to observe patients with primary recurrent angioedema attacks and C1-inhibitor deficiency where both parents are unaffected.

Another type of hereditary angioedema, originally named HAE type III, has been observed. In contrast to HAE types I and II, this type of the disease is characterized by normal C1-inhibitor measurements. Thus, the term &quot;hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor&quot; is now generally used for this HAE type. Normal C1 inhibitor level hereditary angioedema is thought to involve various mutations that increased bradykinin activity and cause a decreased threshold for activation of the plasma contact system thus leading to the symptoms of angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Several molecular subtypes have been identified. A first subtype, identified in 2006, is caused by mutations of the F12 gene encoding coagulation factor XII (also known as Hageman factor). All four mutations known so far, the two originally described missense mutations in exon 9 as well as the two additional, very rare mutations described later, affect the proline-rich region of coagulation factor XII. An accelerated activation of the kallikrein-kinin system appears to represent the pathomechanism through that the F12 mutations cause angioedema.

Clinical manifestation of hereditary angioedema due to a F12 mutation occurs preferably, but not exclusively in female mutation carriers. The remarkable estrogen-sensitivity is a characteristic feature of the HAE type caused by a F12 mutation. For example, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives play an important role in triggering angioedema attacks. Exacerbation of symptoms during pregnancy is also a common observation. Hereditary angioedema due to Factor XII dysfunction is the most common subtype of type III angioedema.

A second molecular subtype of HAE with normal C1-inhibitor is caused by a mutation of the plasminogen gene, namely a rare missense mutation within the kringle 3 domain of plasminogen, resulting in a novel type of dysplasminogenemia. The mutation creates a new lysine-binding site within the kringle 3 domain and alters the glycosylation of plasminogen. The mutant plasminogen protein has been shown to be a highly efficient kininogenase that directly releases bradykinin from high- and low-molecular-weight kininogen. Tongue swellings are a very frequent and characterizing symptom in patients with hereditary angioedema due to a plasminogen mutation.

Very rare observations have suggested that mutations of the following genes may also be responsible for the development of hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor: angiopoietin 1 [HAE with an angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) mutation]; myoferlin [HAE with a myoferlin (MYOF) mutation]; kininogen 1 [HAE with a kininogen 1 (KNG1) mutation]; and heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 6 [HAE with a heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 6 (HS3ST6) mutation].

However, for a large proportion of cases with hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor the genetic cause remains unknown.

==Prevention==
Treatment with ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in this condition, as these drugs can lead to bradykinin accumulation, which can precipitate disease episodes.

===Long-term===
People in whom episodes occur at least once a month or who are at high risk of developing laryngeal edema require long-term prevention. There are several phase III clinical trials addressing HAE prophylaxis and therapy. These have led to the licensing of pdC1INH in many parts of the world; bradykinin receptor antagonists (icatibant) in Europe; kallikrein inhibitors (ecallantide and lanadelumab) in the United States; and recombinant C1-INH replacement therapy (rhC1INH; conestat alfa) in Europe. Tranexamic acid has been shown to be relatively ineffective therapy. Danazol prophylaxis remains an option but therapeutic agents are now being used more for prophylaxis because of danazol&#x27;s adverse events.

In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lanadelumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to prevent attacks of HAE types I and II in people twelve years of age and older. Lanadelumab inhibits the plasma enzyme kallikrein, which liberates the kinins bradykinin and kallidin from their kininogen precursors and is produced in excess in individuals with HAE types I and II.

Berotralstat was approved in the US in December 2020, for the prevention of attacks of hereditary angioedema in people twelve years of age and older.

===Short-term===
Short-term prevention is normally administered before surgery or dental treatment. In Germany, C1-INH concentrate is used for this and given 1–1.5 hours before the procedure. In countries where C1-inhibitor concentrate is not available or only available in an emergency (laryngeal edema), high-dose androgen treatment is administered for 5–7 days.

==Management==
The aim of acute treatment is to halt progression of the edema as quickly as possible, which can be life-saving, particularly if the swelling is in the larynx. In Germany, most acute treatment consists of C1 inhibitor concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously; however, in most European countries, C1 inhibitor concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programs. In emergency situations where C1 inhibitor concentrate is not available, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used as an alternative, as it also contains C1 inhibitor.

Other treatment modalities can stimulate the synthesis of C1 inhibitor, or reduce C1 inhibitor consumption. Purified C1 inhibitor, derived from human blood, has been used in the EU since 1979. Several C1 inhibitor treatments are available in the US and two C1 inhibitor products are available in Canada. Berinert P (CSL Behring), which is pasteurized, was approved by the US FDA in 2009 for acute attacks. Cinryze, which is nanofiltered, was approved by the FDA in 2008 for prophylaxis. Ruconest is a recombinant C1 inhibitor approved in the US and the EU that does not carry the risk of infectious disease transmission due to human blood-borne pathogens.

The medication ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein and was approved by the FDA in the United States for acute attacks in 2009. Icatibant inhibits the bradykinin B2 receptor, and was approved in the EU and the US.

In February 2023, the FDA approved the expanded use of lanadelumab (Takhzyro) to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema in children aged 2 to 12 years of age.

The experimental gene therapy BMN 331 can also be used to prevent the disorder by targeting the SERPING1 gene with adeno-associated virus.

== Prognosis ==
About 25% of those affected die in the first two decades of life, mainly due to lack of treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Data regarding the epidemiology of angioedema is limited. The incidence of HAE is one in 10,000–50,000 people in the United States and Canada. Mortality rates are estimated at 15–33%, resulting primarily from laryngeal edema and asphyxiation. HAE leads to 15,000–30,000 emergency department visits per year.

==Society and culture==
There are national associations for HAE patients and their families in a number of countries around the world. Many of these national associations are members of the global organization Hereditary Angioedema International (HAEI). HAEI raises awareness about hereditary angioedema as well as facilitating coordination of research regarding the condition.

Each year on 16 May, HAEi and the HAE community raise awareness of HAE with the international HAE day.

==Research==
Clinical development of several new active substances, which intervene in the disease process in different ways, is currently ongoing.

In October 2010, the European Medicines Agency authorized conestat alfa (brand name Ruconest), a C1-inhibitor for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks.

Icatibant (marketed as Firazyr) is a selective bradykinin receptor antagonist, was authorized in the EU in July 2008, and was approved in the US in August 2011. After initial borderline results this drug was shown to be effective in phase III trials. Cinryze, a C1 esterase inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in October 2008.

Sebetralstat, an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor, provided faster times to beginning of symptom relief, reduction in attack severity, and complete attack resolution compared to placebo when given as on-demand treatment to people twelve years of age or older., raising the possibility of a “pill-in-pocket” preventive approach to HAE attacks.

The investigational antisense oligonucleotide donidalorsen significantly reduced hereditary angioedema attack rates and improved patient-reported quality of life when administered 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 or 8 weeks. The drug selectively binds to prekallikrein messenger RNA (mRNA) and degrades it by means of ribonuclease H1, which results in the reduced production of prekallikrein protein, a key precursor in the kallikrein–kinin cascade.

Based CRISPR/Cas9 technology, a potential one-time gene editing therapy known as NTLA-2002 is also being developed for the treatment of HAE. NTLA-2002 is designed to prevent HAE attacks by inactivating the kallikrein B1 (KLKB1) gene, which encodes for prekallikrein, the kallikrein precursor protein.

<doc id="960785" wikidata="Q232271" url="?curid=960785" title="Justa Grata Honoria">
<text>Justa Grata Honoria (c. 418 – c. 455) was the daughter of Constantius III and Galla Placidia, as well as the sister of Valentinian III. At a young age, she was granted the title of Augusta. She was said to have asked Attila the Hun to invade on her behalf, which is often interpreted as a proposal.

==Family==
Honoria was the only daughter of later Emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia. Her first two names were after her maternal great-aunts, Justa and Grata, the daughters of Valentinian I and Justina, and the third for the emperor who reigned at the time of her birth, her half-uncle Honorius. Her maternal half-brother Theodosius, born in 414 from the first marriage of Placidia to king Ataulf of the Visigoths, died in infancy, before Honoria was born. Her younger brother, Valentinian III, was her full brother.

==Biography==
The historical record of most of her life is little more than brief mentions of or allusions to her presence. Oost notes that she accompanied her mother and younger brother as they set sail for Constantinople in spring of 423, and that Honoria was with them when they joined the expeditionary force at Thessalonica in the summer of 424 that would restore Galla Placidia and Valentinian to power in the West. She was included in mosaics of the Imperial family, now lost, at the church attached to the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia and in a church dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist in Ravenna. Last is &quot;Carmen I&quot; of Merobaudes written &quot;circa&quot; 443, although a fragmentary poem it clearly includes her in a description of the family of Valentinian III. These details have led Stewart Oost to observe that Honoria came to feel &quot;that life had condemned her to a dull and impotent backwater.&quot;

== Honoria Affair ==

She was alleged to have been in relationship with and impregnated by a man that was working within her household, which was discussed by John of Antioch in the 7th century. Prior to this, Honoria had power as a royal Augusta, but this power was taken away following the affair. Being impregnated presented a problem to the line of succession: if Honoria had a son while her brother had daughters, there was a chance that rule could pass to Honoria’s son, not including a possible struggle with Honoria and her lover. The man she had relations with was put to death and she was married to senator Herculanus.

The emperor was distracted with a multitude of different issues, such as the attack of Britain, North Africa, and Spain, as well as the continuous advance of Attila the Hun. The Western empire was being continuously weakened, and Honoria hastened the Huns&#x27; invasion with her message to Attila the Hun. In A.D. 450, she sent her eunuch, Hyacinthus, to Attila with a message asking for assistance in exchange for a reward, also sending her ring as proof of her earnestness. In response, Attila sent ambassadors to announce that he would marry Honoria and to insist that her title was returned; the Romans refused on both accounts. Shortly afterwards, Attila invaded Roman Gaul.

Honoria was said by contemporaries, such as the historian Priscus of Panium, to be the main cause of Attila’s invasion, but some modern historians have taken a more favorable stance on her. J.B Bury, a proponent of rehabilitating Honoria&#x27;s reputation, called her &quot;another of those political women whose perils and accomplishments lend color to the history of the Theodosian era.&quot; Kenneth Holum has said that her message was not the only factor in provoking the Huns&#x27; attack. It is possible that the Huns would have invaded otherwise given their reliance on Roman goods to upkeep their economy. Attila’s army had been advancing for decades; their fight was reinvigorated by Honoria’s letter, as well as power struggles and changes with diplomacy in the Roman empire. Under Theodosius II, embassies sent to Attila continually denied his requests to send higher ranking officials.

The Eastern empire continuously changed their diplomatic strategies, with their highest priority being to make the Eastern emperor look powerful. On the other hand, the Western empire continued the same diplomatic strategies, with little success. Following the death of Emperor Theodosius II, his sister Pulcheria married the military general Marcian while keeping her vow of virginity as an &quot;augusta&quot;. After ascending to the throne, Marcian stopped tribute payments to the Huns. Prior to invading, the Huns sent Gothic embassies to both empires, from the east they requested to continue the tribute system, while from the west they requested Honoria, assuming that women in the Roman empire were vessels of power. The Hunnic embassies took note of the stronger military in the east, and they decided to invade the west instead.

Attila began his attack in Gaul, which was to fight the Goths to win favor with Geiseric. Meanwhile Roman general Aetius convinced Visgothic king Theodoric to aid in their defense. Together, they had a good chance of defeating the Huns and won the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. During this battle, Theodoric had been killed in battle, and Aetius returned to Rome in shame rather than fight the vulnerable Huns. The writer Jordanes had claimed that Attila fought this battle to kill Aetius, but there is little support for this notion and is disproved by military accounts of the Huns in Priscus.

Following the affair, Hyacinthus, her eunuch, was tortured and executed. Little is known of Honoria&#x27;s fate. Galla Placidia had to step in to advocate for her exile, rather than execution to protect Honoria from Valentinian III. In concluding his account of this incident, John of Antioch writes, &quot;And so Honoria was freed from her danger at this time.&quot; Regarding the ambiguity of the phrase &quot;at this time&quot;, Bury asks, &quot;Does this imply that she incurred some punishment afterwards, worse even than a dull marriage?&quot; Lastly, because her name doesn&#x27;t appear in the list of important persons carried off to Carthage by the Vandals following their sack of the city, the capture of her sister-in-law and her nieces and the murder of her brother in 455, Oost suggests she was dead by then; whether of natural causes or by order of her brother the Emperor, Oost admits &quot;we do not have evidence adequate&quot; to decide. In 452, her husband Herculanus was appointed as the consul in Rome, possibly as a gesture of the emperor&#x27;s gratitude for preserving Honoria&#x27;s honor and reputation.

Ancient writers wrote selectively about women&#x27;s actions, which makes it difficult to understand her life outside this event. For this reason, historians infer based on scant primary sources. This inhibits the ability for historians to infer the real motivations behind her actions. While Honoria&#x27;s actions may have contributed to the end of the Western empire, there were plenty of other factors that influenced the fall, such as continuous barbarian invasions, ambitious generals, and weakening imperial authority.

<doc id="960786" wikidata="Q7179401" url="?curid=960786" title="Petty treason">
<text>Petty treason or petit treason was an offence under the common law of England in which a person killed or otherwise violated the authority of a social superior, other than the king. In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. It was abolished in Ireland in 1829. It never existed in Scotland. It has also been abolished in other common-law countries.

==Element of betrayal==
The element of betrayal is the reason why this crime was considered worse than an ordinary murder; medieval and post-medieval society rested on a framework in which each person had his or her appointed place and such murders were seen as threatening this framework. Many people had somebody subordinate to them and feared the consequences if the murder of superiors was not punished harshly.

==Codification in English law==
The common law offence was codified in the Treason Act 1351. Under that Act, petty treason was an aggravated form of murder. It consisted of:

# a wife killing her husband,
# a clergyman killing his prelate,
# a servant killing his master or mistress, or his master&#x27;s wife.

The Act abolished three other forms of petty treason which had existed under common law:

# a wife attempting to kill her husband,
# a servant forging his master&#x27;s seal, or
# a servant committing adultery with his master&#x27;s wife or daughter.

Counterfeiting gold or silver coin was also petty treason before the 1351 Act elevated this to high treason. However the method of execution was not changed.

==Penalty==
The punishment for a man convicted of petty treason was to be drawn to the place of execution and hanged, but not quartered as in the case of high treason. The punishment for a woman was to be burned at the stake without being drawn there (the penalty for high treason was drawing and burning). In later years the law offered a modicum of mercy to women who were to be executed in this fashion: the executioner was equipped with a cord passed around the victim&#x27;s throat and, standing outside of the fire, would pull it tight, strangling her before the flames could reach her. In a few instances, however, this could go wrong, with the cord burning through and the victim burning alive; the ensuing scandals contributed to the abolition of this punishment and its replacement by hanging in 1790.

==Defences and rules of procedure==
The common law defence of provocation, by which a verdict of murder could be reduced to manslaughter, was also available in petty treason trials.

The rules of evidence and procedure in petty treason trials were the same as in high treason trials, except that the Treason Act 1695 did not apply to petty treason. Petty treason also differed from high treason in that the legal defence of benefit of clergy was available for petty treason until 1496, whereas it was never available for high treason.

<text>Nitrous oxide, as medical gas supply, is an inhaled gas used as pain medication, and is typically administered with 50% oxygen mix. It is often used together with other medications for anesthesia. Common uses include during childbirth, following trauma, and as part of end-of-life care. Onset of effect is typically within half a minute, and the effect lasts for about a minute.

Nitrous oxide was discovered between 1772 and 1793 and used for anesthesia in 1844. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It often comes as a 50/50 mixture with oxygen. Devices with a demand valve are available for self-administration. The setup and maintenance is relatively expensive for developing countries.

There are few side effects, other than vomiting, with short-term use. With long-term use anemia or numbness may occur. It should always be given with at least 21% oxygen. It is not recommended in people with a bowel obstruction or pneumothorax. Use in the early part of pregnancy is not recommended. It is possible to continue breastfeeding following use.

==History==

Pure N2O was first used as a medical analgesic in December 1844, when Horace Wells made the first 12–15 dental operations with the gas in Hartford.

Its debut as a generally accepted method, however, came in 1863, when Gardner Quincy Colton introduced it more broadly at all the Colton Dental Association clinics, that he founded in New Haven and New York City.

The first devices used in dentistry to administer the gas consisted of a simple breathing bag made of rubber cloth.

Breathing the pure gas often caused hypoxia (oxygen insufficiency) and sometimes death by asphyxiation. Eventually practitioners became aware of the need to provide at least 21% oxygen content in the gas (the same percentage as in air). In 1911, the anaesthetist Arthur Ernest Guedel first described the use of self-administration of a nitrous oxide and oxygen mix. It was not until 1961 that the first paper was published by Michael Tunstall and others, describing the administration of a pre-mixed 50:50 nitrous oxide and oxygen mix, which led to the commercialisation of the product.

In 1970, Peter Baskett recognised that pre-mixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mix could have an important part to play in the provision of pre-hospital pain relief management, provided by ambulance personnel. Baskett contacted the Chief Ambulance Officer for the Gloucestershire Ambulance Brigade, Alan Withnell, to suggest this idea. This gained traction when Baskett negotiated with the British Oxygen Company, the availability of pre-mixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mix apparatus for training. Regular training sessions began at Frenchay Hospital (Bristol) and a pilot study was run in Gloucestershire (in which ambulances were crewed by a driver and one of the new highly trained ambulance men), the results of this trial were published in 1970.

Today the nitrous oxide is administered in hospitals by a relative analgesia machine, which includes several improvements such as flowmeters and constant-flow regulators, an anaesthetic vaporiser, a medical ventilator, and a scavenger system, and delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen.

The machine used in dentistry is much simpler, and is meant to be used by the patient in a fully conscious state. The gas is delivered through a demand-valve inhaler over the nose, which will only release gas when the patient inhales through it.

==Medical uses==
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is itself active (does not require any changes in the body to become active), and so has an onset in roughly the lung–brain circulation time with peak action 30 seconds after the start of administration. It is removed from the body unchanged via the lungs, and does not accumulate under normal conditions, explaining the rapid offset of around 60 seconds. It is effective in managing pain during labor and delivery.

Nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for alcohol withdrawal.

Nitrous oxide is more soluble than oxygen and nitrogen, so will tend to diffuse into any air spaces within the body. This makes it dangerous to use in patients with pneumothorax or those who have recently been scuba diving, and there are cautions over its use with any bowel obstruction.

Its analgesic effect is strong (equivalent to 15 mg of subcutaneous route morphine) and characterised by rapid onset and offset, i.e. it is very fast-acting and wears off very quickly.

When used in combination with other anesthetics gases, nitrous oxide causes a dose dependent increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volumes, the net effect is a lower minute ventilation. Like volatile anesthetics, it increases cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. However, contrary to volatile anesthetics, it leads to an increase in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen.

==Contraindications==
N2O should not be used in patients with bowel obstruction, pneumothorax, or middle ear or sinus disease, or who have had a recent intraocular injection of gas and should also not be used on any patient who has been scuba diving within the preceding 24 hours or in violently disturbed psychiatric patients.
There are also clinical cautions in place for the first two trimesters of pregnancy and in patients with decreased levels of consciousness.

==Composition==

The gas is a mixture of half nitrous oxide (N2O) and half oxygen (O2). The ability to combine N2O and oxygen at high pressure while remaining in the gaseous form is caused by the Poynting effect (after John Henry Poynting, an English physicist). The Poynting effect involves the dissolution of gaseous O2 when bubbled through liquid N2O, with vaporisation of the liquid to form a gaseous O2/N2O mixture.

Since the two substances are homogeneously mixed gases, the cylinder delivers a consistent 50/50 mixture all the way down to empty, even if the cylinder adiabatically cools somewhat from the discharge.

Some N2O may condense into a liquid if the cylinder is cooled to low temperatures (−7 °C or below), which can be dangerous if unaddressed. This occurs most easily with partially used / lower pressure cylinders. Even after warming the contents back into a gaseous state, they may remain nonhomogenous for days. Thus it is typically instructed to warm cylinders in a horizontal orientation (to maximize heat transfer) for a 48 hour period, then rehomogenize the gas by inverting the cylinder three times.

==Administration==
The gas is self-administered through a demand valve, using a mouthpiece, bite block or face mask. Self-administration of Entonox is safe because if enough is inhaled to start to induce anaesthesia, the patient becomes unable to hold the valve, and so will drop it and soon exhale the residual gas. This means that unlike other anaesthetic gases, it does not require the presence of an anaesthetist for administration. The 50% oxygen in Entonox ensures the person will have sufficient oxygen in their alveoli and conducting airways for a short period of apnea to be safe.

== Mechanism of action ==

The pharmacological mechanism of action of in medicine is not fully known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of ligand-gated ion channels, and this likely plays a major role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks NMDAR and β-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABA and 5-HT receptors, and slightly potentiates GABA and glycine receptors. It also has been shown to activate two-pore-domain channels. While affects quite a few ion channels, its anesthetic, hallucinogenic and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly, or fully, via inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated currents. In addition to its effects on ion channels, may act to imitate nitric oxide (NO) in the central nervous system, and this may be related to its analgesic and anxiolytic properties. Nitrous oxide is 30 to 40 times more soluble than nitrogen.

==Society and culture==
Nitronox was a registered trademark of the BOC Group between 1966 and 1999, and was reregistered by Hs Tm Inc since 2005 It is also colloquially known as &quot;gas and air&quot; in the United Kingdom.

==Research==
Investigational trials show potential for antidepressant applications of N2O, especially for treatment-resistant forms of depression, and it is rapid-acting. In a phase 2 clinical trial, a treatment with 25% nitrous oxide had comparable efficacy to 50% nitrous oxide but was associated with significantly fewer adverse effects.

<text>Siggeir is the king of Gautland (i.e. Götaland/Geatland, but in some translations also rendered as &quot;Gothland&quot;), in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; he is given as a Sikling and a relative of Sigar who killed the hero Hagbard. &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot; specifies that the last Sigar was Siggeir&#x27;s nephew.

According to the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Siggeir married Signy, the sister of Sigmund and the daughter of King Völsung. Although Völsung agreed to the marriage, Signy herself was unwilling. At the banquet Odin appears in disguise wearing a cape and a hood and sticks a sword in the tree Branstock. Then he said that whoever managed to pull the sword out could keep it. Siggeir and everyone else tried but only Sigmund succeeded. Siggeir generously offered three times the sword&#x27;s value, but Sigmund mockingly refused. Siggeir was offended and went home the next day thinking of revenge.

Siggeir invites Sigmund, his father Völsung and Sigmund&#x27;s nine brothers to a visit in Gautland to see the newlyweds three months later. When the Völsung clan had arrived they were attacked by the Gauts (Geats) and king Völsung was killed and his sons captured.

Signy beseeched her husband to spare her brothers and to put them in stocks instead of killing them. As Siggeir thought that the brothers deserved to be tortured before they were killed, he agreed.

Each night a wolf, who may have been Siggeir&#x27;s mother, devoured one of the brothers, until only Sigmund remained. Signy had a servant smear honey on the face of Sigmund and when the she-wolf arrived she started licking the honey off Sigmund&#x27;s face. As she licked, she stuck her tongue into Sigmund&#x27;s mouth, whereupon Sigmund bit her tongue off, killing her. Sigmund then hid in the forests of Gautland and Signy brought him everything he needed.

Signy gave Siggeir two sons and when the oldest one was ten years old, she sent him to Sigmund to train him to avenge the Völsungs. The boy did not stand a test of courage so Signy asked Sigmund to kill her worthless son. The same thing happened to Siggeir&#x27;s second son.

Signy came to Sigmund in the guise of a witch and she and her brother committed incest and had the son Sinfjotli. 
After some adventures Sigmund and Sinfjotli killed Siggeir.

<doc id="960791" wikidata="Q45138" url="?curid=960791" title="Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (album)">
<text>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is the debut studio album by the American rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on November 9, 1976, by Shelter Records. The album was recorded and mixed at the Shelter Studio in Hollywood, California.

== Release and promotion ==
The album received little attention on its release in the United States. It climbed to No. 24 on the UK albums chart following a British tour, and the single &quot;Anything That&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; became a hit in the UK. After nearly a year and many positive reviews, the album reached the U.S. charts, where it peaked at No. 55 in 1978 and eventually went Gold.

&quot;Breakdown&quot; was released as the lead single and cracked the Top 40 in the U.S. and &quot;American Girl&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s signature songs.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;Addicts of updated nostalgia and rock and roll readymades should find this a sly and authentic commentary on the evolving dilemma of Harold Teen. The songs are cute, the riffs executed with more dynamism than usual, and the singing attractively phlegmy. And like they say at the end of other cartoons, that&#x27;s all, folks.&quot; The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Dimitri Pavlovitch Riabouchinsky (,6 November 1882– 22 August 1962) was a Russian fluid dynamicist noted for his discovery of the Riabouchinsky solid technique. With the aid of Nikolay Zhukovsky he founded the Institute of Aerodynamics in 1904, the first in Europe. He also independently discovered equivalent results to the Buckingham Pi Theorem in 1911. Riabouchinsky left Russia following the October Revolution and his short-term arrest, spending the rest of his life in Paris, yet he never accepted the French citizenship and used his Nansen passport up till death. He was a member of the Moscow State University, the University of Paris, the French Academy of Sciences as well as one of the co-founders of the Russian Higher Technical School in France. Over 200 scientific works were published during his lifetime. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 at Strasbourg, in 1928 at Bologna, and in 1932 at Zurich.

<doc id="960804" wikidata="Q672556" url="?curid=960804" title="Boxer Protocol">
<text>The Boxer Protocol was a diplomatic protocol signed in China&#x27;s capital Beijing on September 7, 1901, between the Qing Empire of China and the Eight-Nation Alliance that had provided military forces (including France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Japan, Russia, and the United States) as well as Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands, after China&#x27;s defeat in the intervention to put down the Boxer Rebellion. The protocol is regarded as one of China&#x27;s unequal treaties.
== Name ==
The 1901 protocol is commonly known as the Boxer Protocol or Peace Agreement between the Great Powers and China in English. It is known as the Xinchou Treaty or Beijing protocol in Chinese, where &quot;Xinchou&quot; refers to the year (1901) of signature under the sexagenary cycle system. The full English name of the protocol is Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, United States and China – Final Protocol for the Settlement of the Disturbances of 1900, reflecting its nature as a diplomatic protocol rather than a peace treaty at the time of signature.

== Negotiations during the Boxer Rebellion ==
The Qing dynasty was by no means completely defeated when the Allies took control of the capital Beijing. The Allies had to temper the demands they sent in a message to Xi&#x27;an to get the Empress Dowager Cixi to agree with them; for instance, China did not have to give up any land. Many of the Dowager Empress&#x27; advisers in the Imperial Court insisted that the war continue against the foreigners, arguing that China could defeat them since it was the disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and the interior of China was impenetrable. The Dowager was practical and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce and stop the war when she was assured of her continued reign.

== Signatories ==
The Boxer Protocol was signed on September 7, 1901, in the Spanish Legation in Beijing. Signatories included:

=== Foreign powers ===
* Kingdom of Spain, represented by the Minister plenipotentiary Bernardo J. de Cólogan y Cólogan, the Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps and the eldest diplomat of the Foreign Compound in Beijing.

== The clauses ==

450 million taels of fine silver (around 18,000 tonnes, worth approx. US$333 million or £67 million at the exchange rates of the time) were to be paid as indemnity over 39 years to the eight nations involved.

The Chinese paid the indemnity in gold on a rising scale with a 4% interest charge until the debt was amortized on December 31, 1940. After 39 years, the amount was almost 1 billion taels (precisely 982,238,150), or ≈ at 1.2 ozt/tael.

The sum was to be distributed as follows: Russia 28.97%, Germany 20.02%, France 15.75%, Britain 11.25%, Japan 7.73%, United States 7.32%, Italy 7.32%, Belgium 1.89%, Austria-Hungary 0.89%, Netherlands 0.17%, Spain 0.03%, Portugal 0.02%, Sweden and Norway 0.01%.

=== Other clauses included ===
* To prohibit the importation of arms and ammunition, as well as materials for the production of arms or ammunition, for two years, extensible further two years as the Powers saw necessary.
* The destruction of Taku Forts.
* Legation Quarters occupied by the Powers shall be considered a special area reserved for their use under the exclusive control, in which Chinese shall not have the right to reside and may be defensible. China recognized the right of each Power to maintain a permanent guard in the said Quarters for the defense of its Legation.
* Boxers and government officials were to be punished for crimes or attempted crimes against foreign governments or their nationals. Many were sentenced to execution, deported to Xinjiang, imprisoned for life, forced to commit suicide, or suffered posthumous degradation.
* The &quot;Office in Charge of Affairs of All Nations&quot; (&quot;Zongli Yamen&quot;) was replaced with a Foreign Office, which ranked above the other six boards in the government.
* The Chinese government was to prohibit forever, under pain of death, membership in any anti-foreign society, civil service examinations were to be suspended for five years in all areas where foreigners were massacred or subjected to cruel treatment, and provincial and local officials would personally be held responsible for any new anti-foreign incidents.
* The emperor of China was to convey his regrets to the German emperor for the assassination of Baron von Ketteler.
* The emperor of China was to appoint Na&#x27;t&#x27;ung to be his envoy extraordinary and direct him to also convey to the emperor of Japan his expression of regrets and that of his government at the assassination of Mr. Sugiyama.
* The Chinese government would have to erect on the spot of the assassination of Baron von Ketteler a commemorative arch inscribed in Latin, German, and Chinese.
* Concede the right to the Powers to station troops in the following places:

== Hoax demands ==
The French Catholic vicar apostolic, Msgr. Alfons Bermyn, wanted foreign troops garrisoned in Inner Mongolia, but the governor refused. Bermyn resorted to lies and falsely petitioned the Manchu Enming to send troops to Hetao, where Prince Duan&#x27;s Mongol troops and General Dong Fuxiang&#x27;s Muslim troops allegedly threatened Catholics. It turned out that Bermyn had created the incident as a hoax. One of the false reports claimed that Dong Fuxiang wiped out Belgian missionaries in Mongolia and was going to massacre Catholics in Taiyuan.

== Demands rejected by China ==
The Qing did not capitulate to all foreign demands. The Manchu Governor Yuxian was executed, but the Imperial court refused to execute the Chinese General Dong Fuxiang, although both were anti-foreign and had been accused of encouraging the killing of foreigners during the rebellion. Instead, General Dong Fuxiang lived a life of luxury and power in &quot;exile&quot; in his home province of Gansu.

In addition to sparing Dong Fuxiang, the Qing refused to exile the Boxer supporter Prince Zaiyi to Xinjiang, as the foreigners demanded. Instead, he moved to Alashan, west of Ningxia, and lived in the residence of the local Mongol prince. He then moved to Ningxia during the Xinhai Revolution when the Muslims took control of Ningxia, and finally moved to Xinjiang with Sheng Yun.
Prince Duan &quot;went no farther than Manchuria for exile, and was heard of there in 1908&quot;.

== Spending and remittance ==
On December 28, 1908, the United States remitted $11,961,121.76 of its share of the Indemnity to support the education of Chinese students in the United States and the construction of Tsinghua University in Beijing, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese ambassador Liang Cheng.

When China declared war on Germany and Austria in 1917, it suspended the combined German and Austrian share of the Boxer Indemnity, which totaled 20.91 percent. At the Paris Peace Conference, Beijing succeeded in completely revoking the German and Austrian shares of the Boxer Indemnity.

The history surrounding Russia&#x27;s share of the Boxer Indemnity is the most complex of all the nations involved. On December 2, 1918, the Bolsheviks issued an official decree abolishing Russia&#x27;s share of the Indemnity (146). Upon the arrival of Lev Karakhan in Beijing during the fall of 1923, however, it became clear that the Soviet Union expected to retain control over how the Russian share was to be spent. Though Karakhan was initially hesitant to follow the United States&#x27; example of directing the funds toward education, he soon insisted in private that the Russian share had to be used for that purpose and, during February 1924, presented a proposal stating that the &quot;Soviet portion of the Boxer Indemnity would be allocated to Chinese educational institutions.&quot; On March 14, 1924, Karakhan completed a draft Sino-Soviet agreement stating, &quot;The government of the USSR agrees to renounce the Russian portion of the Boxer Indemnity.&quot; Copies of these terms were published in the Chinese press, and the positive public reaction encouraged other countries to match the USSR&#x27;s terms. On May 21, 1924, the U.S. Congress agreed to remit the final $6,137,552.90 of the American share to China. Ten days later, however, it became apparent that the USSR did not intend to carry through on its earlier promise of full renunciation. When the final Sino-Soviet agreement was announced, it specified that Russia&#x27;s share would be used to promote education in China and that the Soviet government would retain control over how the money was to be used, an exact parallel to the U.S. remittance of 1908.

On March 3, 1925, Great Britain completed arrangements to use its share of the Boxer Indemnity to support railway construction in China. On April 12, France asked that its indemnity be used to reopen a defunct Sino-French Bank. Italy signed an agreement on October 1 to spend its share on the construction of steel bridges. The Netherlands&#x27; share paid for harbor and land reclamation. The Netherlands also used its indemnity for the establishment of the Sinological Institute at Leiden University. The Belgian funds were earmarked to be spent on railway material in Belgium. Finally, Japan&#x27;s indemnity was transferred to develop aviation in China under Japanese oversight. Once these countries&#x27; approximately 40 percent of the Boxer Indemnity was added to Germany&#x27;s and Austria&#x27;s combined 20.9 percent, the United States&#x27; 7.3 percent, and the Soviet Union&#x27;s 29.0 percent share, the Beijing government had accounted for over 98 percent of the entire Boxer Indemnity. Hence, by 1927, Beijing had almost entirely revoked Boxer Indemnity payments abroad and successfully redirected the payments for use within China.

<text>Peter Nicholas Boulware (born December 18, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for nine seasons with the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles, earning recognition as a consensus All-American. A first-round pick of Baltimore in the 1997 NFL draft, he played his entire pro career for the Ravens.

Boulware was a Republican candidate for the Florida House of Representatives in the 2008 general election.

==Early life==
Boulware was born in Columbia, South Carolina. He played at Heathwood Hall Episcopal School, and then graduated first from Spring Valley High School, and went on to play for Florida State University. He was an all-state pick for Spring Valley High School in 1992. He recorded 132 tackles, 14 sacks, and two blocked punts and was named one of the top 50 athletes in the nation by &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. He was also named one of the nation&#x27;s top 100 athletes by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;.

==College career==
Boulware accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden&#x27;s Seminoles teams from 1993 to 1996. He redshirted his freshman season in 1993; as a redshirt freshman in 1994, he recorded 37 tackles, five sacks, and five tackles for loss. One of his sacks was recorded against Florida Gators quarterback Danny Wuerffel in the 1995 Sugar Bowl.

As a sophomore, Boulware totaled 46 tackles, an ACC-leading ten sacks, and 18 tackles for losses, which ranked second in the ACC, and was named honorable mention All-ACC. As a junior, Boulware totaled 68 tackles, a school record 19 sacks, 20 tackles for losses, seven forced fumbles, and three fumble recoveries. He was a consensus first-team All-American, All-ACC, ACC Defensive Player of the Year, as well as National Defensive Player of the Year by Football News. His 19 sacks were the most in the nation. Boulware decided to enter the 1997 NFL draft. Boulware graduated on April 26, 1997, with a degree in management information systems.

Boulware was one of six defensive ends selected to Sports Illustrated&#x27;s all-20th century college football team.

<doc id="960812" wikidata="Q924978" url="?curid=960812" title="Dublin Port Tunnel">
<text>The Dublin Tunnel (Irish: &quot;Tollán Bhaile Átha Cliath&quot;), originally and still commonly known as the Port Tunnel, is a road traffic tunnel in Dublin, Ireland, that forms part of the M50 motorway.

The twin tunnels form a two-lane dual carriageway connecting Dublin Port, which lies to the east of central Dublin, and the M50 motorway at junction 2, close to Dublin Airport. The tunnels are in length and total project length of . It had a final cost of approximately €752 million.

The tunnel was officially opened on 20 December 2006; it was initially only open to HGVs. It was opened to all traffic on 28 January 2007.

==Purpose==
Traffic congestion in central Dublin became severe at the end of the 20th century, with thousands of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) travelling to and from Dublin port via the city centre. The tunnel relieves surface road congestion in Dublin city centre by diverting HGVs from Dublin Port directly onto the motorway network. This has positive knock-on effects for bus users, pedestrians and cyclists travelling along the city quays, including better air quality and safer travel.

To discourage commuters from using the tunnel, vehicles other than HGVs are heavily tolled at peak times. HGVs travelling north and west benefit from the expected six-minute journey time through the tunnel. A tunnel was chosen as it was decided that a surface relief road was not feasible.

Dublin Bus routes 142, 33x and 41x use the tunnel to get to the port area of the city from the northern suburbs.

Longer distance buses from Belfast, Derry and Letterkenny also use the route.

==Port tunnel project==
The tunnel was first suggested in the 1990s after a number of transportation and engineering studies and was included in the Dublin City Development Plan 1999 – 2005. The project was approved following a public inquiry in 1999.

The tunnel formed part of the National Development Plan and funds were provided under the plan to the National Roads Authority by the Department of Transport. The contract was managed by Dublin City Council and supervised by Brown &amp; Root, a unit of Halliburton. The main contractor was a Japanese-British-Irish consortium Nishimatsu Mowlem Irishenco (NMI), appointed in 2000.

The tender price for the construction of the tunnel was €457 million. The final project cost was brought to €752 million by land acquisition, design, insurance, legal and other services, plus supervision by Brown &amp; Root.

Construction commenced in June 2001 and the tunnel was originally due to open in 2005 after an elapsed time of 43 months. It eventually opened in December 2006, giving an elapsed time of 66 months.

One reason for the project extension was to allay residents&#x27; noise concerns. Under some areas such as Griffith Avenue and the Cloisters, boring was restricted to 16 hours per day. Under Annadale Crescent, it was reduced to 13 hours.

==Tunnel specifications==
*Length: – total project 
*Bores: 2
*Bore width: 11.77 m (38 ft 7.82 inches)
*Lane width (two per bore): 3.65 m (11 ft 11.70 inches)
*Shoulder width (two per bore): 1 m (3 ft 3.37 inches)
*Bore height: 4.9 m (16 ft 0.91 inches)
*Operating height: 4.65 m (15 ft 3.07 inches)
*Lowest point: -30 m (−98 ft 5.10 inches) at Marino

It is the fourth longest urban motorway tunnel in Europe after Madrid M-30, Blanka tunnel complex in Prague and Södra länken in Stockholm, Sweden. When non-urban road tunnels are included, the Dublin Port Tunnel is shorter than some other European tunnels, such as the Lærdal Tunnel () in Norway (24.5 km), the Gotthard Road Tunnel in Switzerland (17 km), the Mont Blanc Tunnel between France and Italy (11.6 km) and the Western Scheldt Tunnel () in The Netherlands (6.6 km).

==Tunnel design==
The tunnel was built in five sections including a pipe-jacked section under the Dublin-Belfast railway line.

===Cut and cover===
The &quot;cut and cover&quot; sections at both ends featured excavations as deep as 12 m into which horseshoe-shaped sections of reinforced concrete were cast in-situ and backfilled. The southern section, at Fairview, is 500 m long while the northern cut and cover channel from Whitehall Church to Shantalla extends over 1500 m. This work was undertaken by the Mowlem and Irishenco units of the consortium.

===Tunnel boring===
Both bored sections were initiated from a shaft 33 m deep and 57 m in diameter created at Collins Avenue by Mowlem in a joint venture with Intrafor of France. From here, the Tunnel boring machines (TBM), managed by Nishimatsu, were sent north through open clay and south through hard limestone. As is traditional, both machines were named after women – Meghan for 650 m of open clay and Grainne for 2,600 m of limestone.

TBM-1 &quot;Grainne&quot; headed south, passing under Griffith Avenue, Marino and Fairview. It was then dismantled, turned around and used to bore a second tunnel for the southbound carriageway. The machine, designed by Herrenknecht of Germany, was 156 m long, 12 m in diameter and was delivered to Dublin port in 105 parts carried by three ships, taking one week to unload. Combined, these bores resulted in the removal of 500,000 m3 of rock.

A similar process was followed northwards by the 60 m long TBM-2 &quot;Meghan&quot; boring from Collins Avenue to Whitehall Church, first creating the southbound carriageway.

The bores were completed with a breakthrough into the reception shaft on 18 November 2003 and 18 August 2004 for clay and rock, respectively. Much of the bored sections are 21–23 m below the surface, with the lowest point at Marino, towards the southern end, a point that also hosts the tunnel&#x27;s drainage sump.

===Pipe jacking===
A particular challenge was faced near the southern portals where the tunnel passes under the Dublin to Belfast railway, a line that also carries suburban and commuter services. The railway was constructed on an elevated embankment made up of soft materials resting on alluvial deposits of sand and silt. Because the railway had to remain operational at all times, the cut-and-cover approach could not be used. Nishimatsu constructed a pipe-jacked supporting structure for the railway 3.5 m below the surface. The tunnel was then constructed in the supported space using horse-shoe sections and backfilled.

This 60 m section took 24 months to complete and resulted in the adjoining Alfie Byrne road being raised by 1.5 m. It also resulted in one incident of subsidence that closed the railway for three hours. This closure cost the contractor €300,000 in penalties – €28 per second.

===Other works===
A new entrance and exit for the Dublin port was constructed including a new bridge over the Tolka River that connects to the toll plaza and southern portals. A new junction and underpass facilitates traffic from the East Wall Road towards the tunnel.

Citybound traffic approaching the tunnel on the M50 (formerly the M1 at this point) can utilise two tunnel-bound lanes or two surface lanes that continue as the N1 toward Whitehall. Traffic emerging at the southern portal approaches the toll plaza outside the port.

==Tunnel operation==
Following a tender process in 2005, the NRA selected Transroute International, part of France&#x27;s Groupe Egis, to operate the tunnel for a period of five years with an optional renewal of two years. The service contract provided for operation, maintenance, safety, traffic management and toll collection. A new subsidiary, Transroute Tunnel Operations Ireland Ltd, was set up for the purpose. Tunnel operations, including tolling, employ between 50 and 60 people. The service contract was worth €15 million to Transroute over the five-year period. The tunnel is currently operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

Elsewhere, Egis was also selected to provide a central system to enable interoperability between different electronic toll collection systems in Ireland.

==Tolling==
The tunnel is tolled, with funds collected remitted to the Department of Transport. To facilitate the ban on 5-axled HGVs in Greater Dublin, there are no tolls for vehicles in excess of 3,500 kg MLW, or for vehicles capable of carrying 25 passengers or more.

The original tolling scheme saw three stages of tolling:

*06:00–10:00 (Southbound) and 16:00–19:00 (Northbound) – €12
*10:00–22:00 (Southbound) and 06:00–16:00 - 19:00-22:00(Northbound) – €6
*22:00–06:00, and all day Saturday and Sunday, in both directions – €3

To alleviate congestion and due to extra capacity, these tolls have now been revised. As of 1 January 2024 the tolls are:

*06:00–10:00 Monday-Friday (Southbound) – €12
*16:00–19:00 Monday-Friday (Northbound) – €12
*All other times – €3.50

The toll plaza is located beside the tunnel control building at the southern portal, near Dublin Port. To date, tolls have been payable either on an ad-hoc basis by cash, credit or debit card or electronically by using a tolling tag from a provider such as eFlow. Cash payments are made either to a cashier or by dropping coins only (5c denomination and above only) into an automatic counter in certain lanes.

==BGA Fleming award==
The project was joint winner in December 2003 of the British Geotechnical Association&#x27;s international Fleming award for excellence in geotechnical design and construction. The award was for the innovative &#x27;observational approach&#x27; used in optimising the design of the tunnel launch shaft in Whitehall, and for the soil-nailed open-cut section of the works accommodating the northern cut and cover tunnel. The award was shared with the recovery operation project for the World Trade Center, following the 2001 attack.

==Safety features==
There are 15 pedestrian crossing points (PCPs) situated 250 m apart with emergency telephone and fire fighting niches. Additional fire hose reels are located 125 m from each niche. There are four vehicle crossover points at 1 km intervals comprising a lay-by plus emergency and recovery area. These are located under Shantalla, Collins Avenue (site of the original launch shaft), Marino and Cloisters.

GSM telephone and FM radio coverage is carried into the tunnel with break-in facilities over public broadcasts in the event of an emergency.

There are 420 cameras attached to the vehicle management system (VMS). A maximum speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) is in place and HGVs are prevented from using the outside lane.

Overheight vehicles are detected up to 3 km from the tunnel portals and automatic signage is then deployed to stop the vehicle. If necessary, barriers can be lowered to protect the portals.

==Controversies==

===Safety lapses===
RTÉ&#x27;s Prime Time ran two reports (28 February and 4 March 2008) alleging that tunnel operator Transroute and the National Roads Authority were keeping the tunnel open in situations contrary to the tunnel safety manual. These included:
*SCADA computer system failures
*Failure of the tunnel&#x27;s jet fans used for fire fighting (up to fifteen in one incident)
*Blockage of vehicle crossover points with water containers
The programme claimed that the tunnel safety manual had been re-written to allow the tunnel to remain open despite safety failures that would previously have required &quot;immediate closure&quot;.

===House damage===
During the hard-rock boring works vibration caused some damage. Houses in the Marino area were surveyed before and after tunnelling and necessary repairs were reimbursed. There were 241 claims and these were adjudicated by a loss adjuster. A fund of €1.5 million was set aside.

===City centre ban===
Dublin City Council&#x27;s policy was to introduce a ban on trucks in the city centre between 7am and 7pm, but it agreed to delay this ban for a period of two months until 19 February 2007. This was because of opposition from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC), the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Dublin Port Company. The hauliers cited unreasonable traffic congestion on the M50, especially during the imminent widening of the northern section while IBEC and the Port Company were concerned about restrictions on the free movement of goods.

The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; ran a story on 12 November 2006 revealing the ban came into force soon after the Tunnel opened. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern reportedly put pressure on the council to abandon their phased approach and initiate the ban in one go. The plan was criticised by opposition parties who said such a move would simply dump the problem onto an already &quot;dangerously crowded M50&quot;.

The M50 ring road around Dublin has since been widened to 4 lanes (3 running lanes and 1 interconnecting lane between exits) in each direction and all of the interchanges are free-flow or partially free-flow since the end of 2010. This in effect negates the concerns regarding capacity.

===East Link tolls===
One company located south of the Liffey, Marine Terminals Ltd, considered taking legal action against the Council if it went ahead with banning trucks from the city. This was because a ban would force the company to use the tunnel, which would mean crossing the privately owned and operated East-link toll bridge, incurring a €4.80 charge each way. In response, the council agreed with National Toll Roads (NTR), the operator of the bridge at the time, to lift the toll for trucks.

===Height controversy===
Even before the commencement of construction, the tunnel was criticised for not being high enough. Critics argued that it would not be able to accommodate heavy goods vehicles higher than 4.65 m (15 ft) and that it should be built with an operating height of 5.5 m to accommodate virtually all sizes of trucks. Proponents of the chosen design argued that it made the best economic sense and that it would be able to accommodate most heavy vehicles with only a minor percentage having to use the surface road network. Construction went ahead as planned, but speaking at the breakthrough ceremony, Jimmy Quinn of the Irish Road Haulage Association stated that a future generation may look back and say (about the tunnel not being high enough for very high trucks): &quot;Maybe they should have done it when they were building it.&quot;

In its submission to the public inquiry, the Irish Road Haulage Association did not raise the issue of the operating height of the Port Tunnel.

Among the 44 countries of the International Transport Forum (covering Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals), the 4.65m operating height of the Dublin Port Tunnel is the highest specified height. Thirty-six countries have an operating height of 4m. Three countries (Finland, Iceland, and North Macedonia) have an operating height not greater than 4.4m. Four countries (France, Norway, Sweden, UK) have not defined a height.

===Water leaks===
In early 2006, media reports revealed that the tunnel was leaking substantial amounts of water. This was as a result of sub-standard concrete being poured. When the concrete was removed during remedial works, protective membranes were punctured, resulting in leaks. Once the membranes and concrete were re-instated, the leaks ceased.

===Cost overruns===
While it is often claimed that the project went over budget, this is not actually the case. The tender price of €457 million was for construction only while the total project cost was approximately €752 million.

In September 2005, it was reported that NMI was launching a claim for an additional €300 million. The council has stated that this claim will not be met and that the total project cost remains at €752 million.

===Relocation of Dublin Port===
In October 2006, as the tunnel neared completion, the Progressive Democrats held a conference on their proposal to relocate Dublin Port to Bremore on the outskirts of Balbriggan, and to redevelop the port area for mixed high-density uses. The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, indicated his support for this proposal. However, this plan was abandoned following the wipeout of the PD&#x27;s in the 2007 general election and the ongoing economic downturn.

===FM radio coverage in Dublin Port Tunnel===
The FM radio services rebroadcast in the Port Tunnel are RTÉ Radio 1, Newstalk, 98FM, FM104, Q102, Spin 1038 and Sunshine 106.8. Radio Nova, announced in 2015 that they were initiating legal action to have their service added.

==Tunnel runs==
The Dublin Port Tunnel has been closed to traffic and used for 10k races on three occasions since it opened. The most recent event was held on 26 March 2017, when over 2,400 runners participated in the &quot;Underground Run&quot;, with proceeds going to the homeless charity Focus Ireland.

<doc id="960814" wikidata="Q511123" url="?curid=960814" title="King of the Geats">
<text>Geatish kings (; ), ruling over the provinces of Götaland (Gautland/Geatland), appear in several sources for early Swedish history. Today, most of them are not considered historical.

This list follows the generally accepted identification between the names &quot;Götar&quot; (modern Swedish), &quot;Gautar&quot; (Old Norse) and &quot;Geatas&quot; (Old English), which is based both on tradition, literary sources and on etymology. However, unlike some translations it does not identify this tribe with the Goths. Both Old Norse and Old English records clearly separate the Geats from the Goths, while still depicting them as closely related to each other.

From the Middle Ages until 1974, Swedish monarchs claimed the title King of the Geats as &quot;King of Sweden and Geats/Goths&quot; or &quot;Rex Sweorum et Gothorum&quot;. Danish monarchs used the similar title &quot;King of the Goths&quot; from 1362 until 1972.

== Legendary kings ==
Some names appear in Norse mythology and in Germanic legend and in at least one case, they were probably historical (Hygelac). Their order of succession is uncertain (if they ever lived).

*Dag, contemporary with Yngvi-Frey in Gamla Uppsala, in &quot;Sturlaugs saga&quot; 19 &amp; 23.
*Gizur 4th century, who helps the Goths during the battles with the Huns in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; (see Hlöd).
*Gauti (in &quot;Herraud&#x27;s saga&quot;), probably the same as Gaut the father of Gautrek according to the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;. See Sons of Odin.
*Ring son of Gauti (king of East Götaland in &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauds&quot;)
*Herrauðr, son of Ring (king of East Götaland in &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauds&quot;)
*Gautrekr, appearing in several sources.
*Ketill Gautreksson, in &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;.
*Hrólfr Gautreksson, in &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;.
*Gestiblindus, according to &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.
*Yngwin (&quot;Yngve&quot;) 5th century (in Gesta Danorum, see Halfdan)
*Siward, contemporary with Yngwin&#x27;s grandson (in Gesta Danorum)
*Algaut 4th century or the 7th century (in the Norse sagas)
*Thorir (the brother of Bödvar Bjarki and Elgfróði in Hrólfs saga kraka)

=== Siklings ===
*Sigar?, the father of Siggeir, who genealogically corresponds to Yngwin, the king of Götaland in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.
*Siggeir 5th century, a son of Sigar and the king of Götaland in the Volsunga saga

=== Hrethelings ===

*Swerting (in Beowulf).
*Hreðel (a relative of Swerting, in Beowulf) (nephew, grandson or stepson)
*Hæþcyn d. 514 or 515 (the son of Hrethel, in Beowulf)
*Hygelac d. 516 (the son of Hrethel, in Beowulf)
*Heardred d. ca 530 (the son of Hygelac, in Beowulf)
*Beowulf d. ca 580? (the nephew of Hygelac, in Beowulf)
*Wiglaf (the kinsman of Beowulf, in Beowulf)

=== Ylfings (Wulfings) ===

Kings of East Götaland

*Helm Early 6th century, the Wulfing king mentioned in &quot;Widsith&quot;. Possible Reign Date Range 475–530. 
*Högne 7th century, the king of East Götaland (in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;) and the father-in-law of Granmar. Most likely descendant of Helm.
*Hjörvard 7th century, king of East Götaland (in &quot;Sögubrot&quot;) Married Hildagun daughter of Granmer. Most likely descendant of Helm.
*Helgi Ylfing 7th century, probably a king of East Götaland in the Norse sagas and son-in-law of Högne. If we separate the merged Helgi into two time frames periods. He is recorded as the killer of Hogne and his sons and also Granmers son&#x27;s.
*Hjörmund 7th century, king of East Götaland (in &quot;Sögubrot&quot;) and a son of Hjörvard. He was most likely grandson of Högne. Given the throne by Ivar Harold Wartooths grandfather.

=== Battle of Bråvalla ===
Chronologically assigned to the 8th century, but poorly attested historically, the Battle of Bråvalla (in a location legendarily between West and East Götaland) was fought between the &quot;King of Sweden&quot; (Sigurd Hring) who is said to have ruled West Götaland, and the &quot;King of Denmark&quot; (Harald Wartooth) whose realm is said to have included East Götaland.

== Historical kings ==
When sources become more reliable, Götaland is an integrated part of the Swedish kingdom and from Stenkil and onwards most of the medieval Swedish kings actually belonged to Geatish clans (House of Stenkil, House of Sverker and the House of Bjälbo, possibly also the House of Erik). In the early High Middle Ages some kings in Sweden were titled &quot;rex Visigothorum&quot; and &quot;rex Gothorum&quot;, failing to hold the Swedish core provinces in Svealand. The non-Geatish King Ragnvald Knaphövde was killed by the Geats as he despised them and travelled among them without Geatish hostages.

*Ingold I, king of West Götaland (1081)
*Halsten, king of West Götaland (1081)
*Magnus the Strong, king of West Götaland (reigned 1125–1130)
*Kol, king of East Götaland (see Inge the Younger) (early 12th century)
*Karl Sverkersson, &quot;rex Gothorum&quot; before becoming king of all of Sweden.
*From the reign of King Magnus Ladulås until the accession of Charles XVI Gustav, Sweden&#x27;s monarchs were officially titled &quot;King of the Goths&quot;. Similarly, from Valdemar IV&#x27;s conquest of Gotland until the accession of Margrethe II, Denmark&#x27;s monarchs held the same title.

==False kings==
* The 16th-century forgery Ballad of Eric tells of the first king of Götaland Eric (&quot;Eiriker&quot;), who for a long time was considered historical.

<doc id="960817" wikidata="Q928855" url="?curid=960817" title="Joe Wilson (American politician)">
<text>Addison Graves &quot;Joe&quot; Wilson Sr. (born July 31, 1947) is an American politician and attorney serving as the U.S. representative for since 2001. A member of the Republican Party, his district stretches from Columbia to the Georgia–South Carolina border. He served as the South Carolina state senator from the 23rd district from 1985 to 2001.

Wilson is a member of the House Republican Policy Committee and an assistant Republican whip.

In September 2009, Wilson interrupted a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama to a joint session of Congress, shouting, &quot;You lie!&quot; The incident resulted in a reprimand by the House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Wray (née Graves) and Hugh deVeaux Wilson. In 1969 he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Washington and Lee University, where he joined Sigma Nu. He obtained his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1972.

== Early career ==
From 1972 to 1975, Wilson served in the United States Army Reserve. Thereafter, he was a Staff Judge Advocate in the South Carolina Army National Guard assigned to the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade until retiring from military service as a colonel in 2003.

A real estate attorney, Wilson co-accounted the law firm Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas in West Columbia, where he practiced for over 25 years. He was also a municipal judge in Springdale, South Carolina.

Wilson was active in South Carolina Republican politics when the party barely existed in the state. He took part in his first Republican campaign in 1962, when he was 15 years old. He served as an aide to Senator Strom Thurmond and to his district&#x27;s congressman, Floyd Spence.

In 1981 and 1982, during the first term of the Reagan administration, Wilson served as deputy general counsel for former governor Jim Edwards at the U.S. Department of Energy. Wilson is also a graduate of Morton Blackwell&#x27;s Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia.

===South Carolina Senate===
Wilson was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 1984 as a Republican from Lexington County and reelected four times, the last three times unopposed. By this time, Lexington County had become one of the most Republican counties in the state. He never missed a regular legislative session in 17 years. After the Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1996, Wilson became the first Republican to chair the Senate Transportation Committee. He was a member of Columbia College&#x27;s board of visitors and Coker College&#x27;s board of trustees.

During his tenure in the South Carolina Senate, Wilson was the primary sponsor of bills including the following: establishing a National Guard license plate, providing paid leave for state employees to perform disaster relief services, and requiring men aged 18–26 to register for the Selective Service System when applying for a driver&#x27;s license. In 2000, Wilson was one of seven senators to vote against removing the Confederate battle flag from being displayed over the state house.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
As of the 118th Congress, Wilson served on three standing committees and various subcommittees overseeing specific areas of legislation. He serves on the Committee on Armed Services, for which he is also a member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. He serves on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, for which he also is a member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Wilson serves on the Subcommittee on Europe and Chairs the Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Wilson serves as the Chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. Wilson is a member of the Republican Study Committee, Chair of the RSC National Security and Foreign Affairs Task Force, and a member of the Tea Party Caucus.

On June 27, 2024, Wilson announced he will run for the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Like his former boss, Spence, Wilson is an ardent social and fiscal conservative.

In 2003, Wilson voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, including its Section 1011 authorizing $250,000 annually of taxpayer money to reimburse hospitals for treatment of illegal immigrants. In 2009, he changed to his current position of opposing public funds for health care of illegal immigrants.

===Legislation===
Wilson has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills concerning teacher recruitment and retention, college campus fire safety, National Guard troop levels, arming airline pilots, tax credits for adoptions, tax credits for living organ donors, and state defense forces. As of January 2006, eight bills he co-sponsored have passed the House, including H.R. 1973, the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, making safe water and sanitation an objective of U.S. assistance to developing countries.

Wilson is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Wilson initiated the Drafting Business Expensing Act of 2003, which allows businesses to immediately write off 50% of the cost of business equipment and machinery. This bonus depreciation provision was extended for 2008 and 2009 in two separate stimulus bills. He also spearheaded the Drafting Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 2003, which offers higher education loan forgiveness to math, science and special education teachers in schools with predominantly low-income student populations. He cites as his most important vote the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.

In 2015, Wilson cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.

Wilson sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.

In 2023, Wilson introduced H.R. 3202, the Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act of 2023. The act would extend the Caesar sanctions until 2032 and prevent the United States from recognizing or dealing with Ba&#x27;athist Syria. The act was passed by the House in 2024. Following the fall of the Assad regime, Wilson called for the lifting of sanctions related to the economy, investment, and reconstruction.

===&quot;You lie!&quot; outburst during Obama address===

On September 9, 2009, during a nationally televised joint address to Congress by President Barack Obama, Wilson shouted &quot;You lie!&quot; after Obama, while outlining his proposal for reforming health care, said, &quot;There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false—the reforms I&#x27;m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.&quot;

Obama&#x27;s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel immediately approached senior Republican lawmakers and asked them to identify the heckler and urge him to apologize immediately. Members of Congress from both parties condemned the outburst. &quot;Totally disrespectful&quot;, said Senator John McCain of Wilson&#x27;s utterance. &quot;No place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately.&quot; Wilson said later in a statement:

This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President&#x27;s remarks regarding the coverage of undocumented immigrants in the health care bill. While I disagree with the President&#x27;s statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility.

Obama accepted his apology. &quot;I&#x27;m a big believer that we all make mistakes&quot;, he said. &quot;He apologized quickly and without equivocation and I&#x27;m appreciative of that.&quot;
House Democrats called on Wilson to issue a formal apology on the House floor. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said, &quot;This is about the rules of the House&quot;. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, &quot;What&#x27;s at issue here is of importance to the House and of importance to the country ... This House cannot stay silent&quot;.

Wilson refused to apologize to the House of Representatives, saying in a televised interview, &quot;I believe one apology is sufficient.&quot; Congressional Republicans agreed, and opposed further action. Minority Leader John Boehner said, &quot;I think this is a sad day for the House of Representatives ... I think this is a political stunt aimed at distracting the American people from what they really care about, which is health care.&quot; On September 15, the House approved a &quot;resolution of disapproval&quot; against Wilson by a 240–179 vote almost exactly along party lines.

Wilson said that his outburst reflected his view that Obama&#x27;s bill would provide government-subsidized benefits to illegal immigrants. Several fact-checking organizations wrote that Wilson&#x27;s view was inaccurate because HR 3200 expressly excludes undocumented aliens from receiving government-subsidized &quot;affordability credits&quot;. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service agreed that people would need to be lawfully present in the U.S. in order to be eligible for the credits, but noted that the bill did not bar non-citizens from buying their own health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchange. The Obama administration said that, in the final bill, undocumented immigrants would not be able to participate in the Exchange. Such language was included in the Senate Finance Committee&#x27;s version of the bill, America&#x27;s Healthy Future Act.

After the incident, Wilson and Democrat Rob Miller, his 2010 general election opponent, experienced a significant upswing in campaign donations. In the week after Wilson&#x27;s outburst, Miller raised $1.6 million, about three times his 2008 donations, while Wilson raised $1.8 million.

===Apology for remarks about hatred of America===
On a 2002 live broadcast of the C-SPAN talk show &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, Wilson and Representative Bob Filner were discussing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. When Filner noted that the U.S. provided Iraq with &quot;chemical and biological weapons&quot; in the 1980s, Wilson stated that this idea was &quot;made up&quot; and told Filner, &quot;This hatred of America by some people is just outrageous. And you need to get over that.&quot; Wilson apologized for his remarks in statements to the press.

===Apology for remarks about Strom Thurmond&#x27;s daughter===
In 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams revealed she was the daughter of Wilson&#x27;s former employer, Senator Strom Thurmond, and Thurmond&#x27;s black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child out of wedlock. Wilson said even if her story were true, she should not have revealed it because &quot;it&#x27;s a smear&quot; on Thurmond&#x27;s image and was a way to &quot;diminish&quot; Thurmond&#x27;s legacy. After Thurmond&#x27;s family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams&#x27;s revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that she should not have revealed that Thurmond was her father.

===&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;===
In December 2020, Wilson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

=== Veterans ===
The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a &quot;nay&quot; from Wilson. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV Wilson also voted against 2022 MORE Act.

=== Opposition to Georgian Dream ===

In May 2024, in response to the Georgian protests of 2023-2024, Wilson introduced the MEGOBARI Act in the United States House of Representatives. The act targets Georgian Dream party officials and others deemed responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia. It also tasks U.S. government agencies with reporting to Congress on improper influence, sanctions evasion, and the activities of Russian intelligence assets in Georgia.

On 26 December 2024 Wilson wrote on X that “President Donald Trump has made it very clear where he stands on the self-professed enemies of America. If Bidzina Ivanishvili goes through with his plan to destroy Georgian democracy on December 29, he should expect a response like he’s never imagined.” He also posted, “Corrupt Bidzina Ivanishvili, a lover of China &amp; Iran and hater of America, is trying to transform Georgia from a democracy into a dictatorship. We must put America First and cut all [funding] to Georgia if that happens.” and questioned Ivanishvili’s actions, writing, “Why did Georgia’s dictator-in-waiting Bidzina Ivanishvili give a contract to build the Anaklia Deep Sea Port to a sanctioned Chinese company? Are you ready for sanctions, Bidzina?”

On 27 December, Wilson, extended an invitation to President Salome Zourabichvili, recognizing her as the sole legitimate leader of Georgia, to attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. He wrote on X: &quot;As the only legitimate leader in Georgia, I am grateful to extend an invite to President Salome Zourabichvili to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. I am in awe of her courage in the face of the assault by Ivanishvili and his friends in the CCP &amp; Iranian regime.&quot;

On December 29, Wilson announced on X that he would introduce a bill in the U.S. Congress recognizing Salome Zourabichvili as the sole legitimate president of Georgia until fair re-elections are conducted in the country. He stated that the proposed legislation, titled the &quot;Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act&quot;, would prohibit U.S. recognition of the &quot;illegal dictatorial regime&quot; in Georgia and reaffirm Zourabichvili&#x27;s legitimacy as the country&#x27;s leader pending free and fair elections.

===Other notable events===
In November 2009, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Wilson and Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer made identical written statements, reading, &quot;One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India.&quot; The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech, now a Swiss biotechnology firm, but founded and still headquartered in San Francisco, California.

Wilson supported President Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the order would &quot;secure our borders and keep American families safe from terrorist attacks.&quot;

On April 10, 2017, a Wilson town hall meeting at Aiken Technical College in Graniteville, South Carolina was interrupted by activists chanting &quot;you lie&quot; as Wilson asserted that the Affordable Care Act was causing people to be denied health services.

In 2018, a segment with Wilson aired as part of Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s Showtime series, &quot;Who is America?&quot;. Wilson endorses &quot;Kinderguardians&quot;, a nonexistent program to teach and arm schoolchildren as young as 3 to protect themselves in the classroom. Advocating toddler carry, he says on camera, &quot;A 3-year-old cannot defend itself from an assault rifle by throwing a Hello Kitty pencil case at it&quot;.

In January 2023, Wilson proposed a bill to direct &quot;the Fine Arts Board to obtain a bust of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for display in the House of Representatives wing of the United States Capitol&quot;.

On October 30, 2024, Columbia Airport Expressway was renamed to the Congressman Joe Wilson Expressway. The sign unveiling was attended by South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) staff and other current and former elected officials present including Attorney General of South Carolina Alan Wilson, South Carolina Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell, U.S. Congressman Ralph Norman, and Anton Gunn. 

==Personal life==
Wilson is the stepfather of Alan Wilson, who has served as Attorney General of South Carolina since 2011.

Wilson was named after Confederate brigadier general David A. Weisiger, the uncle of his great-great-grandmother. Wilson stated that Weisiger &quot;was not a plantation owner; he was a bank cashier&quot;, but Weisiger owned seven slaves in Virginia. His great-great-grandfather Stephen H. Boineau owned 16 slaves.

In a 2005 guest article on Rediff.com, Wilson wrote that his father, Hugh, was a member of the Flying Tigers in World War II. The Wilson family attends First Presbyterian Church in Columbia.

On September 10, 2024, Wilson was hospitalized in Washington after collapsing at an event. Alan Wilson said his father was being treated for &quot;stroke-like symptoms&quot;.

== Electoral history ==
===South Carolina Senate (1984-2000)===
 

 
 








===United States House of Representatives (2001-2024)===

Wilson was elected in 2001 in a special election caused by the death of Floyd Spence, his former boss. Wilson once said that a dying Spence called him from his hospital bed and asked him to run.

In a crowded five-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Wilson tallied 75% of the vote. He won the December 18 special election with 73% of the vote.
 

 
 

 
Wilson won election to a full term in 2002 with 84% of the vote, facing four minor-party candidates.
 

Wilson was mentioned as a possible candidate for retiring Senator Fritz Hollings&#x27;s seat in 2004, but decided to run for a second House term.

<text>Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London saw fifteen shooting events. Most of the events were held at Bisley, Surrey while the trap shooting events were held at Uxendon.

==Medal summary==
==Participating nations==
A total of 215 shooters from 14 nations competed at the London Games:

==Medal table==

== Late arrival of the Russian team==
Some sources claim that the Russian shooting team was 13 days late to the Olympics due to the Russian Empire still using the Julian calendar as opposed to the rest of Europe, which used the Gregorian system. 
The official report does not mention Russia, and it does mention Italy and Australia as &quot;absent&quot;. Other authors doubt of this claim , and underlie that Russia had been living next to Gregorian-calendar Europe for two centuries and was used to the difference

<text>Todd Benjamin Heap (born March 16, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was a tight end for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily for the Baltimore Ravens. He was selected to the Pro Bowl twice with the Ravens, earning second-team All-Pro honors in 2003.

After playing college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils, Heap was selected by Baltimore in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft. He played ten years for the Ravens, becoming the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in touchdown catches and second all-time in receptions and yards. He played two years for the Arizona Cardinals from 2011-2012.

==Early life==
A 1998 graduate of Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, Todd lettered three years in football, three years in basketball and two years in baseball. Todd helped Mountain View win back-to-back football state championships in 1996 and 1997, going undefeated both years. He also helped both the basketball and baseball teams win a State Championship his senior year. During his high school years, Todd won many football related awards, including Arizona All-Star honors, All-Arizona, Super All-State, Arizona 5A Player of the Year, Ed Doherty Player of the Year, All-East Valley Two-Way Player of the Year as a senior and a SuperPrep All-American. Todd broke several school records, including most career receiving yards (1,377), most career receptions (87), most career touchdown receptions, and most touchdown catches in one game (3). In the state championship game against Tucson Amphitheater, he caught one touchdown pass, scored a two-point conversion and threw a 26-yard touchdown pass.

==College career==
Heap played college football at Arizona State University, majoring in pre-business. His 115 receptions broke the school record for tight ends, previously held by Ken Dyer.

* 1999: 55 catches for 832 yards with three touchdowns
* 2000: 45 catches for 617 yards with three touchdowns

==Professional career==
===Baltimore Ravens===
The Baltimore Ravens selected Heap in the first round (31st overall) of the 2001 NFL draft. Through the end of the 2009 NFL season he played 120 total career games, starting 115.

Heap recorded 16 receptions for 206 yards and one touchdown in his rookie season, playing behind eight-time Pro-Bowler Shannon Sharpe. He became the starting tight end for the Ravens in 2002 after Sharpe left in free agency. The Ravens were 7–9 in Heap&#x27;s second season. He caught 68 passes for 836 yards and six touchdowns and was voted to his first Pro Bowl. The following season in 2003, Heap garnered 57 receptions for 693 yards and three touchdowns, despite the Ravens having a run-first offense, behind the record breaking 2,066-yard rushing season of Jamal Lewis. Heap was again voted to the Pro Bowl as the Ravens won the AFC North division for the first time. Heap had six receptions for 80 yards and a touchdown in a 20-17 playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans. 

Heap was injured in the second week of the 2004 season, in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He returned in Week 13, but missed the final game of the season. He finished the season with 303 yards and three touchdowns in six games. He returned healthy and ready to play in the 2005 season. The Ravens team suffered numerous injuries to their starters, and ended the season 6–10. Heap caught 75 passes for 855 yards and seven touchdowns.

In 2006 he would begin catching passes from former rival, former Pro Bowl quarterback Steve McNair. It would also prove to be the Ravens best regular season, as they won the AFC North for the second time in franchise history with a record of 13–3. Heap caught 73 passes for 765 yards and six touchdowns. Heap missed 10 games in the 2007 season due to injury, and caught only 23 passes, amassing 239 yards and one touchdown. In 2008, he collected 35 receptions for 403 yards and three touchdowns. The Ravens advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the first time since the 2000 season, but would lose to the Steelers.

Heap played through numerous injuries in the 2009 season, yet had 53 receptions for 593 yards and six touchdowns, and twice scored two touchdowns in a single game. The Ravens finished 9–7, losing in the second round of the playoffs to the Indianapolis Colts. He built on his success from the previous year in 2010, going on to have one of the best seasons of his career. In 12 games, he notched 37 receptions for 546 yards, and five touchdowns, one being a career long 65-yard touchdown. In a Week 13 match-up with the Steelers, he suffered a pulled hamstring on the first offensive snap for Baltimore, taking him out of the game. As a precaution, he missed the next three weeks, not wanting to re-aggravate or worsen the injury.

On July 25, 2011, the day the NFL announced the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Ravens announced they would be releasing him once free agency began. He was officially released on July 28.

===Arizona Cardinals===
On July 31, 2011, Heap signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals. He appeared in 12 games for the Cardinals, totaling 32 receptions for 377 yards and one touchdown. After being injured in a Week 2 game against the New England Patriots on September 16, 2012, late in the third quarter, he did not return for the remaining 11 weeks afterwards and was eventually released by the Cardinals on December 4, 2012.

===Retirement===
Heap retired from professional football in 2013. On May 13, 2014, the Baltimore Ravens announced Heap would be inducted into the team&#x27;s Ring of Honor.

In 2017, Heap joined the Ravens&#x27; radio broadcast crew, to serve as a color analyst for four regular-season games.

<text>W. Yvon Dumont, (born January 21, 1951) is a Manitoba politician and office-holder. In 1993, he became the first member of Manitoba&#x27;s Métis community to be appointed as the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, the 21st to hold that office. He was born in St. Laurent, Manitoba.

He became involved in the Manitoba Metis Federation in 1967, and became its director for the Interlake region in 1972. He was chosen Executive Vice-President of the Federation in 1973, and served as its President from 1984 to 1993.

Dumont was also a founding member of the Native Council of Canada in 1972, and served as President of the Métis National Council from 1988 to 1993. He has participated as a representative of the MMF at Canadian First Ministers&#x27; conference, and has been actively involved in constitutional debates concerning First Nations and Métis peoples. Dumont has rejected the integration of Métis services into larger Indigenous institutions, expressing concern that Métis distinctiveness could be lost.

Dumont has also been a municipal councillor in St. Laurent, and was on the Board of Governors for the University of Manitoba. He received a Manitoba Metis Federation Award in 1993, and a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in 1996.

Dumont&#x27;s appointment as Lt. Governor of Manitoba coincided with a national reappraisal of Métis leader Louis Riel&#x27;s role in the province&#x27;s creation. Once regarded as a rebel and an outlaw, Riel has in recent years been accepted as a Father of Confederation for his role in establishing a provisional government in the Red River Colony. The appointment of Dumont as Lt. Governor undoubtedly reflected this changed perspective.

The position of Lt. Governor is largely ceremonial, and Dumont had very little influence over the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon.

Dumont was appointed to the Order of Manitoba in 2001. He ran again for the leadership of the MMF in 2003, but was defeated by David Chartrand.

<text>Messier 23, also known as NGC 6494, is an open cluster of stars in the northwest of the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. It can be found in good conditions with binoculars or a modestly sized telescope. It is in front of &quot;an extensive gas and dust network&quot;, which there may be no inter-association. It is within 5° the sun&#x27;s position (namely in mid-December) so can be occulted by the moon.

The cluster is centered about 2,050 light years away. Estimates for the number of its members range from 169 up to 414, with a directly-counted mass of ; by application of the virial theorem. The cluster is around 330 million years old with a near-solar metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.04. The brightest component (lucida) is of magnitude 9.3. Five of the cluster members are candidate red giants, while orange variable VV Sgr in the far south, is a candidate asymptotic giant branch star.

A 6th-magnitude star, shown in the top-right corner, figures in the far north-west as a foreground star – HD 163245 (HR 6679). Its parallax shift is , having taken into account proper motion, which means it is about away.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Baltimore Ravens===

====2000 season====
Regarded as the best available tailback alongside Thomas Jones, Lewis was selected in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens.

Lewis made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He had five carries for 16 yards in the 16–0 victory. He made his first start in Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins. He had 25 carries for 116 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in Week 4 against the Cincinnati Bengals in a 37–0 victory. On November 19, in Week 12, against the Dallas Cowboys, Lewis became the youngest player since 1960 to record 200 yards from scrimmage (21 years, 82 days); since broken by Kenny Britt in 2009, and JuJu Smith-Schuster in 2017. In the following game, against the Cleveland Browns, he had 30 carries for 170 rushing yards in the 44–7 victory. In his rookie season, he rushed for 1,364 yards and six touchdowns, supplanting Priest Holmes as the team&#x27;s starting running back. He was named the PFWA All-Rookie Team.

In the Wild Card Round against the Denver Broncos, Lewis had 30 carries for 110 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 21–3 victory. In the Divisional Round against the Tennessee Titans, he had a rushing touchdown in the 24–10 victory. In the AFC Championship against the Oakland Raiders, he had 100 scrimmage yards in the 16–3 victory. The Ravens&#x27; running game and punishing defense earned them their first Super Bowl when they defeated the New York Giants 34–7 in Super Bowl XXXV.

Lewis also became the youngest player to ever win a Super Bowl; he was 21 years and 155 days old on the day of the game. He broke Tony Hill&#x27;s 23-year-old record; Hill had been 21 years and 206 days old on January 15, 1978, when the Cowboys beat the Broncos 27–10 in Super Bowl XII.
====2001 season====
Lewis missed the 2001 NFL season due to an ACL tear and MCL sprain that he sustained in training camp.

====2002 season====
In Week 5 of the 2002 season, against the Cleveland Browns, he had 26 carries for 187 rushing yards and five receptions for 26 receiving yards in the 26–21 victory. In the following game against the Indianapolis Colts, he had 126 scrimmage yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 22–20 loss. In Week 10, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 21 carries for 135 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 38–27 victory. In the 2002 season, Lewis appeared in 16 games and started 15. He finished with 308 carries for 1,327 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go along with 47 receptions for 442 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.

====2003 season====
On September 14, 2003, Lewis broke Corey Dillon&#x27;s single-game rushing record of 278 yards by running for 295 yards in Week 2 against the Cleveland Browns. Lewis&#x27;s record-breaking game earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2. Lewis&#x27;s record-breaking game started a streak of six consecutive games going over 100 rushing yards. The streak included two games with over 150 scrimmage yards, Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 8 against the Denver Broncos. In Week 14, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 30 carries for 180 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 31–13 victory. In Week 16, against the Cleveland Browns, he had 22 carries for 205 rushing yards in the 35–0 victory. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for Week 16. For the month of December, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Month. Lewis was rewarded for his 2003 season performance by being named NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. Lewis&#x27;s single-game rushing record was later broken by Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings on November 4, 2007, when he ran for 296 yards against the San Diego Chargers. He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned first team All-Pro honors. In the 2003 season, Lewis led the NFL in rushing with 2,066 yards, falling just 40 yards short of officially breaking the all-time single-season rushing record, which remains Eric Dickerson&#x27;s 2,105 record-breaking yards in 1984. Lewis became the fifth running back to join the 2,000 rushing yards club. In addition, he tallied 14 rushing touchdowns. He was named MVP and Offensive Player of the Year by the PFWA.

====2004 season====
In Week 3 of the 2004 season, Lewis had 18 carries for 186 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go with a 46-yard reception in the 23–9 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 17, he had 34 carries for 167 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 30–23 victory over the Miami Dolphins. In the 2004 season, Lewis appeared in and started 12 games. He finished with 235 carries for 1,006 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns to go along with ten receptions for 116 receiving yards.

====2005 season====
In the 2005 season, Lewis appeared and started in 15 games. He finished with 269 carries for 906 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns to go along with 32 carries for 191 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. After the 2005 season, the Ravens declined to place the franchise tag on Lewis, making him an unrestricted free agent after the end of the season. This move was seen by many as a formality in letting Lewis move to another team. Popular speculation blamed Lewis&#x27; steadily declining performance since the 2003 season. Lewis had also voiced displeasure during the 2005 season over the team&#x27;s failure to sign him to a long-term deal. Despite these events, the Ravens re-signed Lewis on March 13, 2006, with a three-year deal, despite having signed former Denver Broncos running back Mike Anderson, who was widely thought to be Lewis&#x27; replacement.

====2006 season====
On November 19, 2006, Lewis rushed for a season-high three touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons. He ended the season with 314 carries for 1,132 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns. On February 28, 2007, the Ravens announced that they released Lewis. However, general manager Ozzie Newsome pointed out that they hoped to re-sign him, but that changed on March 7, 2007, when Lewis signed a contract with the Cleveland Browns. 

===Cleveland Browns===

====2007 season====
After joining the Browns, Lewis became the team&#x27;s starting running back. In Week 2, he had 27 carries for 216 rushing yards and one touchdown in a 51–45 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 12, against the Houston Texans, he had 29 carries for 134 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. In Week 15, against the Buffalo Bills, he had 33 carries for 163 rushing yards in the 8–0 victory. Lewis had his first 1,300+ yard season since 2003 in his first season with the Browns, rushing for 1,304 yards and nine touchdowns. He finished fifth in the league in rushing yards.

====2008 season====
On November 8, 2008, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reported that Lewis was dissatisfied with the performance of his teammates in the Browns&#x27; recent loss to the Denver Broncos. Lewis stated, &quot;This is the NFL, you can&#x27;t call it quits until the game is over.&quot; Lewis went on to say &quot;it looks to me like some people called it quits before that. Denver was down, but they didn&#x27;t call it quits. They kept their heads up and they finished. We didn&#x27;t do that two weeks in a row – at home.&quot; Without naming names, Lewis said: &quot;Some people need to check their egos at the door and find some heart to come out here and play hard. This is a man&#x27;s game. The way we went out there and played two weeks in a row, finishing the same kind of way, it&#x27;s not there. I think there are some men around here that need to check theirselves, straight up. That&#x27;s it.&quot; In the 2008 season, Lewis started in all 16 games for the Browns. He finished with 279 carries for 1,002 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 23 receptions for 178 receiving yards.

====2009 season====
In Week 5 of the 2009 season, Lewis had 31 carries for 117 rushing yards in the 6–3 victory over the Buffalo Bills. On November 2, 2009, Lewis announced he would retire after the 2009 season. Late in the 2009 season, Lewis was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. In the 2009 season, Lewis appeared in nine games and started eight. He finished with 143 carries for 500 rushing yards to go along with eight receptions for 88 receiving yards. On February 17, 2010, the Browns released Lewis. Lewis did not sign with another NFL team after his release from the Browns.

==Personal life==

In February 2004, it surfaced that Lewis had been involved in talks about a drug deal. Lewis was charged with conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine and using a cell phone in the commission of the first count. Lewis reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in October 2004 and ultimately, Lewis was sentenced in January 2005 to four months in federal prison. He was released on June 2, 2005.

In January 2015, Lewis began working as the Vice President of Business and Development for Metro Exhibits, a trade show exhibits company.

A Bleacher Report profile detailed Lewis&#x27; post-NFL life, noting that he suffers from the post-traumatic effects of concussions. He is currently the President of Southeast Exhibits and Metro Retail Solutions for Metro Exhibits.

===Financial problems===

In April 2010, Lewis filed for bankruptcy in Georgia listing $14.5 million in assets and $10.6 million in debts including a judgement of more than $350,000 on a loan defaulted from the bank whose name hangs over the Ravens&#x27; stadium.

On October 31, 2011, Regions Bank filed suit against Lewis over an unpaid $660,000 loan.

On February 8, 2015, a championship ring from Super Bowl XLVII that Lewis had owned was sold at auction for more than $50,000. Lewis had received the ring from Baltimore Ravens owner Stephen Bisciotti in honor of his status as one of the all-time great Ravens players. According to the Ravens organization, Lewis sold the ring due to financial difficulties.

<doc id="960835" wikidata="Q1754937" url="?curid=960835" title="Greatest Hits (Tom Petty album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is a compilation album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on November 16, 1993. It is Petty&#x27;s best-selling album to date and was certified 12× Platinum by the RIAA on April 28, 2015. The single &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; became one of Petty&#x27;s most popular songs, reaching No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The other new song on the album is a cover of the Thunderclap Newman hit &quot;Something in the Air&quot;. The album contains no songs from 1987&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot;. However, three songs from Petty&#x27;s 1989 solo album &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; were included.

On its original release in November 1993, the album debuted at No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and first peaked at No. 5 on the chart in February 1994. It reached a new peak of No. 2 following Petty&#x27;s death in 2017.

The new tracks &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; and &quot;Something in the Air&quot; were the band&#x27;s last recordings with drummer Stan Lynch.

== Reissues ==
In 2008, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was reissued by Geffen Records. This edition replaced &quot;Something In The Air&quot; with &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot;, Petty&#x27;s duet with Stevie Nicks from her 1981 album &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. The album&#x27;s photos and artwork replaced the &quot;Wildflowers&quot; and &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot; session photos with outtakes from &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get It!&quot;. In 2010 the album was once again reissued, this time reverting to the original 1993 track listing but keeping the artwork from the 2008 edition. In 2016 the album was made available on vinyl for the first time since 1993.

<doc id="960841" wikidata="Q7409167" url="?curid=960841" title="Same-sex marriage in Ontario">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been unambiguously legal in Ontario since June 10, 2003. The first legal same-sex marriages performed in Ontario were of Kevin Bourassa to Joe Varnell, and Elaine Vautour to Anne Vautour, by Reverend Brent Hawkes on January 14, 2001. The legality of the marriages was questioned and they were not registered until after June 10, 2003, when the Court of Appeal for Ontario in &quot;Halpern v Canada (AG)&quot; upheld a lower court ruling which declared that defining marriage in heterosexual-only terms violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

Ontario was the third jurisdiction in the world, after the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the first jurisdiction in the Americas to legalize same-sex marriage. The first legal same-sex marriage registered in Ontario was that of Paula Barrero and Blanca Mejias, married at the Emmanuel Howard Park United Church on September 29, 2001 by Reverend Cheri DiNovo. The Office of the Registrar General apparently did not recognize the names on the Record of Marriage form (which did not otherwise specify the parties&#x27; sexes) as both being women and issued a marriage certificate.

All of these marriages were authorized by calling the banns of marriage in the spouses&#x27; churches, a procedure which does not require a government-issued licence. The first civil marriage licence issued to a same-sex couple was to Michael Leshner and Michael Stark, who had the usual waiting period waived and completed the formalities of marriage just hours after the court ruling, on June 10, 2003.

==Background==
In 1993, the Ontario Superior Court ruled in &quot;Layland v. Ontario&quot; that same-sex couples did not have the capacity to marry each other. However, that decision was non-binding as it was the same court taking up the issue in 2002. One of the judges in the most recent case wrote &quot;with respect, the decisions to which I have referred assumed, without analysis, that the inability of persons of the same sex to marry was a question of capacity. The decisions are not binding on this court and, with respect, I do not find them persuasive.&quot;

The &quot;Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act&quot;, which would have granted same-sex couples a status comparable to civil unions, was proposed by the provincial government in 1994, but was defeated. Premier Bob Rae supported the bill.

In October 1999, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario enacted a bill providing same-sex couples with the same statutory rights and responsibilities as opposite-sex common-law spouses under 67 provincial laws, as required by the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s ruling in &quot;M v H&quot;. It introduced the term &quot;same-sex partner&quot;, while maintaining the opposite-sex definition of &quot;spouse&quot;. The law also included the right for same-sex couples to adopt children jointly.

==Court of Appeal ruling==

On July 12, 2002, in a 3–0 decision of the Ontario Superior Court, same-sex couples won the right to marry in the case of &quot;Halpern v Canada (AG)&quot;. The court ruled that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the equality provisions of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, giving the Government of Canada a two-year stay of judgment in which to pass legislation implementing same-sex marriage; otherwise, same-sex marriage would come into force automatically. Justice Harry LaForme wrote, &quot;The restriction against same-sex marriage is an offence to the dignity of lesbians and gays because it limits the range of relationship options available to them. The result is they are denied the autonomy to choose whether they wish to marry. This in turn conveys the ominous message that they are unworthy of marriage...I find that there is no merit to the argument that the rights and interests of heterosexuals would be affected by granting same-sex couples the freedom to marry. I cannot conclude that freedom of religion would be threatened or jeopardized by legally sanctioning same-sex marriage.&quot; Premier Ernie Eves, a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, said on 16 July 2002 that &quot;Ontario won&#x27;t stand in their way...If two people decide that they want to be in a union why would I interfere with that; that&#x27;s my personal point of view.&quot; The Toronto City Council also passed a measure urging the government not to appeal the decision.

In 2003, the couples in &quot;Halpern&quot; appealed the decision, requesting that the decision take effect immediately instead of after a delay. On June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed that Canadian law on marriage violated the equality provisions in Section 15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in being restricted to heterosexual couples. The Court of Appeal struck down the stay of judgment given in the 2002 ruling, thereby causing the judgment to come into effect immediately. The court wrote in its ruling:
Although the definition of marriage is governed by federal law, the court only had jurisdiction to implement the ruling within Ontario. The province became the first jurisdiction in North America to recognize same-sex marriage, and the third in the world after the Netherlands and Belgium. Consequently, the city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. The next day, the Attorney General of Ontario, Norm Sterling, announced that the province would comply with the ruling, &quot;I&#x27;m charged to follow the laws and will follow the laws with regards to this matter.&quot; The first marriage licence issued to a same-sex couple was to Michael Leshner and Michael Stark, who had the usual waiting period waived and completed the formalities of marriage just hours after the court ruling, on June 10, 2003. The court also ruled that two couples, Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell, and Elaine Vautour and Anne Vautour, who had previously attempted to marry using an ancient common-law procedure called &quot;reading the banns&quot; would be considered legally married. Their marriages were performed in the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto on January 14, 2001 by Reverend Brent Hawkes. Justice Minister Martin Cauchon reacted to the ruling by stating, &quot;Listen, the marriages that are taking place now are effectively legal marriages on the basis of the decision of the appeal court rendered [on 10 June]. I say for the time being because I can&#x27;t presume the future. We want to make sure that we&#x27;re going to have a national solution to that question. Having said that, I&#x27;m not in a position to today to give you the official government position.&quot; Paul Martin, then running for prime minister, expressed his support for the decision. Kyle Rae, a member of the Toronto City Council, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a momentous day. It is a great day for equality in Canada.&quot; A spokesperson for Focus on the Family said, &quot;Today&#x27;s court ruling on same-sex marriage ignores centuries of precedent, and renders ordinary Canadians&#x27; views irrelevant.&quot; An opinion poll published by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; a few days after the decision showed that a majority of Canadians supported same-sex marriage.

Two conservative groups who had been granted intervenor status, the Interfaith Coalition on Marriage and Family, and the Association for Marriage and the Family, attempted to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The court heard the petition on 6 October 2003. A lawyer for the groups said, &quot;The court is focused on hearing cases of public importance, and I don&#x27;t think there has been one more important than this that has come up in the last few years. This is not the case of a stranger coming off the street. The nation is saying this [marriage] is our biggest institution. Parliament has not spoken. There is confusion. The court should speak on this issue.&quot; The federal government and the couples who initiated the lawsuit asked the court to reject the petition. The court took only three days to unanimously reject the request. A spokesman for Canadians for Equal Marriage said, &quot;The practical effect of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling ...is to say that same-sex marriage in Ontario and British Columbia are here to stay.&quot; Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada said they were disappointed, &quot;We have lost an important opportunity to express the concerns of millions of Canadians.&quot;

Previously, a same-sex couple, Paula Barrero and Blanca Mejias, had been able to marry by banns at the Emmanuel Howard Park United Church in Toronto, a congregation of the United Church of Canada, on September 29, 2001. The officiant was Reverend Cheri DiNovo. The Office of the Registrar General mistook the name Paula to be that of a man and certified the marriage. The marriage caught media attention and a representative of the Office of the Registrar General sent a letter to the United Church requesting that DiNovo lose her licence. The church distanced itself from DiNovo but did not strip her of her licence.

==Provincial legislation==

On February 24, 2005, the &quot;Spousal Relationships Statute Law Amendment Act, 2005&quot; was passed in the Legislative Assembly, which performed &quot;housekeeping&quot; on various Ontario laws, to bring their wording into line with the court ruling. As well, the bill ensures that no religious institution or clergy will be forced to perform a ceremony against their beliefs. There is no such provision for civil officials. It received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor James Bartleman on March 9, 2005. The Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario supported the legislation, releasing the following statement: &quot;Priests will have some protection, they won&#x27;t find themselves in court. The Bishops wanted to be sure that religious bodies could not be compelled to allow their properties to be used for purposes associated with same-sex unions if such are contrary to their teachings, as is true for the Catholic Church. The Bill clearly provides this protection and the Ontario Bishops accordingly support it.&quot;

On November 29, 2016, the &quot;All Families Are Equal Act (Parentage and Related Registrations Statute Law Amendment), 2016&quot; passed the Legislative Assembly by 79 votes to 0. The bill provides presumption to the spouse or conjugal partner of the birth parent, ensuring that couples who use a sperm or egg donor or a surrogate are automatically recognized as parents, and as such do not have to adopt their own children. It received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell on December 5 and took effect on January 1, 2017.

The &quot;Marriage Act&quot; (; ; ) states that each of the parties to a marriage shall declare to the other:
==Divorce==
On September 13, 2004, the Ontario Court of Appeal declared the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; unconstitutional for excluding same-sex couples. It ordered same-sex marriages read into that act, permitting the plaintiffs, a lesbian couple, to divorce.

==Two-spirit marriages==
While there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in First Nations cultures, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. Many of these cultures recognized two-spirit individuals who were born male but wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. This two-spirit status allowed for marriages between two biological males or two biological females to be performed in some of these tribes.

Two-spirit people are known in the Ojibwe language as (), the origin of the umbrella term &quot;two-spirit&quot;. Many &quot;niizh manidoowag&quot; were wives in polygynous households. Among the Moose Cree, two-spirit individuals were regarded as &quot;esteemed persons with special spiritual powers&quot; and were &quot;noted shamans&quot;. They are known in their language as (ᐃᔅᑴᐦᑳᓱᐤ, ), and it was likely that they were able to marry cisgender men. The Seneca people refer to two-spirit individuals as , the Cayuga people as , and the Tuscarora people as . In these communities, elders say two-spirit people were embraced as &quot;special and powerful&quot;, and honoured as medicine people or healers. The Mohawk people call two-spirit individuals (), translating to &quot;I have the pattern of two spirits inside my body.&quot;

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that 26,585 same-sex couples were living in Ontario, mostly in Toronto and Ottawa. 38.2% of these couples were married.

==Religious performance==
Several dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada allow their clergy to bless and perform same-sex marriages. In 2007, a priest in Stirling-Rawdon was disciplined for marrying a same-sex couple. The Diocese of Ottawa has allowed solemnization of same-sex marriages since 2016. In July 2016, Bishop John Chapman issued a letter allowing local parishes to perform same-sex marriages. The dioceses of Niagara since July 2016, and Toronto since November 2016 have also authorized their clergy to perform same-sex marriages. In July 2019, Bishop Linda Nicholls of the Diocese of Huron allowed her clergy to perform same-sex marriages. In October 2019, the synod of the Diocese of Ontario voted to request the Bishop of Ontario to authorize the solemnization of same-sex marriages in the diocese; Bishop Michael Oulton issued guidelines the following month for clergy willing to perform same-sex marriages. Bishop Geoffrey Woodcroft of the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land, encompassing parts of northwestern Ontario, said in July 2019 that clergy in the diocese would be permitted to perform same-sex marriages from January 2020. Similarly, Bishop Anne Germond of the Diocese of Algoma authorized her clergy to perform same-sex marriages in May 2020. In these dioceses, clergy are not required to officiate at the marriages if this would violate their personal beliefs. On the other hand, same-sex marriages are not performed in the Diocese of Moosonee, which encompasses parts of northern Ontario. The marriage canon of the Anglican Church of Canada serves as the canon on marriage in the diocese. Bishop Lydia Mamakwa of the Indigenous Spiritual Ministry of Mishamikoweesh, encompassing Cree and Ojibwe communities in northwestern Ontario, opposes same-sex marriage, and the diocese does not perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council. In February 2023, the Southridge Community Church and the FreeChurch Toronto, congregations of the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches located in St. Catharines and Toronto respectively, were expelled from the denomination over their decision to affirm same-sex marriages.

<text>State Route 12 or Scenic Byway 12 (SR-12), also known as &quot;Highway 12 — A Journey Through Time Scenic Byway&quot;, is a state highway designated an All-American Road located in Garfield County and Wayne County, Utah, United States.

==Route description==

Proceeding west to east for 123 miles (nearly 200 km), the highway starts south of Panguitch at an intersection with US-89, crosses part of Dixie National Forest and Bryce Canyon National Park, continues through the small towns of Tropic, Cannonville, and Henrieville. It crosses various parts of Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GS-ENM), continues northeast through Escalante and over the Escalante River, then over &quot;The Hogback&quot;, a narrow ridge with no guardrails or shoulders and steep drop-offs on each side. It then proceeds north through more of GS-ENM, Boulder, the Aquarius Plateau, and Grover, ending in Torrey at an intersection with SR-24, five miles (8 km) west of Capitol Reef National Park. The long portion of the highway that ascends and descends Boulder Mountain on the Aquarius Plateau is known as Boulder Mountain Highway.

The segment of SR-12 between the US-89 and SR-63 junctions is part of the National Highway System.

===Traffic volume===
The Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on SR-12 is at its greatest at its western junction with US-89, where the count for 2005 was 2,430. At its other end, at the junction with SR-24, the traffic bottoms out at 435.

==History==

The road from Bryce Canyon Junction to Tropic was added to the state highway system in 1914, and in 1923 a branch from Tropic Junction to Bryce Canyon was built as a forest road. The State Road Commission numbered the route to Bryce Canyon SR-12 in the 1920s, and in 1927 the state legislature assigned it to both branches, to Bryce Canyon and Tropic, but split off the branch to Tropic as State Route 54 in 1931. That same year, a new State Route 120 was created, continuing the road from Tropic to Henrieville, and in 1935 it became part of SR-54. Another road was also added to the state highway system in 1914, connecting SR-22 at Widtsoe with Escalante, and it was numbered State Route 23 in 1927. An extension took SR-23 northeast to Boulder in 1941, and in 1947 SR-54 absorbed SR-23, with the Widtsoe-Escalante road dropped in favor of Henrieville-Escalante. State Route 117, running southeast from SR-24 near Teasdale to Grover, became a state highway in 1931, and was extended south to Boulder in 1957, becoming part of SR-54 in 1966. In 1969, SR-54 became part of SR-12, but most of former SR-117 was dropped, leaving SR-12 to stretch from Bryce Canyon Junction to the north limit of Boulder (at the Dixie National Forest boundary), with a short spur to Bryce Canyon. This spur became a new SR-63 in 1975, and in 1985 the route was extended back north from Boulder to SR-24, using a different route than the old SR-117 north of Grover.

<text>Lazaro Mendez, better known by his stage name DJ Laz (born December 2, 1971, in Hollywood, Florida, United States) is a Cuban-American rapper and DJ from Miami, Florida. He hosted his weekday radio show in Miami on WPOW 96.5 FM, branded &quot;Power 96&quot;, for 22 years until he left the company in April 2012. Beginning July 4, 2012, the new &quot;DJ Laz Morning Show&quot; began after arbitration on the newly reformatted WRMA DJ106.7 a Bilingual Dance/Rhythmic formatted station.

He is best known for his limp which came from his battle with polio as a child. Also known for albums &quot;DJ Laz&quot; and &quot;Category 6&quot;, which charted on U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. He is also notable for the singles &quot;Journey Into Bass&quot; (1994) and &quot;Move Shake Drop&quot; (2008), which peaked at #56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;The DJ Laz Morning Show&quot; on LA 96.3 of Los Angeles and DJ 106.7 of Miami is known for mysteriously getting their hands on exclusive content. DJ Laz is also known for his show&#x27;s prominent appearance on Fox&#x27;s television show, &quot;Dish Nation&quot;.

In July 2012, when Justin Bieber made a 911 call to authorities to report paparazzi that were following him, the &quot;DJ Laz Morning Show&quot; was the first to obtain Bieber&#x27;s 911 call, airing it on Los Angeles&#x27; LA 96.3.

On Tuesday, September 11, 2012, the &quot;DJ Laz Morning Show&quot; aired a pre-recorded interview with President Barack Obama. Many Obama critics quickly bashed Obama for making no mention to the September 11 attacks in 2001, despite the fact that the interview was pre-recorded. The White House later made it clear that the call was indeed pre-recorded and was supposed to have been played on Monday, September 10.

On May 5, 2014, DJ Laz was in command of a boat that was stuck on a sand bar in Biscayne Bay. When bystanders got out to push the boat, DJ Laz increased power to the engine and killed a 23-year-old man who had been trying to help, as he was caught by the boat&#x27;s propeller. DJ Laz was never given a sobriety test and there was no further investigation.

DJ Laz hosted the Morning Show for 97.3 in Miami from August, 2014 until November, 2019. He left in advance of an acquisition, and can currently be found on Sirius XM on Pitbull&#x27;s Globalization Channel 13.

In 2021, DJ Laz joined Miami&#x27;s new 1990s station Totally 93.9, hosting weekday afternoons.

<doc id="960854" wikidata="Q917308" url="?curid=960854" title="Madredeus">
<text>Madredeus () are a Portuguese musical ensemble formed in 1985, in Lisbon. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music, fado and folk music. 

Madredeus are one of the most successful music groups from Portugal, having sold over 3 million albums worldwide.

== History ==

=== 1985–1993: Formation and first lineup ===
Madredeus&#x27; first lineup consisted of Pedro Ayres Magalhães (classical guitar), Rodrigo Leão (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalhães and Leão formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon&#x27;s night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, &quot;Os dias da MadreDeus&quot;.

The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon&#x27;s tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, &quot;Madre de Deus&quot; (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular &quot;Madredeus&quot;.

The second album, &quot;Existir,&quot; was released in 1990. In 1992, they released their first live album, &quot;Lisboa&quot;, recorded at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon.

=== 1993–2007: Lineup changes and second main lineup ===
In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalhães left the group temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by José Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalhães rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. In the following year, the group&#x27;s third album &quot;O Espírito da Paz&quot; becomes their first album released as a sextet.

In 1994, the German director Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie &quot;Lisbon Story.&quot; The soundtrack for the film, &quot;Ainda&quot;, released in 1995, gave the group international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia.

Rodrigo Leão left the group in 1994 to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer).

In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the group. Fernando Júdice (acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join the group and Madredeus became again a quintet. The album &quot;Paraíso&quot;, released that year, was the first with the new lineup, which would remain until 2007.

In 1998, Madredeus contributed &quot;Os Dias São A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. The group also performed in the opening ceremony of the Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon, alongside José Carreras and Michael Nyman.

In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro, Fernando Júdice and José Peixoto announce they would leave Madredeus.

=== 2008–2011: Madredeus &amp; A Banda Cósmica ===
After the departures of Teresa Salgueiro, Fernando Júdice and José Peixoto, Pedro Ayres Magalhães and Carlos Maria Trindade decide to continue performing Madredeus&#x27; music with a new cast of supporting musicians, named A Banda Cósmica. The collaboration Madredeus &amp; A Banda Cósmica released three albums of original material: &quot;Metafonia&quot; (2008), &quot;A Nova Aurora&quot; (2009) and &quot;Castelos na Areia&quot; (2010).

=== 2011–present: Current lineup ===
In 2011, Pedro Ayres Magalhães announced that Madredeus would be coming back with a new lineup and album. The new lineup is composed of Beatriz Nunes (vocals), Pedro Ayres de Magalhães (guitar), Carlos Maria Trindade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). 

The album &quot;Essência&quot; was released in 2012. The group&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Capricho Sentimental&quot;, was released in 2015.

== Musical style ==
The music of Madredeus combines influences from traditional Portuguese music, fado and folk music. It has been described as post-fado and New Age fado. 

A 1997 article in The New York Times stated that &quot;Madredeus does to fado what Enya does to Irish traditional music: wrapping folk-rooted melodies in gauzy, portentous new age trappings&quot;, and that &quot;in many ways, Madredeus is closer to an international movement of ethereal pop, akin to the Cocteau Twins and Kate Bush, than it is to fado.&quot; 

Although Madredeus&#x27; visual presentation is similar to that of traditional fado settings, the group does not consider itself a fado group. According to Pedro Ayres Magalhães, “if you ask any fado player, they will very clearly tell you that Madredeus does not do fado. For example, we do not even include the traditional instrument - the 12-string Portuguese guitar”. Nevertheless, the influence of fado is very much present in their songs&#x27; lyrics, which are often melancholic and evoke the concept of saudade.

<text>Cocamide DEA, or cocamide diethanolamine, is a diethanolamide made by reacting the mixture of fatty acids from coconut oils with diethanolamine. It is a viscous liquid and is used as a foaming agent in bath products like shampoos and hand soaps, and in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent. See cocamide for the discussion of the lengths of carbon chains in the molecules in the mixture. The chemical formula of individual components is CH3(CH2)&quot;n&quot;C(=O)N(CH2CH2OH)2, where &quot;n&quot; typically ranges from 8 to 18.

==Safety==

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists coconut oil diethanolamine condensate (cocamide DEA) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, which identifies this chemical as possibly carcinogenic to humans. The listing is based on a dermal animal bioassay.

In June 2012, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment added cocamide DEA to the California Proposition 65 (1986) list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

Cocamide DEA has a high irritation potential.

<text>Christopher James McAlister (born June 14, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats, earning unanimous All-American honors. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft, and played for the Ravens for 10 seasons before playing his final season with the New Orleans Saints.

==Early life==
McAlister was born in Pasadena, California, and attended Pasadena High School. As a high school football quarterback, he threw for 1,153 yards and rushed for 1,302 yards and also returned three punts and two interceptions for touchdowns. He won the conference player of the year and California&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award in his senior year. McAlister also played basketball and, under Coach Bill Duwe, won the CIF championship in 1995. He also lettered in track. Pasadena High School retired his football jersey No. 9 in 2001.

==College career==
McAlister originally committed to UCLA, where his father James was a star running back in the 1972–73 seasons. McAllister went to Mt. San Antonio College before transferring to the University of Arizona and playing for the Arizona Wildcats football team from 1996 to 1998. He had an illustrious career at Arizona where he won unanimous All-America first-team honors and was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection for 3 straight seasons. He is only the 7th player in college football history (1st in Arizona history) to return a kickoff, punt and interception for touchdowns in the same season. His 18 interceptions at the end of his Arizona career ranked 3rd on the school&#x27;s career-record chart behind Chuck Cecil and Jackie Wallace.

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft===


===Baltimore Ravens===
The Baltimore Ravens selected Chris McAlister in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft, as the tenth overall pick.

McAlister had a solid rookie season in which he recorded 47 tackles (45 solo), 5 interceptions, and 16 passes deflected. He made his NFL debut at the St. Louis Rams on September 12, 1999. At season&#x27;s end, he was named to College &amp; Pro Football Newsweekly&#x27;s 1999 All-Rookie Team. McAlister had another solid season in 2000 as the Ravens won the Super Bowl and he had a key interception in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. During the regular season, he also intercepted New York Jets and former Baltimore Ravens QB Vinny Testaverde and returned it 98 yards for a touchdown.

McAlister set an NFL record for the longest play when he returned a missed field goal 107 yards for a touchdown during Monday Night Football against the Denver Broncos on September 30, 2002. This record was later broken by Nathan Vasher on a 108-yard field goal return, tied by Devin Hester and eventually broken again by Antonio Cromartie on a 109-yard field goal return in 2007.

McAlister earned his first Pro Bowl selection in 2003. He had 43 tackles. McAlister also intercepted three passes for 93 yards. That included an 83-yard run for a score.

In 2004, McAlister signed a 7-year, $55 million contract. 

McAlister had arguably the best season of his career in 2006. He had two touchdowns that year and made his third Pro Bowl. But his last two seasons in Baltimore were marked by injuries and inconsistent play. In 2008, in 5 starts before being put on Injured Reserve, he did however amass 16 tackles, 3 INTs and 1 fumble recovery, showing some of his old form.

Chris McAlister had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens on February 16, 2009.

===New Orleans Saints===
On November 17, 2009, McAlister signed with the New Orleans Saints. In a December 6 game at the Washington Redskins, McAlister forced a fumble in overtime, which started the drive resulting in a game-winning field goal for New Orleans. However, he was released on December 8, just two months before the Saints would go on to win Super Bowl XLIV. McAlister finished 2009 with 4 tackles and the forced fumble.

==NFL statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Personal life==
Chris McAlister&#x27;s father, James McAlister, also played in the NFL for three seasons for the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles during the 1970s. McAlister is divorced and has one daughter. McAlister was married for three months.

<text>Zachary Paul Wamp (born October 28, 1957) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1995 to 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in Chattanooga and includes large parts of East Tennessee, including Oak Ridge.

==Early life and education==
Wamp was born in Fort Benning, Georgia, and grew up in East Ridge, Tennessee, a community adjacent to Chattanooga, where his father worked as an architect. He attended The Lutheran School, a Lutheran elementary school. Later, with his two brothers, he attended The McCallie School, an all-male prep school in Chattanooga, as a day student, from the age of 11 until he graduated in 1976. He was president of the student council, active in athletics, and was the MVP of the varsity basketball team at McCallie in 1976. He was baptized, raised and confirmed in the Lutheran Church. He spent his freshman year at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1977–78 and briefly returned in 1979–80 after his sophomore year at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville between (1978–79). However, he graduated from neither and ultimately dropped out of college. He had struggled with drug and alcohol problems as a student and would eventually enter rehab.

==Early career==
After leaving college, Wamp became a national sales supervisor for Olan Mills, a photography company based in Chattanooga that primarily produces church directories, and later became a successful commercial and industrial real estate broker. He worked in his family&#x27;s architectural and development business and became vice president of Charter Real Estate Corporation in 1989. In 1992, he joined Fletcher Bright Co. in Chattanooga as a commercial and industrial real estate broker.

He began his career in politics as a precinct vice chairman and Youth Coordinator for the 1983 Chattanooga mayoral campaign of Gene Roberts. He became President of the Young Republicans and was later elected chairman of the Hamilton County, Tennessee Republican Party, then regional director for the Tennessee GOP. 

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Wamp ran for the House of Representatives as a Republican in 1992 against nine-term Democrat Marilyn Lloyd. He nearly scored a major upset, only losing by 1.3 points—only 2,900 votes out of 210,000 total votes cast.

When Lloyd did not run for re-election in 1994, Wamp ran again. Battling through a hotly contested primary, he easily defeated his childhood friend and sitting State Representative Kenneth J. Meyer by nearly two to one. During the race, Wamp signed the Contract with America. He also personally committed to serve no more than six terms and further committed to not accept special interest PAC money. He proposed a plan to pay congressmen the same as Lieutenant Colonels and linked his Democratic opponent, Randy Button, to Bill Clinton. Wamp won the general election with 52% of the vote, during the Republican Revolution. He likely got coattails from Bill Frist&#x27;s and Fred Thompson&#x27;s strong 1994 statewide elections, and was helped by Lloyd crossing party lines to endorse him. He was re-elected with slightly less difficulty in 1996. After his first two elections, he never faced another close contest; from 1998 onward, he won by 64 percent or more of the vote. Wamp explored seeking a seat in the United States Senate to succeed Bill Frist, who had promised to serve no more than two terms. He decided against running for that seat in October 2004.

;2006

When he was elected to the House in 1994, Wamp pledged to serve just twelve years (six terms) in the House. However, shortly after winning reelection to a sixth term in 2004, Wamp announced he would run again in 2006 after all, citing his status as Tennessee&#x27;s only member of the powerful Appropriations Committee. The pledge was &quot;a mistake,&quot; he told the Associated Press in 2004.

Wamp faced Brent Benedict, a computer programmer and consultant. During the campaign, Benedict made an issue of Wamp breaking his term limit pledge, saying that he would hold himself to six terms if elected. Despite this, Wamp was easily reelected.

Following the GOP losing the U.S. House and U.S. Senate in the 2006 midterm elections, Wamp reflected on the defeat saying, &quot;For the first six years of the 12 years, we were focused on policy and principles, and politics was secondary. The second six years, politics became primary: raising money, going negative, consolidating power.&quot;

;2008
He won re-election with 69% of the vote, his best election performance.

===Tenure===
Wamp was a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a post he has used to champion what he called his highest legislative priority—funding for his district&#x27;s decaying lock at the Chickamauga Dam. In 2006, the eight-year, $349 million project was approved, but Wamp has had to continually work to protect the project from budget cuts and shortfalls. Indeed, he cited his status as the only Tennessean on that committee as a reason for dropping his original term-limit pledge. He also secured in the 2006 budget a $4 million appropriation for a methamphetamine task force, which was started in 1999 and has since expanded to all regions of Tennessee. Wamp has vigorously supported the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of the largest government-owned firms in the United States.

Wamp supported legislation to allow the posting of the Ten Commandments in public buildings. He changed his vote from &quot;nay&quot; to &quot;yea&quot; on the bill of the Wall Street bailout, but later has said he regrets that vote. In 2003, he was one of two congressmen to have received a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.

;2005 run for Majority Whip
In the wake of Tom DeLay&#x27;s indictment in September 2005, Wamp campaigned among his fellow Republican House members to become the majority whip, the number three position in the Republican House leadership. Representatives Ray LaHood and Gil Gutknecht agreed to co-chair his campaign for the position. However, the incumbent, Roy Blunt, remained the majority whip because Blunt lost his race for Majority Leader (the position was won by John Boehner in February 2006).

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)

Wamp served on the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a Republican group that focuses on reducing the size of the US Government. Congressman Ron Paul hosts a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday.

==2010 gubernatorial election==
On January 5, 2009, Wamp announced that he would run for Governor of Tennessee in the Republican primaries. In the primary, he placed second with 29% of the vote.

On July 23, 2010, &quot;Hotline OnCall&quot; published statements made by Wamp in an interview, in which he said that the health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration had placed state governments in &quot;an untenable position&quot;. Wamp also suggested the possibility of secession arising from opposition to the federal government, stating &quot;I hope that the American people will go to the ballot box in 2010 and 2012 so that states are not forced to consider separation from this government&quot;, as well as expressing support for Texas Governor Rick Perry&#x27;s similar statements regarding secession. Wamp&#x27;s statements drew national attention, prompting Wamp to state that his remarks were misinterpreted, and that he did not support secession. Opponent Ron Ramsey labeled the remarks Wamp&#x27;s &quot;over-the-top temperament and overheated, sometimes crazy rhetoric&quot;.

Wamp was unsuccessful in his bid to be the Republican candidate for Tennessee&#x27;s Governor, losing to Bill Haslam in the August 5, 2010 open primary.

==After Congress ==
After leaving office, he became involved in political reform efforts, including joining nine other former members of Congress to co-author a 2021 opinion editorial advocating reforms of Congress.

==Electoral history==

*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, Marjorie M. Martin received 1,593 votes (1%) and write-ins received 3 votes. In 1994, write-ins received 4 votes.

<doc id="960884" wikidata="Q1372748" url="?curid=960884" title="Dancing Beijing">
<text>Dancing Beijing is the name of the official emblem of the 2008 Summer Olympics, which took place in Beijing in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was unveiled on 3 August 2003 in a ceremony attended by 2,008 people at Beijing&#x27;s Temple of Heaven.

==Description==
The emblem draws on various elements of Chinese culture, depicting a traditional red Chinese seal above the words &quot;Beijing 2008&quot; and the Olympic rings. The seal is inscribed with a stylised calligraphic rendition of the Chinese character (&quot;jīng&quot;, meaning &#x27;capital&#x27;, from the name of the host city) in the form of a dancing figure. The curves are also claimed to suggest the body of a wriggling Chinese dragon. The open arms of the figure symbolise the invitation of China to the world to share in its culture. The figure also resembles that of a runner crossing the finish line. Red, the dominant colour of the emblem, is an important colour in Chinese society, often signifying prosperity.

==Design==
The logo was created by Guo Chunning (), the vice-president of the &quot;Beijing Armstrong International Corporate Identity&quot; (AICI). There was only one seal among the 1,985 entries contributed by designers from China and overseas. Other entries included dozens of Great Walls, pandas and dragons. Other designers include Zhang Wu ().

==Unveiling ceremony==
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge delivered an address at the unveiling ceremony on 3 August 2003 saying, &quot;Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.&quot; Rogge continued, &quot;In this emblem, I saw the promise and potential of a New Beijing and a Great Olympics. This is a milestone in the history of your Olympic quest. As this new emblem becomes known around the world and, as it takes its place at the centre of your Games, we are confident that it will achieve the stature of one of the best and most meaningful symbols in Olympic history.&quot; The ceremony was delayed by several months because of the SARS outbreak in 2003.

<text>Jonathan Phillip Ogden (born July 31, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle and spent his entire career with the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was selected by the Ravens with the 4th overall pick in the 1996 NFL draft, making him the first Ravens draft selection in franchise history. He was an 11-time Pro Bowl selection and a nine-time All-Pro. Ogden won Super Bowl XXXV with the Ravens in 2001.

On February 2, 2013, Ogden was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the first inductee to spend his entire playing career as a Raven. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Ogden was born in Washington, D.C. He received his education at St. Albans School in Washington, excelling not only in high school football but also in track and field. He was a high school All-American in both football and track. He had high school-best throws of 19.23 meters (63.09 feet) in the shot put and 56.73 meters (186.12 feet) in the discus throw.

==College career==
Ogden decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) instead of the University of Florida because the Bruins football coaches would let him participate in track and field. As a sophomore, he helped UCLA to the 1993 Pac-10 Championship and Rose Bowl. He later won the 1996 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships in the shot put, with a personal best of 19.42 meters. Ogden had an outstanding career with the Bruins football team, starting as a left tackle for four years. In 23 games during his junior and senior years, he allowed just two sacks. In 1995, Ogden received the Outland Trophy and the Morris Trophy, was the UPI Lineman of the Year, and was a unanimous All-American. Ogden&#x27;s father, an investment banker, told his son to accept UCLA&#x27;s decision to move him from right to left tackle.

Ogden&#x27;s jersey was retired by UCLA, making him only the eighth player in school history to receive that honor. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006. On December 5, 2012, he was enshrined into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
During the 1996 NFL draft, Ogden was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the fourth overall choice, the first draft pick made by the Ravens. Ozzie Newsome wanted to select Ogden but owner Art Modell wanted to select Lawrence Phillips. Phillips played in 3 NFL seasons and rushed for a career yardage total of 1,453.

He was named a four-time first team All-Pro and an 11-time Pro Bowler at left tackle, earning trips to Hawaii in every season except his rookie year. During his career, Ogden caught two passes – both for one yard and both for touchdowns. He also recovered 10 fumbles and recorded 10 tackles. Ogden also won a reputation for smiling. &quot;He&#x27;s a laugher,&quot; joked former New York Giants DE Michael Strahan. &quot;You see him, you think to yourself this guy is not mean enough to handle the mean guys out there in the NFL. Jonathan would rip your limbs off, and he&#x27;d smile...and wave your arm in front of you.&quot; He is widely considered one of the best tackles to ever play the game.

In 2001, Ogden won a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens when they defeated the New York Giants 34–7 in Super Bowl XXXV. Ogden announced his retirement on June 12, 2008 after a career that spanned 12 seasons, all with Baltimore. His retirement left Ray Lewis and Matt Stover as the last remaining Ravens from the team&#x27;s inaugural season in Baltimore. At 6&#x27; 9&quot;, Ogden was tied with fellow Raven Jared Gaither for the second tallest player in the NFL behind Bengals tackle Dennis Roland at the end of Ogden&#x27;s playing career.

Ogden served as the Ravens&#x27; honorary captain at Super Bowl XLVII, which saw his former team win their second world championship.

==Personal life==
In 1997, he established the Jonathan Ogden Foundation to help student-athletes take responsibility for their futures through lessons learned on the playing field, in the classroom, and throughout their local communities.

On May 1, 2000, Ogden appeared on &quot;WWF Raw&quot; along with members of the Baltimore Ravens and attempted to win the WWF Hardcore Championship from Crash Holly after Holly was attacked by Steve Blackman, but was unsuccessful. In September 2009, Ogden was selected to Sporting News&#x27; Magazine&#x27;s Team of the Decade (2000&#x27;s). In 2010, he was placed 72nd on the list of NFL&#x27;s top 100 players. He was present during the Ravens&#x27; Super Bowl XXXV reunion in 2010.

Ogden has starred in commercials for Apple Ford, a dealership in Columbia, Maryland, and during his playing career, he appeared in TV advertisements for GEBCO, a local car insurance company. He also appeared in a 2012 advertisement with Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake in support of Maryland Question 7. The measure expanded gambling in the state.

<text>Reflector is the sixth studio album by the California soft rock group Pablo Cruise. The album charted slightly higher than its immediate predecessor, but still managed only to reach #34 in the US. Two singles were released from the album; &quot;Cool Love&quot; and &quot;Slip Away&quot;, reaching #13 and #75 respectively in the US. Produced by established and well-known R&amp;B producer Tom Dowd, fans remarked that the album had a different feel to it.

Two changes in members were made before the album was released. After just two albums, bassist and vocalist Bruce Day was replaced by John Pierce while additional guitarist Angelo Rossi was added. Furthermore, keyboardist Cory Lerios sang lead vocals on &quot;This Time&quot; and &quot;Inside/Outside&quot;, something he had not done on previous albums.

<text>The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (also known as Messier 24 and IC 4715) is a star cloud in the constellation of Sagittarius approximately 600 light years wide, which was catalogued by Charles Messier in 1764.

The stars, clusters and other objects comprising M24 are part of the Sagittarius or Sagittarius-Carina arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Messier described M24 as a &quot;large nebulosity containing many stars&quot; and gave its dimensions as being some 1.5° across. Some sources, improperly, identify M24 as the small open cluster NGC 6603. The location of the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud is near the Omega Nebula (also known as M17) and open cluster Messier 18, both north of M24. M24 is one of only three Messier objects that are not actual deep sky objects.

M24 fills a space of significant volume to a depth of 10,000 to 16,000 light-years. The star cloud is the most dense concentration of individual stars visible using binoculars, with around 1,000 stars visible within a single field of view. In telescopes it is best seen at low magnification, with a field of view of at least 2 degrees. Described as &quot;a virtual carpet of stellar jewels&quot;, M24 is visible to the naked eye whenever the Milky Way itself is visible as well. It holds a collection of numerous types of stars that are visible through the galaxy&#x27;s obscuring band of interstellar dust.

The light of M24 is spread out over a large area, which makes estimating its brightness difficult. Older references give the star cloud&#x27;s magnitude as 4.6, but more recent estimates place it a full two magnitudes brighter, at 2.5.

HD 167356 is the brightest star within the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, a white supergiant with an apparent magnitude of 6.05. This star is an Alpha-2 Canum Venaticorum variable, showing small changes in brightness as it rotates. There are three other stars in M24 with visual magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.0.

The star cloud incorporates two prominent dark nebulae which are vast clouds of dense, obscuring interstellar dust. This dust blocks light from the more distant stars, which keeps them from being seen from Earth. Lying on the northwestern side is Barnard 92, which is the darker of the two. Within the star field, the nebula appears as an immense round hole devoid of stars. American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard discovered this dark nebula in 1913. Along the northeast side lies Barnard 93, as large as Barnard 92 though less obvious. There are also other dark nebulae within M24, including Barnard 304 and Barnard 307.

The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud also contains two planetary nebulae, M 1-43 and NGC 6567. Located within a spiral arm of the Milky Way, Messier 24 holds some similarities with NGC 206, a bright, large star cloud within the Andromeda Galaxy.

The interceptions helped the Jets close the season with two straight wins to finish with an 8–8 record, which played a major part in Rex Ryan keeping his job as head coach. With the Jets, Reed played in seven games, of which he started five, with 22 tackles, four passes defended, and three interceptions.

<text>Peter Michael Liba (May 10, 1940 – June 21, 2007) was a Canadian journalist, businessman and 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba.

==Biography==
Liba was born in Winnipeg, and began his journalistic career working for the &quot;Portage la Prairie Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Neepawa Press&quot;. He joined the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot; in 1960, and became its city editor in 1967. An executive assistant to the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party between 1968 and 1973, working under Gildas Molgat, Robert Bend and Israel Asper, in 1974 he joined Asper&#x27;s CanWest group of companies, eventually becoming president and CEO of CKND-TV in Manitoba and SaskWest TV in Saskatchewan. He served on the Board of Directors of Atomic Energy of Canada from 1981 to 1986 with Marc Lalonde.

In 1993 he was appointed executive vice-president of CanWest Global Communications Corp and was promoted to executive director of corporate affairs in 1997. He also served two terms as chairman of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, and was also president of the Western Association of Broadcasters and the Broadcasters Association of Manitoba. President of his own company, Peli Ventures Inc., from 1975 he was actively involved in several social and philanthropic groups in the Winnipeg area. In 1984 Liba was appointed a member of the Order of Canada and in 1998 was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

The appointment as Manitoba&#x27;s lieutenant-governor may have been, in part, a reflection of Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s friendship with Israel Asper. The position is largely ceremonial, and Liba had very little influence over the governments of Gary Filmon and Gary Doer. Liba was made the first member of the Order of Manitoba in 1999, and received the Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal in 2004. He stepped down as lieutenant-governor just before the federal election of 2004, and was replaced by outgoing Liberal MP John Harvard.

Liba died on June 21, 2007, at his cottage at Lake of the Woods.

<text>Angioedema is an area of swelling (edema) of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes. The swelling may occur in the face, tongue, larynx, abdomen, or arms and legs. Often it is associated with hives, which are swelling within the upper skin. Onset is typically over minutes to hours.
The underlying mechanism typically involves histamine or bradykinin. The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder.
Treatment to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead. In the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year.

==Signs and symptoms==


The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue, swell over the period of minutes to hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. The swelling can be itchy or painful. There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves. Urticaria (hives) may develop simultaneously.

In severe cases, stridor of the airway occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing oxygen levels. Tracheal intubation is required in these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death.

Sometimes, the cause is recent exposure to an allergen (e.g. peanuts), but more often it is either idiopathic (unknown) or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure.

In hereditary angioedema (HAE), often no direct cause is identifiable, although mild trauma, including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks. There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, as it is not an allergic response. Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called &quot;attacks&quot;) of abdominal pain, usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash. These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause a significant increase in the patient&#x27;s white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000. As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides. As the symptoms and diagnostic tests are almost indistinguishable from an acute abdomen (e.g. perforated appendicitis) it is possible for undiagnosed HAE patients to undergo laparotomy (operations on the abdomen) or laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) that turns out to have been unnecessary.

HAE may also cause swelling in a variety of other locations, most commonly the limbs, genitals, neck, throat and face. The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly uncomfortable to agonizing pain, depending on its location and severity. Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible. Most patients have an average of one episode per month, but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year. The triggers can vary and include infections, minor injuries, mechanical irritation, operations or stress. In most cases, edema develops over a period of 12–36 hours and then subsides within 2–5 days.

==Pathophysiology==

Bradykinin plays a critical role in all forms of hereditary angioedema. This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting connective tissue, and edema develops easily. Bradykinin is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a pain mediator. Dampening or inhibiting bradykinin has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms.

Various mechanisms that interfere with bradykinin production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency in one of its prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH. This serine protease inhibitor (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited.

The three types of hereditary angioedema are:
* Type I - decreased levels of C1INH (85%);
* Type II - normal levels, but decreased function of C1INH (15%);
* Type III - no detectable abnormality in C1INH, occurs in an X-linked dominant fashion and therefore mainly affects women; it can be exacerbated by pregnancy and use of hormonal contraception (exact frequency uncertain). It has been linked with mutations in the factor XII gene.

Angioedema can be due to antibody formation against C1INH; this is an autoimmune disorder. This acquired angioedema is associated with the development of lymphoma.

Consumption of foods that are themselves vasodilators, such as alcoholic beverages or cinnamon, can increase the probability of an angioedema episode in susceptible patients. If the episode occurs at all after the consumption of these foods, its onset may be delayed overnight or by some hours, making the correlation with their consumption somewhat difficult. In contrast, consumption of bromelain in combination with turmeric may be beneficial in reducing symptoms.

The use of ibuprofen or aspirin may increase the probability of an episode in some patients. The use of acetaminophen typically has a smaller, but still present, increase in the probability of an episode.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made on the clinical picture. Routine blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes) are typically performed. Mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; complement levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of &quot;C1-inhibitor&quot;. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function.

The hereditary form (HAE) often goes undetected for a long time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides a family history of the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive due to the lack of regulation by C1-INH.

Angioedema is classified as either hereditary or acquired.

===Acquired angioedema===
Acquired angioedema (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It is usually caused by allergy and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and urticaria. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, frequently of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals. Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening.

===Hereditary angioedema===
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) exists in three forms, all of which are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the &quot;SERPING1&quot; gene, which result in either diminished levels of the C1-inhibitor protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the &quot;F12&quot; gene, which encodes the coagulation protein factor XII. All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the complement system, and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the digestive tract. If HAE involves the larynx, it can cause life-threatening asphyxiation. The pathogenesis of this disorder is suspected to be related to unopposed activation of the contact pathway by the initial generation of kallikrein and/or clotting factor XII by damaged endothelial cells. The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and is believed to be the predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema &quot;attacks&quot;.

==Management==

=== Allergic ===
In allergic angioedema, avoidance of the allergen and use of antihistamines may prevent future attacks. Cetirizine is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema. Some patients have reported success with the combination of a nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear. Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require steroid therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life-saving.

=== Drug induction ===
ACE inhibitors can induce angioedema. ACE inhibitors block the enzyme ACE so it can no longer degrade bradykinin; thus, bradykinin accumulates and can cause angioedema. This complication appears more common in African-Americans. In people with ACE inhibitor angioedema, the drug needs to be discontinued and an alternative treatment needs to be found, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which has a similar mechanism but does not affect bradykinin. However, this is controversial, as small studies have shown some patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema can develop it with ARBs, as well.

=== Hereditary ===
In hereditary angioedema (HAE), specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. Acute treatment consists of C1-INH (C1-esterase inhibitor) concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously. In an emergency, fresh frozen blood plasma, which also contains C1-INH, can also be used. However, in most European countries, C1-INH concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programmes. The medications ecallantide and icatibant may be used to treat attacks. In 2017 these medications cost between 5,700 and 14,000 per dose in the United States, prices that tripled in two years. In those given icatibant, specialists monitor is recommended.

=== Acquired ===
In acquired angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine may also be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in patients with liver disease, whereas androgens cannot.

=== Prophylaxis ===
Future attacks of HAE can be prevented by the use of androgens such as danazol, oxandrolone or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.

In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lanadelumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to prevent attacks of HAE types I and II in people over age 12. Lanadelumab inhibits the plasma enzyme kallikrein, which liberates the kinins bradykinin and kallidin from their kininogen precursors and is produced in excess in individuals with HAE types I and II.

==Epidemiology==
In the U.S., there are as many as 80,000 to 112,000 emergency department (ED) visits for angioedema annually, and it ranks as the top allergic disorder resulting in hospitalization.

==History==
Heinrich Quincke first described the clinical picture of angioedema in 1882, though there had been some earlier descriptions of the condition.

William Osler remarked in 1888 that some cases may have a hereditary basis; he coined the term &quot;hereditary angio-neurotic edema&quot;.

The link with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency was proved in 1963.

The underground rapper MF DOOM was diagnosed with angioedema in 2020 and later passed from the disease on October 31st.

<text>&quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; is the 14th episode of ninth season of the British BBC anthology TV series &quot;Play for Today&quot;. The episode was a television play that was originally broadcast on 30 January 1979. &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; was written by Dennis Potter, directed by Brian Gibson and produced by Kenith Trodd.

The play concerns a group of seven-year-olds playing in the Forest of Dean one summer afternoon in 1943. It ends abruptly when the character Donald is burned to death, partly as a result of the other children&#x27;s actions. Perhaps the most striking feature of the play is that, although the characters are children, they are played by adult actors. Potter first used this device in &quot;Stand Up, Nigel Barton&quot; (1965) and returned to it in &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; (1996).

The dialogue is written in a Forest of Dean dialect, which Potter also uses extensively in other dramas incorporating a Forest of Dean setting, most notably &quot;A Beast with Two Backs&quot; (1968), &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986).

==Cast==
The stars of the original production were:

Robin Ellis (John), Michael Elphick (Peter), Colin Welland (Willie), John Bird (Raymond), Helen Mirren (Angela), Janine Duvitski (Audrey), Colin Jeavons (Donald).

The screenplay has also been adapted for the theatre. The play is now a standard text for GCSE Drama in Great Britain.

==Title==
The title comes from the 40th poem in A.E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. The poem is read by Potter himself at the end of the BBC version of the play.

<text>Stephen McIntyre (born c. 1947) is a Canadian mining exploration company director, a former minerals prospector and semi-retired mining consultant whose work has included statistical analysis. He is the founder and editor of Climate Audit, a blog which analyses and discusses climate data. He is a critic of the temperature record of the past 1000 years and the data quality of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He has made statistical critiques, with economist Ross McKitrick, of the hockey stick graph which shows that the increase in late 20th century global temperatures is unprecedented in the past 1,000 years.

== Early life and education ==
McIntyre, a native of Ontario, attended the University of Toronto Schools, a college-preparatory school in Toronto, finishing first in the national high school mathematics competition of 1965. He went on to study mathematics at the University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1969. McIntyre then obtained a Commonwealth Scholarship to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, graduating in 1971. Although he was offered a graduate scholarship, McIntyre decided not to pursue studies in mathematical economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

== Career ==
McIntyre started work for Noranda and worked for 30 years in the mineral business, the last part of these in the hard-rock mineral exploration as an officer or director of several public mineral exploration companies. He was the president and founder of Northwest Exploration Company Limited and a director of its parent company, Northwest Explorations Inc. When Northwest Explorations Inc. was taken over in 1998 by CGX Resources Inc. to form the oil and gas exploration company CGX Energy Inc., McIntyre ceased being a director. McIntyre was a strategic advisor for CGX in 2000 through 2003. McIntyre says that during his career his skills in statistical analysis enabled him to analyse mineral prospecting data and out-bet his rivals. He also occasionally worked as a government policy analyst, including a period at the federal Anti-Inflation Board.

Prior to 2003 he was an officer or director of several small public mineral exploration companies. He retired from full-time work, but still sometimes engaged in mining consultancy.
He is an active squash player and once won a gold medal in the World Masters Games in squash doubles.

In April 2011, Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. of Toronto, Ontario announced the appointment of McIntyre to their board of directors and then later to chairman in June 2011. In September 2011, McIntyre was appointed to the board of directors of Augen Gold Corp., which was shortly acquired by Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. in November 2011. In October 2011, McIntyre was appointed to the board of directors of Southeast Asia Mining Corp. and later resigned in May 2012. Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. was acquired by Iamgold Corporation in June 2012.

== Hockey stick graph controversy ==
In 2002, McIntyre became interested in climate science after a leaflet from the Canadian government warning of the dangers of global warming was delivered to his residence. McIntyre states that he noticed discrepancies in climate science papers that reminded him of the false prospectus that had duped investors involved in the Bre-X gold mining scandal.

The Canadian government pamphlets were based on the IPCC Third Assessment Report section, which prominently displayed the hockey stick graph based on the 1999 reconstruction by Mann, Bradley and Hughes (MBH99). McIntyre began studying Mann&#x27;s research, which had produced the graph, and met Ross McKitrick. McIntyre has remarked on how his suspicions of this graph were aroused: &quot;In financial circles, we talk about a hockey stick curve when some investor presents you with a nice, steep curve in the hope of palming something off on you.&quot;

McIntyre &amp; McKittrick&#x27;s papers were cited by Senator Jim Inhofe and Representative Joe Barton to support their political criticisms of the MBH studies, and Representative Sherwood Boehlert requested the National Academy of Sciences in the United States to arrange an investigation. The outcome was the North Report, published in 2006, which endorsed the MBH studies with a few reservations. The principal component analysis method criticised by McIntyre &amp; McKittrick had a small tendency to bias results so was not recommended, but it had little influence on the final reconstructions, and other methods produced similar results.

== ClimateAudit.org ==

McIntyre&#x27;s blog has as a recurrent topic the struggle to obtain underlying data from peer reviewed papers. McIntyre has stated that he started Climate Audit so that he could defend himself against attacks being made at the climatology blog RealClimate. An earlier website, Climate2003, provided additional information for papers co-written by McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, including raw data and source code, and comments by McIntyre. On 26 October 2004 McIntyre commented on climate2003.com, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll start blogging some odds and ends that I&#x27;m working on. I&#x27;m going to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms.&quot; On 1 December Mann and nine other scientists launched the RealClimate website. On 2 February McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the climate2003.com layout.

Climate Audit was co-winner of a 2007 Weblog Award for &quot;Best Science Blog&quot;, receiving 20,000 votes in the online poll.

=== Auditing ===
Stephen McIntyre has been highlighted by the press, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

In 2007, McIntyre started auditing the various corrections made to temperature records, in particular those relating to the urban heat island effect. He discovered a discontinuity in some U.S. records in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) dataset starting in January 2000. He emailed GISS advising them of the problem and within a couple of days GISS issued a new, corrected set of data and thanked McIntyre for &quot;bringing to our attention that such an adjustment is necessary to prevent creating an artificial jump in year 2000&quot;. The adjustment reduced the average temperatures for the continental United States by about 0.15 °C during the years 2000-2006. Changes in other portions of the record did not exceed 0.03 °C; it made no discernible difference to the global mean anomalies.

McIntyre later commented:
My original interest in GISS adjustment procedures was not an abstract interest, but a specific interest in whether GISS adjustment procedures were equal to the challenge of &quot;fixing&quot; bad data. If one views the above assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited by lack of access to source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly that the GISS software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious steps of up to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error in the course of their programming. According to any reasonable audit standards, one would conclude that the GISS software had failed this particular test. While GISS can (and has) patched the particular error that I reported to them, their patching hardly proves the merit of the GISS (and USHCN) adjustment procedures. These need to be carefully examined.

=== Role in the Climatic Research Unit controversy ===

Colby Cosh, writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, believes McIntyre&#x27;s criticisms of climate science are at the heart of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy in November–December 2009. McIntyre is mentioned over 100 times in the hacked Climatic Research Unit (CRU) emails. In the emails, one climate researcher dismisses him as a &quot;bozo&quot;. Others speculate over his funding, and argue about whether to ignore or counterattack him, although, according to Cosh, some unnamed scientists acknowledge that his criticisms have merit.

The Associated Press analysis of the CRU e-mails stated: &quot;Some e-mails said McIntyre&#x27;s attempts to get original data from scientists are frivolous and meant more for harassment than doing good science. There are allegations that he would distort and misuse data given to him. McIntyre disagreed with how he is portrayed. &#x27;Everything that I&#x27;ve done in this, I&#x27;ve done in good faith,&#x27; he said.&quot; The independent Science Assessment Panel&#x27;s chair, Lord Oxburgh, said at a press conference that the repeated Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made by Steve McIntyre and others could have amounted to a campaign of harassment, and the issue of how FOI laws should be applied in an academic context remained unresolved.

In May 2010 BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin wrote that McIntyre &quot;arguably knows more about CRU science than anyone outside the unit — but none of the CRU inquiries has contacted him for input.&quot; In March McIntyre had submitted evidence to the Independent Climate Change Email Review (chaired by Sir Muir Russell), and points he raised were discussed in the Review report published on 7 July 2010. &quot;New Statesman&quot; named McIntyre as 32nd of its &quot;50 People Who Matter 2010&quot;, citing his role in the email controversy. It said &quot;The influence might not be positive, but there&#x27;s no doubt he has shaped the debate.&quot;

<doc id="960922" wikidata="Q71863" url="?curid=960922" title="John Tanner (Tennessee politician)">
<text>John Sumners Tanner (born September 22, 1944) is a former American politician who served as the U.S. representative for , serving from 1989 until 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Since his retirement, Tanner has served as the Vice Chairman of Prime Policy Group.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Tanner was born in Halls, Tennessee, the son of Edith Adell (Sumners) and Emerson Beck &quot;Buzz&quot; Tanner. He grew up in Union City, Tennessee. Following graduation from the University of Tennessee, he served in the United States Navy from 1968 to 1972. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1976, replacing Larry Bates, who mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge against U.S. Congressman Ed Jones.

Tanner received much of his knowledge of politics as a youth from his father E.B. &quot;Buzz&quot; Tanner who was successful in the financial and insurance business. He became a member of a highly political and influential law firm out of law school in his home town community and soon ran for office as a state legislator in the House of Representatives. He was also a relative of then House Speaker Ned McWherter, who later was elected governor twice and was an extremely powerful political force in the state, having friends on both sides of the political aisle.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
When Jones retired in 1988, Tanner won the Democratic nomination for the seat and handily defeated Republican nominee Ed Bryant, who went on to represent the neighboring 7th District from 1995 to 2003. Tanner was reelected in 1990 with no major-party opposition, a feat he repeated in 1992. In 1998, he was completely unopposed. He handily defeated Republican opponents in 1994 (the only time besides his initial election that he faced a serious or well-funded challenger), 1996, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. In 2004 and 2008, he faced James L. Hart, an avowed eugenicist. On both occasions, Hart was disavowed by the state Republican Party.

Tanner announced on December 1, 2009, that he would not seek re-election in 2010 and would retire after 11 terms in Congress. State Senator Roy Herron gave up his gubernatorial bid and ran for Tanner&#x27;s congressional seat. However, he only tallied 39.8 percent of the vote against Republican farmer Stephen Fincher. Indeed, no Democrat running in the district has cracked the 40 percent mark since Tanner left office.

===Tenure===
As a Congressman, Tanner sponsored a bill to repeal the inheritance tax (which was vetoed by President Clinton) and he is in favor of a balanced budget. It is reported that Tanner could have been appointed to the United States Senate by governor of Tennessee Ned McWherter in 1992 to replace Al Gore but he declined the offer, and Harlan Mathews was appointed as a caretaker instead. Tanner was a founder of the Blue Dog Democrats and has denied rumors that he might switch parties, and has an earned reputation as a moderate. Tanner gained notoriety during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal when it was revealed in the Starr Report that Clinton was receiving fellatio from Monica Lewinsky while on the phone with Tanner on November 15, 1995, between 9:31pm and 9:35pm.

Tanner favored balancing the federal budget and paying down the national debt. He was a strong opponent of the fiscal policies of President George W. Bush, voting against many of the tax cuts passed during his terms; yet, he was one of 43 Democrats to vote to repeal the estate tax in 2006. Tanner was one of the few Democrats in the House to vote in favor of CAFTA and has long distanced himself from the majority of his party on issues such as bankruptcy law and lawsuit reform. 

He voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, the ban on &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortions, limiting death penalty appeals, and has voted against most gun control measures. On other issues he had a more liberal voting record. He often voted with his party on separation of church and states issues, and consistently voted against the Flag Desecration Amendment. Tanner voted with the majority of his party to expand stem cell research and against renewing the controversial portions of the Patriot Act. He also supported affirmative action and public education. Tanner was firmly opposed to Bush&#x27;s attempt to reform Social Security.

In 2004, Congressman Tanner made a brief but unintended cameo appearance alongside Michael Moore in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, where Moore was trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist in the Military to go to Iraq.

He drafted a bill that would require special bipartisan commissions rather than state legislatures to redraw congressional districts when necessary due to U.S. Census count changes. It is generally believed that this bill was a response to Republican-inspired mid-decade redistricting in Texas and recent similar efforts in Colorado and Georgia.

After both his district and state chose the former first lady, Congressman Tanner endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign in April 2008.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on Europe
**Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere
*Committee on Ways and Means
**Subcommittee on Trade (Chairman)
**Subcommittee on Social Security

==Post-congressional career==
He currently works for Nashville law firm Miller &amp; Martin and the Prime Policy Group, a lobbying firm. He became chairman of the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, a non-profit group that advocates U.S. leadership in conservation programs globally, in fall of 2011.

Tanner is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. He also serves on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Betty Ann Tanner and has two children.

<text>Edwin Charles Musick (August 13, 1894 – January 11, 1938) was chief pilot for Pan American World Airways and pioneered many of Pan Am&#x27;s transoceanic routes including the famous route across the Pacific Ocean, ultimately reaching the Philippine Islands, on the &quot;China Clipper&quot;.

==Biography==
Musick was born on August 13, 1894, in St. Louis, Missouri, where his father ran a hardware store The family moved to California when Musick was 9, and he first took flight during boyhood experiments. Musick attended Los Angeles Poly for three years and continued for two years afterwards at night while working as an automobile mechanic. Musick would soon switch careers to become an aircraft mechanic in 1914 for the Glenn L. Martin Company.

In 1938, he and his wife (the former Cleo Livingston) were living in San Francisco; they had no children.

===Career===

After attending an air show at Dominguez Field in January 1910, Musick, along with a couple of friends, built his first airplane in 1912; it reached an altitude of and promptly crashed. In 1913, he learned to fly aircraft at a flight school in Los Angeles and began flying as an exhibition pilot in 1915. In June 1917 he joined the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps (later called the United States Army Air Service) in San Diego as a flight instructor for the duration of World War I, and was later transferred to airfields in Wichita Falls, Texas, and Miami, Florida. He then accepted a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Flying Corps on August 28, 1918, at Miami, Florida. After the war, he founded his own flying school in Florida and surpassed the 10,000 flying hours mark.

Musick also flew for several airlines starting in 1920–21: Aeromarine Airways, where he studied navigation, and Mitten Air Transport, shuttling between Philadelphia and Washington DC. In October 1927, Musick joined Pan American as it was just starting their operations. He made the company&#x27;s inaugural mail flight to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida, on October 28 of that year. Musick was promoted to chief pilot for Pan American&#x27;s Caribbean Division in 1930.

In 1934, Musick was chosen to make the trial flights for the new Sikorsky S-42 flying boat. During these stringent test flights, Musick collected 10 world records for seaplanes; one of the test flights was a non-stop flight of .

===Trans-Pacific &quot;Clipper&quot; flights===
Musick&#x27;s work on the trials with the Sikorsky S-42 led to him piloting the first two trans-Pacific survey routes for Pan American in 1935, laid out by Pan Am executives Juan Trippe, André Priester, and Charles Lindbergh and initially plotted by the chartered , which also carried prefabricated buildings, equipment, and supplies to establish air bases. The first survey flight from Alameda to Honolulu, landing at 10:21 am Pacific Standard Time on April 17, 1935, took 18 hours, 21 minutes, breaking a record held jointly by six Navy aircraft; the aircraft, named &quot;Pan American Clipper&quot;, carried a consignment of 10,000 letters, the first shipment of airmail to Hawaii. Flight time was extended by half an hour as the aircraft circled over Honolulu upon arrival, to the delight of onlookers. Musick commanded a six-man crew, which included navigator Fred Noonan.
The second survey flight departed Honolulu for Midway Atoll on June 15, 1935; the flight returned to Alameda on June 22. Later survey flights pushed the route to Wake Island, returning to Alameda on August 28, and Guam, returning on October 24. The Guam round-trip flight was commanded by R. O. D. Sullivan, Musick&#x27;s first officer for the April flight.
Musick also commanded the first commercial trans-Pacific flight, carrying mail to the Philippines; the Martin M-130 &quot;China Clipper&quot; departed from Alameda on November 21, 1935, and landed in Manila on November 29, 6 days, 7 hours, and 40 minutes later, logging nearly 60 hours of flight time. The aircraft flew the trans-Pacific route surveyed in the four earlier flights, with stops in Honolulu, Midway, Wake, and Guam. Compared to the first survey flight, the initial leg to Honolulu was slowed by strong headwinds and arrived after 21 hours, 13 minutes of flight time. &quot;China Clipper&quot; returned to Alameda on December 6.

He was also responsible for surveying a route to New Zealand and Australia in 1937 via Hawaii, Kingman Reef, and American Samoa. The S-42B &quot;Pan American Clipper II&quot; had arrived in Honolulu for that flight on March 18, 1937, with one of the four engines stopped due to an oil leak, requiring several days to repair. Upon his arrival in Auckland on March 29, the famously terse Musick responded to the crowd of 30,000 who had turned out the greet the flight with the brief statement &quot;We are glad to be here.&quot; On December 29, 1937 Musick, aboard the &quot;Samoan Clipper&quot;, made the first flight from New Zealand to the United States, an experimental and survey flight to Hawaii and then to San Francisco.

Because of his exploits with Pan American, Musick was one of the best known pilots of the 1930s, even making the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on December 2, 1935. He received the Harmon Trophy in 1936 to recognize the first commercial flight of &quot;China Clipper&quot;. At one point during the 1930s, Musick held more flying records than any other pilot. At the time of his death, Captain Musick had reportedly flown about two million transocean miles in airline service.

===Final flight===

Musick and his crew of six died in the crash of the Sikorsky S-42 &quot;Samoan Clipper&quot; (ex-&quot;Pan American Clipper II&quot;) near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on a cargo and survey flight returning from Auckland, New Zealand. Approximately 38 minutes after take-off on January 11, 1938, the aircraft reported an engine oil leak and Musick turned back toward Pago Pago after securing that engine. Their anticipated time of return was 8:30 am local time (GMT-11).

The final radio transmission from the crew was that they were dumping fuel to lighten the aircraft in preparation for a precautionary landing at 8:27 am; shortly afterwards, an explosion tore the aircraft apart in flight. Unnamed Pan Am officials speculated at the time that the dump valves, located underneath the wing, may have vented vaporized fuel near the engines&#x27; exhaust ports, resulting in an explosion and loss of the flying boat.

Once the aircraft had missed its planned return time, a search was launched for the aircraft; floating debris surrounded by an oil slick was found approximately 12 hours later, approximately northwest of Pago Pago by the U.S. naval seaplane tender . Debris was limited to charred pieces of the aircraft and its equipment; a Pan American Airways officer&#x27;s jacket, later identified as belonging to the radio officer, was also recovered. However, the bodies of the seven crewmen, Capt. Edwin C. Musick, First Officer Cecil Sellers, flight officer Paul S. Brunk, navigation officer Frederick J. MacLean, radio officer Thomas D. Finley, flight engineer John W. Stickrod, and mechanic John A. Brooks were never recovered. All that remained at the scene of the crash were scorched fragments of wood and metal and some papers from the log book floating about the surface.
After the crash, Pan Am abandoned plans for a base at Pago Pago and instead built a refueling station at Kanton Island, one of the Phoenix Islands in Kiribati, completing construction in July 1939. The alternate route was enabled by the arrival of the Boeing 314 Clippers, which had a longer range than the prior S-42 and M-130 Clippers.

==Legacy==
Musick Light, a lighthouse on Kanton Island, was the first structure to be dedicated for Musick, in July 1938. Musick Point in Auckland Harbour was also named after him in 1942. During World War II, a Liberty ship was christened on February 11, 1944. Musick Road at the Honolulu Airport was named in his honor.

In 2019, the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation launched a search for the wreck of &quot;Samoan Clipper&quot; in collaboration with Search, Inc. and Ocean Exploration Trust. The search, conducted from , concluded on July 20 with nothing found.

<text>NGC 6603 is an open cluster discovered by John Herschel on July 15, 1830 located in Sagittarius constellation.

Situated within the brightest part of star cloud Messier 24, it is classified by Shapley as type &quot;g&quot;. This cluster consists of about 30 stars in a field of about 5 arc minutes in diameter, and is about 9400 light years remote. Thus its linear diameter should be about 14 light years. The hottest stars are about B9 (pointing to an intermediate age of several 100 million years, an estimate of which is not known to the present author), and the brightest of photographic mag 14.

Many sources improperly identify NGC 6603 as Messier 24.

<text>James Carter Walker Jr. (born June 25, 1947) is an American actor and comedian. He portrayed James (&quot;J.J.&quot;) Evans Jr., the older son of James Evans Sr. and Florida Evans, on the CBS television comedy series &quot;Good Times&quot;. The show ran from 1974 to 1979, and Walker was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1975 and 1976 for his role as J.J. On &quot;Good Times&quot;, Walker&#x27;s character was known for his catchphrase &quot;Dyn-o-mite!&quot;, and the actor later used it in his mid-1970s TV commercials for Panasonic cassette and 8-track tape players and in a 2021–2023 public announcement for Medicare. Walker also starred in &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1975) with John Amos, and &quot;The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened&quot; (1977) with James Earl Jones. Walker continues to tour the country with his stand-up comedy routine.

==Early life==
Walker was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in the Bronx. He attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in New York City. Through a New York State funded program known as &quot;SEEK&quot; (Search for Education, Evaluation, and Knowledge), he continued his studies and entered into the field of radio engineering with WRVR. As a young man, Walker was a vendor at Yankee Stadium, starting with the 1964 World Series.

==Career==
In 1967, Walker began working full-time with WRVR, the radio station of the Riverside Church. In 1969, Walker began performing as a stand-up comedian and was eventually discovered by the casting director for &quot;Good Times&quot;, after making appearances on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh In&quot; and on the &quot;Jack Paar Show&quot;. He eventually released one stand-up comedy album during the height of his &quot;Good Times&quot; popularity: &quot;Dyn-o-mite&quot; on Buddah Records (5635). During &quot;Good Times&quot;&#x27; 1974–75 season, Walker was 26 years old, though his character was much younger. John Amos, the actor who portrayed Walker&#x27;s father on &quot;Good Times&quot;, was actually just eight years older than Walker.

Walker credits producer/director John Rich for inventing &quot;Dyn-o-mite!&quot; which Rich insisted Walker say on every episode. Both Walker and executive producer Norman Lear were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and Walker&#x27;s character caught on with the audience.

Off- and on-camera, Walker did not get along with the series&#x27; lead, Esther Rolle, because she and Amos disapproved of Walker&#x27;s increasingly buffoonish character and his popularity, and Walker felt hurt by their disdain. Dissatisfaction led Amos (before Rolle), to leave the show, making Walker the star of the show. Walker was the only &quot;Good Times&quot; star to not attend Rolle&#x27;s funeral.

==Later career==
During 1975 Walker was also a weekend personality on contemporary R&amp;B music station KAGB 103.9 FM licensed to Inglewood in the Los Angeles market.
