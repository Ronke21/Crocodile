<text>Point Barrow or Nuvuk is a headland on the Arctic coast in the U.S. state of Alaska, northeast of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow). It is the northernmost point of all the territory of the United States, at , south of the North Pole. (The northernmost point on the North American mainland, Murchison Promontory in Canada, is farther north.)

==Geography==
Point Barrow is an important geographical landmark, marking the limit between two marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean, the Chukchi Sea to the west and the Beaufort Sea to the east.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that Point Barrow was occupied by the ancestors of the Iñupiat for almost 1,000 years prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. Occupation continued into the 1940s. The headland is an important archaeological site, yielding burials and artifacts associated with the Thule culture, including uluit and bola. The waters off Point Barrow are on the bowhead whale migration route and it is surmised, that the site was chosen to make hunting easier. There are also burial mounds in the area, at the nearby Birnirk site, associated with the earlier Birnirk culture, a pre-Thule culture first identified in 1912 by Vilhjalmur Stefansson while excavating in the area. The settlement was called Nuvuk, and it was near the &quot;migration path of bowhead whales which would become the cultural and nutritional centre of Nuvuk life.&quot;

Point Barrow was named in 1826 by English explorer Frederick William Beechey for Sir John Barrow, a statesman and geographer of the British Admiralty. The water around it is normally ice-free for two or three months a year, but this was not the experience of the early explorers. Beechey could not reach it by ship and had to send a ship&#x27;s boat ahead.

In 1826, John Franklin tried to reach it from the east, but was blocked by ice.

In 1837, Thomas Simpson walked 50 miles west to Point Barrow after his boats were stopped by ice.

In 1849, William Pullen rounded it in two whale boats after sending two larger boats back west because of the ice.

Point Barrow has been a jumping-off point for many Arctic expeditions, including the 1926 Wilkins Detroit Arctic Expedition and the April 15, 1928, Eielson–Wilkins flight across the Arctic Ocean to Spitsbergen.
On August 15, 1935, an airplane crash killed aviator Wiley Post and his passenger, the entertainer Will Rogers, at the Rogers–Post Site, 33 km (20.5 mi) southwest of Point Barrow.

In 1946, William C. Trimble of the State Department discussed an alternate offer of land in Point Barrow, as part of a $100 million in gold bullion offer to Denmark to purchase Greenland. Had the Alaska trade occurred, from 1967 Denmark would have benefited from Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the richest petroleum discovery in American history.

In 1988, gray whales were trapped in the ice at Point Barrow, which attracted attention from the public worldwide. The Iñupiat do not hunt gray whales and joined in rescue operation &quot;Operation Breakthrough&quot;, which also involved Soviet icebreakers.

==Demographics==

Point Barrow first appeared in the 1880 U.S. census as the unincorporated Inuit village of &quot;Kokmullit&quot; (AKA Nuwuk). All 200 residents were Inuit. In 1890, it returned as Point Barrow, which also included the Refuge &amp; Whaling Station and native settlements of Nuwuk, Ongovehenok and winter village on &quot;Kugaru&quot; (Inaru) River. It reported 152 residents, of which 143 were Native American, eight were &quot;other race&quot; and one was white. It did not report in 1900, but appeared again from 1910-1940. It has not reported separately since.

Barrow, a city of 5,000, changed its name to Utqiagvik, its Inupiaq name, on December 1, 2016.

<text>Raj Bhavan is the official residence of the governor of Karnataka located in Bengaluru city, in the State of Karnataka, India. Constructed in the late 19th century.

==History==
Formerly known as the Bengaluru Residency Mysuru state residency or, simply, residency. It is located in the capital city of Bengaluru, Karnataka. During Mysore Kingdom, the building was home to the Resident or Commissioner that was in subsidiary alliance with the Kingdom of Mysore.

Situated at the highest point in Bangalore, High Grounds (3031 feet above sea level), it was built by Sir Mark Cubbon between 1840 and 1842 when he was the Commissioner of Mysore territories of the British. After Cubbon left in 1861, the bungalow was put up for sale and purchased by the succeeding commissioner, Lewin Bentham Bowring, using government funds, and became the official residence of the Commissioner.

A ballroom was constructed in 1874 when the King Edward VII, Prince of Wales, visited India. It was named &#x27;Serapis Room&#x27; after the ship which brought the Prince to Mumbai. Many changes were made to the building during its existence in the British Raj. In 1881, when power over the territory was transferred back to the Mysore royal family, the office of the Commissioner was abolished.

==Post 1947==
The building became the official residence of the Resident and came to be called the Residency till the Independence of India (15 August 1947) when the Residency was abolished. The Constitution of Independent India created the office of the &quot;Raj Pramukh&quot; (Governor). The Maharaja of Mysore was made the first Raj Pramukh of Mysore. Although the Residency was converted to the official residence of the Raj Pramukh, the Maharaja of Mysore chose not to stay there, preferring his own palaces at Bangalore and Mysore. Hence, the Residency was converted to a state guesthouse by the Government of India. State guests such as the President of India, the Vice President of India, central government ministers and chief ministers of other states stayed at the Residency. The Chief Minister of Karnataka hosted parties at the Residency. On Independence Day and Republic Day, parties were hosted by the Raj Pramukh, a tradition that has continued till now.

The Residency was also used by the Congress party for its legislature party meetings.

During Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s visit to India, his wife Eleanor Roosevelt stayed at the Residency.

In 1964, the then Maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar, became the Governor of Madras, and relinquished his gubernatorial post in Mysore. General S M Srinagesh succeeded him, and moved into the Raj Bhavan. It has been the residence of the Governor of the state since.

Originally a single storeyed building, the Raj Bhavan was expanded by the addition of a first floor in 1967, built carefully to adhere to the architectural style of the original structure.

The art collection comprises paintings of a variety of Indian schools of art, as well as some from the West.

The residence is surrounded by beautiful gardens stretching over . The garden is fringed with century old pine and fir trees, and has an artificial waterfall.

<doc id="972208" wikidata="Q1433373" url="?curid=972208" title="Other (philosophy)">
<text>In philosophy, the Other is a fundamental concept referring to anyone or anything perceived as distinct or different from oneself. This distinction is crucial for understanding how individuals construct their own identities, as the encounter with &quot;otherness&quot; helps define the boundaries of the &quot;self.&quot; 

In phenomenology, the Other plays a particularly important role in this self-formation, acting as a kind of mirror against which the self is reflected and understood. The Other is not simply a neutral observer but an active participant in shaping the individual&#x27;s self-image. This includes the idea of the &quot;Constitutive Other,&quot; which refers to the internal relationship between a person&#x27;s essential nature (personality) and their physical embodiment (body), reflecting the interplay of internal differences within the self.

Beyond this individual level, the concept of &quot;the Other&quot; extends to broader social and political contexts. &quot;Otherness&quot; describes the qualities and characteristics attributed to individuals or groups perceived as outside the dominant social norm. This can include differences based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other marker of social identity. The process of &quot;Othering&quot; or &quot;Otherizing&quot; involves labeling and defining individuals or groups as &quot;the Other,&quot; often in ways that reinforce power imbalances and lead to marginalization, exclusion, and even discrimination. This act of Othering can effectively place those deemed &quot;different&quot; at the margins of society, denying them full participation and access to resources. Therefore, the concept of the Other is not just a philosophical abstraction but a powerful force shaping social relations and individual experiences.

==Background==
===Philosophy===

The concept of the Self requires the existence of the constitutive Other as the counterpart entity required for defining the Self. Accordingly, in the late 18th century, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of self-consciousness (preoccupation with the Self), which complemented the propositions about self-awareness (capacity for introspection) proffered by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814).

John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) introduced the idea of the other mind in 1865 in &quot;An Examination of Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s Philosophy&quot;, the first formulation of the other after René Descartes (1596–1650). 

Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as the basis for intersubjectivity, the psychological relations among people. In &quot;Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology&quot; (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an &quot;alter ego&quot;, as an &quot;other self&quot;. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.

In &quot;Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology&quot; (1943), Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person&#x27;s life, and not as a radical threat to the existence of the Self. In that mode, in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949), Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel&#x27;s dialectic of the &quot;Lord and Bondsman&quot; (&quot;Herrschaft und Knechtschaft&quot;, 1807) and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society&#x27;s treatment and mistreatment of women.

The question of why one exists as themselves and not as someone else has been called the vertiginous question by Benj Hellie, and the &quot;even harder problem of consciousness&quot; by Tim S. Roberts. Various philosophers have argued that the existence of first-person perspectives has a number of philosophical implications. Christian List argues that first-person perspectives are evidence against physicalism, and evidence against reality being metaphysically united. Vincent Conitzer argues for a connection between the existence of the self and A series and B series theories of time. Egocentric presentism and perspectival realism are ideas posed by Caspar Hare that posit that first-person perspectives imply a weak form of solipsism. Japanese philosopher Hitoshi Nagai has used the concept of first person perspectives as a way of defining the self, defining the self as the &quot;one who directly experiences the consciousness of oneself&quot;.

Daniel Kolak argues that the entire concept of the &quot;self&quot; being distinct from the &quot;other&quot; is incoherent. In his book &quot;I am You&quot;, Kolak uses the terms &quot;closed individualism&quot;, &quot;empty individualism&quot;, and &quot;open individualism&quot; to describe three contrasting philosophical views of the self. Kolak argues that closed individualism, the idea that one&#x27;s personal identity consist of a line persisting from moment to moment, is incoherent, and there is no basis for the belief in a future self and that one is the &quot;same&quot; person from moment to moment. Empty individualism is the idea that personal identity exists, but one&#x27;s identity only exists as a &quot;time slice&quot; existing for an infinitesimally small amount of time. Open individualism is the view advocated by Kolak, in which the self in reality does not actually exist at all, similar to anattā in Buddhist philosophy. Derek Parfit makes similar arguments in his book &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;, in which he argues that the teletransportation paradox challenges the notion of a continuous personal identity.

===Psychology===
The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) and the philosopher of ethics Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the constitutive Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with the symbolic order of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of scripture and tradition; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the face-to-face encounter (wherein a person is morally responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely metaphysical pure-presence. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of alterity) personified in a representation created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas&#x27;s analysis of the distinction between &quot;the saying and the said&quot;; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of ethics over metaphysics.

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. R. D. Laing), the Other identifies and refers to the unconscious mind, to silence, to insanity, and to language (&quot;to what is referred and to what is unsaid&quot;). Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to relativism if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of truth. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce ontological divisions of reality: of being, of becoming, and of existence.

===Ethics===

In &quot;Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority&quot; (1961), Emmanuel Lévinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the constitutive Other to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute &quot;alterity&quot;—the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network, into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over ontology in real life.

From that perspective, Lévinas described the nature of the Other as &quot;insomnia and wakefulness&quot;; an ecstasy (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, the Otherness of the person remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Lévinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

===Critical theory===
Jacques Derrida said that the absolute &quot;alterity&quot; of the Other is compromised, because the Other person is &quot;other than&quot; the Self and the group. The logic of &quot;alterity&quot; (otherness) is especially negative in the realm of human geography, wherein the native Other is denied ethical priority as a person with the right to participate in the geopolitical discourse with an empire who decides the colonial fate of the homeland of the Other. In that vein, the language of Otherness used in Oriental Studies perpetuates the cultural perspective of the dominantor–dominated relation, which is characteristic of hegemony; likewise, the sociologic misrepresentation of &quot;the feminine&quot; as the sexual Other to man reasserts male privilege as the primary voice in social discourse between women and men.

In &quot;The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq&quot; (2004), the geographer Derek Gregory said that the US government&#x27;s ideologic answers to questions about reasons for the terrorist attacks against the U.S. (i.e. 11 September 2001) reinforced the imperial purpose of the negative representations of the Middle-Eastern Other; especially when President G. W. Bush (2001–2009) rhetorically asked: &quot;Why do they hate us?&quot; as political prelude to the War on Terror (2001). Bush&#x27;s rhetorical interrogation of armed resistance to empire, by the non–Western Other, produced an Us-and-Them mentality in American relations with the non-white peoples of the Middle East; hence, as foreign policy, the War on Terror is fought for control of imaginary geographies, which originated from the fetishised cultural representations of the Other invented by Orientalists; the cultural critic Edward Saïd said that:

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, post-colonial world system of nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European imperial system of economic and settler colonies in which &quot;the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on domination and subordination.&quot; In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires &quot;provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony].&quot;

=== Racism ===
The racialist perspective of the Western world during the 18th and 19th centuries was invented with the Othering of non-white peoples, which also was supported with the fabrications of scientific racism, such as the pseudo-science of phrenology, which claimed that, in relation to a white-man&#x27;s head, the head-size of the non-European Other indicated inferior intelligence; e.g. the apartheid-era cultural representations of coloured people in South Africa (1948–94).

Consequent to the Holocaust (1941–1945), with documents such as &quot;The Race Question&quot; (1950) and the &quot;Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&quot; (1963), the United Nations officially declared that racial differences are insignificant to anthropological likeness among human beings. Despite the United Nations&#x27; factual dismissal of racialism, institutional Othering in the United States produces the cultural misrepresentation of political refugees as &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; (from overseas) and of immigrants as &quot;illegal aliens&quot; (usually from México).

===Orientalism===
To European people, imperialism (military conquest of non-white people, annexation, and economic integration of their countries to the motherland) was intellectually justified by (among other reasons) orientalism, the study and fetishization of the Eastern world as &quot;primitive peoples&quot; requiring modernisation, the civilising mission. Colonial empires were justified and realised with essentialist and reductive representations (of people, places, and cultures) in books and pictures and fashion, which conflated different cultures and peoples into the binary relation of the Orient and the Occident. Orientalism created the artificial existence of the Western Self and the non–western Other. Orientalists rationalised the cultural artifice of a difference of essence between white and non-white peoples to fetishize (identify, classify, subordinate) the peoples and cultures of Asia into &quot;the Oriental Other&quot;—who exists &quot;in opposition to&quot; the Western Self. As a function of imperial ideology, Orientalism fetishizes people and things in three actions of cultural imperialism: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are one folk); (ii) Feminization (the Oriental always is subordinate in the East–West relation); and (iii) Essentialization (a people possess universal characteristics); thus established by Othering, the empire&#x27;s cultural hegemony reduces to inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, as measured against the West, the standard of superior civilisation.

===Subaltern native===
Colonial stability requires the cultural subordination of the non-white Other for transformation into the subaltern native; a colonised people who facilitate the exploitation of their labour, of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country. The practise of Othering justifies the physical domination and cultural subordination of the native people by degrading them—first from being a national-citizen to being a colonial-subject—and then by displacing them to the periphery of the colony, and of geopolitical enterprise that is imperialism.

Using the false dichotomy of &quot;colonial strength&quot; (imperial power) against &quot;native weakness&quot; (military, social, and economic), the coloniser invents the non-white Other in an artificial dominator-dominated relationship that can be resolved only through racialist &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, the &quot;moral responsibility&quot; that psychologically allows the colonialist Self to believe that imperialism is a civilising mission to educate, convert, and then culturally assimilate the Other into the empire—thus transforming the &quot;civilised&quot; Other into the Self.

In establishing a colony, Othering a non-white people allowed the colonisers to physically subdue and &quot;civilise&quot; the natives to establish the hierarchies of domination (political and social) required for exploiting the subordinated natives and their country. As a function of empire, a settler colony is an economic means for profitably disposing of two demographic groups: (i) the colonists (surplus population of the motherland) and (ii) the colonised (the subaltern native to be exploited) who antagonistically define and represent the Other as separate and apart from the colonial Self.

Othering establishes unequal relationships of power between the colonised natives and the colonisers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they othered into racial inferiority, as the non-white Other. That dehumanisation maintains the false binary-relations of social class, caste, and race, of sex and gender, and of nation and religion. The profitable functioning of a colony (economic or settler) requires continual protection of the cultural demarcations that are basic to the unequal socio-economic relation between the &quot;civilised man&quot; (the colonist) and the &quot;savage man&quot;, thus the transformation of the Other into the colonial subaltern.

==Gender and sex==

===LGBT identities ===
The social exclusion function of Othering a person or a social group from mainstream society to the social margins—for being essentially different from the societal norm (the plural Self)—is a socio-economic function of gender. In a society wherein man–woman heterosexuality is the sexual norm, the Other refers to and identifies lesbians (women who love women) and gays (men who love men) as people of same-sex orientation whom society has othered as &quot;sexually deviant&quot; from the norms of binary-gender heterosexuality. In practise, sexual Othering is realised by applying the negative denotations and connotations of the terms that describe lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, in order to diminish their personal social status and political power, and so displace their LGBT communities to the legal margin of society. To neutralise such cultural Othering, LGBT communities &quot;queer&quot; a city by creating social spaces that use the spatial and temporal plans of the city to allow the LGBT communities free expression of their social identities, e.g. a boystown, a gay-pride parade, etc.; as such, &quot;queering&quot; urban spaces is a political means for the non-binary sexual Other to establish themselves as citizens integral to the reality (cultural and socio-economic) of their city&#x27;s body politic.

=== &quot;Woman&quot; as identity ===
The philosopher of feminism, Cheshire Calhoun identified the female Other as the female-half of the binary-gender relation that is the Man and Woman relation. The deconstruction of the word &quot;Woman&quot; (the subordinate party in the Man &quot;and&quot; Woman relation) produced a conceptual reconstruction of the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition, as rationalised by patriarchy. That the female Other is a self-aware Woman who is autonomous and independent of the patriarchy&#x27;s formal subordination of the female sex with the institutional limitations of social convention, tradition, and customary law; the social subordination of women is communicated (denoted and connoted) in the sexist usages of the word &quot;Woman&quot;.

In 1949, the philosopher of existentialism, Simone de Beauvoir applied Hegel&#x27;s conception of &quot;the Other&quot; (as a constituent part of self-awareness) to describe a male-dominated culture that represents Woman as the sexual Other to Man. In a patriarchal culture, the Man–Woman relation is society&#x27;s normative binary-gender relation, wherein &quot;the sexual Other&quot; is a social minority with the least socio-political agency, usually the women of the community, because patriarchal semantics established that &quot;a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] &quot;Man&quot; to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] &quot;Woman&quot; represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity&quot; from the first sex, from Man.

In 1957, Betty Friedan reported that a woman&#x27;s social identity is formally established by the sexual politics of the Ordinate–Subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation, the social norm in the patriarchal West. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves by their social roles (wife, mother, lover) in the private sphere of life; and did not identify themselves by their own achievements (job, career, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had acted conventionally, and automatically identified and referred to themselves as the social Other to men.

Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society&#x27;s social constructs (social class, sex, gender), as a human organisation, society holds the socio-political power to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and &quot;Woman&quot;, the sexual Other, who is not male.

In feminist definition, women are the Other to men (but not the Other proposed by Hegel) and are not existentially defined by masculine demands; and also are the social Other who unknowingly accepts social subjugation as part of subjectivity, because the gender identity of woman is constitutionally different from the gender identity of man. The harm of Othering is in the asymmetric nature of unequal roles in sexual and gender relations; the inequality arises from the social mechanics of intersubjectivity.

==Knowledge==
===Cultural representations===
About the production of knowledge of the Other who is not the Self, the philosopher Michel Foucault said that Othering is the creation and maintenance of imaginary &quot;knowledge of the Other&quot;—which comprises cultural representations in service to socio-political power and the establishment of hierarchies of domination. That cultural representations of the Other (as a metaphor, as a metonym, and as an anthropomorphism) are manifestations of the xenophobia inherent to the European historiographies that defined and labelled non–European peoples as the Other who is not the European Self. Supported by the reductive discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) of the empire&#x27;s dominant ideology, the colonialist misrepresentations of the Other explain the Eastern world to the Western world as a binary relation of native weakness against colonial strength.

In the 19th-century historiographies of the Orient as a cultural region, the Orientalists studied only what they said was the high culture (languages and literatures, arts and philologies) of the Middle East, but did not study that geographic space as a place inhabited by different nations and societies. About that Western version of the Orient, Edward Saïd said that:

In so far as the Orient occurred in the existential awareness of the Western world, as a term, The Orient later accrued many meanings and associations, denotations, and connotations that did not refer to the real peoples, cultures, and geography of the Eastern world, but to Oriental studies, the academic field about the Orient as a word.

===Academia===
In the Eastern world, the field of Occidentalism, the investigation programme and academic curriculum of and about the essence of the West—Europe as a culturally homogeneous place—did not exist as a counterpart to Orientalism. In the postmodern era, the Orientalist practices of historical negationism, the writing of distorted histories about the places and peoples of &quot;The East&quot;, continues in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice Othering with fabricated facts about threat-reports and non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to politically delegitimise opponent political parties composed of people from the social and ethnic groups designated as the Other in that society.

The Othering of a person or of a social group—by means of an ideal ethnocentricity (the ethnic group of the Self) that evaluates and assigns negative, cultural meaning to the ethnic Other—is realised through cartography; hence, the maps of Western cartographers emphasised and bolstered artificial representations of the national-identities, the natural resources, and the cultures of the native inhabitants, as culturally inferior to the West.

Historically, Western cartography often featured distortions (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of places and true distances by placing the cartographer&#x27;s homeland in the centre of the &quot;mapamundi&quot;; these ideas were often utilized to support imperialistic expansion. In contemporary cartography, the polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by U.S. cartographers, also frequently feature distorted spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia which according to historian Jerome D. Fellman emphasise the perceived inferiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) of the Russian Other.

===Practical perspectives===

In &quot;Key Concepts in Political Geography&quot; (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and as a term within phenomenology; as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, &quot;the colonizing powers narrated an &#x27;Other&#x27; whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize . . . [in order to] extract resources through colonization&quot; of the country whose people the colonial power designated as the Other. As facilitated by Orientalist representations of the non–Western Other, colonization—the economic exploitation of a people and their land—is misrepresented as a civilizing mission launched for the material, cultural, and spiritual benefit of the colonized peoples.

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, postmodern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as phenomenological and ontological progress for Man and Society. Public knowledge of the social identity of peoples classified as &quot;Outsiders&quot; is &quot;de facto&quot; acknowledgement of their being real, thus they are part of the body politic, especially in the cities. As such, &quot;the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of difference that moves sites once conceived of as &#x27;marginal&#x27; to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis&quot; of the human relations between the Outsiders and the Establishment.

<doc id="972209" wikidata="Q3282273" url="?curid=972209" title="Celebrity Poker Showdown">
<text>Celebrity Poker Showdown is an American celebrity game show that aired on the cable network Bravo from 2003 to 2006. It was a limited-run series in which celebrities played poker, with eight tournaments during its five-season run.

In each show, five celebrities played a no limit Texas hold &#x27;em tournament for charity. The winners of each qualifying game won a silver commemorative poker chip and advanced to the championship game. The winner of the championship game won the grand prize for his or her charity as well as a gold commemorative poker chip. Each tournament featured 25 celebrities and consisted of six episodes, five qualifying games and one championship game.

In an interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, host Dave Foley said that a ninth tournament is not being produced, as Bravo did not order any new episodes.

==Setup, logistics, and personalities==
The first seven tournaments were taped at the Palms Casino in Paradise, Nevada in front of a live studio audience. With the eighth tournament, Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment became the &quot;official casino of Celebrity Poker Showdown.&quot;

When a player was eliminated, he or she moved to the &quot;Loser&#x27;s Lounge&quot; to watch the rest of the game. With the move to New Orleans for the eighth tournament, the Lounge was renamed for sponsor Southern Comfort as the &quot;SoCo Lime Lounge&quot;.

The first series was hosted by actor/comedian Kevin Pollak; the episodes of that run were an hour in length, except for the Championship telecast, which was two hours in length. In 2004, the show expanded all episodes to two hours in length and Dave Foley took over hosting duties. Most episodes of his run were two hours in length, and only one episode (the Championship telecast of the fifth tournament) was an hour in length. Professional poker player Phil Gordon provided the color commentary for the first seven tournaments. Phil Hellmuth took over the commentary spot in the eighth tournament.

All the games were officiated by Tournament Director Robert Thompson. Thompson used the catchphrase &quot;Shuffle up and deal!&quot;

Several celebrities appeared in multiple tournaments, and five won games in separate tournaments. David Cross won in the first and third tournaments; Dulé Hill won in the second and seventh; Kevin Nealon won in the fourth and seventh; Jason Alexander won in the fifth and eighth; and Michael Ian Black won in the second and eighth tourneys. No celebrity won more than one championship game.

The series was produced by Andrew Hill Newman and Joshua Malina.

==Tournament winnings==
The first six tournaments were played for a total of $250,000 in prize money as follows:
* The four players eliminated in each of the first 5 games: $5,000 each
* Fifth Place in the Championship: $7,500
* Fourth Place in the Championship: $10,000
* Third Place in the Championship: $12,500
* Second Place in the Championship: $20,000
* First Place in the Championship: $100,000

Starting with the Seventh Tournament, the &quot;prize pool&quot; was increased to $1,000,000 and divided as follows:
* The four players eliminated in each of the first 5 games: $5,000 each
* Fifth Place in the Championship: $25,000
* Fourth Place in the Championship: $75,000
* Third Place in the Championship: $100,000

==Post-show poker==
Some of the celebrities on this series have parlayed their game play into visits onto the World Poker Tour and the World Series of Poker. In 2005, Brad Garrett, Shannon Elizabeth, Nicholas Gonzalez, and James Woods all participated in the WSOP&#x27;s $10,000 Texas Hold-Em Main Event. In 2007, Shannon Elizabeth advanced to the semifinals of the NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship.

In 2005, prior to appearing on the show, Jennifer Tilly won a WSOP Gold Bracelet for coming in first in the Ladies&#x27; No-Limit Texas Hold &#x27;Em event, and won the third annual WPT Ladies Invitational Tournament.

==Parodies==
For the December 10, 2005 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Foley and Gordon lent their voices (playing themselves) to a Robert Smigel animated TV Funhouse parody called &quot;Celebrity Mugshot Poker,&quot; where, as the title suggests, various celebrities (like Nick Nolte and James Brown) are represented by animated versions of their infamous mugshots.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; also did a parody of this show on the season 29 episode hosted by &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; star Megan Mullally as Tammy Faye Messner, with Phil Gordon played by Chris Parnell and comedian Kevin Pollak played by Jimmy Fallon.

&quot;MADtv&quot; did a parody of this show as a ninth and tenth season recurring sketch called &quot;Celebrity Quarters&quot; (based on the drinking game &quot;quarters&quot;) with Ron Pederson as Dave Foley and, replacing Phil Gordon, was Nick Nolte (played by Ike Barinholtz) with various celebrities (like Anna Nicole Smith played by Stephnie Weir and Kathy Griffin played by Nicole Parker).

For the November 3, 2005 episode of the sitcom &quot;Joey&quot;, Foley and Gordon played themselves in a fictitious tournament in which the character of Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc) participates based on bad advice and incorrect rules from his neighbor, Alex, who is trying to sabotage his efforts. This includes a so-called &quot;Texas Earthquake&quot; that occurs when one card of each suit is present in the face-up community cards, during which Joey believes that players jump onto the table and attempt to steal chips from their opponents.

<text>The 1952 Winter Olympics, officially known as the &quot;VI Olympic Winter Games&quot;, took place in Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February 1952. A total of 694 athletes representing 30 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Games, taking part in 22 events from 6 sports.

From the thirteen NOCs that collected at least one medal, eight secured at least one gold. Ten NOCs won more than one medal, and among these, Norway was the most successful with sixteen medals, including seven golds. The United States (eleven medals, four golds) and Finland (nine medals, three golds) finished second and third in the medal table, respectively.

Norway&#x27;s Hjalmar Andersen and Germany&#x27;s Mirl Buchner were the top medal winners, with three medals each. The Netherlands got its first Winter Olympics medals, when Kees Broekman and Wim van der Voort won three silver medals between them in speed skating. Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic Games debuts in Oslo, but neither nation won a medal.

==Highlights==
Oslo was the first Scandinavian city to host a Winter Olympics. Athletes from the host nation won more medals than any other nation. Truck driver Hjalmar Andersen won three out of the four speed skating events, and Simon Slåttvik and Sverre Stenersen won gold and bronze in nordic combined. Ski jumpers Arnfinn Bergmann and Torbjørn Falkanger placed first and second, and only Swedish jumper Karl Holmström prevented a Norwegian sweep.

After a 16-year hiatus from Olympic competition Germany made a triumphant return, winning seven medals and three golds. They won gold medals in both two- and four-man bobsleigh events. The results for both events were identical with the United States and Switzerland taking silver and bronze. The other gold medal for Germany went to the husband and wife figure skating pair of Paul and Ria Falk, who won the mixed pairs competition. Mirl Buchner of Germany was the only other triple medalist when she won three medals in alpine skiing, placing second in the downhill and third in the slalom and giant slalom.

Wim van der Voort from the Netherlands placed second in the 1,500 meter speed skating events and his countryman Kees Broekman placed second in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races. These were the first-ever Dutch medals at the Winter Olympics. Great Britain&#x27;s lone medal was won by Jeannette Altwegg, who became only the second British woman to win the ladies&#x27; figure skating competition. Dick Button and James Grogan of the United States won gold and bronze in the men&#x27;s figure skating event. Button became the first figure skater to land a triple jump in competition when he performed the triple loop in the men&#x27;s free skate program.

Finnish athletes won nine medals and three golds at the Games. They dominated the cross-country events, winning eight out of a possible twelve medals. A women&#x27;s race was added to the cross-country program for the first time and Finnish skiers Lydia Wideman, Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen swept the event. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men&#x27;s race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold.

The ice hockey tournament was won by Canada. Their gold medal game against the United States ended in a tie, and International rules at the time did not allow for overtime, so the gold medal was awarded to Canada on goal differential. Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey tournament thus far, but in 1956 the Soviet team entered the competition and ended Canadian dominance.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

There was a tie for third place in the men&#x27;s 500-metre event in speed skating, therefore two bronze medals were awarded.


==Notes==
* The IOC medal table currently shows medals won by both &quot;Germany&quot; and &quot;Federal Republic of Germany (1950–1990, GER since)&quot;, which have been combined here. The official report for these Games refers to Germany, not West Germany or FRG.

<text>Streamlining the cities: Government proposals for reorganising local government in Greater London and the Metropolitan counties was a government white paper issued in 1983, by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher which led to the abolition of the Greater London Council (GLC) and the metropolitan county councils (MCCs).

The white paper argued that most local services in Greater London and in the six metropolitan counties, were provided by the London boroughs, and by the Metropolitan district councils. Specifically, GLC and the MCCs only provided 16% and 26% of services in their areas respectively - however the shire county councils provided 87% of services in their areas. The white paper concluded therefore, that the latter&#x27;s existence could be justified, whereas the GLC and the MCCs could not. It was also claimed that the GLC and the MCCs were profligate. The white paper concluded that the GLC and the MCCs should be abolished and replaced by a system of joint boards, to take over some of the county council&#x27;s functions. The white paper&#x27;s proposals were largely implemented in the Local Government Act 1985. However, this was controversial as the GLC and MCCs were controlled by the Labour Party and led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics.

<text>Amy Heckerling (born May 7, 1954) is an American writer, producer, and director. Heckerling started out her career after graduating from New York University and entering the American Film Institute, making small student films. Heckerling is a recipient of AFI&#x27;s Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal celebrating her creative talents and artistic achievements. She struggled to break out into big films up until the release of her breakout film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982). 

She has also directed the films &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;National Lampoon’s European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;Look Who’s Talking&quot; (1989), &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), &quot;I Could Never be Your Woman&quot; (2007) and &quot;Vamps&quot; (2012). She was also a producer on &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998) and executive producer on &quot;Molly&quot; (1999). Many of Heckerling’s films were adapted as television series. &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; evolved into the series &quot;Fast Times&quot; (1986), while &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) became a television series that ran from 1996 to 1999.

==Early life and education==
Heckerling was born on May 7, 1954, in The Bronx, New York City, to a bookkeeper mother and an accountant father. She had a Jewish upbringing and remembers that the apartment building where she spent her early childhood was full of Holocaust survivors. &quot;Most of them had tattoos on their arms and for me there was a feeling that all of these people had a story to tell. These were interesting formative experiences.&quot; Both of her parents worked full-time, so she frequently moved back and forth from her home in the Bronx, where Heckerling claims she was a latchkey kid sitting at home all day watching television, to her grandmother&#x27;s home in Brooklyn which she enjoyed much better. Here, she frequented Coney Island and stayed up watching films all night with her grandmother. At this time Heckerling loved television, where she watched numerous cartoons and old black and white movies. Her favorites were gangster movies, musicals and comedies. She had a particular fondness for James Cagney.

After her father passed his CPA exam, the family became more financially stable and moved to Queens, where Heckerling felt more out of place than ever. She did not get along with other kids in her school there, nor did she want to continue to be classmates with them through high school, so she enrolled at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan. On her first day of school there, Heckerling realized that she wanted to be a film director. During their first assignment, writing about what they wanted to do in life, Heckerling wrote that she wanted to be a writer or artist for &quot;Mad&quot;. She noticed that a boy next to her, that she claimed copied from her papers later on, wrote that he wanted to be a film director.

She graduated from high school in 1970, focused on directing and studying film at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts. Her father made just slightly over the cut-off for financial aid for the school, so Heckerling had to take out a large loan to cover her expenses. She claims this caused considerable stress in her life, and she was unable to pay them off until the end of her twenties. When Heckerling was in high school and focused on directing, her father was opposed to the idea, wishing that she had chosen a more practical aspiration. Despite this, he gave her Parker Tyler&#x27;s book &quot;Classics of the Foreign Film: A Pictorial Legacy&quot;. Heckerling pored over the book, marking off films that she had seen until she had eventually watched most of them. She claims that by the time she got to NYU, because of this book, she had seen almost all of the films that they had to watch in her classes. 

Though Heckerling considered her time at NYU to be a great time where she learned a lot and made great connections, such as Martin Brest and noted screenwriter and satirist Terry Southern who was one of her professors, she later reflects on her time at the school as sloppy and unprofessional, claiming that she used very low-quality equipment and had a lot of technical problems. During her time at NYU, Heckerling was making mostly musicals. &quot;I was the only one doing them and they were weird. It was the mid-70s and it was a bizarre combination of long hair with bell bottoms, the tail end of the hippie movement at its schlumpiest. With this, I sort of infused a 1930s idiotic grace that didn&#x27;t go with the post-Watergate mentality that was prevalent at the time. They were weird films, but they got me into AFI.&quot;

==Career==
After graduating from NYU, Heckerling decided that she wanted to follow her friend Martin Brest to the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles where she felt there would be more opportunities to break into the business. Heckerling experienced severe culture shock upon moving to LA from NYC, especially because NYC&#x27;s public transportation had made it unnecessary for her to learn to drive. When she did eventually learn, she adjusted to LA life and started working. Her first studio job was lip-syncing dailies for a television show, where she started making connections in the business.

During her second year at AFI, Heckerling made her first short film, &quot;Getting it Over With&quot;, about a girl that wants to lose her virginity before she turns twenty and the adventures she has before midnight of her twentieth birthday. Heckerling continued to work on the film after she graduated from AFI with her MFA, using the editing studios at night to finish the project after work. As soon as she finished the edit and sent it away to be processed, she was in a car collision with a drunk driver who hit the side of her car, landing her in the hospital with a collapsed lung, bruised kidney, and mild amnesia, causing her to be fired from her editing job because she could not remember where certain footage was.

When asked about film&#x27;s ability to grant a form of immortality, Heckerling describes the experience during the accident: &quot;There was the whole thing-the yellow light and all that stuff-and what went through my mind right then was, &#x27;Well, at least I got the film to the lab.&#x27; So it&#x27;s not going to save you from anything, obviously, but something about it pulls you forward.&quot; Eventually, she finished the film and held a screening that gained a very positive response, causing Heckerling to call it one of the best days of her life. Her next step was to use the film to get a job. Thom Mount, president of Universal Pictures, showed a lot of interest in Heckerling but because she was not backed by an agent they could not hire her. After months of struggling to find an agent, Mount called Heckerling up on the phone and asked her to make a film.

===Feature films===

====1980s====
Heckerling&#x27;s first feature was &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), based on the non-fiction account of a year in the life of California high school students as observed by undercover &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Cameron Crowe. When Heckerling first signed on to do a feature for Universal, she read a lot of scripts, but it was Crowe&#x27;s script for &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; that stood out to her. Although she loved the script, she felt that it bore the marks of excessive studio interference, so she read the novel, determined which parts were strongest, and sat down with Crowe to rework the script. The film helped launch the careers of numerous stars including Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. 

In addition, it marks early appearances by several actors who later became stars, including Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, and Anthony Edwards. Most notable, however, is the appearance of Sean Penn as Jeff Spicoli, who was launched into stardom by his performance. Heckerling describes casting Penn, whom she first met while he was sitting on the floor outside of the casting office, as a feeling of being overwhelmed by his intensity, even though all he had done was look up at her. She knew that this was her Spicoli, even though they had seen other people who had read better for the role. Ally Sheedy read for the role of Leigh&#x27;s character Stacy Hamilton, but Heckerling decided that she wanted someone that seemed younger and more fragile (though Jennifer Jason Leigh is more than four months older than Ally Sheedy).

Heckerling was discriminating about the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Originally, the film was supposed to have music in it by bands like the Eagles. &quot;I guess a lot of people like that stuff, but being young as I was at the time, I really wanted a new edgy eighties music soundtrack. I wanted Fear, Oingo Boingo, The Go-Gos, Talking Heads, and the Dead Kennedys. I was one of those obnoxious teenagers that thought that the music I liked was great and everything else sucked. Getting that Oingo Boingo song in the film was a big fight. But I had to make some compromises and put in some songs that I didn&#x27;t like at all.&quot;

The studio was unsure of how to market the film, and Heckerling guesses that they did not think that anyone would want to watch it. The studio decided to just open it in a few hundred or so theaters on the west coast without any advertisement. Once the film opened, it was a huge success so the studio quickly opened it at theaters around the country. It became an instant hit right out of the gate, eventually going on to become a pop culture touchstone. The film earned $27,092,880 at the box office in the USA. It also spawned a short-lived series on CBS called &quot;Fast Times&quot;, with Heckerling writing, directing and producing.

After doing &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, Heckerling was bombarded with similar but lesser scripts. It was hard for her to find anything that wasn&#x27;t about high school, preppy kids, or story about a girl losing her virginity. Eventually she found her next film. &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), with Michael Keaton, Joe Piscopo, Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, and Peter Boyle, was an &quot;Airplane!&quot;-style spoof of gangster movies, but it failed to catch fire at the box office upon its initial release. Heckerling attributes the film&#x27;s failure to the public&#x27;s lack of familiarity with the gangster movies that the film was poking fun at. &quot;It was pure satire of something nobody remembers. I think that was the main problem, because all the actors and writers did great jobs. But we were definitely satirizing something ... I mean, unless you watch 1930s movies on TV at night, people don&#x27;t remember. Somebody told me that during a screening they were sitting next to Brian De Palma, who had just done &quot;Scarface&quot;, and he was in hysterics. If you studied those movies, you know what we were doing.&quot; In subsequent years, however, it has garnered a substantial cult audience.

The following year, she directed &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985) with Chevy Chase and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, a sequel to the popular &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. With it, Heckerling scored her second solid hit, earning $74,964,621 at the box office. The film, like many of Heckerling&#x27;s films, received poor reviews from critics but proved to be very popular with audiences. Heckerling, despite being well educated and loving the work of such intellectual writers as Franz Kafka, has admitted that she loves &quot;silly things,&quot; which has proven to make her commercially successful in the comedy genre.

In 1989, Heckerling had her biggest success with &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;, starring John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and a baby voiced by Bruce Willis. Heckerling got the idea for the film while she was pregnant with her daughter and developed it into a feature. Heckerling says that she loves to write comedies, such as &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;, because she notes that when a film is made, everyone working on it puts more than a year of their lives into making it, so she wants that year to be happy and fun. Heckerling, who loved Travolta, was ecstatic to work with him, though many people consider the film&#x27;s release to be during the end of a low point in Travolta&#x27;s career. The film has been Heckerling&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date, earning $296,999,813. After the film&#x27;s release, Heckerling was able to cross off the second of two goals that she had set for herself in college, the first being to make a studio feature, which she did with &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, and the second being: &quot;I wanted to have hits the way boys had hits, not like a &#x27;girl hit&#x27; that made 50 million, but a boy hit that made 100s of million.&quot;

====1990s====
Two &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; sequels would follow—1990&#x27;s &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot;—also directed by Heckerling and co-written with her then-husband Neal Israel. The film added another baby to the storyline and was a moderate success. Heckerling then produced, but did not direct, the third and final sequel, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot;—a flop. The films also spawned a brief television show called &quot;Baby Talk&quot; that was largely written by Heckerling.

In 1995, she wrote and directed &quot;Clueless&quot;, reworking and updating Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot; as a 1990s teen comedy about wealthy teenagers living in Beverly Hills. Heckerling originally thought of &quot;Clueless&quot; as a television show because she loved to write the character of Cher who she described as a &quot;happy, optimistic, California girl&quot;, and wanted to explore all of her adventures, but after she pitched it to her agent she was told that it would make a great feature. To research for the script, Heckerling sat in on classes at Beverly Hills High School where she observed how teenagers acted, though she admits that most of it was made up. She notes that teenagers at the high school did not dress in high fashion every day as the characters do in the film and that in reality the students there dressed just as frumpily as everyone else. She did, however draw on many of her observations, especially the tendency of teenage girls to groom themselves constantly. &quot;You would think that within, you know, the few minutes that they&#x27;ve been in class, that their makeup wouldn&#x27;t be needing so much repair and yet they&#x27;re constantly painting and sculpting and ... doing to themselves.&quot; 

As with &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, it quickly caught on with teenagers and went on to become a significant pop culture reference point. The film went on to gross $56,631,572 and helped launch the careers of most of the cast, including Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Donald Faison, Breckin Meyer, and Stacey Dash. It was spun off into a moderately successful TV series, with Heckerling penning the pilot, as well as directing several episodes from the first season. Heckerling describes the show as basically the same as the film, only cleaner, and says that she still loves the characters.

====2000–present====
Heckerling directed and produced &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), a romantic college comedy with Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. The film was not a critical or commercial success. After a break, Heckerling&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;I Could Never Be Your Woman&quot; (2007), starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd, never opened in theaters; rather, it received a direct-to-video release domestically, despite fairly good notices. Production of the film was troubled by financial issues, including the rights to distribution being sold off without Heckerling&#x27;s knowledge, making it difficult for her to sell the film to a studio. At the time, Heckerling was also taking care of both of her parents who were very ill (her father was in the hospital and her mother had cancer). Though Heckerling dislikes the baggage that the film carries and is upset about it not being released theatrically, she says that the experience was significant for her because she loved working with Rudd and Pfeiffer in England. Heckerling also directed an episode of the NBC version of &quot;The Office&quot;.

In 2011, Heckerling directed the horror-comedy film &quot;Vamps&quot; with Sigourney Weaver, Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter, about two vampires living in New York City as best friends and roommates. The film was released to theatres on November 2, 2012, followed by a DVD release on November 13. On July 4, 2016, Gilbert Gottfried posted an in-depth 81-minute interview with Heckerling on his podcast. In July 2017, a musical version of &quot;Clueless&quot; helmed by Tony nominee Kristin Hanggi received a developmental lab in New York City. A previous workshop starring Taylor Louderman (&quot;Kinky Boots&quot;) and Dave Thomas Brown (&quot;Heathers&quot;) took place in 2016. Heckerling wrote the libretto for the musical. The musical opened Off-Broadway on November 20, 2018 with Dove Cameron in the lead role.

== Filmmaking style ==
Heckerling&#x27;s films have been characterized as having a proto-feminist perspective. Heckerling focuses on the female life at pivotal turning points. With films such as &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), Heckerling has focused on women finishing high school and going into what would be their adult lives. Her characters are constantly going against the norms that women are pushed into within society. Heckerling has a tendency to prioritize the female friendships within her films, along with a larger discussion of gender positioning within teenagers&#x27; lifestyles.

==Personal life==
Heckerling dated friend and fellow film director Martin Brest briefly when she first moved to Los Angeles. Though they later broke up, they remained good friends. Heckerling&#x27;s first marriage was to David Brandt, from 1981 to 1983. In 1984, Heckerling married director Neal Israel, but divorced in 1990.

The couple&#x27;s daughter, Mollie Israel, was born in 1985. Mollie was led to believe Israel was her biological father until 2004, when it was revealed to her that in fact Harold Ramis was her biological father. Heckerling has included Mollie in some of her films in bit parts, including &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; and &quot;Loser&quot;, though Heckerling claims that her daughter never wanted to be a &quot;girly girl&quot; and distanced herself from much of her work, never adding any input to the lives of characters such as those in &quot;Clueless&quot;. Despite this, the two get along very well and Mollie frequently introduces her mother to new music, such as OK Go, and films. 

Heckerling is not especially fond of the sycophantic nature present in the film industry. She likens the idea to a term initially coined by her brother:

===Affair with Chris Kattan===
Actor and comedian Chris Kattan claimed in his 2019 memoir &quot;Baby, Don&#x27;t Hurt Me: Stories and Scars from Saturday Night Live&quot; that he was pressured by Lorne Michaels to have sex with Heckerling so she would direct the 1998 film &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (although she ultimately only produced, rather than directed it). Heckerling&#x27;s daughter Mollie disputes his claims saying that, although Heckerling and Kattan had an affair, it occurred when the film was already shooting.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1995, Heckerling won the National Society of Film Critics Best Screenplay award and was nominated for the Writers Guild of America award for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for her screenplay, &quot;Clueless&quot;. The film was also nominated for a WGA Award for Best Screenplay. In 1998, she received the Franklin J. Schaffner Medal from the American Film Institute. In 1999, she received the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through endurance and excellence, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.

<text>Diana Canova (born Diane Canova Rivero; June 1, 1953) is an American actress, director, and professor. She is best known for her role as Corinne Tate on &quot;Soap&quot; (1977-1980).

==Early life==
Canova was born Diane Canova Rivero in West Palm Beach, Florida, to actress and singer Judy Canova and Cuban musician Filberto Rivero. She was raised in the Greater Los Angeles Area, where she graduated from Hollywood High School. Canova later studied acting at Los Angeles City College.

==Career==
Canova made her television acting debut in a 1974 episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; portraying a considerably taller date of Richie; in reality both she and Ron Howard are the same height at 5&#x27;9&quot;. She later guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; and &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and appeared in television films. In 1975, Canova co-starred in the cult movie &quot;The First Nudie Musical&quot; along with Cindy Williams. In 1976, she was a regular on &quot;Dinah and Her New Best Friends&quot; a CBS summer replacement series for The Carol Burnett Show. Canova then landed the role of Corinne Tate on &quot;Soap&quot; in 1977 opposite Katherine Helmond as her mother. She remained with the series until 1980. Canova was known for her singing, exhibited during Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Early American Christmas&quot; program in 1978. The show was filmed in Williamsburg, Virginia, featured John Wayne, and had musical numbers interwoven with storytelling. In 1979, she made an appearance on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; as nude dancer/graduate student Stephanie Wolf.

In 1980, ABC executives offered Canova her own television series starring alongside Danny Thomas in &quot;I&#x27;m a Big Girl Now&quot;. The show lasted just one season. She then co-starred on the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Foot in the Door&quot; in 1983. A few years later, she was cast as Sandy Beatty on &quot;Throb&quot;, a sitcom which was broadcast in syndication from 1986 to 1988. Between 1984 and 1996 she appeared in three episodes of the long-running TV show &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, including being featured as Maggie McCauley in 1990&#x27;s &quot;Murder: According to Maggie.&quot; In 1993, Canova co-starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Free&quot; (which also featured Marian Mercer, her co-star from &quot;Foot in the Door&quot;). Since the mid-1990s, she has mainly done voice work for cartoons in video shorts. In 1995, she played &quot;Jenny&quot; in a revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Company&quot;.

From 2015 to 2023, Canova was an adjunct professor of voice at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, and teaches private lessons. She has been working with the school systems of Easton and Redding, Connecticut, where she directs musicals and short plays as well as a high school improv troupe that performs at local charity events. Under her leadership, Joel Barlow High School&#x27;s theater program has won several awards from the Connecticut Drama Association and has set the record for winning first place two years in a row in multiple categories.

==Personal life==
Canova is married to record producer Elliot Scheiner. The couple have two children. She was married to Geoff Levin from 1976 until their divorce in 1979. Before marrying Scheiner, she and Steve Landesberg dated.

===Religion===
Canova is a former member of the Church of Scientology, an organization she has since criticized. She found the Scientologists straightforward in their desire for money, declaring in 1993 in a &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine interview, &quot;The first time I walked in those doors, they said, &#x27;Just give us all the money in your bank account&#x27;&quot;. She also criticized the Church&#x27;s counseling practice, called auditing, when she said, &quot;They&#x27;re telling you, &#x27;Don&#x27;t spend $100 an hour on a shrink&#x27;s couch, it&#x27;ll ruin your mind.&#x27; Auditing is so much better?&quot;

<text>Alrewas ( ) is a village and civil parish in the Lichfield District of Staffordshire, England.

==Geography==
The village is beside the River Trent and about northeast of Lichfield. It is located southwest of Burton-on-Trent. The parish is bounded by the Trent to the north and east, and by field boundaries to the south and west. The A38 road passes the village, which is just inside the boundary of the National Forest.

Until 2009 Alrewas was part of the civil parish of Alrewas and Fradley. Fradley had begun as a hamlet in the ancient parish of Alrewas, and the civil parish was named to reflect Fradley&#x27;s growth into a village. From 1 April 2009 Alrewas and Fradley have been two separate civil parishes. Near Alrewas are the villages of Wychnor, Barton-under-Needwood, Fradley and Kings Bromley. Diamond Bus service 12 links the village to Lichfield, Fradley and Burton.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,852.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Alrewas&quot; is derived from the Old English &quot;Alor-wæsse&quot;, meaning &quot;alluvial land growing with alder trees&quot;.
On the Staffordshire wikipedia entry, the Hand-drawn map of Stafford by Christopher Saxton from 1577 shows the name as Alderwaies. 

==Places of interest==

The A38 dual carriageway follows the line of Ryknild Street, a Roman road that linked what are now Gloucestershire and South Yorkshire.

Orgreave Hall is a brick-built country house in Alrewas parish about northwest of the village. It was built in 1668 and extended in the early 18th century.

The Trent and Mersey Canal was built between 1766 and 1777. It passes through Alrewas, where northeast of the village it has a junction with the River Trent.

The South Staffordshire Line of the South Staffordshire Railway was built through the parish in the 1840s and Alrewas railway station was opened in 1849. British Railways closed the station in 1965, but this part of the line remains open.

East of Alrewas is the National Memorial Arboretum, dedicated to remembering those lost due to warfare since the Second World War.

Chetwynd Bridge, an early cast-iron arch bridge, crosses the River Tame from neighbouring Edingale on the eastern edge of the parish.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church is All Saints in Church Lane. The oldest parts of the building are 12th-century. Some Norman work remains but much of the present building is Gothic from the 13th, 14th and 16th centuries. The font is 15th-century. The pulpit is Jacobean, made in 1639. There is a monument by Thomas White to John Turton, who died in 1707. The church was restored in 1997. All Saints&#x27; is a Grade I listed building.

The Methodist Church is in Post Office Road opposite the Crown Inn. It is a Gothic Revival brick building completed in 1928. In 1989 due to rot the roof was renewed. At the same time a new floor was laid, involving the removal of pews and organ.

==School==
All Saints Primary School is the local Church of England primary school. It is a small primary school which is only slightly more than single form entry.

==Public houses==
The village has three pubs: the Crown Inn, the George and Dragon and the William IV. The Crown is a pub and restaurant in Post Office Road. The George and Dragon is an 18th-century building in Main Street. The William IV was three cottages until the 1830s, when it was converted into a pub.

==The National Memorial Arboretum==

The National Memorial Arboretum is at Alrewas. It &quot;honours the fallen, recognises service and sacrifice, and fosters pride in our country&quot;. The Arboretum is a charity run by staff and volunteers, and part of The Royal British Legion group of charities. An Act of Remembrance, including a silence, is observed daily in the Millennium Chapel. The Arboretum receives about 300,000 visitors a year.

==Culture==
The village holds the biennial Alrewas Arts Festival every other summer. The first festival was in 2006, and it has become a much loved attraction in the village&#x27;s calendar. It is an eight-day free festival that includes workshops, performances, exhibitions and events in Alrewas village. It features local artistic and artisan talents. The workshops range from silk painting to film making. There is fund raising including auctions and sales in the intermediate 2-year period to meet the festival&#x27;s costs. It culminates in a Sunday daytime to evening event of live music, comedy and interactive arts in Alrewas Park that attracts thousands of party-goers from surrounding villages and towns.

Each year the village hosts the Alrewas Show, which is a registered charity. It includes a walking carnival procession (formerly driven floats), galloping acrobatics, a falconry display, miniature steam display, Punch and Judy show, livestock display, fairground rides and attractions, trade stands, historic cars, farm machinery and music.

<text>Brighton is a former town and current neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, located in the northwestern corner of the city. It is named after the English city of Brighton. Initially Brighton was part of Cambridge, and known as &quot;Little Cambridge&quot;. Brighton separated from Cambridge in 1807 after a bridge dispute, and was annexed to Boston in 1874. For much of its early history, it was a rural town with a significant commercial center at its eastern end.

The neighborhood of Allston was also formerly part of the town of Brighton, but is now often considered to be separate, leading to the name Allston–Brighton for the combined area. This historic center of Brighton is the Brighton Center Historic District. The Aberdeen section of Brighton was designated as a local architectural conservation district by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 2001.

==History==
In 1630, land comprising present-day Allston–Brighton and Newton was assigned to Watertown. In 1634, the Massachusetts Bay Colony transferred ownership of the south side of the Charles River, including present-day Allston–Brighton and Newton, from Watertown to Newtowne, which was soon renamed Cambridge. In 1646, Reverend John Eliot established a &quot;Praying Indian&quot; village on the present Newton–Brighton boundary, where resided local natives converted to Christianity. The first permanent English settlement came as settlers crossed the Charles River from Cambridge, establishing Little Cambridge, the area&#x27;s name before 1807.

Before the American Revolutionary War, Little Cambridge became a small, prosperous farming community with fewer than 300 residents. Its inhabitants included wealthy Boston merchants such as Benjamin Faneuil (after whom a street in Brighton is named). A key event in the history of Allston–Brighton was the establishment in 1775 of a cattle market to supply the Continental Army. Jonathan Winship I and Jonathan Winship II established the market, and in the post-war period that followed, the Winships became the largest meat packers in Massachusetts. The residents of Little Cambridge resolved to secede from Cambridge when the latter&#x27;s government made decisions detrimental to the cattle industry and also failed to repair the Great Bridge linking Little Cambridge with Cambridge proper. Legislative approval for separation was obtained in 1807, and Little Cambridge renamed itself Brighton.

In 1820, the horticulture industry was introduced to the town. Over the next 20 years, Brighton blossomed as one of the most important gardening neighborhoods in the Boston area. Its businessmen did not neglect the cattle industry, however. In 1834, the Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad was built, solidifying the community&#x27;s hold on the cattle trade. By 1866, the town contained 41 slaughterhouses, which later were consolidated into the Brighton Stock Yards and Brighton Abattoir.

In October 1873, the Town of Brighton in Middlesex County voted to annex itself to the City of Boston in Suffolk County, and in January 1874 Brighton officially became part of the City of Boston. Allston–Brighton&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the next 50 years, rising from 6,000 in 1875 to 47,000 by 1925.

==Transportation==
Brighton is accessible via the B branch of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)&#x27;s Green Line light rail service, which has 11 stops along Commonwealth Avenue in Brighton, terminating at the Boston College stop at the western edge of Brighton. Cleveland Circle on the C branch is located in the southern tip of Brighton, and Reservoir station on the D branch is located one block to the south. The former A branch of the Green Line, (discontinued in 1969), also served the community. Brighton is also served by MBTA bus routes , , , , , , , , and , as well as Boston Landing station on the MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham/Worcester Line.

A rape victim, comic book artist Lisa Roberts is given the runaround by the New York City Police Department. Tired of city life, she heads for the wide open spaces of Arizona. Not long afterward, she is propositioned by lowlife Randall Atkins. She reports this to sympathetic local policeman Steve Smith, who replies matter-of-factly that this is not the first time that Atkins has been accused of a sexual offense.

To her amazement, Roberts is later visited by Atkins, who agitatedly warns her not to trust the sweet-natured policeman. Someone is lying about something, and Roberts plainly does not know what to believe. When she finds out, it is nearly too late.

<text>Capgemini SE is a French multinational information technology (IT) services and consulting company, headquartered in Paris, France.

==History==
Capgemini was founded by Serge Kampf in 1967 as an enterprise management and data processing company. The company was founded as the &quot;Société pour la Gestion de l&#x27;Entreprise et le Traitement de l&#x27;Information&quot; (Sogeti).

In 1974, Sogeti acquired Gemini Computer Systems, an American company based in New York. In 1975, having made two major acquisitions of CAP (Centre d&#x27;Analyse et de Programmation) and Gemini Computer Systems, and following the resolution of a dispute with the similarly named CAP UK over the international use of the name &#x27;CAP&#x27;, Sogeti renamed itself as CAP Gemini Sogeti.

Cap Gemini Sogeti launched US operations in 1981, following the acquisition of Milwaukee-based DASD Corporation, specializing in data conversion and employing 500 people in 20 branches throughout the US. Following this acquisition, The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.

In 1990 Cap Gemini Sogeti acquired the Hoskyns Group, a major IT outsourcing and managed services company in the UK.

In 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini, and the firm launched a new group logo. All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini.

Ernst &amp; Young Consulting was acquired by Cap Gemini in 2000. It simultaneously integrated Gemini Consulting to form Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young. In 2017, Cap Gemini S.A. became Capgemini SE, and its Euronext ticker name similarly changed from CAP GEMINI to CAPGEMINI.

In 2018, they acquired the Philadelphia-based digital customer engagement company LiquidHub for to assist Capgemini&#x27;s digital and cloud growth in North America. Earlier Capgemini acquisitions included Kanbay for $1.2 billion and iGate for $4 billion.

In 2019, Capgemini acquired Altran, the largest acquisition in the company&#x27;s history, bringing the total employee count to over 250,000. As part of the acquisition, Capgemini acquired frog design and Cambridge Consultants, which were integrated into Capgemini Invent; several other recent acquisitions in the design and digital space, including staff from Fahrenheit 212, Idean, and June21, have been merged into this group and operate under the frog brand.

In June 2021, Capgemini partnered with Sanofi, Orange &amp; Generali to launch Future4care, a European start-up accelerator focused on digital healthcare. In 2021, Capgemini acquired RXP Services and Acclimation in Australia to expand their operations in Australia. Also in 2021, Capgemini acquired Australian company Empired and its New Zealand subsidiary Intergen.

As of 2024, Capgemini has over 338,000 employees in approximately 50 countries, with around 194,400 in India.

In May 2020, Aiman Ezzat succeeded Paul Hermelin as CEO. Paul Hermelin continues as chairman of the board of directors.

==Capgemini and the public sector in France==
In December 2022, the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company was alleged, amongst other accusations, to have benefitted in France from special access and favorable government treatment, including the awarding of lucrative government contracts. The French media dubbed the scandal the &quot;McKinsey Affair&quot;. Subsequently, a French Senate Committee of Inquiry investigated the growing influence of private consulting firms on public policy.

In February 2022 Senator Éliane Assassi questioned each consulting firm on their activities on specific projects. She raised in particular the case of a former employee of the Capgemini group, who had been appointed as head of the Elysée correspondence service. The service subsequently contracted Capgemini to reorganize its digital tools, with the aim of setting up a system to automate mail reading to produce reports. &quot;Is it not embarrassing, from your point of view, that a former employee of Capgemini is responsible for reviewing the correspondence service of the Élysée?&quot;, the senator asked. &quot;It is not up to us to have an opinion on who, within the client organization, triggers this type of service&quot;, replied Mathieu Dougados, executive director, and he suggested the commission ask the Élysée.

Etienne Grass, director of public sector activities at Capgemini also participated. He was a former classmate of Emmanuel Macron (French president at the time of the scandal), and former chief of cabinet of a government minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. Etienne Grass commented: &quot;In principle, our employees are not intended to be recruited&quot;, and for good reason: &quot;when it happens, it puts us in a complex situation&quot;, he admitted. However, the firm makes an exception vis-à-vis the State, by not applying certain contractual clauses which prevent an employee from joining a client, &quot;provided that an ethical framework has been fixed&quot;, the director underlined.

In June 2022, published a survey of the significant lucrative projects carried out by Capgemini for the French public sector entitled &quot;Consulting firms: Capgemini, the expensive service provider that the State can no longer do without&quot;. The name of Etienne Grass, head of the &quot;public sector&quot; market unit of Capgemini Invent since 2017, was mentioned.

<text>Giuseppe Terragni (; 18 April 1904 – 19 July 1943) was an Italian architect who worked primarily under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and pioneered the Italian modern movement under the rubric of Rationalism. His most famous work is the Casa del Fascio built in Como, northern Italy, which was begun in 1932 and completed in 1936;
it was built in accordance with the International Style of architecture and frescoed by abstract artist Mario Radice. In 1938, at the behest of Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government, Terragni designed the Danteum, an unbuilt monument to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri structured around the formal divisions of his greatest work, the Divine Comedy.

==Biography==
Giuseppe Terragni was born to a prominent family in Meda, Lombardy. He attended the Technical College in Como then studied architecture at the Politecnico di Milano university. In 1927 he and his brother Attilio opened an office in Como. They remained in practice until Giuseppe&#x27;s death during the war years.

A pioneer of the modern movement in Italy, Terragni produced some of its most significant buildings. A founding member of the fascist Gruppo 7 and a leading Italian Rationalist, Terragni fought to move architecture away from neo-classical and neo-baroque revivalism. In 1926 he and other progressive members of Gruppo 7 issued the manifesto that made them the leaders in the fight against revivalism.

In a career that lasted only 13 years, Terragni created a small but remarkable group of designs; most of them were built in Como, which was one of the centers of the Modern Movement in Italy. These works form the nucleus of the language of Italian rationalist or modernistic architecture. Terragni was also one of the leaders of the artistic group called &quot;astrattisti comaschi&quot; with Mario Radice and Manlio Rho, one of the most important events in Italian Modern Art. He also contributed to the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution.

In his last designs, Terragni achieved a more distinctive Mediterranean character through the fusion of modern theory and tradition.

His brother, Attilio, was the Fascist Podestà (mayor) of Como when the Casa del Fascio was commissioned, and his chief architectural patron was one of Mussolini&#x27;s mistresses. His career was sidetracked by Italy&#x27;s entry into World War II, where he was part of the Italian army sent to the Eastern Front. After the Italians collapsed near Stalingrad, Terragni produced drawings of the suffering around him and suffered a nervous breakdown. Terragni returned to Como where he died of thrombosis in 1943.

<doc id="972242" wikidata="Q5159293" url="?curid=972242" title="Conditions comorbid to autism">
<text>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or simply autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in early childhood, persists throughout adulthood, and is characterized by difficulties in social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. There are many conditions comorbid to autism, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and epilepsy.

In medicine, comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions co-occurring with the primary one, or the effect of such additional disorders. Distinguishing between ASD and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASD often overlap with symptoms of other disorders, and the characteristics of ASD make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult.

Autism is associated with several genetic disorders, perhaps due to an overlap in genetic causes. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, a category referred to as syndromic autism.

Approximately 8 in 10 people with autism suffer from a mental health problem in their lifetime, in comparison to 1 in 4 of the general population that suffers from a mental health problem in their lifetimes.
==Comorbid conditions==

===Abnormal folate metabolism===
Several lines of evidence indicate abnormalities of folate metabolism in ASD. These abnormalities can lead to a decrease in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate production, alter the production of folate metabolites and reduce folate transport across the blood-brain barrier and in neurons. The most significant abnormalities of folate metabolism associated with ASD may be autoantibodies to the alpha folate receptor (FRα). These autoantibodies have been associated with cerebral folate deficiency. Autoantibodies can bind to FRα and greatly impair its function.

In 2013, one study reported that 60% and 44% of 93 children with ASD were positive for FRα-blocking and binding autoantibodies, respectively. This high rate of anti-FRα autoantibody positivity was confirmed by Ramaekers et al. who compared 75 children with ASD to 30 non-autistic &quot;controls&quot;. These controls were children who had a developmental delay, but did not have ASD. FRα-blocking autoantibodies were positive in 47% of children with ASD, but only in 3% of children without ASD.

Many children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency have marked improvements in their clinical status when taking folinic acid.

A series of five children with cerebral folate deficiency and low functioning autism with neurological deficits found a complete reduction of ASD symptoms with the use of folinic acid in a child and substantial improvements in communication in two other children.

===Abnormal redox metabolism===
An imbalance in glutathione-dependent redox metabolism has been shown to be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Glutathione synthesis and intracellular redox balance are related to folate metabolism and methylation, metabolic pathways that have also been shown to be abnormal in ASD. Together, these metabolic abnormalities define a distinct endophenotype of TSA closely associated with genetic, epigenetic and mitochondrial abnormalities, as well as environmental factors related to ASD. Glutathione is involved in neuroprotection against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation by improving the antioxidant stress system.

In autistic children, studies have shown that glutathione metabolism can be improved:

* Subcutaneously by injection of methylcobalamin (a form of B12). 
* Oral folinic acid. 
* A vitamin and mineral supplement that includes antioxidants, coenzyme Q10 and vitamins B. 
* Tetrahydrobiopterin.

Interestingly, recent DBPC studies have shown that N-acetyl-1-cysteine, a glutathione precursor supplement, is effective in improving the symptoms and behaviors associated with ASD. However, glutathione was not measured in these studies.

Small, medium and large DPBC trials and open small and medium-sized clinical trials demonstrate that new treatments for children with ASD for oxidative stress are associated with improvements in baseline symptoms of ASD, sleep, gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperactivity, seizures and parental impression, sensory and motor symptoms. These new treatments include N-acetyl-l-cysteine, methylcobalamin with and without oral folinic acid, vitamin C, and a vitamin and mineral supplement that includes antioxidants, enzyme Q10, and B vitamins.

Several other treatments that have antioxidant properties, including carnosine, have also been reported to significantly improve ASD behaviors, suggesting that treatment of oxidative stress could be beneficial for children with ASD. Many antioxidants can also help improve mitochondrial function, suggesting that clinical improvements with antioxidants could occur through a reduction in oxidative stress and an improvement in mitochondrial function.

Some of these treatments can have frequent serious side effects (bronchospasm, etc. ...).

===Anxiety===
Anxiety disorders are common among children and adults with ASD. Symptoms are likely affected by age, level of cognitive functioning, degree of social impairment, and ASD-specific difficulties. Many anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, are not commonly diagnosed in people with ASD because such symptoms are better explained by ASD itself, and it is often difficult to tell whether symptoms such as compulsive checking are part of ASD or a co-occurring anxiety problem. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in children with ASD has been reported to be anywhere between 11% and 84%; the wide range is likely due to differences in the ways the studies were conducted.

A systematic review summarized available evidence on interventions to reduce anxiety in school children with autism spectrum disorder. Of the 24 studies reviewed, 22 used a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. The review found that CBT was moderately to highly effective at reducing anxiety in school children with autism spectrum disorder, but that effects varied depending on whether they were reported by clinicians, parents or self-reported. Treatments involving parents and one-on-one compared to group treatments were more effective.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
The diagnosis manual DSM-IV did not allow the co-diagnosis of ASD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, following years of clinical research, the DSM-5 released in 2013 removed this prohibition of co-morbidity. Thus, individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also have a diagnosis of ADHD, with the modifiers of a predominantly inattentive, hyperactive, combined, or not otherwise specified presentation. Clinically significant symptoms of these two conditions commonly co-occur, and children with both sets of symptoms may respond poorly to standard ADHD treatments. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may benefit from additional types of medications. The term AuDHD is sometimes used for those with both autism and ADHD. There are also studies suggesting noticeable differences in presenting symptoms by gender which can complicate diagnosis, especially in adulthood.

===Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder ===

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding or eating disorder in which individuals significantly limit the volume or variety of foods they consume, causing malnutrition, weight loss, and psychosocial problems. A 2023 review concluded that &quot;there is considerable overlap between ARFID and autism,&quot; finding that 8% to 55% of children diagnosed with ARFID were autistic. Unlike eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, body image disturbance is not a root cause. Individuals with ARFID may have trouble eating due to the sensory characteristics of food (appearance, smell, texture, or taste); executive function disregulation; fears of choking or vomiting; low appetite; or a combination of these factors.

===Bipolar disorder===
Bipolar disorder, or manic-depression, is itself often claimed to be comorbid with a number of conditions, including autism. Autism includes some symptoms commonly found in mood and anxiety disorders.

===Bowel disease===
Gastrointestinal symptoms are a common comorbidity in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), even though the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms reported by proprietary tool developed and administered by Mayer, Padua, and Tillisch (2014) are abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea and bloating, reported in at least 25 percent of participants. Carbohydrate digestion and transport is impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, which is thought to be attributed to functional disturbances that cause increased intestinal permeability, deficient enzyme activity of disaccharides, increased secretin-induced pancreatico-biliary secretion, and abnormal fecal flora Clostridia taxa. Altered gastrointestinal function accompanied by pain may induce feeding issues and increase perceived negative behaviors, including self injury, in individuals with autism.

===Brain fog===
Brain fog is a constellation of symptoms that include reduced cognition, inability to concentrate and multitask, as well as loss of short- and long-term memory. Brain fog can be present in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Its prevalence, however, remains unknown.

=== Depression ===
Major depressive disorder has been shown by several studies to be one of the most common comorbid conditions in those with ASD, and is thought to develop and occur more in high-functioning individuals during adolescence, when the individual develops greater insight into their differences from others. In addition, the presentation of depression in ASDs can depend on the level of cognitive functioning in the individual, with lower functioning children displaying more behavioral issues and higher functioning children displaying more traditional depressive symptoms.

A 2019 meta-analysis identified autistic people as being four times more likely to have depression than non-autistic people, with approximately 40% of autistic adults having depression.

===Developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia)===
The initial accounts of Asperger syndrome and other diagnostic schemes include descriptions of developmental coordination disorder. Children with ASD may be delayed in acquiring motor skills that require motor dexterity, such as bicycle riding or opening a jar, and may appear awkward or &quot;uncomfortable in their own skin&quot;. They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, other hand/dexterity impairments, or problems with visual-motor integration, visual-perceptual skills, and conceptual learning. They may show problems with proprioception (sensation of body position) on measures of developmental coordination disorder, balance, tandem gait, and finger-thumb apposition.

===Epilepsy===
ASD is also associated with epilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder. One in four autistic children develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence. Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a &quot;blackout&quot;), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG can help confirm the seizure&#x27;s presence. Typically, onset of epilepsy occurs before age five or during puberty, and is more common in females and individuals who also have a comorbid intellectual disability.

===Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder===
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a common disorder that can mimic the signs of ASD. Although results from studies are mixed, it is estimated that 2.6% of children with an FASD have an ASD as well, a rate almost two times higher than that reported in the general US population.

===Fragile X syndrome===
Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. If one child has Fragile X, there is a 50% chance that boys born to the same parents will have Fragile X (see Mendelian genetics). Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.

===Gender dysphoria===

Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis given to transgender people who experience discomfort related to their gender identity. Autistic people are more likely to experience gender dysphoria. Around 20% of gender identity clinic-assessed individuals reported characteristics of ASD.

===Hypermobility spectrum disorder and Ehlers–Danlos syndromes===
Studies have confirmed a link between hereditary connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) with autism, as a comorbidity and a co-occurrence within the same families.

===Intellectual disability===
The fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%. This wide variation illustrates the difficulty of assessing intelligence in autistic individuals. For example, a 2001 British study of 26 autistic children found only about 30% with intelligence in the normal range (IQ above 70), 50% with a mild to moderate intellectual disability, and about 20% with a severe to profound intellectual disability (IQ below 35). For ASD other than autism the association is much weaker: the same study reported typical levels of intelligence in about 94% of 53 children with PDD-NOS. Estimates are that 40–69% of individuals with ASD have some degree of an intellectual disability, with females more likely to be in severe range of an intellectual disability. Learning disabilities are also highly comorbid in individuals with an ASD. Approximately 25–75% of individuals with an ASD also have some degree of learning disability, although the types of learning disability vary depending on the specific strengths and weaknesses of the individual.

A 2006 review questioned the common assumption that most children with autism have an intellectual disability. It is possible that the association between an intellectual disability and autism is not because they usually have common causes, but because the presence of both makes it more likely that both will be diagnosed.

The CDC states that based on information from 11 reporting states 46% of people with autism have above 85 IQ.

===Mitochondrial diseases===
The central player in bioenergetics is the mitochondrion. Mitochondria produce about 90% of cellular energy, regulate cellular redox status, produce ROS, maintain homeostasis, synthesize and degrade high-energy biochemical intermediates, and regulate cell death through activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). When they fail, less and less energy is generated within the cell. Cell injury and even cell death follow. If this process is repeated throughout the body, whole organ systems begin to fail.

Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect multiple organs with varying severity. Symptoms may be acute or chronic with intermittent decompensation. Neurological manifestations include encephalopathy, stroke, cognitive regression, seizures, cardiopathies (cardiac conduction defects, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc...), diabetes, visual and hearing loss, organ failure, neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy.

The prevalence estimates of mitochondrial disease and dysfunction across studies ranging from about 5 to 80%. This may be, in part, due to the unclear distinction between mitochondrial disease and dysfunction. Mitochondrial diseases are difficult to diagnose and have become better known and detected. Studies indicating the highest rates of mitochondrial diagnosis are usually the most recent.

Some drugs are toxic to mitochondria. These can trigger or aggravate dysfunctions or mitochondrial diseases.

* Antiepileptics:
Valproic acid (also used in various other indications) and phenytoin are the most toxic. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, ethosuximide, zonisamide, topiramate, gabapentin and vigabatrin are also.

* Other types of drugs:
Corticosteroids (such as cortisone), isotretinoin (Accutane) and other vitamin A derivatives, barbiturates, certain antibiotics, propofol, volatile anesthetics, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, some local anesthetics, statins, fibrates, glitazones, beta blockers, biguanides, amiodarone, some chemotherapies, some neuroleptics, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and various other drugs.

=== Neurofibromatosis type I ===
ASD is also associated with neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1). NF-1 is a complex multi-system human disorder caused by the mutation of a gene on chromosome 17 that is responsible for production of a protein, called neurofibromin 1, which is needed for normal function in many human cell types. NF-1 causes tumors along the nervous system which can grow anywhere on the body. NF-1 is one of the most common genetic disorders and is not limited to any person&#x27;s race or sex. NF-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that mutation or deletion of one copy (or allele) of the NF-1 gene is sufficient for the development of NF-1, although presentation varies widely and is often different even between relatives affected by NF-1.

===Neuroinflammation and immune disorders===
The role of the immune system and neuroinflammation in the development of autism is controversial. Until recently, there was scant evidence supporting immune hypotheses, but research into the role of immune response and neuroinflammation may have important clinical and therapeutic implications. The exact role of heightened immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with autism is uncertain, but may be a primary factor in triggering and sustaining many of the comorbid conditions associated with autism. Recent studies indicate the presence of heightened neuroimmune activity in both the brain tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with autism, supporting the view that heightened immune response may be an essential factor in the onset of autistic symptoms. A 2013 review also found evidence of microglial activation and increased cytokine production in postmortem brain samples from people with autism.

===Neuropathies===
The prevalence of peripheral neuropathies would be significantly increased in ASD. Peripheral neuropathies may be asymptomatic. Peripheral neuropathy is a common manifestation of mitochondrial diseases and polyneuropathies would be relatively common. Neuropathies could also be caused by other features of ASD.

===Neurotransmitter anomalies===

Nonverbal learning disorder is a proposed category of neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core deficits in non-verbal skills, especially visual-spatial processing. People with this condition have normal or advanced verbal intelligence and significantly lower nonverbal intelligence. See for sources and more info.

===Nonverbal learning disorder===
Nonverbal learning disorder is a proposed category of neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core deficits in non-verbal skills, especially visual-spatial processing. People with this condition have normal or advanced verbal intelligence and significantly lower nonverbal intelligence.

=== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ===
Obsessive–compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent obsessive thoughts or compulsive acts. About 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders also have OCD.

=== Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder ===
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a cluster C personality disorder characterized by a general pattern of excessive concern with orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, mental and interpersonal control and a need for control over one&#x27;s environment which interferes with personal flexibility, openness to experience and efficiency as well as interfering with relationships.

There are considerable similarities and overlap between autism and OCPD, such as list-making, inflexible adherence to rules and obsessive aspects of routines, though the latter may be distinguished from OCPD especially regarding affective behaviors, bad social skills, difficulties with theory of mind and intense intellectual interests e.g. an ability to recall every aspect of a hobby. A 2009 study involving adult autistic people found that 40% of those diagnosed with autism met the diagnostic requirements for a co-morbid OCPD diagnosis.

=== Psychosis and schizophrenia ===

Childhood-onset schizophrenia is preceded by childhood autistic spectrum disorders in almost half of cases, and an increasing number of similarities are being discovered between the two disorders.

Studies have also found that the presence of psychosis in adulthood is significantly higher in those with autism spectrum disorders, especially those with PDD-NOS, than in the general population. This psychosis generally occurs in an unusual way, with most individuals with ASD experiencing a highly atypical collection of symptoms. Recent studies have also found that the core ASD symptoms also generally present in a slightly different way during the childhood of the individuals that will later become psychotic, long before the actual psychosis develops.

===Reduced NMDA‐receptor function===
Reduced NMDA receptor function has been linked to reduced social interactions, locomotor hyperactivity, self-injury, prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits, and sensory hypersensitivity, among others. Results suggest that NMDA dysregulation could contribute to core ASD symptoms.

=== Schizoid personality disorder ===
Schizoid personality disorder (SPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment and apathy. Other associated features include stilted speech, a lack of deriving enjoyment from most, if not all, activities, feeling as though one is an &quot;observer&quot; rather than a participant in life, an inability to tolerate emotional expectations of others, apparent indifference when praised or criticised, a degree of asexuality and idiosyncratic moral or political beliefs. Symptoms typically start in late childhood or adolescence.

Several studies have reported an overlap, confusion or comorbidity with Asperger syndrome (which has been combined with autism spectrum disorder and no longer appears as a diagnostic label in the DSM-5). Asperger syndrome was at one time called &quot;schizoid disorder of childhood&quot;. Eugen Bleuler coined the term &quot;autism&quot; to describe withdrawal to an internal fantasy, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance.

In a 2012 study of a sample of 54 young adults with Asperger syndrome, it was found that 26% of them also met criteria for SPD, the highest comorbidity out of any personality disorder in the sample (the other comorbidities were 19% for obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, 13% for avoidant personality disorder and one female with schizotypal personality disorder). Additionally, twice as many men with Asperger syndrome met criteria for SPD than women. While 41% of the whole sample were unemployed with no occupation, this rose to 62% for the Asperger&#x27;s and SPD comorbid group.

Although the cause for this comorbidity is not yet certain, genetic evidence for a spectrum between cluster A personality disorders/schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders has been found. Tantam suggested that Asperger syndrome may confer an increased risk of developing SPD.

In the same 2012 study, it was noted that the DSM may complicate diagnosis of SPD by requiring the exclusion of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) before establishing a diagnosis of SPD. The study found that social interaction, stereotyped behaviours and specific interests were more severe in the individuals with Asperger syndrome also fulfilling SPD criteria, against the notion that social interaction skills are unimpaired in SPD. The authors believe that a substantial subgroup of people with autism spectrum disorder or PDD have clear &quot;schizoid traits&quot; and correspond largely to the &quot;loners&quot; in Lorna Wing&#x27;s classification &quot;The autism spectrum&quot; (&quot;Lancet&quot; 1997), described by Sula Wolff.

=== Self-injury and suicide ===
Self-injurious behaviors are relatively common in autistic people, and can include head-banging, self-cutting, self-biting, and hair-pulling. Some of these can result in serious injury or death. Autistic people are about three times as likely as non-autistic people to engage in self-injury.

Theories about the cause of self-injurious behavior in children with developmental delay, including autistic children, include:
* Frequency or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g., reward in return for halting self-injurious behavior). This theory does not apply to younger children with autism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce the behavior.
* Higher rates of self-injury are noted in socially isolated autistic people. Studies have shown that a lack of socialization skills are related factors to self-injurious behavior for autistic people.
* Self-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present.
* Abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior.

Risk factors for self-harm and suicidality include circumstances that could affect anyone, such as mental health problems (e.g., anxiety disorder) and social problems (e.g., unemployment and social isolation), plus factors that affect only autistic people, such as actively trying to behave like a neurotypical person, which is called &quot;masking&quot;. Approximately 8 in 10 people with autism suffer from a mental health problem in their lifetime, in comparison to 1 in 4 of the general population that suffers from a mental health problem in their lifetimes.

Rates of suicidality vary significantly depending upon what is being measured. This is partly because questionnaires developed for neurotypical subjects are not always valid for autistic people. As of 2023, the Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire–Autism Spectrum Conditions (SBQ-ASC) is the only test validated for autistic people. According to some estimates, about a quarter of autistic youth and a third of all autistic people have experienced suicidal ideation at some point. Rates of suicidal ideation are the same for people formally diagnosed with autism and people who have typical intelligence and are believed to have autism but have not been diagnosed. The suicide rate for verbal autistics is nine times that of the general population. In a 2014 study of late diagnosed autistic adults, 66% had experienced suicidal ideation (nine times higher than the general population) and 35% had a suicide plan or had made a suicide attempt.

Although most people who attempt suicide are not autistic, autistic people are about three times as likely as non-autistic people to make a suicide attempt. Less than 10% of autistic youth have attempted suicide, but 15% to 25% autistic adults have. The rates of suicide attempts are the same among people formally diagnosed with autism and those who have typical intelligence and are believed to have autism but have not been diagnosed. The suicide risk is lower among cisgender autistic males and autistic people with intellectual disabilities. The rate of suicide results in a global excess mortality among autistic people equal to approximately 2% of all suicide deaths each year.

===Sensory problems===

Unusual responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in individuals with autism, and sensory abnormalities are commonly recognized as diagnostic criteria in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as reported in the DSM-5; although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Sensory processing disorder is comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42–88%. With or without meeting the standards of SPD, about 90% of ASD individuals have some type of atypical sensory experiences, described as both hyper- and hypo-reactivity. The prevalence of reported &quot;unusual sensory &quot;behaviors&quot;&quot; that affect functioning in everyday life is also higher, ranging from 45 to 95% depending on factors such as age, IQ and the control group used.

Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.

Many with ASD often find it uncomfortable to sit or stand in a way which neurotypical people will find ordinary, and may stand in an awkward position, such as with both feet together, supinating, sitting cross-legged or with one foot on top of the other or simply having an awkward gait. However, despite evidently occurring more often in people with ASD, all evidence is anecdotal and unresearched at this point. It has been observed by some psychologists that there is commonality to the way in which these &#x27;awkward&#x27; positions may manifest.

===Sleep disorders===
Sleep disorders are commonly reported by parents of individuals with ASDs, including late sleep onset, early morning awakening, and poor sleep maintenance; sleep disturbances are present in 53–78% of individuals with ASD. Unlike general pediatric insomnia, which has its roots in behavior, sleep disorders in individuals with ASD are comorbid with other neurobiological, medical, and psychiatric issues.

If not addressed, severe sleep disorders can exacerbate ASD behaviors such as self-injury; however, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological treatments for pediatric insomnia at this time.

Studies have found abnormalities in the physiology of melatonin and circadian rhythm in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These physiological abnormalities include lower concentrations of melatonin or melatonin metabolites in ASDs compared to controls. Some evidence suggests that melatonin supplements improve sleep patterns in children with autism but robust, high-quality studies are overall lacking.

===Strabismus===
According to several studies, there is a high prevalence of strabismus in autistic individuals, with rates 3–10 times that of the general population.

===Tinnitus===
According to one study, 35% of people who are autistic would be affected by tinnitus, which is much higher than in the general population.

===Tourette syndrome===
The prevalence of Tourette syndrome among individuals who are autistic is estimated to be 6.5%, higher than the 2% to 3% prevalence for the general population. Several hypotheses for this association have been advanced, including common genetic factors and dopamine, glutamate or serotonin abnormalities.

===Tuberous sclerosis===
Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with the autism spectrum. One to four percent of autistic people also have tuberous sclerosis. Studies have reported that between 25% and 61% of individuals with tuberous sclerosis meet the diagnostic criteria for autism with an even higher proportion showing features of a broader pervasive developmental disorder.

=== Turner syndrome ===
Turner syndrome is an intersex condition wherein a person is born phenotypically female but with only one X chromosome or with X/XX mosaicism instead of XX or XY chromosomes. One study found that 23% of girls with Turner syndrome who were included met criteria for a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder and the majority had &quot;significant social communication difficulties.&quot;

===Vitamin deficiencies===

Vitamin deficiencies are more common in autism spectrum disorders than in the general population.

* &quot;Vitamin D&quot;: Vitamin D deficiency was concerned in a German study 78% of hospitalized autistic population. 52% of the entire ASD group in the study was severely deficient, which is much higher than in the general population. Other studies also show a higher rate of vitamin D deficiencies in ASDs.
* &quot;Vitamin B12&quot;: The researchers found that, overall, B12 levels in the brain tissue of autistic children were three times lower than those of the brain tissue of children not affected by ASD. This lower-than-normal B12 profile persisted throughout life in the brain tissues of patients with autism. These deficiencies are not visible by conventional blood sampling. As for the classic deficiency of vitamin B12, it would affect up to 40% of the population, its prevalence has not yet been studied in autism spectrum disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency is one of the most serious.
* &quot;Vitamin B9&quot; (folic acid): Studies have been conducted regarding folic acid supplementation in autism in children. &quot;The results showed that folic acid supplementation significantly improved certain symptoms of autism such as sociability, verbal / preverbal cognitive language, receptive language, and emotional expression and communication. In addition, this treatment improved the concentrations of folic acid, homocysteine and redox metabolism of standardized glutathione.&quot;
* &quot;Vitamin A&quot;: Vitamin A can induce mitochondrial dysfunction. According to a non-specific study on ASD: &quot;Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoids, are micronutrients necessary for the human diet in order to maintain several cellular functions of human development in adulthood as well as during aging ... Although it is either an essential micronutrient, used in clinical applications, vitamin A has several toxic effects on the redox environment and mitochondrial function. A decline in the quality of life and an increase in the mortality rate among users of vitamin A supplements have been reported. Although the exact mechanism by which vitamin A causes its deleterious effects is not yet clear ... Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoids , disrupt mitochondrial function by a mechanism that is not fully understood.&quot;
* &quot;Zinc&quot;: Zinc deficiency incidence rates in children aged 0 to 3, 4 to 9 and 10 to 15 years were estimated at 43.5%, 28.1% and 3.3% for boys and at 52.5%, 28.7% and 3.5% among girls.
* &quot;Magnesium&quot;: Incidence rates of magnesium deficiency in children aged 0 to 3, 4 to 9 and 10 to 15 years were estimated at 27%, 17.1% and 4.2% for boys and at 22.9%, 12.7% and 4.3% among girls.
* &quot;Calcium&quot;: Incidence rates of calcium deficiency in children aged 0 to 3, 4 to 9 years and 10 to 15 years were estimated at 10.4%, 6.1% and 0.4% for boys and at 3.4%, 1.7% and 0.9% among girls.

It has been found that special diets that are inappropriate for children with ASD usually result in excessive amounts of certain nutrients and persistent vitamin deficiencies.

===Other mental disorders===
Phobias and other psychopathological disorders have often been described along with ASD but this has not been assessed systematically.

<text>Article 45 is an article of the Hong Kong Basic Law. It states that the Chief Executive should be chosen by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee as an eventual goal.

==Content of Article 45==
Article 45 gives the requirements for choosing the Chief Executive:

Details of procedures to be adopted are found in Annex I to the Basic Law where the same expression &quot;broadly representative&quot; is used to describe the constituency of the Election Committee notwithstanding its only representing a tiny section of the total number of registered electors.

==Background==
Paragraph 3 of Annex I Section I of the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides the corresponding backing for art.45:
The earlier version of Article 45, from December 1987 (Article 45 in 1987), contained the details of the methods for selecting the Chief Executive, which was put in the Annex I to the April 1988 version and then in the enacted version. The Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee noted that opinions were expressed on several areas of the article, including whether the Chief Executive should be appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government; that consultation is not as democratic as direct or indirect elections; and that the clause “in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress” is vague and difficult to define legally. 

==Controversy==

The focus of initial controversy was on the timetable for progress towards universal suffrage but, having extracted a promise of a timetable of reform (2016 for the legislature and 2017 for the Chief Executive) heated debate ensued over the details of the election systems to be employed. Positions on both sides hardened in early 2013, with the newly appointed chairman of the PRC government&#x27;s Law Committee, Qiao Xiaoyang, espousing hard-to-define pre-conditions on CE candidature, (&quot;love China and Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;not oppose the Central Government&quot;) including declaring that Beijing would refuse to appoint an unsupportive Hong Kong CE even if democratically elected. Pro-democracy groups formed the Alliance for True Democracy in support of the Occupy Central with Love and Peace protest movement, devised by University of Hong Kong Associate Professor Benny Tai, demanding unconditional universal suffrage.

<text>Harrisburg University of Science &amp; Technology, commonly referred to as Harrisburg University (HU), is a private STEM-focused university in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with an additional location in Philadelphia. Founded in 2001 as Harrisburg Polytechnic Institute, it offers STEM-focused degree and certificate programs.

Harrisburg University places special emphasis on education in fields related to engineering, applied science and technology and offers 15 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 13 master&#x27;s degrees, and 3 doctoral degrees and certificate programs. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
The university was started as Harrisburg Polytechnic Institute to address the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, region&#x27;s need for educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math careers. Before creation of Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, Harrisburg was the largest state capital in the country without a four-year university. The institute received $12 million in state capital funding in 2003 for the construction and related services of the institute from then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell. The YWCA building at 215 Market Street was the first home for the university. In the same year the university changed its name to Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.

Harrisburg University has many research centers, including the Center for Advanced Entertainment and Learning Technologies, the Security Center of Excellence, the Government Technology Institute, the Center for Advanced Agriculture and Sustainability, and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

In 2023, the university downsized employees due to a budget shortfall. In May 2024, the university missed a bond payment, signifying a cash flow crunch. A second round of layoffs took place in June 2024. In July 2024, the university closed its locations in Dubai and Panama.

In May 2020, a team of two Harrisburg University professors and a Ph.D. student announced they had developed computer facial recognition software capable of predicting whether someone is likely to be a criminal based solely on a photo of their face, and &quot;with no racial bias&quot;, a claim found dubious by critics. The announcement was criticized as being &quot;21st-century phrenology&quot; and going &quot;way further than the pseudoscience of physiognomy.&quot; The university later deleted the press release at the request of the researchers involved, noting that they are &quot;updating the paper to address concerns raised.&quot;

Four years later, Harrisburg University leaders announced that the university had been designated by the National Security Agency (NSA) as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD). According to a university press release, “schools seeking to become NSA-approved CAE institutions undergo an extensive program validation process; prove relevant courses map to NSA requirements, objectives, and priorities; and meet high academic standards.” Harrisburg University’s Master of Science in Computer Information Sciences served as the NSA’s validated program of study. The university also offers a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Cybersecurity Operations &amp; Control Management.

== Campus ==

The university&#x27;s 371,000-square-foot Academic Center is a 16-story building in downtown Harrisburg, 326 Market St. The building includes classrooms, science labs, meeting areas, seminar rooms, a 125-seat auditorium and a courtyard. The academic center has wireless internet, video conferencing and a multi-media production facility. It also has seven levels of parking between the ground floor and the academic floors.

In 2017, the university opened a satellite location in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia location offers bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in Computer and Information Science, Esports Management, Information Systems and Information Technologies, Management and Entrepreneurship, and Interactive Media and also master&#x27;s courses in Techpreneurship.

In 2022, the university opened a location in the City of Knowledge in Panama. Additionally, the university is currently constructing a $100-million Science Education Center at 3rd and Chestnut in Harrisburg. The 11-story building is set to open in January 2023.

The Philadelphia location offers bachelor&#x27;s courses in Computer and Information Science, Esports Management, Information Systems and Information Technologies, Management and Entrepreneurship, and Interactive Media and also master&#x27;s courses in Techpreneurship. The university offers online degree programs, including an RN-to-BSN.

===Accreditations===
Harrisburg University of Science and Technology is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since 2009. All Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral (Research) degrees are accredited. In 2014, the commission placed the university on probation for failing to comply with its standards. In March, 2016, the commission determined that the school was in compliance and reaffirmed accreditation until 2021. In 2022, the university accreditation was re-affirmed through 2029.

The university is also approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education Bureau of Postsecondary and Adult Education. The MS in Project Management is accredited by the Global Accreditation Center from the Project Management Institute. The B.S. in Computer and Information Science program is accredited by ABET.

<text>George Padmore (28 June 1903 – 23 September 1959), born Malcolm Ivan Meredith Nurse, was a leading Pan-Africanist, journalist, and author. He left his native Trinidad in 1924 to study medicine in the United States, where he also joined the Communist Party.

From there he moved to the Soviet Union, where he was active in the party, and working on African independence movements. He also worked for the party in Germany but left after the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. In 1935, the official foreign policy of the USSR shifted, Britain and France, colonial powers with colonies in Africa, were now referred &quot;democratic-imperialisms&quot;, a lower priority than the category of &quot;fascist-imperialist&quot; powers, Germany and Japan. This shift fell into direct contradiction with Padmore&#x27;s prioritization of African independence, as Germany and Japan had no colonies in Africa. Padmore broke instantly with the Kremlin, but continued to support socialism ideologically. In 1939, the official view shifted again, as it did after 1941, and afterwards.

Padmore lived for a time in France, before settling in London, England, in 1934. Toward the end of his life he moved to Accra, Ghana, where he helped shape the politics of Kwame Nkrumah and the Convention People&#x27;s Party.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Malcolm Ivan Meredith Nurse, better known by his pseudonym George Padmore, was born on 28 June 1903 in Arouca District, Tacarigua, Trinidad, then part of the British West Indies. His paternal great-grandfather was an Asante warrior who was taken prisoner and sold into slavery at Barbados, where his grandfather was born. His father, James Hubert Alfonso Nurse, was a local schoolmaster who had married Anna Susanna Symister of Antigua, a naturalist.

Nurse attended Tranquillity Intermediate College in Port of Spain, before going to St Mary&#x27;s College for two years (1914 and 1915). He transferred to Pamphylian High School, graduating from there in 1918. After that, he worked for several years as a reporter with the Trinidad Publishing Company.

In late 1924, he travelled to the United States to take up medical studies at Fisk University, a historically black college in Tennessee. He had recently married, on 10 September that year, and his wife Julia Semper would later join him in America. She left behind their daughter Blyden, who was born in 1925 (and died in 2012). According to Nurse&#x27;s instruction, she was named in honour of the African nationalist Edward Blyden of Liberia. Nurse subsequently registered at New York University but soon transferred to Howard University.

===Communist Party===

During his college years in the US, Nurse became involved with the Workers (Communist) Party (CPUSA). When engaged in party business, he adopted the name George Padmore (compounding the Christian name of his father-in-law, Constabulary Sergeant-Major George Semper, and the surname of the friend who had been his best man, Errol Padmore).

Padmore officially joined the Communist Party in 1927 (when he was in Washington, DC) and was active in its mass organization targeted to black Americans, the American Negro Labor Congress. In March 1929 he was a fraternal (non-voting) delegate to the 6th National Convention of the CPUSA, held in New York City.

Padmore, an energetic worker and prolific writer, was tapped by Communist Party trade union leader William Z. Foster as a rising star. He was taken to Moscow to deliver a report on the formation of the Trade Union Unity League to the Communist International (Comintern) later in 1929. Following his presentation, Padmore was asked to stay on in Moscow to head the Negro Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern). He was elected to the Moscow City Soviet.

As head of the Profintern&#x27;s Negro Bureau, Padmore helped to produce pamphlet literature and contributed articles to Moscow&#x27;s English-language newspaper, the &quot;Moscow Daily News&quot;. He was also used periodically as a courier of funds from Moscow to various foreign Communist Parties.

In July 1930, Padmore was instrumental in organizing an international conference in Hamburg, Germany. It launched a Comintern-backed international organization of black labour organizations called the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers (ITUCNW). Padmore lived in Vienna, Austria, during this time, where he edited the monthly publication of the new group, &quot;The Negro Worker&quot;.

In 1931, Padmore moved to Hamburg and accelerated his writing output, continuing to produce the ITUCNW magazine and writing more than 20 pamphlets in a single year. This German interlude came to an abrupt close by the middle of 1933, however, as the offices of the &quot;Negro Worker&quot; were ransacked by ultra-nationalist gangs following the Nazi seizure of power. Padmore was deported to England by the German government, while the Comintern placed the ITUCNW and its &quot;Negro Worker&quot; on hiatus in August 1933.

Disillusioned by what he perceived as the Comintern&#x27;s flagging support for the cause of the independence of colonial peoples in favour of the Soviet Union&#x27;s pursuit of diplomatic alliances with the colonial powers, Padmore abruptly severed his connection with the ITUCNW late in the summer of 1933. The Comintern&#x27;s disciplinary body, the International Control Commission (ICC), asked him to explain his unauthorized action. When he refused to do so, the ICC expelled him from the Communist movement on 23 February 1934. A phase of Padmore&#x27;s political journey was at an end.

As a result of his membership in the Communist Party and working for it in the Soviet Union and Germany, Padmore was barred from re-entry into the United States. He was a non-citizen and the government did not want to admit known communists.

===Pan-Africanist===

Although alienated from Stalinism, Padmore remained a socialist. He sought new ways to work for African independence from imperial rule. Relocating to France, where Garan Kouyaté was an ally from his Comintern days, Padmore began to write a book: &quot;How Britain Rules Africa&quot;. With the help of former American heiress Nancy Cunard, he found a London agent and, eventually, a publisher (Wishart). It published the book in 1936, the year the publisher became Lawrence and Wishart, known to be sympathetic to communists. Publication of books by black men at that time was rare in the United Kingdom. A Swiss publisher distributed a German translation in Germany.

In 1934, Padmore moved to London, where he became the centre of a community of writers dedicated to pan-Africanism and African independence. His boyhood friend C. L. R. James, also from Trinidad, was already there, writing and publishing. James had started International African Friends of Ethiopia in response to Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia. That organization developed into the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which became a centre for African and Caribbean intellectuals&#x27; anti-colonial activity. Padmore was chair of IASB, the Barbadian trade unionist Chris Braithwaite was its organising secretary, and James edited its periodical, &quot;International African Opinion&quot;. Ras Makonnen from British Guiana handled the business end. Other key members included Jomo Kenyatta from Kenya and Amy Ashwood Garvey.

As Carol Polsgrove has shown in &quot;Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause,&quot; Padmore and his allies in the 1930s and 1940s—among them C. L. R. James, Kenya&#x27;s Jomo Kenyatta, the Gold Coast&#x27;s Kwame Nkrumah and South Africa&#x27;s Peter Abrahams—saw publishing as a strategy for political change. They published small periodicals, which were sometimes seized by authorities when they reached the colonies. They published articles in other people&#x27;s periodicals, for instance, the Independent Labour Party&#x27;s &quot;New Leader&quot;. They published pamphlets. They wrote letters to the editor; and, thanks to the support of publisher Fredric Warburg (of Secker &amp; Warburg), they published books. Warburg brought out Padmore&#x27;s &quot;Africa and World Peace&quot; (1937), as well as books by both Kenyatta and James. In a foreword to &quot;Africa and World Peace&quot;, Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps wrote: &quot;George Padmore has performed another great service of enlightenment in this book. The facts he discloses so ruthlessly are undoubtedly unpleasant facts, the story which he tells of the colonization of Africa is sordid in the extreme, but both the facts and the story are true. We have, so many of us, been brought up in the atmosphere of &#x27;the white man&#x27;s burden&#x27;, and have had our minds clouded and confused by the continued propaganda for imperialism that we may be almost shocked by this bare and courageous exposure of the great myth of the civilizing mission of western democracies in Africa.&quot; The Biographical Note on the cover describes Padmore as European correspondent for the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, &quot;Gold Coast Spectator&quot;, &quot;African Morning Post&quot;, &quot;Panama Tribune&quot;, &quot;Belize Independent&quot; and &quot;The Bantu World&quot;.

In 1941, Padmore argued that the British Empire should be transformed into &quot;federated commonwealths based upon Socialist principles.&quot;

Before World War II, James left for the United States, where he met Kwame Nkrumah, a student from the Gold Coast who studied at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. James gave Nkrumah a letter of introduction to Padmore. When Nkrumah arrived in London in May 1945 intending to study law, Padmore met him at the station. It was the start of a long alliance. Padmore was then organizing the 1945 Manchester Pan-African Congress (designated the Fifth Pan-African Congress), attended not only by the inner circle of the IASB but also by W. E. B. Du Bois, the American organizer of earlier Pan-African conferences. The Manchester conference helped set the agenda for decolonisation in the post-war period.

Padmore used London as his base for more than two decades. He and Dorothy Pizer, a white English writer and his domestic partner and co-worker, shared a flat that became a center for African nationalists. Padmore maintained connections across the world, sending articles to international newspapers and keeping up a correspondence with American writers and activists W. E. B. Du Bois and Richard Wright. The latter was then living in Paris. At Padmore&#x27;s urging, Wright travelled to the Gold Coast in 1953 to explore the buildup to independence, and he wrote his book &quot;Black Power&quot; (1954). Before Wright left the Gold Coast, he gave a confidential report on Nkrumah to the American consul; later he reported on Padmore to the American Embassy in Paris. According to the embassy&#x27;s account, Wright said that Nkrumah was relying heavily on Padmore as he made plans for independence.

When Wright published &quot;Black Power&quot; in 1954, Padmore was finishing a book that he hoped would be both a history and blueprint for African independence: &quot;Pan-Africanism or Communism?&quot; It was his attempt to counter Cold War suspicions in Western nations that the African independence movements were fundamentally communist-inspired.

As independence neared for the Gold Coast, the London community had splintered. In 1956, James had returned from the United States, but Padmore and Pizer referred to him with condescension in letters to Wright. Meanwhile, former Padmore ally Peter Abrahams published a &quot;roman à clef&quot; entitled &quot;A Wreath for Udomo&quot; (1956), which contained unflattering portrayals of the members of this London political community. George Padmore was identified by many as the model for the character &quot;Tom Lanwood&quot;.

But Padmore&#x27;s alliance with Nkrumah held firm. From the time of Nkrumah&#x27;s return to the Gold Coast in 1947 to lead its independence movement, Padmore advised him in long detailed letters. He also wrote dozens of articles for Nkrumah&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Accra Evening News&quot;, and wrote a history of &quot;The Gold Coast Revolution&quot; (1953). With Dorothy Pizer (who was a writer and secretary), Padmore encouraged the leader to write his autobiography. Nkrumah published his autobiography in 1957, the year the Gold Coast became independent Ghana. Padmore deputized for Nkrumah as best man when Sir Stafford Cripps&#x27; daughter Peggy married the anti-colonialist Joe Appiah, who was one of Nkrumah&#x27;s closest allies at the time.

Padmore accepted Nkrumah&#x27;s invitation to move to Ghana, but his time there as Nkrumah&#x27;s advisor on African affairs was difficult. Padmore was talking with friends about leaving Ghana to settle elsewhere when he returned to London for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver.

Padmore died on 23 September 1959, aged 56, at University College Hospital in London. A few days later, responding to rumours that the activist had been poisoned, his companion Pizer typed out a detailed statement about his death. She said that his liver condition had worsened in the previous nine months, before he sought treatment from a longtime physician friend. Due to his failing liver, he suffered haemorrhages that resulted in his death.

===Legacy===

*After Padmore&#x27;s death, Nkrumah paid tribute to him in a radio broadcast: &quot;One day, the whole of Africa will surely be free and united and when the final tale is told, the significance of George Padmore&#x27;s work will be revealed.&quot; In the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, George Schuyler said Padmore&#x27;s writings had been &quot;an inspiration to the men who dreamed of a free Africa&quot;. Padmore&#x27;s physician friend, Cecil Belfield Clarke, wrote the obituary that ran in &quot;The Times,&quot; describing Padmore as a writer who wrote books and studied them. Jamaican pan-Africanist and diplomat Dudley Thompson wrote of Padmore in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;He was truly international and the entire colonial world has suffered a loss.&quot;
*After a funeral service at a London crematorium, Padmore&#x27;s ashes were buried at Christiansborg Castle in Ghana on 4 October 1959. The ceremony was broadcast in the US by NBC television. As C. L. R. James wrote,

...eight countries sent delegations to his funeral in London. But it was in Ghana that his ashes were interred and everyone says that in this country, famous for its political demonstrations, never had there been such a turnout as that caused by the death of Padmore. Peasants from far-flung regions who, one might think, had never even heard his name, managed to find their way to Accra to pay a final tribute to the West Indian who spent his life in their service.

Staying on in Accra, Dorothy Pizer wrote a preface for a French edition of Padmore&#x27;s &quot;Pan-Africanism or Communism&quot;. She began research for a biography of Padmore. However, as she told Nancy Cunard, she was frustrated by his habit of having destroyed his personal papers and not having talked about his past.

* The George Padmore Research Library, in the neighbourhood of Ridge, Accra, Ghana, is named after him. Kwame Nkrumah spoke at the opening of the building dedicated to Padmore as a memorial library on 30 June 1961. Nkrumah ranked Padmore as &quot;one of the greatest architects of the African liberation movement ... dedicated to African union and liberty.&quot;
* James, relocated to Port of Spain, Trinidad, wrote a series of articles on Padmore for &quot;The Nation&quot;. James also began collecting material for a biography but eventually produced only a slim manuscript, &quot;Notes on the Life of George Padmore.&quot; For years James tried to publish his book &quot;Nkrumah and the Ghana Revolution&quot;; the book was published in 1977 (London: Allison and Busby). In it, James omitted any reference to Padmore&#x27;s own 1953 book on the Gold Coast revolution; his correspondence has numerous references to his idea that Padmore did not understand the revolution.
* Ras Makonnen, who understood so well the importance of books about the African nationalist movement, published his own intimate account of the London-based community around Padmore, &quot;Pan-Africanism from Within&quot; (1973). James R. Hooker wrote a biography of Padmore, &quot;Black Revolutionary&quot; (1967). Padmore is the central figure featured in Carol Polsgrove&#x27;s &quot;Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause&quot;, published in 2009.
* In 1991, John La Rose founded the George Padmore Institute (GPI), based in North London, with the aim of &quot;continuing the traditions which shaped his life: independent, radical vision and outlook connecting the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, North America and Asia.&quot; Educational and cultural activities, including talks and readings, take place at the GPI, which occasionally publishes relevant materials. It is an archive, educational resource and research centre housing materials relating to the black community of Caribbean, African and Asian descent in Britain and continental Europe. La Rose also founded the George Padmore Supplementary School in 1969.
* On 28 June 2011 – 98 years to the day since Padmore was born – the Nubian Jak Community Trust unveiled a blue plaque at Padmore&#x27;s former address, 22 Cranleigh Street in the London Borough of Camden, in a ceremony addressed by the High Commissioner of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, the High Commissioner of Ghana, the Mayor of Camden, Selma James, Nina Baden-Semper (related to Padmore&#x27;s in-laws), and others. According to Cameron Duodu: &quot;Many of the statements and pamphlets, as well as the correspondence with which leaders of the British colonies in Africa combated the policies of the Colonial Office in London, were drafted at the dining table of 22 Cranleigh Street. It was also the venue at which George Padmore organised the 5th Pan-African Conference in Manchester in 1945.&quot;
*George Padmore Road and George Padmore Lane, in Hurlingham, Nairobi, Kenya, are named after him.

The campaign&#x27;s message, promoted on t-shirts and other things, is &quot;Vote or Die!&quot;, a phrase adapted from Join, or Die, a well-known cartoon by Benjamin Franklin. 

===2004 presidential election===
P. Diddy said at the time that its mission was to make voting &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;sexy.&quot; The 2004 campaign included a line of &quot;Vote or Die&quot; t-shirts, an album, a voter registration push in cities and campuses nationwide, and commercials on such outlets as MTV and BET.

===2008 presidential election===
P. Diddy invoked the phrase, &quot;Obama or Die&quot;, at the BET Awards 2008.

==In pop culture==

* In a &quot;South Park&quot; episode entitled &quot;Douche and Turd&quot;, P. Diddy and his associates chase Stan Marsh around with weapons and literally threaten to kill him if he doesn&#x27;t vote. 
* In 2012, the &quot;Vote or Die!&quot; t-shirt concept was resurrected for the Democratic National Convention in the form of parody &quot;Vote Obama&quot; t-shirts.

<text>Appropriation in sociology is, according to James J. Sosnoski, &quot;the assimilation of concepts into a governing framework...[the] arrogation, confiscation, [or] seizure of concepts.&quot; According to Tracy B Strong it contains the Latin root &quot;proprius&quot;, which, &quot;carries the connotations not only of property, but also of proper, stable, assured and indeed of common or ordinary.&quot; He elaborates: &quot;I have appropriated something when I have made it mine, in a manner that I feel comfortable with, that is in a manner to which the challenges of others will carry little or no significance. A text, we might then say, is appropriated when its reader does not find himself or herself called into question by it, but does find him or herself associated with it. A text is successfully appropriated insofar as the appropriator no longer is troubled with it; it has become a part of his or her understanding, and it is recognized by others as &#x27;owned,&#x27; not openly available for interpretation.&quot; 

Misappropriation according to Gloria Anzaldúa is &quot;the difference between appropriation [(misappropriation)] and proliferation is that the first steals and harms; the second helps heal breaches of knowledge.&quot;

<text>Robert Smith Walker (born December 23, 1942) is a former American politician who represented Pennsylvania in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from 1977 until his retirement in 1997. He was known for his fiery rhetoric and knowledge of parliamentary procedure.

==Life and career==
Born in Bradford, Pennsylvania, Walker graduated from Penn Manor High School. He attended the College of William and Mary from 1960 to 1961 and received his B.S. from Millersville University of Pennsylvania in 1964. Walker taught high school from 1964 to 1967. He took his M.A. from the University of Delaware in 1968 and served in the Pennsylvania National Guard from 1967 to 1973.

Walker became an assistant to Pennsylvania congressman Edwin Duing Eshleman, working for him from 1967 to Eshleman&#x27;s retirement in 1977. Walker won the Republican nomination to succeed Eshleman from the 16th District, including all or part of Lebanon, Lancaster, and Chester counties.

In Congress, Walker was an outspoken conservative and allied himself with fellow conservatives Newt Gingrich, Bob Dornan and Trent Lott and the Conservative Opportunity Society. He was one of the speakers at the first Pennsylvania Leadership Conference in 1989. Michael Barone and Grant Ujifusa wrote that Walker was &quot;scrappy, good humored, and ready to push his principles forward even at the cost of being mocked.&quot; He was a hawk on deficit spending and worked to reduce government spending but at the same time served on the science committee and advocated more spending on the space program, weather research, hydrogen research, and earthquake programs as well as pushing for a cabinet-level department of science.

Walker was also responsible for a rare punishment of the Speaker of the House and aiding in the rise of Gingrich. When C-SPAN began televising the House, Walker, Gingrich, and other conservatives found they could reach a national audience with special order speeches, given at the end of the day after the House finished its legislative program. In these speeches, they assailed the Democrats and their leadership in the House. On May 10, 1984, Walker was speaking to an empty chamber and Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill had the cameras pan the nearly empty chamber. No notice of this change was given to the Republicans when it was implemented on May 14, 1984. When the Republicans found out what was going on, Walker, who was speaking when the panning began, and Bob Michel, the Republican leader, angrily complained on the floor. The next day, Gingrich was speaking and Speaker O&#x27;Neill lost his cool, resulting in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s words being taken down and ruled out of order. No Speaker had been so punished since 1795. These events made Gingrich a household name. Gingrich would later bring Walker into the Republican leadership; Walker was chief deputy whip.

Walker was a fierce advocate of stronger drug laws. He proposed that all federal contractors institute programs among their employees with violations to result in the forfeiture of federal contracts – even if as little as one joint were found in a contractor&#x27;s workplace. Walker also led a campaign against the rewriting of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; and had the practice banned in the 104th Congress when Republicans won control of the House. He was chairman of the House Science Committee during his last term.

&quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; wrote that &quot;he has raised too many hackles and rubbed too many nerves to be very popular&quot; in the House, but the voters back in Pennsylvania only once gave him less than sixty-five percent of the vote.

In 2001 he was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. He also served on the President&#x27;s Commission on Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy (2004) and the President&#x27;s Commission on the United States Postal Service (2005).

His name had been circulated as a possible NASA administrator following the 2004 resignation of Sean O&#x27;Keefe. He is now on the board of directors of Space Adventures, and has served as chairman of the board of the Space Foundation. He is chairman of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee of the U.S. Department of Energy. In October 2016 he was appointed space policy adviser of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Walker was executive chairman of the Washington lobbying firm, Wexler &amp; Walker Public Policy Associates, before it closed its doors at the end of 2018. Walker is CEO of MoonWalker Associates. Walker is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

He also appeared in successful television shows including &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Early Edition&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Off Centre&quot; and &quot;The Shield&quot;.

He gave his voice talent to animated films including &quot;Open Season 2&quot; (2008) and &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&quot; (2013).

==Life and career==
Jones was born and raised in Detroit. He lost the middle finger on his left hand at the age of 4. He began his career with an uncredited role in the successful TV show &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In 1992, he took part in the &quot;Malcolm X&quot; film.

Jones played the character of Zack Taylor, the original &quot;Black Power Ranger&quot; in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series. He was written out of the series midway through the second season, after a contract and pay dispute, and was replaced by Johnny Yong Bosch as the Black Ranger. Jones returned to &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in the &quot;Lost Galaxy&quot; season (1999) where he played the voice of Hexuba&#x27;s Nightmare Monster in the episode &quot;Dream Battle&quot;; he also acted in an episode of &quot;Power Rangers: Wild Force&quot; (2002) entitled &quot;Forever Red&quot; in which many previous Red Rangers teamed up. Again, he did not appear as his original character, Zack, but rather provided the voice for one of the antagonists, a general in the Machine Empire named Gerrok. He was also one of the special commentators, along with fellow co-star Amy Jo Johnson, on the &quot;1993&quot; episode of &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s&quot;. He also reunited with Austin St. John (with whom he formed a close friendship during their time together on the show) as co-host for a special airing of the original pilot episode of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; called &quot;The Lost Episode&quot;. In 2023, he reprised the role of Zack Taylor for the first time since leaving the show in 1994 in the Netflix special, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, which celebrates the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise.

Jones was the very first actor to do voicework for any character other than a Ranger (mainly for monsters or villains) on a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; show after having a role as a Ranger himself. Other former Rangers who would do voicework after Jones included Archie Kao, Catherine Sutherland, Jason Faunt, Valerie Vernon, Sean Cw Johnson and Johnny Yong Bosch.

Jones was a lead character in the teen drama Malibu Shores playing &quot;Mouse&quot;. Jones also had major roles in the independent film &quot;The Dogwalker&quot;. He has appeared in other well-known productions, including a small part in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in the season 4 episode &quot;Fear, Itself&quot; and the Disney Channel Original Movie, &quot;Brink!&quot;. He also appeared as Harlan Band in the Nickelodeon series &quot;Space Cases&quot;, his second role as a main character and as a teenager. He guest starred in an episode of &quot;Family Matters&quot; as Kissel, and portrayed a supporting character in the first season of &quot;The Shield&quot; named Rondell Robinson, a drug dealer. He had a small role in the film &quot;Suckers&quot; in which he played a character named Clay. He also appeared in many successful TV shows including &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;Early Edition&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Off Centre&quot;. Additionally, he played a small role in the film &quot;House of the Dead 2&quot; as &quot;locker zombie&quot;. Jones also had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;.

Jones also had a major role in the backyard wrestling film &quot;Backyard Dogs&quot;, which spent time as the lowest-rated film on IMDb. As of July 2007, it is no longer on the list as it was straight-to-video. Jones voiced characters in the successful animated films &quot;Open Season 2&quot; (2008) and &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&quot; (2013).

He appeared briefly as a salsa dance instructor on &quot;Age of Love&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Mighty Med&quot; and as a poet in an episode of Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;Pair of Kings&quot;. Additionally Jones has also been featured in a PetSmart commercial and a Bank of America commercial as well. In 2002, he appeared in the film &quot;Love and a Bullet&quot;. In 2016, he appeared in the film &quot;&quot; and the short film &quot;Star Trek : Captain Pike&quot;.

In January 2019, he starred in &quot;The Order&quot; alongside Austin St. John, Catherine Sutherland, David Yost, Johnny Yong Bosch, Paul Schrier, Karan Ashley, Steve Cardenas, Erin Cahill, Blake Foster, Nakia Burrise, Hilary Shepard Turner, Dan Southworth, Alyson Sullivan, Deborah Estelle Phillips and Azim Rizk.

<text>Flashback, released as Flashback: The Quest for Identity in the United States, is a 1992 science fiction cinematic platform game. It was developed by Delphine Software of France and published by U.S. Gold in the United States and Europe, and by Sunsoft in Japan.

The game was created for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and was directed, written, designed, and partially programmed by Paul Cuisset, who had previously created the adventure game &quot;Future Wars&quot;. &quot;Flashback&quot; was launched for the Amiga in 1992. It was released for Mega Drive/Genesis, MS-DOS, Acorn Archimedes, and Super NES in 1993. CD-ROM versions for the Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and FM Towns were released during 1994 and 1995, together with a cartridge version for the Jaguar in 1995. In 2017, the game was released worldwide on the Dreamcast, featuring graphic assets and cutscenes from the MS-DOS version and music from the Amiga version. An updated port titled &quot;Flashback: Remastered Edition&quot; was released for Switch on June 7, 2018, for PlayStation 4 on November 20, 2018, and for Windows on November 29, 2018. The game was also released on October 2023 for the Evercade platforms as part of Delphine collection cartridge and it&#x27;s based on the original Megadrive/Genesis version.

It was originally advertised as a &quot;CD-ROM game on a cartridge&quot;, and features fully hand-drawn backdrops and rotoscoped animation, with unusually fluid movements similar to &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; from 1989. The video capture technique of &quot;Flashback&quot; was invented independently of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, using a more complicated method of first tracing video images onto transparencies.

The game was a commercial and critical success and was listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the best-selling French game of all time. Its sequel is &quot;Fade to Black&quot; in 1995. In 2013, a &quot;Flashback&quot; remake by VectorCell was released for the PC and consoles.

A new sequel, &quot;Flashback 2&quot; by Microids, was released on November 16, 2023, for the PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, with previous generation consoles getting their release early 2024. It is a prequel set eight years before the original.

==Gameplay==

As a cinematic platformer, &quot;Flashback&quot; features gameplay similar to that of 1989&#x27;s &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, and Delphine&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; released in 1991. Each level spans many non-scrolling screens, nearly all of which feature multiple levels of altitude. This requires the player character Conrad to jump, grab onto ledges, climb, use elevators, and drop onto lower levels. Conrad exhibits realistic human running speed and jumping ability, and realistic weakness. He dies if he falls from a great height.

Conrad carries a pistol with unlimited ammunition; a force shield, which absorbs a certain number of shots before needing recharging, acting as Conrad&#x27;s health; and a portable force field with unlimited use, which can act as a temporary barrier to block enemies&#x27; shots.

As Conrad progresses through the game&#x27;s seven levels, he is increasingly presented with spatial puzzles, requiring the player to discover how to guide him toward his destination. Late in the game, Conrad receives a teleportation device, and is able to progress by throwing the device and teleporting into otherwise unreachable areas.
==Plot==
In the year 2142, intelligence agent Conrad B. Hart awakens in a jungle on the planet Titan, with no memory of how he got there. While exploring his surroundings, Conrad comes across a recording containing a message made by himself, advising him to find his friend Ian in the city of New Washington on the planet. Making his way there, Conrad arrives to find Ian being attacked by the local police for unknown reasons. After saving them, Ian uses a regenerator device to restore Conrad&#x27;s memories, using a digital copy that Conrad had sent them.

The device causes Conrad to recall that he had recently made a visor designed for analysing the density of molecular structures in organic life, but through its use had inadvertently discovered an alien species called Morphs had infiltrated human society. Fearful of what they were doing, Conrad sent a copy of his memories to Ian as a precaution, before attempting to warn the authorities, only to be caught by the Morphs who erased all knowledge of their existence from his mind and attempted to get rid of him.

Seeking to uncover more, Conrad vows to return to Earth to inform his superiors, but is informed by Ian his only hope of leaving Titan is to win a ticket in a gladiatorial deathmatch game known as &quot;Death Tower&quot;, alongside acquiring forged papers - the latter requiring Conrad to take on a series of dangerous jobs around New Washington. After acquiring both, Conrad returns to Earth, but finds that Morph infiltrators were prepared, forcing him to defend himself while breaching their hideout under a local nightclub.

Inside the hideout, Conrad spies on a group of Morphs through a vent, hearing them discussing their plan to conquer Earth thanks to their subtle efforts to give them new technology they can utilize. Unfortunately, the vent gives way, causing Conrad to be captured. Managing to escape, he fights his way through the hideout, eventually uncovering a teleport to the Morphs&#x27; home planet. Determined to stop them, he comes across a human prisoner named Phillip Howard Clark, who the Morphs had been using for their own ends.

Agreeing to free him, Conrad opens his cell, but is powerless to stop a Morph executing Phillip. Before dying, they hand him an atomic charge. Uncovering his diary, Conrad learns Phillip had been manipulated to help the Morphs plans for conquering humanity, and had thus sent blueprints for the visor technology to Titan, hoping someone would attempt to recreate it. Conrad learns that the atomic charge he was given was designed to destroy the &quot;Master Brain&quot;, an entity that controls the Morphs deep within the planet&#x27;s core.

Forcing it to become active and expose itself, and guided by Phillip&#x27;s voice, Conrad plants the charge on an unstable platform above the core, and then forces the Master Brain to trigger a tremor, leading to the charge dropping into the core. Conrad then escapes with a Morph&#x27;s spacecraft moments before the planet is destroyed. Unable to navigate back home due to the galaxy he is now in, Conrad puts himself in suspended animation while his ship drifts into space, leading up to the events of &quot;Fade to Black&quot;.

==Development and release==
The PC version has an extended introductory sequence and more minor cut scenes than the Amiga version, such as when picking up items. In the Amiga version, the user can see these scenes by enabling them (although with few seconds of delay every time the animations load) or by playing the game entirely from the hard drive. The Amiga version also had an option to zoom in on the action whenever Conrad opens fire. Due to criticism of the look, it was removed from all other versions, although an option to play the game zoomed in remained in the PC version. The message that Conrad writes in the ending was also different in this release. The Macintosh version was developed by Presage Software.

The game was originally released on 3.5&quot; floppy disk for MS-DOS. The re-release on CD-ROM for the Sega CD (later adapted to the PC CD-ROM, 3DO and CD-i) featured redone pre-rendered cinematic FMVs with voice acting and sound effects. The Sega CD version also has voice work for gameplay and CD tracks for each level which were not carried to the other CD-ROM conversions. The Jaguar port has the title screen that these versions have, but the music is different and the cutscenes are as on the original releases.

In 2013, Paul Cuisset told &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;: &quot;The best version for me is the Mega Drive version. The game was created for this platform&quot;.

In North America, the Genesis, Super NES and Sega CD versions featured a Marvel comic book within the manual in order to explain the initial story. The PAL releases of the Mega Drive and Super NES versions (there was no Mega CD version in the PAL region) omitted the comic and instead featured a textual prologue. The Super NES port featured some minor censorship due to Nintendo&#x27;s content guidelines at the time. Changes included New Washington&#x27;s bar becoming a cafe and &quot;Death Tower&quot; being renamed &quot;Cyber Tower&quot;, while the enemy mutants (who had natural skin colors in other versions) were recolored green.

A two-track CD soundtrack was released featuring music inspired by the game, but not directly from it.

&quot;Flashback&quot;, along with &quot;Another World&quot;, shipped as a single retail package by Microids for the PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One in Europe on April 16, 2020.

==Reception==
About 750,000 copies were sold by 1995.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; approved of &quot;Flashback&quot;″s &quot;superbly rotoscoped graphics&quot;, &quot;fluid movement&quot;, and sound card audio. Criticizing the awkward interface and use of save points, the magazine concluded that it &quot;is an excellent game that truly creates a sense of reality&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the SNES version for having improved graphics and music over the Genesis version. They remarked that &quot;Flashback&quot; is slow-paced at times, but retains the player&#x27;s interest through its compelling plot and involving puzzles. &quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine conceded that although there were &quot;five big levels&quot;, finishing the game did not take very long. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the graphics, story and animation, calling it &quot;almost cinematic&quot; while noting that the play control takes &quot;some getting used to&quot;.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Flashback: The Quest for Identity&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #38 (1993), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Very Good&quot; and stated that &quot;Even gamers not including toward arcade entertainment will quickly become engrossed by &quot;Flashback&quot;. It&#x27;s a tough but fair challenge. Players will grow fascinated as this sci-fi mystery unfolds screen by screen.&quot;

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented that the Sega CD version is &quot;virtually identical&quot; to the Genesis version, but that &quot;Flashback&quot; is still an essential purchase for those who do not already own a different version. &quot;GamePro&quot;, in contrast, argued that the reworked cutscenes &quot;look so awesome that even gamers who&#x27;ve already completed this game on another platform will want to play it again just to see all the new CD footage&quot;. They also praised the addition of a CD-quality soundtrack and voices. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; acknowledged that the Sega CD version makes considerable improvements, but argued that they are all standard cartridge-to-Sega CD enhancements which have no impact on the gameplay. However, he lauded &quot;Flashback&quot; itself for its graphics, animation and &quot;fiendishly clever puzzles&quot;, and said that though the game superficially resembles &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot;, it is &quot;in a class by itself that easily surpasses them&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; similarly said that &quot;Flashback&quot; held up well, but that the Sega CD version&#x27;s improvements seem less significant than its frequent load times. Reviewing the Jaguar version, &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that it was merely a straight port with no enhancements to take advantage of the hardware, but that &quot;the game is no less enjoyable&quot; than when it was first released to game consoles over a year before.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version, praising the animation, story sequences, plot, level design, and longevity. Its 3DO review stated that &quot;this title is still the same great game that we&#x27;ve been looking at for a couple of years. And one last note, the 3DO controller, for once, doesn&#x27;t interfere (much) with the game&#x27;s demanding control scheme.&quot;

&quot;Flashback&quot; was listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the best-selling French game of all time. The Mega Drive version became a bestseller.

In 1994, &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at number eight of top Mega Drive games of all time. In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed the Genesis version as number 92 on its &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;a strong package that is fun to play even today. &quot;Flashback&quot; makes us feel like we&#x27;re &quot;in&quot; that alien world, and with its lifelike animation and excellent moves, we can&#x27;t help but love it.&quot; In February 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 17th best Amiga game and the Polish edition of &quot;CHIP&quot; ranked it as the tenth best Amiga game. In 2004, readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted &quot;Flashback&quot; as the 65th top retro game. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named &quot;Flashback&quot; the 17th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;&quot;Flashback&quot; proves that, when it comes to producing original, stylish and challenging games, there are few more adept than the French.&quot; IGN rated the game #79th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;. In 2018, Complex listed the game 43rd in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; placed the game 24th on their Top 100 SNES Games. The lauded the rotoscoped graphics saying at the time &quot;the most realistic animation ever seen in a platformer&quot;. They also praised the combination of action and adventure style puzzle challenges, summarizing: &quot;The game itself is a [..] of an experience and the excellent plot also keeps the whole thing incredibly atmospheric.&quot; In the same year, &quot;Flux&quot; ranked &quot;Flashback&quot; tenth on its &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; listed the Mega Drive version 59th in its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
A 2013 remake was released after being announced on April 11, 2013, with a reveal trailer.

A sequel titled &quot;Fade to Black&quot; was produced by Delphine Software International in 1995 for the PC and PlayStation as a 3D game. A third game in the series, &quot;Flashback Legend&quot;, was in development by both Delphine Software International and Adeline Software International for a planned release in 2003, but was cancelled when the company went bankrupt and ceased operations at the end of 2002.

In early 2013, a game titled &quot;Flashback Origins&quot; was rumored to be in development, with the French website Gameblog stating that €300,000 of government funding had been granted to Cuisset&#x27;s VectorCell in 2011.

In May 2021, &quot;Flashback 2&quot; was announced for personal computers and multiple consoles. The game was developed by Microids who did not specify how the game would be connected, if at all, to &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. The game was released on November 16, 2023, for the PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, with previous generation consoles getting their release in early 2024. &quot;Flashback 2&quot; is a prequel set eight years before the original.

<text>Sethy John Regenvanu (born 1945) is a politician in Vanuatu. He is one of several churchmen who have been active in Vanuatu politics, like Father Walter Lini, Rev. Frederick Karlomuana Timakata, and Father Gérard Leymang.

Hailing from Uripiv island near Malekula, he became lands minister in the last pre-independence government of the New Hebrides in November 1979.

He was Christian Education Officer with the Presbyterian Church of New Hebrides, before becoming Minister of Lands in the new government of Vanuatu on Independence in July 1980.

In February 1983 he succeeded Timakata as deputy prime minister. In January 1988 he became minister of education, youth and sports, and in December 1991 he again became deputy prime minister. He was Minister of Finance in 1991. Later he served as chairman of the electoral commission.

In 1994 he led a group which broke away from Lini&#x27;s National United Party and formed the People&#x27;s Democratic Party.

He has also been social issues coordinator in the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu. In October 2004 he was seconded for a three-year appointment to St. Andrew&#x27;s, Suva, Fiji.

He married an Australian-born missionary teacher, Dorothy Rutter, who also became a pastor in the Presbyterian Church. They have five sons, including Ralph Regenvanu, formerly the long-time director of the Vanuatu Cultural Centre and currently Minister for Lands in the government of Moana Carcasses.

He has written an autobiography, &quot;Laef Blong Mi&quot; (2004).

<text>Penfield, Georgia, United States was established shortly after 1829 in Greene County, and named in honor of Josiah Penfield (1785–1828), a Savannah merchant and silversmith from Fairfield, Connecticut, who bequeathed $2,500 and a financial challenge to the Georgia Baptist Convention to match his gift for educational purposes. The convention, led by Billington Sanders, organized a manual labor school which opened in 1833 as Mercer Institute (renamed Mercer University in 1837), in honor of Rev. Jesse Mercer of Greene County, a major contributor to the matching gift request.

As the university grew, a Female Academy (1838), post office, bank, mercantile stores, print shops, Male Academy Preparatory School (1847), hosiery mill, and cotton warehouses opened on the 450 areas that surrounded the campus. Residential housing, influenced by the requirement that homes provide housing for students, added to the charm of this typical southern community.

Before long, the &quot;Christian Index&quot;, &quot;Temperance Banner&quot;, &quot;Georgia Illustrated Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Orion&quot; were all being published in Penfield. Hard times brought on by the American Civil War, however, initiated the school&#x27;s move to Macon in 1871 and the village of Penfield survived on the strength of the cotton industry.

Today, the village of Penfield is distinguished by the Greek Revival architecture of Old Mercer Chapel, community churches, town cemetery, and Victorian homes that flourished until 1919 when the prosperity built during the &quot;Cotton Era&quot; was ended by the boll weevil.

Ruins of the town&#x27;s mercantile buildings, bank, post office and Mercer Institute&#x27;s (science building, dormitory, Phi Delta Literary Society Hall, Ciceronian Hall and others) can be seen next to the still-functioning chapel located just above the old town square along East Main Street. Penfield Cemetery, located a short distance from Penfield Road, on the North end of Cemetery Road, holds the remains of many community leaders. One is noted Baptist minister Jesse Mercer, namesake of the university. Another is (Frances) Etta Colclough Whelchel, a member of the first class of women to graduate from the University of
Georgia, who was instrumental in founding the university&#x27;s first Y.W.C.A. branch and served as its first president, and later ran the Colclough family&#x27;s Penfield farm.

In 1976, the village of Penfield was added to the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its contributions to architecture, education and religion from 1825 to 1874. The area now known as the Penfield Historic District comprises 305 acres (1.2 km), including Old Mercer Chapel (now Penfield Baptist Church), Sanders Chapel, Penfield Presbyterian Church, Penfield Cemetery and over a dozen notable houses. Behind the wall of the Penfield Cemetery, lies a slave cemetery. There are some markers still standing, mostly indentations on the ground, and unless you walk down and look over the fence of the nice manicured lawn, you wouldn&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there. The road to it has been blocked.

The Penfield Historic District is located seven miles (10 km) north of Greensboro on GA 5925 (commonly known as Penfield Road).

Directions: From Atlanta travel east on Interstate 20 approximately 73 miles (117 km) to Greensboro (exit 130). Exiting the interstate, turn left onto GA-44/Lake Oconee Parkway. Follow GA-44 2.7 miles (4.3 km) into Greensboro. Turn right at the first traffic light onto East Broad St./ GA-12/GA-15. Turn left at first traffic light onto N. East St. for 1.5 miles (2.4 km). N. East St. becomes Penfield Rd./GA 5925. Follow Penfield Rd. 5.8 miles (9.3 km) into Penfield.

<text>The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games, were an international multi-sport event held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, from 30 January to 8 February 1948. A total of 669 athletes representing 28 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. NOCs as first-time entrants at the Winter Games included Chile, Denmark, Iceland, Lebanon, and South Korea. The games featured 22 events in 4 sports across 9 disciplines. The games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been twelve years since the last Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, from 6 to 16 February 1936. The games were the second Winter Games held in St. Moritz.

Overall, athletes representing 13 NOCs won at least one medal, and 10 NOCs won at least one gold medal. Norway and Sweden won the most gold medals with 4 and also won the most overall medals with 10, tied with host nation Switzerland. Norway and Sweden also had the same silver and bronze medal totals, meaning that they tied for first place in the medal table. Italy&#x27;s team won their first Winter Olympic gold medal after Nino Bibbia won the men&#x27;s skeleton event; the medal was also their first Winter Olympic medal of any color. Additionally, Belgium&#x27;s team won their first Olympic gold medal, with Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet winning the pair skating event.

Alpine skiers Henri Oreiller of France and Martin Lundström of Sweden tied for the most gold medals won by an individual at the games, with two each. Oreiller also won the most overall medals, winning an additional bronze medal for a total of three medals. Norway and Sweden both achieved podium sweeps at the games, with the former in the individual ski jumping event with Petter Hugsted winning the gold, Birger Ruud winning the silver, and Thorleif Schjelderup winning the bronze, and the latter in the men&#x27;s 18 kilometre cross-country skiing event with Lundström winning the gold, Nils Östensson winning the silver, and Gunnar Eriksson winning the bronze.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. 

In alpine skiing, two bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s downhill event after a third-place tie. In speed skating, a three-way tie for second place resulted in three silver medals and no bronze medal being awarded in the men&#x27;s 500 metres event.

<doc id="972312" wikidata="Q2466790" url="?curid=972312" title="Liquid air">
<text>Liquid air is air that has been cooled to very low temperatures (cryogenic temperatures), so that it has condensed into a pale blue mobile liquid. It is stored in specialized containers, such as vacuum flasks, to insulate it from room temperature. Liquid air can absorb heat rapidly and revert to its gaseous state. It is often used for condensing other substances into liquid and/or solidifying them, and as an industrial source of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and other inert gases through a process called air separation (industrially referred to as air rectification.).

== Properties ==
Liquid air has a density of approximately . The density of a given air sample varies depending on the composition of that sample (e.g. humidity &amp; concentration). Since dry gaseous air contains approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon, the density of liquid air at standard composition is calculated by the percentage of the components and their respective liquid densities (see liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen). Although air contains trace amounts of carbon dioxide (about 0.03%), carbon dioxide solidifies from the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase, and hence will not be present in liquid air at pressures less than .

The boiling point of air is , intermediate between the boiling points of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen. However, it can be difficult to keep at a stable temperature as the liquid boils, since the nitrogen will boil off first, leaving the mixture oxygen-rich and changing the boiling point. This may also occur in some circumstances due to the liquid air condensing oxygen out of the atmosphere.

Liquid air starts to freeze at approximately , precipitating nitrogen-rich solid (but with appreciable amount of oxygen in solid solution). Unless the oxygen is previously accommodated in the solid solution, the eutectic freezes at 50 K.

== Preparation ==
=== Principle of production ===
The constituents of air were once known as &quot;permanent gases&quot;, as they could not be liquified solely by compression at room temperature. A compression process will raise the temperature of the gas. This heat is removed by cooling to the ambient temperature in a heat exchanger, and then expanding by venting into a chamber. The expansion causes a lowering of the temperature, and by counter-flow heat exchange of the expanded air, the pressurized air entering the expander is further cooled. With sufficient compression, flow, and heat removal, eventually droplets of liquid air will form, which may then be employed directly for low temperature demonstrations.

The main constituents of air were liquefied for the first time by Polish scientists Karol Olszewski and Zygmunt Wróblewski in 1883.

Devices for the production of liquid air are not commercially available, and not easily fabricated.

=== Process of production===
The most common process for the preparation of liquid air is the two-column Hampson–Linde cycle using the Joule–Thomson effect. Air is fed at high pressure (&gt;) into the lower column, in which it is separated into pure nitrogen and oxygen-rich liquid. The rich liquid and some of the nitrogen are fed as reflux into the upper column, which operates at low pressure (&lt;), where the final separation into pure nitrogen and oxygen occurs. A raw argon product can be removed from the middle of the upper column for further purification.

Air can also be liquefied by Claude&#x27;s process, which combines cooling by Joule–Thomson effect, isentropic expansion and regenerative cooling.

== Application ==
In manufacturing processes, the liquid air product is typically fractionated into its constituent gases in either liquid or gaseous form, as the oxygen is especially useful for fuel gas welding and cutting and for medical use, and the argon is useful as an oxygen-excluding shielding gas in gas tungsten arc welding. Liquid nitrogen is useful in various low-temperature applications, being nonreactive at normal temperatures (unlike oxygen), and boiling at .

=== Transport and energy storage ===

Between 1899 and 1902, the automobile Liquid Air was produced and demonstrated by a joint American/English company, with the claim that they could construct a car that would run a hundred miles on liquid air.

On 2 October 2012, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said liquid air could be used as a means of storing energy. This was based on a technology that was developed by Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in Hertfordshire, England to power vehicles.

<text>Edel SE &amp; Co. KGaA is a German independent media company based in Hamburg. As a label and publishing group, it also operates marketing and sales for artists and smaller music labels. The repertoire of the Edel labels includes dance, rock and pop music to classical music and a children&#x27;s catalogue. In addition to the development and marketing of music, the group also deals with the production, logistics and distribution of CDs, DVDs, vinyl records, and books at the production site of the subsidiary optimal media GmbH in Röbel/Müritz as well as with services in the online and book business.

==History==
Edel was founded in 1986 by the current chairman of the board of directors and the majority shareholder Michael Haentjes as a one-man company under the name &quot;edel Gesellschaft für Produktmarketing mbH&quot; and initially dealt exclusively with mail order for film music. In 1992, the company name was changed to &quot;edel Company Music GmbH&quot;. In April 1993 Edel purchased the East German VEB Deutsche Schallplatten&#x27;s classical music recording catalog of 2,000 recordings. Specifically, Edel&#x27;s Berlin Classics imprint has carried the output of VEB&#x27;s classical Eterna label. Edel grew steadily and recorded sales of more than 150 million Deutsche Mark in 1995. In 1998, under the new company name &quot;edel music AG&quot;, the IPO (WKN 564950) and the listing on the Neuer Markt followed. The first stock market listing was 101 DM. The IPO brought the company a gross capital inflow of almost 60 DM million. As part of a global strategy, investments were acquired abroad, for example the PIAS Group in Belgium, which also included &quot;Connected Music Vertrieb GmbH&quot;, founded by Haentjes in 1997, and &quot;Eagle Rock,&quot; London. In 2000, more than 1 billion DM in consolidated sales was achieved.

In July 1999, Edel purchased an 80% stake in RED Distribution from Sony Music Entertainment.

In connection with the general crisis in the music business, the collapse of the Neuer Markt and the high costs of integrating the additional companies, a crisis followed in 2001, which jeopardised the company&#x27;s continued existence. In 2002, Edel and Roland Berger Strategy Consultants implemented an extensive corporate restructuring program. Parts of the company and shareholdings were repelled and loss-making companies were closed.

Of more than 1,700 employees, about 750 remained in the company. Thanks to this consolidation and the stable business of the manufacturer&#x27;s subsidiary, positive business figures were again achieved. At the end of the short financial year 2001 (30.09.) Edel changed from listing in the Neuer Markt to the Regulated Market / General Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which was transferred to the Regulated Market in 2007.

In February 2007, &quot;edel music AG&quot; took over the book division of &quot;Pabel-Moewig&quot; with cookbooks, guides, puzzle books, children&#x27;s books and some licenses such as the silver volumes of the science fiction series Perry Rhodan, thus expanding its media division.

At the Annual General Meeting in May 2007 it was decided to remove the addition &quot;music&quot; in the company name. The company then operated under the name &quot;edel AG&quot; until 2010. In December 2009, the listing on the Regulated Market was revoked. The stock has since been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

In 2010, Edel took over 75% of the then &quot;ZS&quot; publishing house, followed by the remaining 25% in October 2014.

In January 2011, the spelling of the company name changed to &quot;Edel AG&quot;.

In March 2011, &quot;Edel AG&quot; finally acquired the evaluation rights for the TV and cinema films around the cartoon characters &quot;Pettersson and Findus&quot; from the insolvent &quot;TV-Loonland AG&quot;.

In October 2012, &quot;Edel AG&quot; acquired 100% of the shares in &quot;Brilliant Classics B.V.,&quot; which is one of the leading companies in the field of classical music. The label, based in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, sells its products through a worldwide network of distributors.

In July 2014, Edel acquired the catalogue of Jazz label MPS Records from Universal Music Group.

Since October 2015, Edel holds 75% of &quot;Pandastorm Pictures GmbH&quot;.

In March 2016, Jonas Haentjes, the son of the company&#x27;s founder, took over the position of Director Corporate Development at Edel.

As of December 2017, Michael Haentjes and Jonas Haentjes jointly led &quot;Edel AG&quot; as co-CEOs, and Jonas Haentjes was appointed to the board of management of &quot;Edel AG&quot;.

Joerg Pfuhl, Charles Caldas and Joel Weinstein are members of the Edel supervisory board.

In April 2018, the executive board and supervisory board of &quot;Edel AG&quot; decided to convert the company into a limited partnership for shares (KGaA).

The change of form is intended to ensure the influence of the family after a generational succession. In addition, the general partner of KGaA should be given the legal form of a European Company (SE).

In March 2019, the generational transition was completed and the change of legal form to SE &amp; Co. KGaA was completed. Jonas Haentjes has been the sole CEO ever since.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, the Wedderburn–Etherington numbers are an integer sequence named after Ivor Malcolm Haddon Etherington and Joseph Wedderburn that can be used to count certain kinds of binary trees. The first few numbers in the sequence are
:0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 46, 98, 207, 451, 983, 2179, 4850, 10905, 24631, 56011, ... ()

==Combinatorial interpretation==

These numbers can be used to solve several problems in combinatorial enumeration. The &quot;n&quot;th number in the sequence (starting with the number 0 for &quot;n&quot; = 0)
counts
*The number of unordered rooted trees with &quot;n&quot; leaves in which all nodes including the root have either zero or exactly two children. These trees have been called Otter trees, after the work of Richard Otter on their combinatorial enumeration. They can also be interpreted as unlabeled and unranked dendrograms with the given number of leaves.
*The number of unordered rooted trees with &quot;n&quot; nodes in which the root has degree zero or one and all other nodes have at most two children. Trees in which the root has at most one child are called planted trees, and the additional condition that the other nodes have at most two children defines the weakly binary trees. In chemical graph theory, these trees can be interpreted as isomers of polyenes with a designated leaf atom chosen as the root.
*The number of different ways of organizing a single-elimination tournament for &quot;n&quot; players (with the player names left blank, prior to seeding players into the tournament). The pairings of such a tournament may be described by an Otter tree.
*The number of different results that could be generated by different ways of grouping the expression formula_1 for a binary multiplication operation that is assumed to be commutative but neither associative nor idempotent. For instance formula_2 can be grouped into binary multiplications in three ways, as formula_3, formula_4, or formula_5. This was the interpretation originally considered by both Etherington and Wedderburn. An Otter tree can be interpreted as a grouped expression in which each leaf node corresponds to one of the copies of formula_6 and each non-leaf node corresponds to a multiplication operation. In the other direction, the set of all Otter trees, with a binary multiplication operation that combines two trees by making them the two subtrees of a new root node, can be interpreted as the free commutative magma on one generator formula_6 (the tree with one node). In this algebraic structure, each grouping of formula_1 has as its value one of the &quot;n&quot;-leaf Otter trees.

==Formula==
The Wedderburn–Etherington numbers may be calculated using the recurrence relation
:formula_9
:formula_10
beginning with the base case formula_11.

In terms of the interpretation of these numbers as counting rooted binary trees with &quot;n&quot; leaves, the summation in the recurrence counts the different ways of partitioning these leaves into two subsets, and of forming a subtree having each subset as its leaves. The formula for even values of &quot;n&quot; is slightly more complicated than the formula for odd values in order to avoid double counting trees with the same number of leaves in both subtrees.

==Growth rate==
The Wedderburn–Etherington numbers grow asymptotically as
:formula_12
where &quot;B&quot; is the generating function of the numbers and &quot;ρ&quot; is its radius of convergence, approximately 0.4027 , and where the constant given by the part of the expression in the square root is approximately 0.3188 .

==Applications==
 use the Wedderburn–Etherington numbers as part of a design for an encryption system containing a hidden backdoor. When an input to be encrypted by their system can be sufficiently compressed by Huffman coding, it is replaced by the compressed form together with additional information that leaks key data to the attacker. In this system, the shape of the Huffman coding tree is described as an Otter tree and encoded as a binary number in the interval from 0 to the Wedderburn–Etherington number for the number of symbols in the code. In this way, the encoding uses a very small number of bits, the base-2 logarithm of the Wedderburn–Etherington number.

 describe a similar encoding technique for rooted unordered binary trees, based on partitioning the trees into small subtrees and encoding each subtree as a number bounded by the Wedderburn–Etherington number for its size. Their scheme allows these trees to be encoded in a number of bits that is close to the information-theoretic lower bound (the base-2 logarithm of the Wedderburn–Etherington number) while still allowing constant-time navigation operations within the tree.

 use unordered binary trees, and the fact that the Wedderburn–Etherington numbers are significantly smaller than the numbers that count ordered binary trees, to significantly reduce the number of terms in a series representation of the solution to certain differential equations.

<text>The Forty Foot () is a promontory on the southern tip of Dublin Bay at Sandycove, County Dublin, Ireland, from which people have been swimming in the Irish Sea all year round for some 250 years.

==Name==
The name &quot;Forty Foot&quot; is somewhat obscure. On an 1833 map, the Marine Road (located to the west) was named the Forty Foot Road, possibly because it was wide; the name may have been transferred to the swimming place, which was called the Forty-Foot Hole in the 19th century.

Other accounts claim the name was given by fishermen because it was forty feet ( fathoms) deep, but the water in the area is no deeper than . Others have attempted to link it to the 40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot, who supposedly bathed there, but they were stationed at Richmond Barracks in Inchicore.

==Use==
At first, it was exclusively a male bathing place, and &quot;Sandycove Bathers Association&quot;, a men&#x27;s swimming club was established. Owing to its relative isolation and gender-restrictions it became a popular spot for nudists. On 24 July 1974, about a dozen female equal-rights activists (&quot;Dublin City Women’s Invasion Force&quot;) went swimming, and sat with placards. and later, including fewer than five women, swam nude, in 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;rte.ie/631349&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; now swimming is open to men, women, and children. In 2014, the &quot;Sandycove Bathers Association&quot; ended the ban on women club members, and they may now use the onsite changing rooms and clubhouse kitchen.&lt;ref name=&quot;wheresmybackpack/forty-foot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The swimming club requests voluntary contributions for the upkeep of the area.

==Safety==
Death, near-drowning and hypothermia have resulted from swimming at Forty Foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejournal.ie/5397391&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
James Joyce and Oliver St. John Gogarty once resided at the Martello tower together. It is now the James Joyce Tower and Museum. The opening section of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; is set here, with the characters Stephen Dedalus and Buck Mulligan being partly based on Joyce himself and Gogarty, respectively. Buck Mulligan described the sea as &quot;The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea.&quot;

The Forty Foot also featured in the novels &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; by Flann O&#x27;Brien (1939), &quot;At Swim, Two Boys&quot; by Jamie O&#x27;Neill (2001) and &quot; Nessuna notizia dello scrittore scomparso &quot; by Daniele Bresciani (2017).

==In media==
The Forty Foot is featured in the series &quot;Bad Sisters&quot;.

In the 2023 documentary film &quot;Bono &amp; The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, With Dave Letterman&quot;, David Letterman visits the location, which ends up serving as inspiration for the composition of a song by Bono and the Edge called &quot;40 Foot Man&quot; featured in the credits of the show.

<doc id="972333" wikidata="Q2071769" url="?curid=972333" title="Highly totient number">
<text>A highly totient number formula_1 is an integer that has more solutions to the equation formula_2, where formula_3 is Euler&#x27;s totient function, than any integer smaller than it. The first few highly totient numbers are

1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 144, 240, 432, 480, 576, 720, 1152, 1440 , with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 17, 21, 31, 34, 37, 38, 49, 54, and 72 totient solutions respectively. The sequence of highly totient numbers is a subset of the sequence of smallest number formula_1 with exactly formula_5 solutions to formula_2.

The totient of a number formula_7, with prime factorization formula_8, is the product:
:formula_9
Thus, a highly totient number is a number that has more ways of being expressed as a product of this form than does any smaller number.

The concept is somewhat analogous to that of highly composite numbers, and in the same way that 1 is the only odd highly composite number, it is also the only odd highly totient number (indeed, the only odd number to not be a nontotient). And just as there are infinitely many highly composite numbers, there are also infinitely many highly totient numbers, though the highly totient numbers get tougher to find the higher one goes, since calculating the totient function involves factorization into primes, something that becomes extremely difficult as the numbers get larger.

==Example==
There are five numbers (15, 16, 20, 24, and 30) whose totient number is 8. No positive integer smaller than 8 has as many such numbers, so 8 is highly totient.

<doc id="972350" wikidata="Q7241901" url="?curid=972350" title="Preston Hall, Preston-on-Tees">
<text>Preston Hall is an early 19th century mansion house at Preston-on-Tees, about 4 km south of the centre of Stockton-on-Tees, England. It has been a museum since 1953 and is owned by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. It is a listed building. The house stands in of parkland. The grounds of the house form Preston Park.

==History==
The manor of Preston on Tees was held in 1515 by William Sayer but was lost when the estates of Lawrence Sayer, who was a Royalist during the English Civil War, were sequestered and sold by the Commonwealth of England. In 1673 the manor was purchased by George Witham and during the residency of the Witham family the manor house was known as Witham Hall. In 1722 William Witham sold the estate to Sir John Eden Bt of Windlestone Hall and in 1820 it was sold again to David Burton Fowler.

In 1825 Fowler built the present Preston Hall as a modest two-storey three-bayed rectangular structure with a service wing. The old manor house was retained in use as a farmhouse until its demolition in 1974.

In 1882 Marshall Fowler sold the estate to Robert Ropner, a shipping merchant and shipbuilder, who was High Sheriff of Durham in 1896 and who became a baronet in 1904. He extended the property by the addition of substantial wing blocks, and in about 1900 he added a large and recently renovated winter garden or conservatory. The Ropner baronets lived in the house until 1937 (in which year Leonard Ropner served as High Sheriff). It was acquired by the Stockton on Tees District Council in 1947.

On 3 June 1953, Preston Hall was officially opened for the first time as a museum, as part of the celebration of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In the 1970s, there were a number of additions made to the museum, including the building of the popular replica Victorian Street.

==Attractions==
Following a major redevelopment, the museum reopened to the public as Preston Park Museum &amp; Grounds in 2012. This has reinforced its reputation as one of the region&#x27;s major cultural attractions and, in its Diamond Jubilee year of 2013, was shortlisted for the prestigious Art Fund Museum of the Year award.

The Hall&#x27;s grounds have become a popular local park, with woodland and riverside walks, an adventure play area and a skate park. Within the park are other attractions, including Butterfly World (a tropical rainforest hothouse filled with a variety of species of butterflies and other animals), rowing boat hire from RiverShack and the volunteer-run Teesside Small Gauge Railway.

== The Museum ==
Following the failure of a scheme to build housing on the site, the decision was made to transform Preston Hall into a museum and to use the grounds as parkland. The museum opened to the public 1953. In April 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of £3.7 million towards a major refurbishment of the building and the museum&#x27;s collections.

After its redevelopment, Preston Park Museum &amp; Grounds now has four themed galleries, telling the stories of the Hall, the local area and the people who have lived here, as well as showcasing the many treasures held in the collection. This includes the famous Georges de La Tour painting &quot;The Dice Players&quot;, which is part of the Clephan Bequest. This bequest is at the heart of the museum&#x27;s collection, together with the outstanding Spence Collection of arms, armour and decorative objects and the Ions Collection of ceramics and glassware.

Created from the Hall&#x27;s service wing and outbuildings, the replica Victorian Street is a favourite feature of the museum for many of its visitors. Representing life in 1895, people can step back in time and enjoy the range of recreated shops and a working tearoom. These are brought to life by a team of costumed volunteers. The Victorian Street is often used as a film set, including TV and films.

A key part of the redevelopment project was the restoration and reopening of the Victorian Walled Kitchen Garden and Orchard. This fine example of what was once a staple of stately homes now displays bright floral planting and heritage varieties of fruit and vegetables. It is open throughout the spring and summer.

The museum also has a number of temporary exhibition gallery spaces, which host a changing series of exhibitions throughout the year. These showcase the museum&#x27;s rich collection, exhibitions of local and community interest, travelling exhibitions and more.

=== The Dice Players ===

The museum contains a notable oil painting called &quot;The Dice Players&quot; by Georges de La Tour. It is regarded as a superb example of the artist&#x27;s work and, as well as being on display in the museum, has been loaned out for a number of prestigious major exhibitions.

The painting was part of a collection left to the borough in 1934 in memory of Edwin Clephan, who had been born in Stockton, by his daughter Annie. The significance of this work was not realised until 1972, when the collection was being valued by Christopher Wood of Christie&#x27;s. Believing it to be a work of some significance, Wood sought the opinion of Benedict Nicholson, a noted expert on de La Tour, who confirmed that this work was indeed from the hand of this French artist.

<doc id="972359" wikidata="Q381817" url="?curid=972359" title="Norodom Ranariddh">
<text>Norodom Ranariddh (; 2 January 1944 – 28 November 2021, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ) was a Cambodian politician and law academic. He was the second son of King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia and a half-brother of King Norodom Sihamoni. Ranariddh was the president of FUNCINPEC, a Cambodian royalist party. He was also the first Prime Minister of Cambodia following the restoration of the monarchy, serving between 1993 and 1997, and subsequently as the President of the National Assembly between 1998 and 2006.

Ranariddh was a graduate of the University of Provence and started his career as a law researcher and lecturer in France. In 1983, he joined FUNCINPEC and in 1986 became the chief of staff and commander-in-chief of Armée nationale sihanoukiste. Ranariddh became Secretary-General of FUNCINPEC in 1989, and its president in 1992. When FUNCINPEC won the 1993 Cambodian general election, it formed a coalition government with the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP), which was jointly headed by two concurrently serving prime ministers. Ranariddh became the First Prime Minister of Cambodia while Hun Sen, who was from the CPP, became the Second Prime Minister. As the First Prime Minister, Ranariddh promoted business interests in Cambodia to leaders from regional countries and established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC).

From early 1996, relations between Ranariddh and Hun Sen deteriorated as Ranariddh complained of unequal distribution of government authority between FUNCINPEC and the CPP. Subsequently, both leaders publicly argued over issues such as the implementation of construction projects, signing of property development contracts, and their rival alliances with the Khmer Rouge. In July 1997, major clashes between troops separately aligned to FUNCINPEC and the CPP took place, forcing Ranariddh into exile. The following month, Ranariddh was ousted from his position as First Prime Minister in a coup d&#x27;état.

He returned to Cambodia in March 1998, and led his party in the 1998 Cambodian general election. When FUNCINPEC lost the elections to the CPP, Ranariddh, after initially challenging the results, became President of the National Assembly in November 1998. He was seen as a potential successor to Sihanouk as the King of Cambodia, until in 2001 he renounced his interest in the succession. As the President of the National Assembly, Ranariddh was one of the nine members of the throne council which in 2004 selected Sihamoni as Sihanouk&#x27;s successor.

In March 2006, Ranariddh resigned as the President of the National Assembly and in October 2006 was ousted as President of FUNCINPEC. The following month, he founded the Norodom Ranariddh Party (NRP). Accusations and a conviction of embezzlement drove him into exile again. He returned to Cambodia after being pardoned in September 2008 and retired from politics. Between 2010 and 2012 he unsuccessfully attempted a merger of his NRP with FUNCINPEC. In 2014, he launched the short-lived Community of Royalist People&#x27;s Party (CRPP) before returning to FUNCINPEC in January 2015. He was subsequently re-elected to the FUNCINPEC presidency.

Ranariddh remained out of public view following a car accident during the 2018 election campaign, which saw the death of his second wife. He made frequent visits to France for medical treatment, and died in November 2021 in Aix-en-Provence.

==Early life==

Ranariddh was born on 2 January 1944 in Phnom Penh to Sihanouk and his first wife, Phat Kanhol, who was a ballet dancer attached to the royal court. Ranariddh was separated from his mother at three years of age when she remarried, and subsequently grew up mostly under the care of his aunt, Norodom Ketkanya, and grandaunt, Norodom Sobhana. Ranariddh attended primary education at Norodom School and completed part of his high school studies at Lycee Descartes in Phnom Penh. During his childhood, he developed a close relationship with his grandparents, Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak, but was distanced from his father.

In 1958, Ranariddh was sent to a boarding school in Marseille together with his half-brother Norodom Chakrapong. Ranariddh initially planned to pursue medical studies as he did well in science subjects, but was persuaded by Kossamak to study law. After finishing high school in 1961, he enrolled in the undergraduate law programme of the University of Paris. He struggled to focus on his studies in Paris, which he attributed to the social distractions that he encountered in the city.

In 1962, Ranariddh enrolled in the law school of the University of Provence. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in 1968 and 1969 respectively, specialising in public law. After completing his master&#x27;s, Ranariddh took the PhD qualifying examinations in 1969. He returned to Cambodia in January 1970, and worked briefly as a secretary at the Interior Ministry. When Lon Nol staged a successful coup against Sihanouk in March 1970, Ranariddh was dismissed from his job and fled into the jungle where he was a close associate of resistance leaders.

In 1971, Ranariddh was captured, along with several members of the royal family, and was held in prison for six months before being released. He was rearrested the following year, and spent a further three months in detention. In 1973, Ranariddh returned to the University of Provence, where he completed his PhD in 1975. Between 1976 and 1979, he worked as a research fellow at the CNRS, and was awarded a diploma of higher studies in air transport. In 1979 Ranariddh went back to the University of Provence as an associate professor, teaching courses in constitutional law and political sociology.

==Entry into politics==

===Initial years in FUNCINPEC===

When Sihanouk formed FUNCINPEC in 1981, Ranariddh declined his father&#x27;s invitation to join the party as he disagreed with its association with the Khmer Rouge. In June 1983, Sihanouk urged Ranariddh to leave his teaching career in France and join FUNCINPEC, and this time he agreed. Ranariddh was appointed a personal representative to Sihanouk, and relocated to Bangkok, Thailand, where he took charge of the party&#x27;s diplomatic and political activities in Asia. In March 1985, Ranariddh was appointed inspector-general of the (ANS), the armed force of FUNCINPEC, and in January 1986 became ANS commander-in-chief and chief-of-staff.

Ranariddh became secretary-general of FUNCINPEC in August 1989, when Sihanouk stepped down as its president. On 10 September 1990, Ranariddh joined the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), an interim United Nations administrative body tasked with overseeing sovereign affairs of Cambodia. When the 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed in October of that year, officially ending the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, Ranariddh was one of the SNC signatories. In February 1992, he was elected to the presidency of FUNCINPEC.

===1993 elections===
When the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) – a parallel administrative body with the SNC – was formed in February 1992, Ranariddh was appointed one of its council members. He spent time travelling between Bangkok and Phnom Penh, and while in Phnom Penh led efforts in opening FUNCINPEC party offices across Cambodia. At the same time, FUNCINPEC began to criticise the ruling CPP, which retaliated with violent attacks by police against low-level FUNCINPEC officials.

The attacks prompted Ranariddh&#x27;s close aides, Norodom Sirivudh and Sam Rainsy, to advise him against registering the party for the 1993 general elections. However, the chef-de-mission for UNTAC, Yasushi Akashi, encouraged Ranariddh to run in the elections. Persuaded by Akashi, he registered the party and the election campaign began in April 1993. Ranariddh, as well as other FUNCINPEC officials, wore T-shirts depicting Sihanouk on the campaign trail. This nominally complied with an election rule by the UNTAC administration not to use Sihanouk&#x27;s name during the campaign, who now served as the politically neutral head of the SNC. Voting took place in May 1993; FUNCINPEC secured about 45 percent of the valid votes, winning 58 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats. The CPP refused to recognise the election results and complained of electoral fraud.

On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and persuaded him to head an interim government with the CPP and FUNCINPEC as joint coalition partners. Ranariddh, who had not been consulted, expressed surprise. At the same time, the United States and China opposed the plan, prompting Sihanouk to rescind his decision the following day. On 10 June 1993, CPP leaders led by General Sin Song and Chakrapong threatened to secede eight eastern provinces from Cambodia. Ranariddh feared a civil war with the CPP, which had a much larger army than the ANS.

Accordingly, he accepted the idea of FUNCINPEC working with the CPP, and both parties agreed to a dual prime minister arrangement in the new government. On 14 June, Ranariddh presided over a parliamentary meeting which made Sihanouk the Head of State, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh serving as co-Prime Ministers in an interim government. A new constitution was drafted over the next three months, and was adopted in early September. On 24 September 1993, Sihanouk resigned as the head of state and was reinstated as King of Cambodia. In the new government, Ranariddh and Hun Sen were appointed the First Prime Minister and Second Prime Minister, respectively.

==Co-premiership (1993–1997)==

===Co-operation and co-administration with CPP===
Benny Widyono, the UN secretary-general&#x27;s representative in Cambodia from 1994 to 1997, has observed that although Ranariddh was nominally senior to Hun Sen, he held less executive power. Ranariddh initially viewed Hun Sen with suspicion, but the pair soon developed a close working relationship, agreeing on most policy decisions made until early 1996. In August 1993, while Cambodia was still under the administration of an interim government, Ranariddh and Hun Sen jointly applied to make the country a member in the International Organization of the Francophonie. The decision to enter the Francophonie sparked a debate among students in higher educational institutes, particularly those from the Institute of Technology of Cambodia who called for French to be replaced with English as the language of instruction. In response, Ranariddh encouraged students to simultaneously learn both English and French.

In August 1995, Ranariddh expressed admiration for the political and economic systems of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As he saw it, these countries, characterised by hybrid regimes, active economic interventionism and limited press freedom, served as good models to propel Cambodia&#x27;s socio-economic growth. Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights. In the initial months of the administration, he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries, including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, with a view to encouraging investment in Cambodia. In early 1994, Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) to encourage foreign investment, and served as its chairperson. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, supported Ranariddh&#x27;s plans, and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism, infrastructural development and telecommunications industries.

As the chairman of the CDC, Ranariddh gave his approval to at least 17 business contracts submitted by Malaysian businessmen between August 1994 and January 1995. The projects mostly covered infrastructural development, and included construction of a racing track, power plants and petrol stations. In November 1994, the CDC opened a tender to build a casino near Sihanoukville and proposals submitted by three companies were shortlisted; Ariston Berhad from Malaysia, Unicentral Corporation from Singapore and Hyatt International from the US. Ariston&#x27;s proposal was valued at US$1.3 billion, and included bringing a luxury cruise ship with casino to Cambodia, to be used to accommodate tourists until the Sihanoukville resort was built. Before the tender was even concluded, Ariston&#x27;s ship was brought to Phnom Penh in early December. The Tourism Minister, Veng Sereyvuth suspected that there was backroom dealing activities between CDC and Ariston, who were nevertheless awarded the contract, which Ranariddh signed in January 1995.

In 1992, the UNTAC administration had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued an order to lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies. The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues.

In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.

The logging ban went into force on 31 March 1994, but trees continued to be felled and a new stockpile of timber was created. Ranariddh and Hun Sen gave special authorisation for the lumber to be exported to North Korea. They would continue the practice of periodically lifting export bans and granting special approvals to clear stocks of fallen timber on an on-and off-basis until Ranariddh&#x27;s ouster in 1997. According to Canadian geographer Philippe Le Billon, Ranariddh and Hun Sen tacitly supported continued Khmer Rouge logging activities as it provided a lucrative backdoor source of cash revenue to finance their own political activities. Under Ranariddh&#x27;s co-administration, Malaysia&#x27;s Samling Berhad and Indonesia&#x27;s Macro-Panin were among the largest beneficiaries of government contracts, as these two logging companies, in 1994–1995, secured rights to log 805,000 hectares and 1.4 million hectares of forests, respectively.

===Conflicts within the government===
In October 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen dropped Sam Rainsy as Finance Minister during a cabinet reshuffle. Rainsy had been appointed by Ranariddh in 1993, but both prime ministers became uncomfortable working with Rainsy, because of his pursuit of allegations of government corruption. Rainsy&#x27;s dismissal upset Norodom Sirivudh, who resigned as Foreign Minister the following month. In March 1995, during an academic forum on corruption in Cambodia, Rainsy publicly questioned Ranariddh&#x27;s acceptance of a Fokker 28 airplane and a US$108 million commission from Ariston Berhad. This angered Ranariddh, who expelled him from FUNCINPEC in May 1995. The following month, Ranariddh introduced a parliamentary motion to remove Rainsy as a member of parliament (MP).

In 1995, Ranariddh made calls for capital punishment by calling for murderers and drug traffickers to be executed by the state.

From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh&#x27;s relations with Hun Sen began to show signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh&#x27;s liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen&#x27;s response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.

In February 1996, Ranariddh expressed concern over repeated delays in the construction of the resort-cum-casino complex at Sihanoukville, for which he had signed an agreement with Ariston in January 1995. Ariston blamed the lack of a governmental authority in Sihanoukville for the delay. At the end of April 1996, the government formed the Sihanoukville Developmental Authority (SDA) to oversee regulatory affairs and facilitate development. At a conference in May 1996, Ranariddh charged that CPP-controlled ministries were deliberately delaying the paperwork needed to complete the approval of Ariston&#x27;s project.

According to Tioulong Saumura, the former deputy governor of Cambodia&#x27;s Central Bank (and Sam Rainsy&#x27;s wife), the delays were part of Hun Sen&#x27;s strategy to undermine projects associated with Ranariddh. In an apparent act of retaliation, Ranariddh directed FUNCINPEC&#x27;s co-minister of the interior, You Hockry to close down all casinos in the country, citing the absence of authorising legislation. Ranariddh also proposed the cancellation of Ariston&#x27;s contracts due to the delays. Hun Sen responded by meeting with Mahathir, and assured him that agreements which Ranariddh had previously approved would be honoured.

At a FUNCINPEC congress in March 1996, Ranariddh expressed unhappiness over his relationship with Hun Sen and the CPP. He likened his position as prime minister, and those of the FUNCINPEC ministers, to &quot;puppets&quot;. He also questioned the CPP over their delays in appointing FUNCINPEC local officials as district chiefs. Ranariddh threatened to dissolve the National Assembly before the end of 1996, should FUNCINPEC&#x27;s concerns remain unresolved.

Several FUNCINPEC MPs, including Loy Sim Chheang and Ahmad Yahya, called on Ranariddh to reconcile with Sam Rainsy and work with the newly formed Khmer Nation Party (KNP) in the forthcoming general election. On 27 April 1996 Ranariddh, while vacationing in Paris, attended a meeting with Sihanouk, Rainsy, Chakrapong and Sirivudh. A few days later, Sihanouk issued a declaration praising Hun Sen and the CPP, while also stating that FUNCINPEC had no intention of leaving the coalition government. According to Widyono, Sihanouk&#x27;s statement was an attempt to defuse the tension between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.

Hun Sen rejected the king&#x27;s conciliatory overtures, and responded by publishing several public letters attacking Sihanouk, Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC. At a CPP party meeting on 29 June 1996, Hun Sen chided Ranariddh for not following through on his March threat to leave the coalition government and called him a &quot;real dog&quot;. At the same time, Hun Sen urged provincial governors from the CPP not attend Ranariddh&#x27;s rallies.

===Conflict escalation and military clashes===
In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary publicly split, with the former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge and went on to form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. This prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary&#x27;s favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he convinced Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary&#x27;s charge to join the CPP. Ranariddh canceled a follow-up visit to Samlout, another town located within Ieng Sary&#x27;s fiefdom, when Sary&#x27;s soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh&#x27;s helicopter if he went there.

In September 1996 Ariston Berhad signed three agreements with CPP&#x27;s minister Sok An, without Ranariddh&#x27;s knowledge or that of other FUNCINPEC ministers. The agreements provided for the leasing of land to Ariston to develop a golf course, holiday resort and an airport in Sihanoukville. These actions angered Ranariddh, who in a February 1997 letter to Ariston&#x27;s president Chen Lip Keong, declared the agreements null and void. Subsequently, Ariston claimed that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact FUNCINPEC officials, with a view to getting them to jointly sign the agreements. Hun Sen was offended by Ranariddh&#x27;s actions, and in April 1997 wrote to Mahathir assuring him of the validity of the agreements.

Ranariddh forged a political coalition by bringing FUNCINPEC to work together with the KNP, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party and the Khmer Neutral Party. On 27 January 1997, the four political parties formalised their alliance, which became known as the &quot;National United Front&quot; (NUF). Ranariddh was nominated as the president of the NUF, and stated his intent to lead the alliance against the CPP, in the general elections scheduled to be held in 1998. The CPP issued a statement condemning NUF&#x27;s formation, and formed a rival coalition consisting of political parties ideologically aligned to the former Khmer Republic.

Meanwhile, Ranariddh stepped up his attacks against Hun Sen, accusing him of harbouring plans to restore a Communist regime should the CPP win the next general election. At the same time Ranariddh attempted to persuade moderate leaders of the Khmer Rouge, including Khieu Samphan and Tep Kunnal, to join the NUF. Khieu Samphan accepted Ranariddh&#x27;s overtures, and on 21 May 1997, put the support of his party, the Khmer National Solidarity Party (KNSP), behind the NUF. On 4 June 1997, Ranariddh and Samphan signed a communiqué pledging mutual support.

Five days later, customs officials at Sihanoukville discovered a three-ton shipment of rocket launchers, assault rifles and handguns, labelled &quot;spare parts&quot; and consigned to Ranariddh. The rocket launchers were seized by Cambodian Air Force officers aligned to the CPP, while Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) officials aligned to FUNCINPEC were allowed to keep the light weapons. In mid-June, Khmer Rouge radio, controlled by Khieu Samphan, broadcast a speech praising the KNSP-NUF alliance and calling for an armed struggle against Hun Sen. Fighting subsequently broke out between Ranariddh&#x27;s and Hun Sen&#x27;s bodyguards.

In response Hun Sen issued an ultimatum, calling for Ranariddh to make a choice between siding with the Khmer Rouge or with the coalition government. Eleven days later, he stopped working with Ranariddh altogether. On 3 July 1997, while travelling to Phnom Penh, Ranariddh encountered troops aligned to the CPP. These troops persuaded his bodyguards to surrender their weapons, which prompted him to flee Cambodia the following day. On 5 July, fighting broke out between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC, after CPP-aligned generals unsuccessfully attempted to coax FUNCINPEC-aligned troops into surrendering their weapons. The FUNCINPEC-aligned units suffered major casualties the following day, and subsequently fled from Phnom Penh to the border town of O Smach in Oddar Meanchey Province.

==Continued leadership in FUNCINPEC (1997–2006)==

===Exile, return and 1998 elections===
The defeat of FUNCINPEC-aligned troops in the military clashes on 6 July 1997 amounted to the effective ouster of Ranariddh. On 9 July 1997, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry issued a white paper labelling Ranariddh a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;traitor&quot;, as well as accusing him of conspiring with the Khmer Rouge to destabilise the government. Ranariddh travelled to the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia, where he met with Fidel Ramos, Goh Chok Tong and Suharto to seek their help in his restoration. During his absence, at a party meeting on 16 July 1997, Ung Huot was nominated by FUNCINPEC MPs loyal to Hun Sen to replace Ranariddh as First Prime Minister.

Huot was subsequently endorsed as First Prime Minister during a National Assembly sitting on 6 August 1997. A few days later, Sihanouk expressed his unhappiness over the clashes, and threatened to abdicate the throne and take over the premiership. Sihanouk also claimed that Ranariddh&#x27;s ouster was unconstitutional, and initially refused to endorse Ung Huot&#x27;s appointment, but later relented when Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states supported Ung Huot&#x27;s appointment.

In September 1997, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan met separately with Ranariddh and Hun Sen, to mediate the return of FUNCINPEC politicians and prepare for the 1998 Cambodian general elections. The UN proposed that its representatives monitor the elections, to which both Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed, but Hun Sen insisted that Ranariddh be prepared to face court charges, to which Ranariddh responded with a threat to boycott the election.

At O Smach, FUNCINPEC-aligned troops fought along with the Khmer Rouge forces against CPP-aligned troops until February 1998, when a ceasefire brokered by the Japanese government came into effect. In March 1998, Ranariddh was convicted in absentia by a military court of illegally smuggling ammunitions in May 1997, and of colluding with the Khmer Rouge to cause instability in the country. He was sentenced to a total of 35 years&#x27; imprisonment, but this was nullified by a pardon from Sihanouk. Ranariddh returned to Cambodia at the end of March 1998 to lead FUNCINPEC&#x27;s election campaign, which focused on pro-monarchical sentiments and anti-Vietnamese rhetoric.

FUNCINPEC faced numerous obstacles, including lack of access to television and radio channels which had come under CPP&#x27;s exclusive control following the 1997 clashes, and the difficulties of its supporters in getting to party rallies. In the vote on 26 July 1998, FUNCINPEC polled 31.7 percent and secured 43 out of a total of 122 parliamentary seats. The CPP won the elections by polling 41.4 percent of all votes and securing 64 parliamentary seats. The Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), Rainsy&#x27;s renamed KNP, was in third place with 14.3 percent of the vote and 15 parliamentary seats.

Both Ranariddh and Rainsy protested against the election results, claiming that the CPP-led government had intimidated voters and tampered with ballot boxes. They filed petitions with the National Election Commission (NEC) and Constitutional Court; when these were rejected in August 1998, Ranariddh and Rainsy organised street protests to demand that Hun Sen relinquish power. The government responded on 7 September 1998, by banning street protests and cracking down on participants. At this point Sihanouk intervened, and arranged a summit meeting on 24 September 1998 in Siem Reap. He summoned Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Rainsy for discussions aimed at ending the political impasse.

On the day of the summit meeting, a B40 rocket was fired from an RPG-2 rocket launcher at the direction of Hun Sen&#x27;s motorcade, who was travelling en route to Siem Reap. The rocket missed the motorcade, and Hun Sen escaped unhurt. The police accused FUNCINPEC and SRP leaders of plotting the attack, with Rainsy as its ringleader. Both Ranariddh and Rainsy denied any involvement, but fled to Bangkok the following day, fearing government crackdowns on their parties.

===President of the National Assembly (1998–2006)===

Following Ranariddh&#x27;s departure, Sihanouk urged him to return with a view to joining the CPP in a coalition government, reckoning that FUNCINPEC faced the prospect of breaking up if Ranariddh refused. Ranariddh returned to Cambodia on 12 November 1998 to attend a summit meeting hosted by Sihanouk, at which Ranariddh negotiated with Hun Sen and Chea Sim over the structure of a new government. An agreement was reached whereby FUNCINPEC would be given the National Assembly presidency together with several low and mid-level cabinet posts, in exchange for its support for the creation of the Cambodian Senate. On 25 November 1998, Ranariddh was nominated as the President of the National Assembly. According to Mehta, the creation of the Senate was to provide an alternative platform to pass legislation in the event that Ranariddh exerted his influence as the President of the National Assembly to block legislation.

After his appointment, Ranariddh worked with Hun Sen to re-integrate the FUNCINPEC-aligned troops into the RCAF. He also participated in efforts to foster better relations with Vietnam, and liaised with the Vietnamese National Assembly president Nông Đức Mạnh to develop friendship and cooperation initiatives. This led to several mutual visits between Cambodian and Vietnamese political leaders, between 1999 and 2000, but relations between Cambodia and Vietnam deteriorated from September 2000 onwards amid renewed border clashes. Ranariddh steered FUNCINPEC towards political rapprochement with the CPP, and actively discouraged FUNCINPEC ministers and MPs from criticising their CPP counterparts. During the party&#x27;s congress in March 2001, Ranariddh declared the CPP an &quot;eternal partner&quot;.

As early as 1999, a sizeable minority of FUNCINPEC&#x27;s politicians were unhappy with Ranariddh&#x27;s leadership, as rumours began to circulate that he had accepted bribes from the CPP. In February 2002, FUNCINPEC performed poorly in the commune elections, winning 10 out of 1,600 commune seats. As a result of FUNCINPEC&#x27;s poor performance in the commune elections, rifts within the party boiled into the open. In March 2002, the Deputy Commander-in-chief of the RCAF – Khan Savoeun, accused You Hockry, the co-Minister of the Interior, of corruption and nepotism, acts which Savoeun claimed had alienated voters.

When Ranariddh expressed support for Savoeun in May 2002, Hockry resigned. Around the same time, two new political parties, splintered from FUNCINPEC, were formed: the Khmer Soul Party, led by Norodom Chakrapong, and the Hang Dara Democratic Party, led by Hang Dara. Both new parties attracted sizeable numbers of FUNCINPEC defectors, who were apparently unhappy with Ranariddh&#x27;s leadership. The defections caused Ranariddh to fear that FUNCINPEC would fare poorly in the 2003 general elections.

When general elections were held in July 2003, the CPP won, while FUNCINPEC polled 20.8 percent of the popular vote and secured 26 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats. This marked an 11 percentage point drop in FUNCINPEC&#x27;s share of the popular vote compared with 1998. Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, whose SRP had also participated in the elections, expressed unhappiness with the outcome of the election, and once again accused the CPP of winning through fraud and voter intimidation. They also refused to support a CPP-led government, which needed the joint support of more MPs from FUNCINPEC or SRP to attain the two-thirds majority in forming a new government.

Subsequently, in August 2003, Ranariddh and Rainsy formed a new political alliance, the &quot;Alliance of Democrats&quot; (AD), and together they lobbied upon the CPP to form a three-party government consisting of the CPP, FUNCINPEC and the SRP. At the same time, they also called for Hun Sen to step down and a reform of the NEC, which they claimed was stacked with pro-CPP appointees. Hun Sen rejected their demands, bringing several months of political stalemate.

In March 2004, Ranariddh privately proposed to Hun Sen that FUNCINPEC should join CPP in the new government as a junior coalition partner. Discussions between CPP and FUNCINPEC began on the composition of the coalition government and legislative procedures. An agreement was reached in June 2004, when Ranariddh walked out of his alliance with Rainsy, dropped his demands to reform the NEC and once again pledged to support Hun Sen as Prime Minister. Hun Sen also pressured Ranariddh into supporting a constitutional amendment known as a &quot;package vote&quot;, which required MPs to support legislation and ministerial appointments by an open show of hands.

While Ranariddh acquiesced to Hun Sen&#x27;s demand, the &quot;package vote&quot; amendment was opposed by Sihanouk, Chea Sim, the SRP as well as several senior leaders within FUNCINPEC. After the &quot;package vote&quot; amendment was passed in July 2004, several FUNCINPEC leaders resigned in protest. Ranariddh, who remained as President of the National Assembly as part of the agreement, attempted to lure SRP leaders into defecting to FUNCINPEC with the promise of jobs within the government. At least one senior SRP leader, Ou Bun Long, caved into Ranariddh&#x27;s enticements.

===Exit from FUNCINPEC===

On 2 March 2006, the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment which required only a simple majority of parliamentarians to support a government, instead of the two-thirds majority that was previously stipulated. Rainsy had first proposed the amendment in February 2006, who had hoped that a simple majority would make it easier for his party to form a government should they win in future elections. The following day after the constitutional amendment was passed, Hun Sen relieved Norodom Sirivudh and Nhek Bun Chhay of their posts as FUNCINPEC&#x27;s co-minister of interior and co-minister of defense respectively. Ranariddh protested against the dismissals, and resigned as the President of the National Assembly on 14 March. He then left Cambodia, to reside in France. Shortly after his departure, local tabloids published stories that Ranariddh had had an affair with Ouk Phalla, an Apsara dancer.

In early September 2006, a new law was passed to outlaw adultery, and Ranariddh responded by accusing the government of attempting to undermine FUNCINPEC. On 18 September 2006, Hun Sen and Nhek Bun Chhay called for Ranariddh to be replaced as FUNCINPEC&#x27;s president, after party reports suggested that Phalla had lobbied Ranariddh to appoint her relatives to government posts. On 18 October 2006, Nhek Bun Chhay convened a party congress which dismissed Ranariddh from his position as FUNCINPEC&#x27;s president. In turn, he was given the titular position of &quot;Historic President&quot;. At the congress, Nhek Bun Chhay justified Ranariddh&#x27;s ouster on the grounds of his deteriorating relations with Hun Sen as well as his practice of spending prolonged periods of time overseas.

==Later political activities (2006–2021)==

===Norodom Ranariddh Party, exile and retirement===

Following Ranariddh&#x27;s exit from FUNCINPEC, Nhek Bun Chhay filed a lawsuit in November 2006, accusing Ranariddh of pocketing $3.6 million from the sale of its headquarters to the French embassy in 2005. In mid-November, Ranariddh returned to Cambodia and formed the Norodom Ranariddh Party (NRP), of which he became its president. The following month, the National Assembly expelled Ranariddh as an MP. Within days his wife, Eng Marie, sued him for adultery. Ranariddh&#x27;s half-brother Chakrapong was also expelled from the party, and joined the NRP as the party&#x27;s deputy president.

In March 2007, Ranariddh was convicted by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court of embezzlement of the sale proceeds of FUNCINPEC headquarters, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. To avoid imprisonment, Ranariddh sought asylum in Malaysia shortly before the sentencing.

While living in exile in Malaysia, Ranariddh communicated to NRP party members and supporters through telephone and video conferencing. In November 2007, he proposed a merger between the NRP, SRP and the Human Rights Party, to better their prospects against the CPP in the 2008 general elections. Rainsy, the leader of the SRP, rejected his proposal. When the election campaign began in June 2008, Ranariddh, though not able to enter the country, raised issues such as border disputes with Cambodia&#x27;s neighbours, illegal logging, and promised to lower petrol prices.

When voting took place in July, the NRP won two parliamentary seats. Immediately after the election, the NRP joined the SRP and the HRP in charging the Election Commission with irregularities. The NRP subsequently dropped their accusations, after Hun Sen brokered a secret deal with Ranariddh which allowed the latter to return from exile, in exchange for the NRP&#x27;s recognition of the election results.

In September 2008, Ranariddh received a royal pardon from Sihamoni (who had succeeded to the throne in October 2004) for his embezzlement conviction, allowing him to return to Cambodia without risking imprisonment.

Following his return, Ranariddh retired from politics and pledged to support the CPP-led government. He dedicated most of his time to philanthropic work and supporting royal activities. In late 2010, NRP and FUNCINPEC leaders including Nhek Bun Chhay publicly called for Ranariddh to return to politics. Ranariddh initially resisted the calls, but changed his mind and returned in December 2010. For the next one-and-a-half years, Ranariddh and Nhek Bun Chhay negotiated a merger between NRP and FUNCINPEC. An agreement was formalised in May 2012, whereby Ranariddh would be made the president of FUNCINPEC, while Nhek Bun Chhay would become its vice-president. The merger agreement was rescinded a month later, when Nhek Bun Chhay accused Ranariddh of supporting other opposition parties. Two months later, Ranariddh retired from politics for a second time and resigned as the president of NRP.

===Community of Royalist People&#x27;s Party===

In March 2014, Ranariddh came out of retirement to launch a new political party, the Community of Royalist People&#x27;s Party (CRPP). Sam Rainsy, now president of the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), accused Ranariddh of intending to split the opposition vote to favour the ruling CPP in future elections. Ranariddh responded by accusing the CNRP of harbouring republican sentiments, while also stating that his motivation in launching CRPP was to reunite royalist supporters within the Cambodian electorate. The CRPP attracted support from some senior FUNCINPEC party members; in December 2014 an ex-secretary of state, a senator and a deputy police chief declared their support for the CRPP. Hun Sen then proposed to Ranariddh that he return to FUNCINPEC.

===Return to FUNCINPEC===

In January 2015, Ranariddh dissolved the CRPP and returned to FUNCINPEC. At a party congress on 19 January 2015, he was reappointed FUNCINPEC president; his half-sister and previous FUNCINPEC president, Norodom Arunrasmy, became the first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed second vice-president. In March 2015, Ranariddh held another party congress where he appointed four more vice-presidents to the FUNCINPEC executive committee. He also convinced the congress to adopt a new party logo, which had a design almost identical that of the now-defunct CRPP.

Ranariddh supported the formation of the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for FUNCINPEC from younger voters, of which he was appointed its honorary president. In November 2017, he returned to the National Assembly as a member of parliament, following the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, after which the FUNCINPEC received 41 of the 55 vacated seats. The party performed poorly in the 2018 general election, failing to win a single seat in the National Assembly. Though they were runners-up behind the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party, their tally of popular vote was fewer than the 594,659 invalid ballots cast by disenfranchised supporters of the former opposition.

==Palace relations==

===Awards and royal appointments===

In June 1993 Ranariddh was granted the Cambodian royal title of &quot;Sdech Krom Luong&quot; (Khmer: ស្ដេចក្រុមលួង), which translates as &quot;Senior Prince&quot; in English. Five months later, in November 1993, he was elevated to the rank of &quot;Samdech Krom Preah&quot; (Khmer: សម្ដេចក្រុមព្រះ), or &quot;Leading Senior Prince&quot; in English, in recognition of his efforts to re-instate Sihanouk as the King of Cambodia. Ranariddh has been a recipient of several awards from the palace; in December 1992 he was decorated as the Grand Officer of the Royal Order of Cambodia. In May 2001 he received the Grand Order of National Merit and in October 2001 was awarded the Order of Sovatara, with the class of Mohasereivadh. He was also awarded the Grand Officer de l&#x27;Ordre de la Pleaide by the La Francophonie in March 2000.

In December 2008, Sihamoni appointed Ranariddh as President of the Supreme Privy Council of Cambodia, equivalent in rank to that of prime minister, and, during an interview in December 2010 Ranariddh revealed that this royal appointment entitled him to a monthly salary of three million riels (about United States dollar750).

===Candidacy to the throne===

Debates on the succession to the throne began in November 1993, shortly after Sihanouk was diagnosed with cancer. In a 1995 poll of 700 people conducted by the Khmer Journalists&#x27; Associations, 24 percent of respondents preferred Ranariddh to take the throne, although a larger proportion indicated no preference over any members of the royal family. In a March 1996 interview with the &quot;Cambodia Daily&quot;, Sihanouk encouraged Ranariddh to succeed him as king, but also expressed concern that a leadership vacuum within FUNCINPEC would occur, should Ranariddh accede.

Sihanouk repeated these concerns in an interview with the &quot;Phnom Penh Post&quot; in February 1997. Sihanouk mentioned Sihamoni as another potential candidate, despite the latter&#x27;s view that the responsibilities attached to the throne were &quot;frightening&quot;. Sihamoni&#x27;s candidacy found favour with Hun Sen and Chea Sim, because of his non-involvement in politics.

In two reports from 1993 and 1996, Ranariddh rejected the notion of becoming the next king. In November 1997, Ranariddh suggested that his outspoken and passionate personality made him an unsuitable candidate for the throne. However, by March 1999 Ranariddh became more receptive to the idea of succeeding his father. In early 2001, in an interview to Harish Mehta, Ranariddh discussed his conflicting desires between taking the throne and staying in politics.

In November 2001, Ranariddh told the &quot;Cambodia Daily&quot; that he had decided to prioritize his political career over the throne. In the same interview, he added that Sihamoni had in the past supported him to become the next king. In September 2004, Ranariddh revealed that although he had been offered the throne by both Sihanouk and Monineath, who was Sihamoni&#x27;s mother, he would prefer to see Sihamoni take the throne. When the throne council convened in October 2004 to select Sihanouk&#x27;s successor, Ranariddh was part of the council which unanimously chose Norodom Sihamoni to be the next king.

==Personal life and death==

Ranariddh was known for his physical resemblance to his father Sihanouk, inheriting his facial features, high-pitched voice and mannerisms. Contemporaries including Harish Mehta, Lee Kuan Yew and Benny Widyono (Oei Hong Lan) have so stated after meeting with him. An opinion poll conducted in July 1997 by the Cambodian Information Centre also supports similar observations of Ranariddh&#x27;s physical resemblance to Sihanouk. Journalists such as those from the &quot;Phnom Penh Post&quot; have observed that Ranariddh had used his resemblance to canvass support for FUNCINPEC during the 1993 and 1998 general elections. Ranariddh acknowledged these observations during an interview with Mehta in 2001, saying:

People adore the king and I look like him. It is not my achievement they are remembering, but the deeds of my father. On the contrary, if I fail the people would say &quot;Oh, you are the son, but you are not like your father&quot;. It&#x27;s rather a burden.

Ranariddh spoke Khmer, French and English fluently. He also held dual Cambodian and French citizenship, having obtained the latter in 1979. He enjoyed listening to music and watching films, though in a 2001 interview he described himself as lacking the artistic talent which Sihanouk possessed. In 2002, Ranariddh produced and directed a 90-minute film, titled &quot;Raja Bori&quot;, which was shot at Angkor Wat.

On 28 November 2021, Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith announced that Ranariddh had died at the age of 77 in France.

===Family===

Ranariddh had 12 half-siblings from his father by different wives; Norodom Buppha Devi is his only full-sibling. Buppha Devi became a ballet dancer, like her mother Phat Kanhol had been during her younger days. Kanhol remarried in 1947 to a military officer, Chap Huot, and had five children with him. Phat Kanhol died from cancer in February 1969 at the age of 49, while Chap Huot was killed in an explosion a year later. Four of Ranariddh&#x27;s half-siblings by his mother and Chap Huot were killed during the Khmer Rouge years, while one of them, Chap Nhalyvoud, survived. Chap Nhalyvoud served as the governor of Siem Reap Province between 1998 and 2004.

Ranariddh met his first wife, Eng Marie, in early 1968. Marie was the eldest child of Eng Meas, an Interior Ministry official of Sino-Khmer descent, and Sarah Hay, a Muslim of Cham ethnicity. Marie had nine younger siblings, and among them was Roland Eng, the former ambassador to Thailand and the United States. The couple married in September 1968 at the royal palace, and had three children: Chakravuth (born 1970), Sihariddh (born 1972) and Rattana Devi (born 1974).

The couple separated, and Marie filed for divorce in March 2006 when Ranariddh&#x27;s relationship with Ouk Phalla became known. The divorce was not finalised until June 2010. Ranariddh had two sons with Ouk Phalla: Sothearidh (born 2003) and Ranavong (born 2011). Phalla was a descendant of King Sisowath and was a classical dancer. She met Ranariddh when the latter was producing and directing the film &quot;Raja Bori&quot;.

On 17 June 2018, Ranariddh and Ouk Phalla were both seriously injured in a car accident en route to Sihanoukville Province. Ouk Phalla died hours later as a result of her injuries. In 2019, Ranariddh went to Paris to receive medical treatment for a broken pelvis.

<doc id="972363" wikidata="Q238580" url="?curid=972363" title="Janine Lindemulder">
<text>Janine Lindemulder (born November 14, 1968) is an American pornographic actress, often credited mononymously as Janine. She is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame. In 1999, she was pictured on the album artwork for punk rock band Blink-182&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Enema of the State&quot;.

==Early career==
After graduating from high school in 1986, Lindemulder worked as a stripper. She answered an ad looking for a figure model, not knowing &quot;figure model&quot; meant nude model. After meeting with the photographer who posted the ad, he asked her to do a spread for &quot;Penthouse&quot;, a men&#x27;s magazine. Lindemulder made her first appearance in the December 1987 issue, as the Pet of the Month. She appeared several more times in &quot;Penthouse&quot; over the next ten years as well as other men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Gallery&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot;, and was chosen as Pet of the Year Runner-Up for 1990.

==Career==
===Adult film career===
Lindemulder came to prominence performing in lesbian pornography for film distributor Vivid Video in the 1990s. Together with fellow adult film performer Julia Ann, Lindemulder also formed the exotic dancing duo &quot;Blondage&quot; who headlined several videos for Vivid. Blondage was featured in an early issue of the Carnal Comics comic book title True Stories of Adult Film Stars, which included a story written by Lindemulder.

===Modeling and acting===
In 1997, Lindemulder played the wife of a camp director in the Howard Stern film &quot;Private Parts&quot;. She also appeared on Stern&#x27;s television and radio shows as a featured guest. Lindemulder was the cover model for Blink-182&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Enema of the State,&quot; and appeared in their video for the song &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; as a nurse.

===Retirement and comeback===
In 1999, Lindemulder announced that she was leaving the adult film industry to pursue a career as a kindergarten teacher. She added that another reason she was retiring was to focus more on raising her son. She was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2002, and her retirement lasted until April 2004, when she announced that she would be making a comeback – now, for the first time, performing with men. She signed with her former company, Vivid Video, and starred in eight new films. Her first film scene with a male was with Nick Manning in &quot;Maneater.&quot; After her comeback deal with Vivid expired, Lindemulder signed with Vivid rival Digital Playground and starred in a handful of features for them, including &quot;Pirates&quot; in 2005.

In January 2006 she won two AVN Awards. Her April 2007 film &quot;Janine Loves Jenna&quot; co-stars Jenna Jameson.

Lindemulder appeared in front of a camera for the first time in five years in the 2017 documentary &quot;After Porn Ends 2&quot;, covering her rise to fame, her &quot;Blondage&quot; act, her mental unpreparedness for the realities of being famous and the post-effects of her custody battle for her daughter with television personality Jesse James.

Lindemulder has an OnlyFans account, which she started in 2017.

==Personal life==
Lindemulder appeared in a sex tape with her then-boyfriend Mötley Crüe lead singer Vince Neil, and former Penthouse model Brandy Ledford.
Lindemulder was married to West Coast Choppers founder Jesse James from 2002 until 2004.

===Legal issues and custody battle===
In August 2008, Lindemulder pleaded guilty to federal misdemeanor charges of willful failure to pay federal income taxes. She had failed to pay nearly $300,000 in back taxes. She had made a down payment on a $647,000 house and bought two new vehicles – despite being aware of her tax debt obligations. She faced up to one year in prison, and a $100,000 fine.

In December 2008, Lindemulder began serving a six-month federal prison sentence for tax evasion. The judge also ordered that she live in a residential community corrections center for up to six months after her release from prison, that she complete one year of supervised release, and that she repay the federal government $294,000 in back taxes.

During Lindemulder&#x27;s incarceration, Jesse James was awarded custody of their daughter. Upon Lindemulder&#x27;s release, James and Lindemulder engaged in a custody battle over their daughter. Lindemulder had weekly visitation rights limited to daytime hours. Her request for expanded visitation rights was denied by an Orange County family court.

<text>Tweed, Ontario is a community on Stoco Lake and the only urban centre of the Municipality of Tweed in Hastings County, central-eastern Ontario, Canada. It had a population of 1,701 in the 2016 census. The principal thoroughfare is Highway 37.

==History==
Tweed was first settled in the 1830s, originally named Hungerford Mills, after the surrounding township of Hungerford. The settlement was renamed Tweed after the River Tweed in Scotland. The economic development of the community was enabled by lumbering and mining developments during the mid-19th century. Tweed became a service centre for area farmers. It was incorporated as a Village in 1891.

In 1967, Tweed was the site of the first all-women municipal council in Canada.

In 1998, Tweed was amalgamated with the Township of Hungerford and the Township of Elzevir &amp; Grimsthorpe to form the Municipality of Tweed.

==Select events==
In 1996 the town made news when resident Presbyterian minister Larry Turner and Russel Moon applied for a CFL team, in an attempt to become the Green Bay of Canada. Had the attempt been successful, the team would have been known as the Tweed Muskies.

In 1989 the Ottawa branch of the Elvis Sighting Society declared Elvis was alive and well and living in Tweed. Since that time, an &quot;Elvis is Alive&quot; festival has been held in July every year. More recently Tweed and Elvis made the headlines when a reporter from the Toronto Sun came to investigate if there was truth to the rumours. The only evidence that remains now that Elvis may have ever been in the community is a very short road now called Elvis Lane. Oddly enough not far from the proposed site of the Tweed Muskies stadium.

Between 2007 and 2009, a series of crimes occurred in Tweed and neighbouring Cosy Cove including 2 sexual assaults, but mainly numerous thefts of women&#x27;s undergarments and clothing. In February 2010 Jessica Lloyd of nearby Belleville was found dead in Tweed after Russell Williams led police to her body, confessing to her murder, as well as that of Cpl. Marie-France Comeau, a military flight attendant stationed at CFB Trenton, but living in neighboring Brighton. Williams pleaded guilty to all charges on October 18, 2010.

==Notable people==
* Former Chief Justice of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Patrick Lesage was born in Tweed.
* Michael Ondaatje has a holiday house in the area and is occasionally sighted in the village.
*Jack Vance, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, who died in Tweed in 2013.

==Transportation==

The history of Tweed became entwined with the Canadian Pacific Railway when, in 1884, Canadian Pacific (through its indirectly managed subsidiary, the Ontario and Quebec Railway, or O&amp;Q) constructed a line through the village of Tweed. This placed Tweed in between two junctions between the O&amp;Q and other significant rail lines: the Central Ontario Railway (COR), which connected to the O&amp;Q line at Bonarlaw to the west, and the Kingston and Pembroke Railway (K&amp;P), which connected at Sharbot Lake to the east. This positioned the O&amp;Q line as CP&#x27;s east-west mainline connecting these Eastern Ontario locations with Toronto, and creating valuable connection points for freight brought in from the fully independent COR and K&amp;R lines. In 1889, Tweed became a junction in its own right when the Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway (which would be reorganized under the Bay of Quinte Railway, or BQ, in 1881) was extended north to it. In a final push, BQ would extend their line another to Bannockburn in 1903, where it crossed the COR before terminating.

Over the next hundred years, the historic short line railways were gradually assimilated into the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National rail conglomerates; CP managed the O&amp;Q as an internal part of the company, and the O&amp;Q itself laid essentially dormant, with the line being referred to internally as the Havelock Subdivision. Meanwhile, the COR was acquired by a succession of interests including the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in 1911, which was nationalized in 1918 and merged into Canadian National in 1923; thereafter, the COR became CN&#x27;s Maynooth Subdivision. After the K&amp;P encountered financial difficulties, Canadian Pacific negotiated a lease for the entire company and line in 1912, which ended the K&amp;P as a legal entity and turned it into CP&#x27;s Kingston Subdivision (not to be confused with the CN Kingston Subdivision). Finally, the Bay of Quinte Railway also became a part of CN, but was gradually abandoned, starting with the Tweed to Bannockburn section in 1935, then the Tweed to Yarker section in 1941, thus ending Tweed&#x27;s nearly 50-year history as a rail junction.

The problems with the O&amp;Q came to a head in the early 1970s as CP began to quietly sell off the company&#x27;s assets and pursue abandonment of sections of the line. In the midst of a $422 million lawsuit with the company&#x27;s minority shareholders over the profits from sell-off of the company&#x27;s assets, CP abandoned the section from Glen Tay to Tweed, thus making Tweed the end of the line. Legal proceedings at a provincial level stretched from 1977 to 1978, when the Ontario Supreme Court ruled that CP had acted illegally in its management of the company, including abandonment of sections of the line over several decades, and that CP had violated the terms of its lease, which required it to &quot;efficiently work, maintain and keep in good order and repair, the said railway and the rolling stock and appurtances ... and all the property hereby demised.&quot; Canadian Pacific continued the legal battle and, in 1987, won its appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. In the same year, it abandoned the Havelock to Tweed section, ending its hundred-year presence in the village of Tweed.

In the late 2010s, Via Rail began to promote the idea of high-frequency rail (HFR), which would potentially bring passenger rail service to Tweed again. Via&#x27;s HFR plan is currently not finalized.

He is known for his characters and celebrity impersonations, including Jerry Jones and Tiger Woods.

=== Nestor/Keith feud===
A long-running feud has existed between members of The Ticket and Nestor Aparicio, an American sports writer and radio personality. On January 30, 2009, during Super Bowl week in Tampa, Florida, while roaming the Radio Row with a wireless microphone, Keith approached Aparicio in an alleged attempt to bury the hatchet. Aparicio assaulted Keith before the scuffle was broken up by Super Bowl security. The incident was broadcast live during The Ticket&#x27;s morning show.

The Gordon Keith character is unseen, a deceased mob assassin who links several other supporting characters together.

<text>The Coast Guard Honor Guard Badge is a qualification badge of the United States Coast Guard which recognizes those personnel who are/have been permanently assigned to the Ceremonial Honor Guard Unit at the U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Cyber and Intelligence Service Center (C5ISC), Alexandria, Virginia. The badge was inspired by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge.

==Qualification ==

<doc id="972379" wikidata="Q1974260" url="?curid=972379" title="Nefyn">
<text>Nefyn (, archaically anglicised as Nevin) is a town and community on the northwest coast of the Llŷn Peninsula, Gwynedd, Wales. Nefyn is popular with visitors for its sandy beach, and has one substantial hotel, a community pub and a beach cafe. The A497 road terminates in the town centre.

The community includes Edern and Morfa Nefyn. In 2011, the population was 2,602, with Nefyn itself having 1,373 people.

==History==
The history of the area can be traced back to 300 BC with the Iron Age hillfort of Garn Boduan overlooking Nefyn. The remains of 170 round stone huts and ramparts are still visible on top of the hill.

The earliest known reference to Nefyn in documents dates from the latter part of the 11th century, when it is mentioned as a landing place of the Welsh prince, Gruffudd ap Cynan.

Gerald of Wales, writing in his account of a journey around Wales in 1188, says that he slept at Nefyn on the eve of Palm Sunday.

Nefyn was the location of the court of the commote of Dinlaen: part of the cantref of Llŷn.

Edward I of England held a jousting tournament in the town in 1284 to celebrate his victory over the Welsh, emphasising its importance at that time as a trading town. In 1355, it became a free borough and remained an important centre of commerce.

The sea was always an important part of the economy of Nefyn; and fishing, particularly for herring, became the prime trade for most of the 18th and 19th centuries: so much so that the town&#x27;s coat of arms bears three herrings. Herring were locally referred to as &quot;Nefyn beef&quot;. In 1910, Nefyn had 40 herring fishing boats, but herring fishing ceased around the time of the First World War. The area nurtured many ships&#x27; captains in the age of sail, and shipbuilding was also an important local industry. About 3 miles to the south-west is Madryn Castle, home of Sir Love Jones-Parry, 1st Baronet, one of the founders of the settlement of Puerto Madryn in Argentina.

===Parish church and origin of the name Nefyn===
The foundations of the old St Mary&#x27;s parish church date from the 6th century, although the present building was erected in 1827. It would have been an important staging post for pilgrimages to Ynys Enlli (Bardsey Island). The old church is no longer a place of worship but houses a museum dedicated to the maritime history of Nefyn. Since 2013, archaeologists have been investigating the area under the church and have uncovered a 13th–14th century brooch and the remains of a lady buried sometime between 1180 and 1250 in an older form of entombment called a cist grave.

The place name is of uncertain origin. It is recorded as &quot;Newin&quot; in 1291, and as &quot;Nefyn&quot; in 1291. It may represent a personal name. The official spelling of the name was changed from Nevin to Nefyn in 1955.

The Romans recorded a tribe occupying the peninsula called the &#x27;Gangani&#x27;, who are also recorded as a tribe in Ireland.
===20th century and after===

Nefyn &amp; District Golf Club was formed in 1907. The course added a further 9 holes in 1912 and a third set of 9 holes in 1933. The current course is made up of a front ten with a choice of two back eights. It is set high on the sea cliffs of the narrow peninsula overlooking Porthdinllaen bay.

Since 1929, Nefyn has played host to a Beach Mission, which runs for two weeks at the beginning of August each year.

Nefyn football club, Nefyn United F.C., was formed in 1932 and has enjoyed some success over the years, winning numerous league titles. At present, the senior team competes in the Welsh Alliance League: it was promoted from the Gwynedd League in 2005–06.

During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force built a Chain Home radar station to the south-west of Nefyn.

In 1977, the Llŷn Maritime Museum was opened in the Church of St Mary by a group of volunteers. It closed in 2000 on grounds of health and safety, but was redeveloped from 2007 and reopened in 2014.

The area has a history of earth tremors and landslides. A tremor in the area on 12 December 1940 was reported by the &quot;Cambrian News&quot; as having caused two fatalities including John Thomas of Nefyn who died of a heart attack. On 19 July 1984, an earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale had an epicentre near Nefyn. This was one of the strongest tremors recorded in Britain in recent times but caused little structural damage. A fatal landslide occurred at Y Lôn Gam on 2 January 2001. On 19 April 2021, a landslide resulted in a cliff collapse, which affected gardens in Rhodfa&#x27;r Môr, but there were no casualties. A further landslide on 29 October 2021 blocked vehicular access to the beach at Y Lôn Gam and the adjacent cliff path was closed.

Nefyn is twinned with Puerto Madryn, a town in Chubut Province in Argentina (see Welsh settlement in Argentina).

<text>Eden Sonja Jane Riegel (born January 1, 1981) is an American actress. She portrayed Bianca Montgomery in the daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot;, and propelled the character into a gay icon, as well as a popular figure within the medium. Nominated previously on multiple occasions, she received a Daytime Emmy Award for the role in 2005.

In addition to her work on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Riegel has guest starred in several prime time shows, as well as film, and starred as character &quot;Eden&quot; in the web series &quot;Imaginary Bitches&quot;. She assumed the role of Heather Stevens on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from April 2010 to November 2011.

Riegel is also a prolific voice actress, providing the voices for many video games and animated projects. She is the voice director for Disney&#x27;s animated TV series &quot;Amphibia&quot;, &quot;The Owl House&quot;, &quot;The Ghost and Molly McGee&quot;, &quot;Hailey&#x27;s On It!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Primos&quot; and &quot;Kiff&quot; (alongside her brother Sam Riegel)

==Early life==
Born to Kurt and Lenore Riegel on New Year&#x27;s Day 1981 in Washington, D.C., Riegel was raised in a Virginia suburb and became interested in acting while watching her brother, Sam, perform dinner theater, which she later joined in for $10 a week. Her big break came when she won the role of Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, leading to other roles on and off-Broadway. She graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School and attended Harvard University, with ambitions to become a lawyer, but later left the institution. In 2000, she served as an intern at the White House for the summer.

==Career==
===&quot;All My Children&quot;===
From July 2000 to February 2005, Riegel portrayed the role of Bianca Montgomery on the American ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;; Bianca was the daughter of the show&#x27;s central character, Erica Kane. During the 2004-2005 baby switch storyline, when Bianca&#x27;s daughter is kidnapped and switched with the son of Babe Carey Chandler (Alexa Havins), Riegel also portrayed Bianca on fellow ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. 

In December 2000, Riegel&#x27;s character Bianca &quot;came out&quot; to her mother, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), becoming the only lesbian on a daytime soap opera at that time. In 2003, the kiss between Bianca and character Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) made history when it became the first lesbian kiss to appear on American daytime television. In 2005, Bianca shared a kiss with close friend and confidante Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson), making &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; list of best same-sex kisses on television. Riegel&#x27;s character was awarded the first Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation award for &quot;Favorite OUT Image of the Year&quot; in 2004. Lesbianation.com, self-proclaimed as the leading online community for lesbians, voted Eden Riegel as Number 7 on their top ten list of &quot;Women We Love: The Ladies of June &#x27;06&quot;, stating, &quot;We were swamped with requests to add &quot;All My Children&quot; hottie Eden Riegel to our list this month — and here she is!&quot;

Riegel was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series (2001, 2002, 2004) and won the award in 2005. She also won two Soap Opera Digest Awards in 2001 for Outstanding Female Newcomer. Later that year, Riegel, along with best friend and co-star Elizabeth Hendrickson, exited &quot;All My Children&quot;, with their last show airing on February 24, 2005. Riegel then moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue other acting ventures. She made a brief return to the soap opera when Bianca&#x27;s mother (Erica) married in May 2005, and returned for an extended stay from December 16, 2005, to January 10, 2006. Bianca&#x27;s daughter, Miranda, was aged accordingly. Riegel returned again for a short visit from May 24, 2006, until mid-June, in a storyline connected with Bianca&#x27;s sister Kendall&#x27;s (Alicia Minshew) pregnancy and coma. In August 2006, Riegel&#x27;s return to &quot;All My Children&quot; as a contract player was announced. The actress taped her first scenes on September 12, which first aired on October 11. Riegel commuted back and forth between her home and family in Los Angeles and New York, where &quot;All My Children&quot; tapes. In 2007, she parted ways with the show once again, but reappeared in the episode dated August 14, 2007, when Bianca phones in to check on Kendall from Paris, and in December for a Christmas visit.

In 2008, Riegel agreed to return to &quot;All My Children&quot; with Tamara Braun. Braun came on as Reese Williams, Bianca&#x27;s new lover/girlfriend and later wife. Bianca first aired on October 17, 2008. Reese followed on October 30, 2008. Riegel&#x27;s return was partly to minimize the effect of Alicia Minshew&#x27;s absence on the show while Minshew took a two-month hiatus to get married. Reese and Bianca&#x27;s union made history when it resulted in the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime television. Riegel left the show again in February 2009, but also confirmed in an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; that she would be returning in spring 2009 to conclude the Reese and Bianca story.

In 2010, Riegel returned for a short-term stint for &quot;All My Children&#x27;s&quot; 40th anniversary. The character had been cited as too iconic to recast, but in 2010, Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, and plans to recast were subsequently confirmed. However, on February 22, 2013, it was announced that Riegel would be reprising her role as Bianca in guest-arc on the Prospect Park&#x27;s brief continuation of &quot;All My Children&quot;.

===Other projects===
Prior to joining &quot;All My Children&quot;, Riegel had a small role on the daytime drama &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as an AIDS patient, appeared in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and portrayed a minor character in the feature film &quot;American Pie&quot;. She sang and did voice acting work in the film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. She has also done some voicework for animated TV shows like &quot;Stitch!&quot; and &quot;Bleach.&quot; While portraying Bianca, she remained active in other acting avenues, doing a small guest role on &quot;American Dreams&quot; and appearing in the New York play &quot;The Sex Lives of Superheroes&quot;.

In 2008, Riegel joined the cast of &quot;Year One&quot;, a Harold Ramis film that stars Jack Black and Michael Cera. The film is a comedy about two men wandering through civilization during Biblical times, and was released in June 2009.

Eden and her brother, Sam Riegel, both voiced characters in the 2012 Vita port of &quot;Persona 4 Golden&quot;, voicing the characters of Marie and Teddie, respectively.

In 2008, Riegel starred in the web series &quot;Imaginary Bitches&quot;, portraying the role of &quot;Eden&quot;, a single girl who deals with the lonely reality that her best friends are all in serious relationships by creating some imaginary friends...who turn out to be total bitches. The show is edited by Eden&#x27;s half-sister Tatiana S. Riegel, written by brother Sam Riegel, and was created by Andrew Miller. In 2010, Riegel took over the role of Heather Stevens on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She also guest-starred on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot;, portraying the distraught sister of a man who is killed in the episode.

==Personal life==
Her older brother, Sam, is a voice actor and voice director in various animated shows and video games, and her half-sister, Tatiana (known as &quot;Tanya&quot; to friends and family), is an Oscar-nominated film editor for various television shows and films. Eden discussed the portrayal of Bianca with Tatiana, who is a lesbian, and with the producers of &quot;All My Children&quot;, in order to ensure that the character was not a stereotype.

In March 2007, Riegel became engaged to actor Andrew Miller, who had been a high school classmate of Cameron Mathison&#x27;s (Ryan Lavery on &quot;All My Children&quot;). Miller and Riegel married on September 30, 2007, and their first son, Jack Oscar Miller, was born on May 21, 2011. In June 2013, Riegel announced on Twitter that she was expecting her second child, a boy. Her second son, Henry Isaac Miller, was born on December 20, 2013.

Riegel is a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and is a close friend of actresses Rebecca Budig, Alicia Minshew, and Elizabeth Hendrickson.

<doc id="972393" wikidata="Q158161" url="?curid=972393" title="1936 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1936 Winter Olympics, officially known as the IV Olympic Winter Games, were an international multi-sport event held in  Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, from 6 to 16 February 1936. A total of 646 athletes representing 28 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, 11 NOCs more than the last Winter Games in Lake Placid, United States. NOCs as first-time entrants at the Winter Games included Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Liechtenstein, Spain, and Turkey. The games featured 17 events in 4 sports across 8 disciplines. These games were the last time that the same country hosted the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics in the same year, with the 1936 Summer Olympics being held from 1 to 16 August 1936 in Berlin.

Overall, athletes representing 11 NOCs won at least one medal, and 8 NOCs won at least one gold medal. Norway won the most gold medals and the most overall medals, with 7 and 15 respectively. Germany&#x27;s team obtained their first Winter Olympic gold medal, with alpine skier Christl Cranz winning the women&#x27;s combined event. Norway and Sweden both achieved podium sweeps at the games, with the former in the individual nordic combined event with Oddbjørn Hagen winning the gold, Olaf Hoffsbakken winning the silver, and Sverre Brodahl winning the bronze, and the latter in the men&#x27;s 50 kilometre cross-country skiing event with Elis Wiklund winning the gold, Axel Wikström winning the silver, and Nils-Joel Englund winning the bronze.

Speed skater Ivar Ballangrud of Norway won the most gold medals and overall medals for an individual at the games, with three and four respectively. Ballangrud became the first athlete since middle- and long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi of Finland at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, to attain the greatest Olympic performance by an individual.
==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<doc id="972407" wikidata="Q1814269" url="?curid=972407" title="Scorn (band)">
<text>Scorn is an English electronic music project. The group was formed in the early 1990s as a project of former Napalm Death members Mick Harris and Nic Bullen. Bullen left the group in 1995, and the project continued on an essentially solo project for Harris until 1997 when it was stopped. Scorn was relaunched in 2000 until the end of 2011. Harris restarted the project in 2019, but stopped it again in late 2022.

==History==
Scorn was formed in 1991 in Birmingham by drummer Mick Harris and vocalist/bassist Nic Bullen, former members of the grindcore band Napalm Death. Upon Bullen&#x27;s departure in April 1995, Harris remained the only member of the project. Scorn has often been associated with industrial and experimental music, particularly with their Earache Records-era output between 1991 until 1994. Since the departure of Bullen in 1995, much of the output has been minimalist beats with an emphasis on very deep bass lines, often resembling dub and trip hop in structure.

Justin Broadrick (also a former Napalm Death member) provided guitar for the first LP, &quot;Vae Solis&quot;. The EP &quot;Lick Forever Dog&quot; was formed of remixes from the album. &quot;Evanescence&quot; featured James Plotkin on guitar and was followed by the remix album &quot;Ellipsis&quot; which featured reworkings by Autechre, Coil, Bill Laswell, Meat Beat Manifesto and Robin Rimbaud. Harris parted ways with Earache after the &quot;Logghi Barogghi&quot; release, both sides having been unhappy with how the project was being handled.

Many fans of his drumming were confused by the contrast in musical style between Napalm Death and Scorn, but Harris saw it as a natural progression, telling &quot;Decibel&quot; in 2012: &quot;For the ideas that I had, I needed to make that move. Some people think that it was a crazy move, just as grind was maybe starting to go places, do something, but I&#x27;ve always been an experimenter, still am; I’m someone who just loves sound.&quot;

Having left Earache Records, the project kept pushing the heavy bass sound, subtly changing with each release. The downtempo sound gained Harris an underground following and he was seen as an early originator of dubstep. In May 1997, Harris decided to end the project in order to finish relations with KK Records, after they refused to fund a collaboration EP with Bill Laswell as mixing engineer and a rapper Kalil. After pursuing other projects, Harris returned with two critically acclaimed Scorn albums on Hymen Records, &quot;Greetings from Birmingham&quot; and &quot;Plan B&quot;. Scorn then released a one track live mix called &quot;List of Takers&quot; in 2004 on Vivo Records.

Scorn returned in 2007 with &quot;Stealth&quot; on Ad Noiseam with the CD version released on Kurt Gluck&#x27;s Ohm Resistance label. Scorn then released 12&quot; records on Combat Records and Record Label Records in 2008. Another full-length album entitled &quot;Refuse; Start Fires&quot;, again was released on Ohm Resistance in 2010. This album also marked the first time since Bullen left the project that Harris has worked full-on with another musician (excluding the unreleased EP with rapper Kalil from 1997 and a track Scorn did with David Knight on the &quot;Rise|Converge&quot; compilation in 2000), drummer Yan Treasey. On the heels of this full-length, Harris returned with the &quot;Yozza&quot; EP in 2011, again with Treasey.

In November 2011, Harris stated the Scorn project was &quot;put to bed&quot;.

== Relaunch 2019-2022 ==

On 17 January 2019, the Ohm Resistance label announced that Scorn was back and would release an EP in early 2019, with an album to follow. The EP of four new tracks, was called &quot;Feather&quot;. The full-length album, &quot;Cafe Mor,&quot; was released in November and featured a collaboration with Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods. Daniele Antezza of Dadub mastered the album. Harris intended to tour in 2020 with a new Akai MPC liveset but was forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He then released a studio album, &quot;The Only Place&quot; in 2021, with one track featuring a collaboration with Kool Keith. In June 2022 Mick Harris teased new upcoming Scorn album with guitars by Justin Broadrick plus contributions from Shane Embury. But in August 2023 Mick Harris posted an update that &quot;Scorn is dead&quot; again since late 2022 and &quot;it was a bad mistake bringing it back after I stopped it in 2012&quot;. So the last Scorn performance was in October 2022 at Kirkgate Centre, Shipley, England. In his Instagram post from December 19, 2023 Mick confirmed that &quot;Scorn is dead long dead&quot;.

<text>Longwell Green is a suburban neighbourhood and electoral ward in South Gloucestershire, England. It is part of the Bristol Built-up Area, east of the city centre of Bristol. Longwell Green takes its name from the medieval well which used to be situated on the site of the Church. It lies along the A431 Bath Road north of the River Avon.

The electoral ward is bounded by the A4174 Avon ring road to the west, the River Avon to the south, and the Siston Brook to the east, while the northern boundary with Cadbury Heath ward follows residential streets. The population of the ward at the 2021 census was 9,890, up from 6,761 at the 2011 census.

Next to the A4174 is a retail park with supermarkets and other warehouse-style retail outlets.

<doc id="972414" wikidata="Q731765" url="?curid=972414" title="1932 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1932 Winter Olympics, officially known as the III Olympic Winter Games, were an international multi-sport event held in Lake Placid, United States, from February 4 to 15, 1932. A total of 252 athletes representing 17 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, 8 NOCs fewer than the last Winter Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The games featured 14 events in 4 sports across 7 disciplines. These Winter Games were the first held outside of Europe, with prior editions held in Chamonix, France, and St. Moritz, Switzerland.

Overall, athletes representing 10 NOCs won at least one medal, and 7 NOCs won at least one gold medal. Host nation United States won the most gold medals and the most overall medals, with 6 and 12 respectively. Hungary&#x27;s team obtained their first Winter Olympic medal, with figure skaters Emília Rotter and László Szollás winning bronze in the pair skating event. Norway achieved two podium sweeps at the games, in the individual nordic combined event with Johan Grøttumsbråten winning the gold, Ole Stenen winning the silver, and Hans Vinjarengen winning the bronze, and in the individual ski jump event with Birger Ruud winning the gold, Hans Beck winning the silver, and Kaare Wahlberg winning the bronze.

Speed skaters Irving Jaffee and Jack Shea, both from the United States, tied for the most gold medals won for an individual at the games, with two. Shea became the first American athlete to win multiple gold medals at the same Olympic Winter Games. Alongside Jaffee and Shea, cross-country skier Veli Saarinen of Finland and speed skaters Alexander Hurd and Willy Logan of Canada tied for the most total medals won with two each. Bobsledder Eddie Eagan of the United States became the first and only person to win a gold medal in different events at the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, after winning the gold medal in the four-man event at these games and in the men&#x27;s light heavyweight event in boxing at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.

==Medals==

The medals used for the 1932 Winter Olympics were minted by the Robbins Company. The obverse of the medals featured a design of a goddess holding a laurel wreath behind the Adirondack Mountains. It also featured the host city&#x27;s landscape with a stadium and a ski jumping hill. The reverse of the medals featured the Olympic rings, the official name of the games, and a laurel wreath. The medal itself had curved ridges that were said to represent ancient Greek columns.

For the first time in Olympic history, medals awarded to athletes were given out on podiums. The podiums were based on the medal awarding of the athletics events at the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Canada, where winning athletes stood on top of a podium while the second- and third-placed athletes stood on their sides, one step below. Then-president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Henri de Baillet-Latour, saw the practice and developed his own version. Instructions to use De Baillet-Latour&#x27;s version of the practice were sent out by the IOC to the organizing committees of the 1932 Summer Olympics and 1932 Winter Olympics. Shea became the first Olympic champion to be awarded a medal on top of a podium after winning the gold medal at the men&#x27;s 500 metres event in speed skating.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<doc id="972441" wikidata="Q2923691" url="?curid=972441" title="Principal branch">
<text>In mathematics, a principal branch is a function which selects one branch (&quot;slice&quot;) of a multi-valued function. Most often, this applies to functions defined on the complex plane.

== Examples ==
=== Trigonometric inverses ===

Principal branches are used in the definition of many inverse trigonometric functions, such as the selection either to define that
:formula_1
or that
:formula_2.

=== Exponentiation to fractional powers ===

A more familiar principal branch function, limited to real numbers, is that of a positive real number raised to the power of .

For example, take the relation , where is any positive real number.

This relation can be satisfied by any value of equal to a square root of (either positive or negative). By convention, is used to denote the positive square root of .

In this instance, the positive square root function is taken as the principal branch of the multi-valued relation .

=== Complex logarithms ===

One way to view a principal branch is to look specifically at the exponential function, and the logarithm, as it is defined in complex analysis.

The exponential function is single-valued, where is defined as:

:formula_3
where formula_4.

However, the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions involved makes it clear that the logarithm is not so uniquely determined. One way to see this is to look at the following:

:formula_5

and

:formula_6
where is any integer and continues the values of the -function from their principal value range formula_7, corresponding to formula_8 into the principal value range of the -function formula_9, covering all four quadrants in the complex plane.

Any number defined by such criteria has the property that .

In this manner log function is a multi-valued function (often referred to as a &quot;multifunction&quot; in the context of complex analysis). A branch cut, usually along the negative real axis, can limit the imaginary part so it lies between and . These are the chosen principal values.

This is the principal branch of the log function. Often it is defined using a capital letter, .

<doc id="972443" wikidata="Q1333796" url="?curid=972443" title="Renault Fuego">
<text>The Renault Fuego (&quot;Fire&quot; in Spanish) is a sport hatchback that was manufactured and marketed by Renault from 1980 to 1986, replacing the Renault 15 and 17 coupés of the 1970s.

Marketed in the United States by American Motors Corporation (AMC), the Fuego was also assembled in several countries in South America, where production continued until 1992. According to Renault, 265,367 Fuegos were produced, 85% of those manufactured in France from February 1980 to October 1985. Spanish production for European markets continued into 1986.

==Design==
The Fuego&#x27;s exterior was styled by Michel Jardin, and the interior by Francois Lampreia, both working under direction of Robert Opron. Automotive journalist L. J. K. Setright said the Fuego &quot;is blessed with a body which is not only roomy and aerodynamically efficient, but is also beautiful&quot;.

The Fuego was heavily based on the Renault 18, sharing its floorpan and drivetrain, with its front suspension developed from the larger Renault 20/30. Despite sharing no parts, the design kept the familiar double-wishbone layout common with the Renault 18, incorporating a negative scrub radius geometry. The suspension design would later be added to the facelifted Renault 18, and later, with minor refinements (larger bushings etcetera), the Renault 25. Power steering was available at the higher end of the range. The Fuego dashboard was added to the facelifted R18 in 1984 (though initially only available in the R18 Turbo) and then both updated again in September 1983 (LHD cars only) for the 1984 model year. European production continued until 1985 in France and 1986 in Spain, while Renault Argentina produced the Fuego from 1982 until ending production in 1992 with the 2.2 L &quot;GTA Max&quot; (the final phase III facelift introduced in 1990). In Argentina, it reached 63 percent local parts integration.

Wind tunnel testing was used to allow the Fuego to have sporty coupé lines while maximizing rear seat space. The resulting drag coefficient (Cd) factor ranges from 0.32 to 0.35. In October 1982, the turbocharged diesel Fuego became the fastest diesel car in the world, with a top speed of .

The Fuego was one of the first cars to offer a remote keyless system with central locking, available from September 1982, using a system invented by Frenchman Paul Lipschutz — marketed as the &quot;PLIP&quot; remote in Europe. The Fuego was also the first to have remote steering-wheel-mounted controls for the audio system (European LHD GTX and Turbo from September 1983). This feature was subsequently popularised on the 1984 model Renault 25. The Fuego was also available with options including leather upholstery, multi-function trip computer, cruise control, air-conditioning (factory or dealer-installed), and a full-length Webasto electric fabric sunroof.

A convertible version trimmed with a leather interior was unveiled by the French coachbuilder Heuliez in 1982 aimed at the U.S. market, but was not produced due to lower than expected sales in the American market - the R11/Alliance convertible taking its place. Three examples were built and finished to American specification (sealed beam headlights, enlarged bumpers, etc.).

==Marketing==
===Europe===
The Fuego became the best selling coupé in Europe during 1980 through to 1982. Variants included: 1.4 L TL, 1.6 L economy tuned GTL (LHD only); 1.6 L TS and GTS (manual and automatic transmissions); 2.0 L TX and GTX (manual and automatic transmissions). The TX was a downgraded version of the GTX, but differences varied by country. This model deleted alloy wheels, electric windows, central locking, air conditioning, fog lights, headlight wipers, etc. depending upon the market. A manual-only 2.1 L turbo-diesel was also produced for LHD European markets in the 1982-1985 period. This model was differentiated by the &quot;bulge&quot; in the top of the bonnet, extra vents in the front bumper, and &quot;Turbo D&quot; badging on the grille, side and rear hatch glass.

The Fuego Turbo (1.6 L/1565cc with a manual transmission) was added in 1983 to coincide with the facelift. This facelift included a revised front grille, plastic trim on the bumpers, revised dashboard on LHD models, wheel design, interior trim and fabrics - sepia (coffee brown) with dark brown/white striped velour seats; or ash (grey) with black/red striped velour seats for the Turbo, and ash or sepia for the other models sold with European specifications. Interior colour now depended on exterior colour, eliminating the large choice of customised options of the previous models. The facelifted GTX was also offered with the 2.2 L EFI engine from the Renault 25 in certain LHD markets (generally where the Fuego Turbo was not sold).

===United States===
The Fuego was marketed in the United States through American Motors Corporation (AMC) dealers from 1982 to 1985 inclusive. It was offered with a fuel-injected 1.6 L turbocharged (1565cc) or normally aspirated version (1647cc) in 1982 and 1983; for 1984 and 1985 the car was offered with a 2.2 L engine with manual or automatic transmissions, plus the 1.6 L turbo version. The hatchback coupe could carry four passengers, and delivered on the highway) at a base price of $8,495 at introduction. The model received generally good reviews. &quot;MotorWeek&quot; praised the 1982 Fuego for its styling, standard features including an electric sunroof, and as well with with performance. They also noted below average braking and understeer.

The Fuego did not achieve the sales to turn Renault&#x27;s fortunes around in the United States. By 1984, AMC dealers were eligible for rebates of $300 and $1,000, respectively, on each model.

===United Kingdom===
Renault sold the Fuego in the UK aiming it at the market segment occupied by the Opel Manta and Ford Capri. It became the top-selling coupé during 1981 and 1982. The available trims beginning in 1980–81 with the TL, GTS, and GTX, before increasing to the TL, TS, GTS, GTS Automatic, TX, and GTX manual in 1981–82; TL, TS, GTS, GTS Automatic, TX, GTX, GTX Automatic in 1982–83; TL, GTS, TX, GTX Automatic, and Turbo in 1983–84, and down to just two (GTS and Turbo) during 1985 and 1986 as sales declined.

===Australia===

In Australia, the 2 L GTX manual was the main model from 1982 to 1987, fully specified with factory air conditioning, TRX alloy wheels, a passenger mirror with remote control, but no trip computer. There was also a limited run of the more basic TX models. The Australian specifications included side intrusions beams in the doors and emission controls to meet Australian Design Rules.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the UK specification GTS and GTX manuals were delivered from late 1981 into 1982; GTS, GTS Automatic, GTX, GTX Automatic in 1983; GTX, GTX Automatic, Turbo in 1984; GTX Automatic and Turbo in 1985; GTX (end of line Australian specification GTX&#x27;s transferred from Australia), GTX Automatic, and Turbo in 1986.

==Timeline==
*February 1980 - Introduction of the Fuego three-door coupé. Available as &quot;TL&quot; with a 1397 cc engine (rated at , with manual choke), &quot;GTL&quot; with a lower power output (economy tuned) 1647 cc engine, and &quot;GTS&quot; with the regular 1647 cc engine (rated at , with automatic choke), with a four-speed manual gearbox on the TL and GTL, five-speed manual or three-speed automatic gearbox on the GTS. The TL has a basic equipment level with 155 SRx13 tyres, heated rear window, rear fog light, split-fold rear seat, and cloth upholstery. The GTL adds 175/70x13 tyres, electric front windows, tachometer, height-adjustable steering wheel, front head restraints, analogue clock, wheel covers, remote-adjustable drivers door mirror, laminated windscreen, opening rear quarter windows, H4 headlights, pre-installed radio kit, and velour upholstery. The GTS adds an engine oil-level gauge, power-assisted steering, and an optional three-speed automatic transmission. 185/65xHR14 light alloy wheels are optional. 
*1981 - Fuel reserve warning light standard on all models, the four- and five-speed manuals were modified and some had their ratios adjusted. Introduction of the &quot;TX&quot; and &quot;GTX&quot; with 1995 cc engine (rated at ) and five-speed manual gearbox. The TX has the same specification as the GTS, except for series mounted 14-inches wheels though equipped with steel rims rather than alloy, with the GTX gaining front fog lights, headlamp wash-wipe, 14-inch alloy wheels (185/65xHR14 tires), leather on the steering wheel rim, gear lever gaiter, and handbrake lever gaiter, as well as a digital clock, optional passenger side door mirror, bronze tinted windows, luggage cover, and airhorn. The optional three-speed automatic transmission now available on the 2 L TX and GTX in addition to the 1.6 L, beginning in September 1981.
*1982 - The GTL is upgraded to a five-speed gearbox, while the automatic switched from the 1.6 L to the torquier 2 L engine. The GTS gains electronic ignition. The GTS, TX (depending on the country), and GTX gain remote central locking. The 2.1 L turbo diesel is introduced to certain LHD European markets. The 1.6 L fuel-injected and turbo versions are introduced in the United States through Renault/American Motors dealers.
*1983 - The GTL gains an economy tuned version of the 1647 cc engine and a five-speed gearbox, while electronic ignition becomes standard across the range. The Fuego also becomes more aerodynamic, with small spoilers and deflectors as well as smooth hubcaps added.
*1984 - The new 1984 model year facelift (From October 1983) involved consolidating the range but included adding the top of the range Turbo model to the European lineup. The facelift included a new grille, bumpers, wheel design, and interior trim (as well as a redesigned dashboard for LHD vehicles). A limited production run of turbos fitted with EFi produced for the Swiss market to meet their emission controls. A 2.2 L EFi version of the GTX is introduced to certain LHD markets. Models sold in the United States are equipped with either the 1.6 L turbo or 2.2 L engines (manual or automatic) and an updated interior.
*1985 - Production of the Fuego ends in France, with the introduction of the Renault 21.
*1986 - Production ends in Spain. Production lines transferred to Argentina and Venezuela.
*1987 - Production continues in Argentina (where the only available engine is the 2165 cc producing ) and Venezuela.
*1990 - The final phase III GTA is introduced with new bumpers, white front indicators, and charcoal tail-lights. The higher performance GTA Max is introduced in Argentina with a 2.2 L engine tuned by Berta Motorsport, producing .
*1992 - South American production ends.

The Fuego was not directly replaced by another model in the Renault range. A Fuego II was planned, similarly styled as the new Renault Alpine GTA. However, the development of the new model was cancelled at the last minute due to a combination of Renault&#x27;s financial problems along with the declining demand for sports coupés in the marketplace at that time.

<text>The Body Shop International Limited, trading as the Body Shop, is a British cosmetics, skin care, and perfume company founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick, who opened her first store in Brighton, England. The company is now based in London Bridge and Littlehampton, West Sussex, and is currently owned by Auréa Group.

The Body Shop operated under the French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal between 2006 and 2017. In September 2017, L&#x27;Oréal sold it to Brazil&#x27;s Natura &amp; Co for £880 million. In November 2023, Natura sold it to Aurelius.

On 13 February 2024, it was announced that Aurelius had put the UK business of the Body Shop into administration, that the chain would close up to half of its 198 stores in the UK, and that the number of staff at the chain&#x27;s head office would be reduced by 40%. In March 2024, the company announced that it would shutter its operations in the United States and reorganize in Canada under bankruptcy protection. The Body Shop was acquired by Auréa Group in September 2024. 

==History==
An earlier Body Shop, unaffiliated with Anita Roddick or the Body Shop International Limited, was opened in Berkeley, California, in 1970, by Peggy Short and Jane Saunders.

Roddick opened her own health and beauty store, named the Body Shop, in her hometown of Brighton, UK, in 1976. Her motivation was to &quot;make a living for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away travelling&quot;.

The business&#x27;s original vision was to sell products with ethically sourced, cruelty-free, and natural ingredients. None of Roddick&#x27;s products were tested on animals, and the ingredients were sourced directly from producers.

The store began trading with just 25 products. Roddick had purchased urine-sample bottles from a nearby hospital to sell her products in but did not have enough of them, creating the business&#x27;s refillable bottles policy. Labels were handwritten, and Roddick did not advertise explicitly, using the local press instead.

In the late 1970s, Roddick&#x27;s partner, Gordon, returned to Brighton from America and suggested the business foster growth through franchising. By 1984, the company had 138 stores, 87 of which were outside the UK. By 1994, 89% of the business&#x27;s locations were franchises.


The company went public in April 1984 and was floated on London&#x27;s Unlisted Securities Market, opening at a price of 95p, with the Roddicks keeping 27.6% of shares in the company and Anita continuing as managing director so as to retain control of the company&#x27;s direction. After it obtained a full listing on the London Stock Exchange, share prices in the company increased dramatically, rising 10,944 percent in the first eight years.

In 1987, Roddick paid the owners of the original Body Shop in the US, Peggy Short and Jane Saunders, US$3.5 million for the exclusive rights to the brand name. The US company became Body Time in 1992; it closed in 2018.

In 1991, the Body Shop sued Bath &amp; Body Works for allegedly copying its marketing, reaching a confidential out-of-court settlement.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the company joined a number of campaigns related to social responsibility and environmental issues. These included a &quot;Trade Not Aid&quot; campaign in 1987, wherein the company sourced some of its ingredients directly from the native communities they originated from. The company also made alliances with Greenpeace and Amnesty International.

===1994 &quot;Business Ethics&quot; exposé===
In September 1994, &quot;Business Ethics&quot; magazine published an investigative article entitled &quot;Shattered Image: Is The Body Shop Too Good to Be True?&quot;, written by Jon Entine, on the company&#x27;s practices. Entine reported that Anita Roddick had copied the name, store design, marketing concept, and most product line ideas from the earlier American Body Shop.

===2000s and 2010s===
In March 2006, the Body Shop agreed to a £652.3 million takeover by L&#x27;Oréal. The Roddicks made £130 million from the sale.

The takeover caused some media controversy, particularly surrounding L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s use of animal testing. Although L&#x27;Oréal itself ceased animal testing in 1989, the company had begun selling its products in China in 1997, where the law required cosmetics to be tested on animals before sale to the public. Roddick stated that she believed the takeover could allow her to be a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; within the larger company, working through the Body Shop to improve its standards on animal testing and environmental issues.

In September 2007, Roddick died following a major brain haemorrhage.

In 2017, L&#x27;Oréal sold the Body Shop to Brazilian cosmetics company Natura for £880 million (€1 billion). At the time, the company was one of the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics chains, with 3,200 stores and 17,000 employees in 66 countries.

The Body Shop received its B-Corp certification in 2019.

===Aurelius takeover and Auréa Group===
In November 2023, Natura sold the Body Shop to Aurelius, a German private equity group, for £207 million ($254.32 million). The deal came as part of Natura&#x27;s downsizing strategy after its sale of Aesop to L&#x27;Oréal for $2.5 billion earlier in the year.

At the time, it was suggested that Aurelius had &quot;grabbed itself a bargain&quot; and Aurelius predicted rapid growth for the company. However, following the sale, Aurelius experienced financial challenges and lapses during its due diligence, resulting in the departure of its managing director, who had spearheaded the deal.

On 7 September 2024, the Body Shop was acquired by Auréa Group, a consortium led by Mike Jatania and Charles Denton, who became its executive chair and CEO, respectively.

===Administration===
====United Kingdom====
On 15 February 2024, Aurelius put the Body Shop&#x27;s UK division into administration and hired the business advisory firm FRP Advisory as administrators to help the company through the procedure. This followed Aurelius&#x27; failure to secure a line of credit for the company after its takeover when HSBC withdrew a prior line of credit negotiated under Natura&#x27;s ownership. In administration, it was reported that the UK division owed over £276 million to creditors, of which about £143 million was owed to other parts of the group. After restructuring, 82 UK stores were closed and 489 jobs were lost, with a further 329 jobs axed at the company&#x27;s head office.

On 17 May 2024, FRP Advisory announced that the Body Shop&#x27;s UK business and assets would be put up for auction after plans for a company voluntary arrangement fell through.

====European Union====
On 16 February 2024, just one day after the UK division went insolvent, the Body Shop Germany collapsed into administration and announced that all 60 stores were to be closed within the coming months. The same day, the Body Shop hired administrators for its Belgium, Ireland, Austria, Luxembourg, and France divisions, all of which were expected to be put into administration as early as the following week.

On 29 February 2024, the Body Shop&#x27;s Belgian and Denmark divisions were placed under administration, and it was announced that all stores in both countries would close. All of the Body Shop&#x27;s Irish stores were closed by the end of February.

As part of the shutdown, Alma24, a company controlled by Friedrich Trautwein, took control of the Body Shop&#x27;s European entities along with those in Japan.

====North America====
On 1 March 2024, the Body Shop Canada filed for creditor protection and announced that it would cease online operations and close 33 locations out of 105. On the same day, the Body Shop USA closed all of its stores and ceased operations online. On 10 March, the Body Shop USA filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

While profitable, the North American businesses had paid funds into the UK head office under cash pooling, which made their funds inaccessible to pay creditors, including suppliers, following the collapse of the UK entity.

====Oceania====
On 22 January 2025, Body Shop New Zealand was placed into voluntary administration. While the chain&#x27;s 16 stores remained open, Body Shop NZ ceased to accept loyalty points and reduced the use of gift card funds.

==Multilevel marketing channels==
In addition to retail channels, products from the Body Shop were available through the &quot;Body Shop at Home&quot; multilevel marketing network, established in 1994. The multilevel marketing program was known as &quot;the Body Shop Direct&quot; in Britain and was first trialled in Australia in Gippsland in 1997. Distributors (or consultants) could also recruit others to sell the products. In 1998, the Australian division was featured in &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; for its motivational-based policy of funding unrelated courses for home distributors, such as French polishing and tarot reading.

The Body Shop at Home announced it would cease trading on 23 February 2024 in the UK and Australia.

===Unfair dismissal claim===
In 2014, an unfair dismissal case ruled against the Body Shop (Adidem Pty Ltd T/A the Body Shop v Suckling [2014] FWCFB 3611). The plaintiff, Nicole Suckling, worked in an administrative support role for the Body Shop at Home as an independent direct candle seller for the company PartyLite. The Body Shop alleged that Suckling&#x27;s access to its confidential contractual information could threaten the company&#x27;s commercial interests.

==Social activism==
The Body Shop long held aims of social activism as part of its business practices. Roddick herself took on gradually more critical views of both business broadly and the cosmetics industry in particular, criticising what she considered the environmental insensitivity of the industry and its traditional views of beauty, and aimed to change standard corporate practices through her brand.

In 1997, Roddick launched a global campaign to raise self-esteem in women and against the media stereotyping of women. It focused on unreasonably thin models in the context of rising numbers of bulimia and anorexia.

===Community Trade===
Launched in 1987, the Body Shop&#x27;s Community Trade programme was based on the practice of trading with communities in need and giving them a fair price for natural ingredients or handcrafts, including Brazil nut oil, sesame seed oil, honey, and shea butter. The first Community Trade product was a wooden roller, supplied by a small community in southern India, Teddy Exports, which continued to be a key Community Trade supplier.

Fair trade activists have criticised the programme: &quot;The company...displayed claims...to pay fairer prices to the Third World poor but covered less than a fraction of 1 percent of its turnover&quot;, wrote Paul Vallely, the former chair of Traidcraft, in the obituary for Anita Roddick published in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

The Body Shop regularly invited employees and stakeholders to visit Community Trade suppliers to see the benefits that the programme has brought to communities and Body Shop products.

As part of the Community Trade programme, the Body Shop undertook periodic social audits of its sourcing activities through Ecocert.

A campaign by Christian Peacemaker Team protested the alleged role of the Body Shop in purchasing palm oil from Daabon, a third-party supplier in Colombia, who forcefully evicted 123 families from their land at Las Pavas on 14 July 2009. The Body Shop initially denied intentionally purchasing palm oil from the area but later dropped Daabon as a supplier after the company failed to provide proof that it was not involved in the land seizures.

===Policy on animal testing===
The Body Shop has campaigned to end animal testing in cosmetics alongside animal cruelty NGO Cruelty Free International (CFI) since 1989. The company&#x27;s products are non-animal tested and are certified cruelty-free by CFI&#x27;s Leaping Bunny logo.

In June 2017, the Body Shop and CFI launched Forever Against Animal Testing, its largest-ever campaign, aimed at banning animal testing in cosmetics everywhere and forever.

In October 2009, the Body Shop received a lifetime achievement award from the RSPCA in Britain, in recognition of its uncompromised policy, which ensures ingredients are not tested on animals by its suppliers.

In 2021, the Body Shop announced that all its products would be certified vegan by the Vegan Society as of the end of 2023. The process was completed in January 2024.

===The Body Shop Foundation===
The Roddicks founded the Body Shop Foundation in 1990, which supports innovative global projects working in the areas of human and civil rights and environmental and animal protection. The foundation was formed to consolidate all the charitable donations made by the company. To date, it has donated over £24 million in grants. The foundation regularly gives gift-in-kind support to various projects and organisations, such as Children on the Edge.

In 2017, the Body Shop announced its new approach to corporate philanthropy, the World Bio-Bridges Mission (Re-Wilding the World), whose purpose is to increase biodiversity around the world while creating sustainable supply chains where possible.

==Products==

The Body Shop carries a wide range of products for the body, face, hair, and home. The company claims its products are &quot;inspired by nature&quot; and feature ingredients such as marula oil and sesame seed oil, sourced through the Community Trade program.

Products include:
* Body butters (including Moringa, satsuma, strawberry, olive, shea, mango, and coconut)
* Body products such as body scrub, body butter, and bath lilies
* Cosmetics (including mascara, lipstick, lip gloss, eye shadow, and cotton rounds)
* Full skin care ranges (including tea tree, vitamin C, vitamin E, aloe vera, and seaweed)
* Men&#x27;s skin care (including maca root and white musk)
* Hair care (including banana shampoo and banana conditioner)
* Fragrances (women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s)
* Bath products (including shower gels and solid soaps)
* Face masks (including sheet masks)

<doc id="972457" wikidata="Q1567542" url="?curid=972457" title="Mass wasting">
<text>Mass wasting, also known as mass movement, is a general term for the movement of rock or soil down slopes under the force of gravity. It differs from other processes of erosion in that the debris transported by mass wasting is not entrained in a moving medium, such as water, wind, or ice. Types of mass wasting include creep, solifluction, rockfalls, debris flows, and landslides, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, and on many other bodies in the Solar System.

Subsidence is sometimes regarded as a form of mass wasting. A distinction is then made between mass wasting by subsidence, which involves little horizontal movement, and mass wasting by slope movement.

Rapid mass wasting events, such as landslides, can be deadly and destructive. More gradual mass wasting, such as soil creep, poses challenges to civil engineering, as creep can deform roadways and structures and break pipelines. Mitigation methods include slope stabilization, construction of walls, catchment dams, or other structures to contain rockfall or debris flows, afforestation, or improved drainage of source areas.

==Types==
Mass wasting is a general term for any process of erosion that is driven by gravity and in which the transported soil and rock is not entrained in a moving medium, such as water, wind, or ice. The presence of water usually aids mass wasting, but the water is not abundant enough to be regarded as a transporting medium. Thus, the distinction between mass wasting and stream erosion lies between a mudflow (mass wasting) and a very muddy stream (stream erosion), without a sharp dividing line. Many forms of mass wasting are recognized, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years.

Based on how the soil, regolith or rock moves downslope as a whole, mass movements can be broadly classified as either creeps or landslides. Subsidence is sometimes also regarded as a form of mass wasting. A distinction is then made between mass wasting by subsidence, which involves little horizontal movement, and mass wasting by slope movement.

===Creep===
Soil creep is a slow and long term mass movement. The combination of small movements of soil or rock in different directions over time is directed by gravity gradually downslope. The steeper the slope, the faster the creep. The creep makes trees and shrubs curve to maintain their perpendicularity, and they can trigger landslides if they lose their root footing. The surface soil can migrate under the influence of cycles of freezing and thawing, or hot and cold temperatures, inching its way towards the bottom of the slope forming terracettes. Landslides are often preceded by soil creep accompanied with soil sloughing—loose soil that falls and accumulates at the base of the steepest creep sections.

====Solifluction====

Solifluction is a form of creep characteristics of arctic or alpine climates. It takes place in soil saturated with moisture that thaws during the summer months to creep downhill. It takes place on moderate slopes, relatively free of vegetation, that are underlain by permafrost and receive a constant supply of new debris by weathering. Solifluction affects the entire slope rather than being confined to channels and can produce terrace-like landforms or stone rivers.

===Landslide===
A landslide, also called a landslip, is a relatively rapid movement of a large mass of earth and rocks down a hill or a mountainside. Landslides can be further classified by the importance of water in the mass wasting process. In a narrow sense, landslides are rapid movement of large amounts of relatively dry debris down moderate to steep slopes. With increasing water content, the mass wasting takes the form of debris avalanches, then earthflows, then mudflows. Further increase in water content produces a sheetflood, which is a form of sheet erosion rather than mass wasting.

== Occurrences ==
On Earth, mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes. Submarine mass wasting is particularly common along glaciated coastlines where glaciers are retreating and great quantities of sediments are being released. Submarine slides can transport huge volumes of sediments for hundreds of kilometers in a few hours.

Mass wasting is a common phenomenon throughout the Solar System, occurring where volatile materials are lost from a regolith. Such mass wasting has been observed on Mars, Io, Triton, and possibly Europa and Ganymede. Mass wasting also occurs in the equatorial regions of Mars, where stopes of soft sulfate-rich sediments are steepened by wind erosion. Mass wasting on Venus is associated with the rugged terrain of tesserae. Io shows extensive mass wasting of its volcanic mountains.

==Deposits and landforms==
Mass wasting affects geomorphology, most often in subtle, small-scale ways, but occasionally more spectacularly.

Soil creep is rarely apparent but can produce such subtle effects as curved forest growth and tilted fences and telephone poles. It occasionally produces low scarps and shallow depressions. Solifluction produced lobed or sheetlike deposits, with fairly definite edges, in which clasts (rock fragments) are oriented perpendicular to the contours of the deposit.

Rockfall can produce talus slopes at the feet of cliffs. A more dramatic manifestation of rockfall is rock glaciers, which form from rockfall from cliffs oversteepened by glaciers.

Landslides can produce scarps and step-like small terraces. Landslide deposits are poorly sorted. Those rich in clay may show stretched clay lumps (a phenomenon called boudinage) and zones of concentrated shear.

Debris flow deposits take the form of long, narrow tracks of very poorly sorted material. These may have natural levees at the sides of the tracks, and sometimes consist of lenses of rock fragments alternating with lenses of fine-grained earthy material. Debris flows often form much of the upper slopes of alluvial fans.

== Causes ==
Triggers for mass wasting can be divided into passive and activating (initiating) causes. Passive causes include:
* Rock and soil lithology. Unconsolidated or weak debris are more susceptible to mass wasting, as are materials that lose cohesion when wetted.
* Stratigraphy, such as thinly bedded rock or alternating beds of weak and strong or impermeable or permiable rock lithologies.
* Faults or other geologic structures that weaken the rock.
* Topography, such as steep slopes or cliffs.
* Climate, with large temperature swings, frequent freezing and thawing, or abundant rainfall
* Lack of vegetation

Activating causes include:
* Undercutting of the slope by excavation or erosion
* Increased overburden from structures
* Increased soil moisture
* Earthquakes

==Hazards and mitigation==
Mass wasting causes problems for civil engineering, particularly highway construction. It can displace roads, buildings, and other construction and can break pipelines. Historically, mitigation of landslide hazards on the Gaillard Cut of the Panama Canal accounted for of the of material removed while excavating the cut.

Rockslides or landslides can have disastrous consequences, both immediate and delayed. The Oso disaster of March 2014 was a landslide that caused 43 fatalities in Oso, Washington, US. Delayed consequences of landslides can arise from the formation of landslide dams, as at Thistle, Utah, in April 1983.

Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting. This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes. It is seen on submarine volcanoes as well as surface volcanoes: Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Loihi) in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain and Kick &#x27;em Jenny in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc are two submarine volcanoes that are known to undergo mass wasting. The failure of the northern flank of Mount St. Helens in 1980 showed how rapidly volcanic flanks can deform and fail.

Methods of mitigation of mass wasting hazards include:
* Afforestation
* Construction of fences, walls, or ditches to contain rockfall
* Construction of catchment dams to contain debris flows
* Improved drainage of source areas
* Slope stabilization

<text>Alfonso Guerra González (born 31 May 1940) is a Spanish politician. A leading member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), he served as vice president of the government (&quot;vicepresidente del Gobierno&quot;, i.e. equivalent to deputy prime minister) of Spain from 1982 to 1991 under the premiership of Felipe González. He represented Seville province in the Congress of Deputies from 1977 to 2015, and was the longest-serving deputy at the time of his departure.

In 1988, Guerra received an honorary degree from the Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal in Lima, Peru, and he was awarded the &quot;Medaglia D&#x27;oro&quot; in 1984 by the Sapienza University of Rome. Guerra was an extremely controversial politician, noted for his acid discourse against his opponents, which was criticised as demagogy by his political adversaries. He was forced to quit his position as vice-president after a financial scandal involving his brother Juan Guerra.

On 5 November 2014, Guerra announced that he would be resigning from congress at the end of the parliamentary session in December 2014. At the time of his resignation announcement, he was the longest serving member of congress.

<text>The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSBs) was a line infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the Scottish Division. On 28 March 2006 the regiment was amalgamated with the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret&#x27;s Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment), the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons), the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s), 52nd Lowland Regiment, and 51st Highland Regiment to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland. However, after just a few months the battalion merged with the Royal Scots Battalion to form the Royal Scots Borderers.

==History==
===Early history===

The regiment was raised on 18 March 1689 by David Leslie, 3rd Earl of Leven to defend Edinburgh against the Jacobite forces of James VII. It&#x27;s claimed that 800 men were recruited within the space of two hours. The regiment&#x27;s first action was at the Battle of Killiecrankie on 27 July 1689. Although this battle was a defeat for the Williamite army, the Jacobite commander, John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (Bonnie Dundee), was killed by a volley fired by Leven&#x27;s Regiment, bringing an end to James II&#x27;s attempt to save his throne in Scotland. The regiment was judged to have performed well and was granted the privilege of recruiting by beat of drum in the City of Edinburgh without prior permission of the provost.
For a period it was known as Semphill&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, the name under which it fought at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and the Battle of Culloden in 1746. When the British infantry were allocated numerical positions in the &#x27;line&#x27; of Infantry the regiment was numbered 25th Regiment of Foot (based on its formation date) in 1751. The regiment fought at the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759 with five other regiments; this battle honour was celebrated by the regiment each year on 1 August. The 25th was the county regiment of Sussex in 1782 when it became known as the 25th (Sussex) Regiment of Foot.

The regiment was awarded the right to bear the emblem of the Sphinx for their role in the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. Its recruiting area was moved to the Scottish Borders region in 1805 from when the regiment became known as the 25th (the King&#x27;s Own Borderers) Regiment of Foot.

===Victorian era===
The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Fulford Barracks in York from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 – as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. The regiment moved to Berwick Barracks in July 1881. Under the reforms the regiment became The King&#x27;s Own Borderers on 1 July 1881. A 3rd, Militia, Battalion was formed as the Scottish Borderers Militia, with headquarters at Dumfries. The regiment became The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers in 1887.

During the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878 to 1880, the regiment formed part of the 2nd division which was renamed the &quot;Khyber Line Force&quot; while guarding the lines of communication between Kabul and Peshawar. The 3rd (Militia) battalion was embodied in January 1900 for service in the Second Boer War, and 998 officers and men embarked for South Africa on the SS &quot;Kildon Castle&quot; two months later. Most of the battalion returned home in June 1902.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and two Territorial battalions.

The Bachelor&#x27;s Walk massacre happened in Dublin, on 26 July 1914, when a column of troops of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers were accosted by a crowd on Bachelor&#x27;s Walk. The troops attacked &quot;hostile but unarmed&quot; protesters with rifle fire and bayonets - resulting in the deaths of four civilians and injuries to in excess of 30 more.

===First World War===
The 1st Battalion was serving in Lucknow, India when the war broke out. After returning to England it landed at Cape Helles in Gallipoli as part of the 87th Brigade in the 29th Division in April 1915. After being evacuated from Gallipoli in January 1916 it moved to Alexandria in Egypt and then landed at Marseille in March 1916 for service on the Western Front. It saw action at the Battle of the Somme in autumn 1916, the Battle of Passchendaele in autumn 1917, the Battle of Lys in April 1918 and the Battle of Cambrai in October 1918.

During the Home Rule Crisis in 1914, the 2nd Battalion was stationed in Dublin as part of 13th Brigade in the 5th Division. 
A detachment of the battalion was responsible for killing four and wounding 38 unarmed civilians during an altercation with a crowd on the day of the Howth gun-running in July 1914.
It then landed at Le Havre in August 1914 for service on the Western Front and saw action at the Battle of Mons in August 1914, the Battle of Le Cateau also in August 1914 and the First Battle of the Aisne in September 1914. It later saw combat at the Second Battle of Ypres in May 1915, the Battle of the Somme in November 1916, the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917, the Battle of Passchendaele in November 1917 and the Battle of Lys in April 1918.

The regiment&#x27;s two Territorial Force units, the 1/4th (Border) Battalion and the 1/5th (Dumfries &amp; Galloway) Battalion, landed in Gallipoli as part of the 155th Brigade in the 52nd (Lowland) Division in June 1915. After being evacuated from Gallipoli in January 1916 they moved to Egypt and then took part in the Third Battle of Gaza in November 1917 before landing at Marseille in April 1918 for service on the Western Front.

The 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 28th Brigade in the 9th (Scottish) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front. It saw action at the Battle of Loos in September 1915, the Battle of the Somme in November 1916, the Battle of Arras in May 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele in November 1917.

The 7th (Service) Battalion and the 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 46th Brigade in the 15th (Scottish) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front. They fought at the Battle of Loos in September 1915, the Battle of the Somme in November 1916, the Battle of Arras in May 1917, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge in August 1917, the Second Battle of the Somme in August 1918 and at the Second Battle of the Marne also in August 1918.

===Second World War===
In the period between the wars, the regiment&#x27;s regular battalions were sent all over the British Empire to Ireland, Egypt and Hong Kong but were quickly recalled home at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.

The 1st Battalion landed in France as part of the 9th Brigade in the 3rd Infantry Division in September 1939 for service with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF); it took part in the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940 and the Normandy landings in June 1944 and saw action at the Battle for Caen later that month.

The 2nd Battalion moved to Burma as part of the 89th Brigade in the 7th Indian Infantry Division in September 1943 for service in the Burma Campaign and saw action at the Battle of the Admin Box in February 1944 and the Battle of Imphal in July 1944.

The 4th and 5th Battalions landed at Saint-Malo as part of the 155th Brigade in the 52nd (Lowland) Division in June 1940 for service with the British Expeditionary Force; after evacuation from Cherbourg later in the month they took part in Operation Infatuate in November 1944 and the subsequent capture of Bremen in April 1945.

The 6th Battalion took part in the Normandy landings as part of the 44th Brigade in the 15th (Scottish) Division in June 1944 and saw action at the Battle for Caen later that month and then advanced into Germany.

One of its heaviest losses during the war was at the ill-fated Battle of Arnhem in which the 7th Battalion, as part of the 1st Airlanding Brigade of 1st Airborne Division, suffered 90% casualties in September 1944; they defended the perimeter in Oosterbeek against 2nd SS Panzer Corps.

===Post war===
After the Second World War, the regiment served internal security duties in the British Mandate of Palestine and was reduced to a single battalion around 1948. The regiment was part of the United Nations forces that saw action at the First Battle of Maryang San in October 1951 during the Korean War. Private Bill Speakman was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Second Battle of Maryang-san. The regiment was deployed during the Malayan Emergency in the late 1950s.

The regiment was deployed to Aden as the garrison battalion in Aden on internal security duties in February 1962. In April 1964, within three months of its return to the UK and during the 24 hours of its first day as the Spearhead Battalion of the UK Strategic Reserve, it was deployed back to Aden in response to the Radfan Campaign in what had become the Federation of South Arabia. Within a year of its return to the UK in May 1965, the regiment was again deployed overseas in response to Indonesia&#x27;s aggression in Borneo against newly formed Malaysia. The regiment was at first deployed in Hong Kong, replacing a Gurkha battalion sent to Borneo, then to the Jungle Warfare School at Kota Tinggi in Malaysia in August 1965.

The regiment were then deployed in the mountainous and primary jungle areas of Sarawak in October 1965. Shortly after its return to the UK the regiment was posted to Osnabrück in June 1967. It was subsequently regularly posted to Northern Ireland as part of Operation Banner during the Troubles and suffered casualties during the 1989 Derryard attack which killed two of its men. It took part in the Gulf War in 1991 but was one of the few Scottish regiments not deployed to the Yugoslav Wars: it was being mainly stationed in Northern Ireland instead. The regiment also served in Iraq on Operation Telic in 2003.

===Restructuring of the infantry===
Until 2004 the regiment was one of five in the line infantry never to have been amalgamated, the others being The Royal Scots, The Green Howards, The Cheshire Regiment and The Royal Welch Fusiliers. When five Scottish regiments were amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006, the Royal Scots Battalion and the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers Battalion initially maintained their identities as separate battalions.

However almost immediately the Ministry of Defence moved to amalgamate the two battalions. This was not a new idea: the origins of the combined entity, Royal Scots Borderers, dates from the 1990 &quot;Options for Change&quot; review, when it was initially announced that the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers would amalgamate. That amalgamation was subsequently rescinded. The Royal Scots Battalion and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers Battalion duly amalgamated on 1 August 2006 – upon their amalgamation, the new battalion took the name Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland.

<text>Worcester Warriors Rugby Football Club is a currently disbanded professional rugby union club founded in 1871, that played in the top division of the sport in England, Premiership Rugby.

In May 2023, it was announced that Atlas Group had completed the purchase of Worcester Warriors. Even though the rugby club and its assets had been acquired, it was not known whether the team would play again in a championship.

==Overview==
Using the colours gold and blue, it was based in Worcester, England. In 1975, the team moved to their most recent home, Sixways Stadium, located to the north of the city.

Placed in the eighth tier of English rugby with the advent of the English rugby union league competition, the club were able to build a strong team due to extensive financial support from their backer and chairman Cecil Duckworth, being promoted repeatedly through the league system. Worcester were first promoted to the highest tier, the Premiership in 2004, and returned there on two occasions following relegation to the RFU Championship.

Worcester won one major trophy, the 2022 Premiership Cup, and won the second division three times in 2004, 2011 and 2015. They also won four titles in lower divisions while working their way through the English league structure.

In the 2021–22 Premiership Rugby season they finished 11th, entitling them to compete in the 2022–23 Premiership Rugby season, and in the 2022-23 European Rugby Challenge Cup. The most recent director of rugby was Steve Diamond who was appointed in January 2022.

The club entered administration on 26 September 2022 as a result of a tax dispute with the UK Government&#x27;s tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs. The club was suspended from completing fixtures by the Rugby Football Union. The contracts of all players and coaching staff were terminated on 5 October 2022 following the granting of a winding-up petition from HMRC in the High Court.

After starting to manage the Warriors, James Sandford and Jim O&#x27;Toole announced that the team might not play games again after an earlier administration. On 9 February 2023, it was announced that the club had been disbanded and that its administrators were trying without making Stourbridge RFC decide to play their games at Sixways Stadium in their place – something that was not successful.

==History==

===Foundation===
The club was founded in 1871 by the Reverend Francis John Ede, with the first known game played against the Royal Artillery Rugby Club on 8 November 1871. This game was played on Pitchcroft. The club began playing at Bevere in Worcester in 1954 and left Bevere for Sixways in 1975 when the clubhouse was opened. When the league system was formed, the club was placed in North Midlands Division One, a level eight league.

===Support===
Due to extensive support from their backer Cecil Duckworth, the club were able to build a strong team, with promotion after promotion following. In 2006, extremely ambitious plans were announced for a £23 million development programme, which would see a health club with fitness centre and swimming pool, fully tarmacked park and ride area, and expanded capacity to 11,499.

===Promotion to the Premiership===

Worcester Warriors were promoted to the (then Zurich) Premiership after winning National Division One in 2003–04 with a perfect record of 26 wins from 26 games, something that had never before been achieved. They were the bookies&#x27;, and many of the rugby pundits&#x27; odds-on-favourites to go straight back down but defied the odds to stay in the Premiership for another season, finishing ninth in the league, after wins against teams including Harlequins, Leeds, a historic victory against Premiership Champions London Wasps and Northampton in a &#x27;winner takes all&#x27; end of season finale, which they won 21–19. This match was shown live with more twists and turns off the pitch as well as on it, with then Northampton player, Shane Drahm, who had signed for Worcester eventually starting, and successfully kicking almost everything, after press releases by Northampton stating that he would be a substitute. In the 2004–05 season, despite Premiership survival being their ultimate aim, they reached the final of the defunct European Shield at Oxford&#x27;s Kassam Stadium, after beating Leeds Tykes in the semi-final. They eventually lost out to the French side Auch. They also managed to achieve a play-off match for the Heineken Cup against Saracens, but their long fight for Premiership survival and an injury-ravaged squad meant that they lost. Their achievements for that season meant that they had achieved much more than they had originally hoped for, as well as earning the respect of the other Premiership sides in the process.

In the 2005–06 season, they reached the quarter–finals of the European Challenge Cup after finishing top of their pool with five wins out of a possible six, above Connacht, Montpellier Hérault and Amatori Catania, and faced an away match against Northampton Saints on April Fool&#x27;s Day, which they won, in what was described by sports writers as some of the best rugby they have played all season. They reached the semi – finals where they faced Gloucester Rugby in a local derby showdown, it being the third time they had played Gloucester that season, with the European match being played the week after the Premiership match at Kingsholm. Despite playing some thrilling rugby, and looking much more solid as a team than the previous week&#x27;s Premiership performance, they were knocked out of the competition. The European Challenge Cup was then a much more important competition to Worcester as it offered them a route into the Heineken Cup. In the 2005–06 Guinness Premiership, they avoided relegation and were safe much earlier in the season, which meant that they avoided a repeat of last years relegation battle on the last day of the season. The season culminated in an eighth-place finish in the league on 47 points, one place higher than 2004–05, with the same number of wins (9) but more bonus points and a draw, missing 7th position due to Newcastle Falcons having a better points difference, secured on the last day of the season. This was a huge achievement considering that this is still only their second season in rugby&#x27;s top flight.

In the 2006–07 season Worcester didn&#x27;t get off to a very good start and for the majority of the season they were positioned in 12th place, but a good run of form which involved beating some of the top sides in the Premiership, helping them to avoid relegation and send the former Heineken Cup champions Northampton Saints down into National Division One.

===Established in the Premiership===
For the 2007–08 season Worcester had brought in several big name players, the best known being the All Black Rico Gear. But they again didn&#x27;t start off very well in the Premiership and did not record their first victory until after Christmas. While they were struggling in the premiership they were enjoying good success in the European Challenge Cup (ECC), progressing through the group stages. After Christmas their premiership form picked up and they beat top teams such as Leicester Tigers and Sale Sharks, which subsequently saw them move out of the relegation zone, Leeds Carnegie replacing them. They progressed even further in the ECC and beat off Montpellier Hérault RC in the quarter-final and saw off Newcastle Falcons in the semi-final which set up a final against Bath. Leeds Carnegie could not survive relegation and were relegated well before the end of the season. The final against Bath resulted in a 24–16 defeat in a one-sided game.

In 2008 Worcester pulled off one of their largest signings ever by signing Australian international Chris Latham from the Queensland Reds, for the 2008–09 season on a three-year deal. The season again didn&#x27;t go the way it was planned but Worcester still progressed in the ECC and pulled off home and away victories over local rivals Gloucester and London Wasps in the league. However the season ended disappointingly (after Worcester suffered a succession of serious injuries), losing in the semi-final of the European Challenge Cup to Bourgoin.

===Relegation from the Premiership===
After the disappointment of the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership season, the Warriors made a bright start to the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership season. Either side of a loss to Wasps, they had convincing wins over newly promoted Leeds Carnegie and over Sale Sharks, only their second home win over Sale since they joined the top flight in 2004–05, which was then followed by an unlucky loss at champions Leicester Tigers. A poor spell followed with 10 games without a win. During the winless spell, the club did become the first Premiership team to draw four games in a season and the first team to draw three successive league games. Following this bad spell, the Warriors secured a much needed 13–0 victory over Newcastle at Sixways, before another six consecutive losses. On 25 April, the Warriors were relegated from the Premiership after a 12–10 loss away to Leeds Carnegie, their first relegation in 22 years. They played the 2010–11 season in the Championship with Richard Hill as the new head coach, on a 2-year contract and Chris Pennell as the new captain.

===Return to the Premiership===
The 2010–11 season saw Worcester win 30 out of 31 games in the Championship, losing the only game to the Cornish Pirates in the main season at Sixways. Worcester were top of the league and top of their stage 2 group. After winning the play-off against Bedford Blues at Sixways and both legs of the play-off final, Worcester secured promotion to the Premiership for the 2011–12 season. Before the season began, there were local news reports that Worcester Warriors
aimed to build a Hilton Hotel on the Sixways site, whilst also building a health and leisure facility and potentially expanding the North Stand.
Hill left the Warriors in April 2013 and was replaced by Dean Ryan.

===2013 onwards===
Ryan couldn&#x27;t keep the Warriors in the league in his first season in charge and the club was once again relegated to England&#x27;s second tier.
However, after releasing a number of older players the club began a rebuilding phase led by Ryan who recruited young talents unable to get game-time at big clubs. Warriors achieved promotion back to the Premiership at their first attempt, beating Bristol in the playoffs thanks to a last minute Chris Pennell try and Ryan Lamb conversion. The club also managed to win the B&amp;I Cup defeating Doncaster 35–5.
Warriors&#x27; first season back in the Aviva Premiership during the 2015/16 campaign was a successful one following the redevelopment of the Indoor Training Centre. The club also made a number of high-profile signings in Francois Hougaard, Donncha O&#x27;Callaghan and Wynand Olivier and finished the season in tenth position after winning seven games.
In 2016–17 the club finished 11th after a strong finish to the season under new Director of Rugby Gary Gold. Warriors scored a club record of 56 tries in the league. Gold left Worcester in early 2018 and was replaced as director of rugby by Alan Solomons who guided Worcester to another 11th-place finish in 2017–18.

The 2021–22 season saw the club finish 11th in the Premiership and win the Premiership Cup for the first time.

===2022 onwards: financial difficulties, administration and suspension from Premiership===
In August 2022 the club was served with a winding-up petition for unpaid tax by HM Revenue and Customs. They played their first game of the season, suffering heavy defeat to London Irish on 10 September 2022.

A statement was released on 13 September confirming that the club were awaiting final contract sign off by a new buyer. Despite the deadline of the following day; the deal was not signed and the RFU issued an ultimatum to the club on 15 September. They had until 12:00 BST on 16 September to confirm compliance for their round two match at Sixways or they would be suspended from the league. Compliance was confirmed by midday and therefore their round 2 match took place on 18 September 2022. The club received a similar ultimatum for their round 3 match on 24 September. They were able to prove compliance for the match by midday on 22 September and were then asked to prove long-term viability by 5pm on 26 September. This deadline was missed and Worcester Warriors along with their women&#x27;s team were suspended from all competitions. It was later confirmed by the club that they were seeking administration.

The club were expelled from Premiership Rugby for the season on 6 October and their results were expunged from the table. Subject to finding a buyer they will play in the RFU Championship in 2023–24.

On 16 December 2022, the RFU rejected the club&#x27;s plans for a return to the Championship in 2023–24 due to the prospective buyers selected by the administrators being unable to fulfill given conditions. Unless an alternative buyer is found the prospective buyers will not be able to operate the club as a professional club.

In the autumn of 2024 the club submitted an application to join the second tier of English rugby. Evaluations and interviews took place throughout November 2024 and if successful they will return for the 2025–26 season when the second is expanded from 12 to 14 teams.

===Rivalries===
Toward the end of their time, Worcester developed two main rivalries, with Gloucester and Rotherham.

The rivalry with Rotherham stemmed from the clubs meeting each other numerous times in The Championship between 1998 and 2003. After Worcester gained promotion to the Championship in 1998, the two clubs were constantly at the top end of the table together, battling for the solitary promotion place. In the four seasons they were both in the league, between 1998 and 2003, Rotherham finished second once and first three times, whilst Worcester finished third twice and second twice. Due to both teams consistently doing well in the league, and tensions between the two clubs being high off the pitch, the games often attracted bigger crowds and greater media interest than usual. The importance of the clashes and the rivalry that developed led to the two clubs being dubbed &quot;The Celtic and Rangers&quot; of their division.

After two close league games in the 2001–02 season, which saw Worcester win at Sixways in September by two points, thanks to a Tim Walsh drop goal, and Rotherham win the game at Clifton Lane in January by 10 points, the rivalry peaked in the following season, 2002–03. Rotherham had won the 2001–02 Championship, losing just two games, with Worcester finishing second, having lost three games. However, Rotherham were denied promotion based on the fact that their stadium, Clifton Lane, was not at the required standard. To rectify that and meet Premiership stadium criteria in time for the 2002–03 season, Rotherham moved to Millmoor and shared the stadium with Rotherham United FC.

The first meeting between the two teams in the 2002–03 campaign was at Millmoor on 23 November. Despite being fairly early in the season, a big five-point win for Rotherham, in front of over 4,000 fans, including a sizeable away following from Worcester, was a huge step in Rotherham winning the league and gaining promotion. That encounter was again a very heated and physical battle. Worcester were well on top during the first half and went into the interval 13–6 ahead, thanks to a Chris Garrard try and some excellent game management from fly half Tim Walsh. However, the second half was a completely different affair, with Worcester&#x27;s Chris Garrard sent off for a dangerous tackle on Jacob Raulini, and Steve Caine sin binned. Rotherham, spurred on by their biggest and most vociferous crowd of the season, scored 32 points, including four tries, and conceded none, to complete a demolition of Worcester.

Despite the big win for Rotherham at Millmoor, Worcester only lost one game until the two teams met again at Sixways in April, winning 12 league games and losing only away to Orrell. That ensured they kept in contact with Rotherham at the top of the table. The game at Sixways was the third-last game of the season and, with the sides neck and neck in the league, the winner would almost certainly gain a place in the Premiership. Worcester had gone 20 games and 18 months since their last home loss, which was to Rotherham in September 2001. The game was the first Championship match to be broadcast live on Sky Sports and it also saw the record attendance for a Championship game, with temporary stands constructed to ensure that 5,700 fans could watch. Rotherham brought a 1,000-strong contingent, almost all of whom were seated in the North Stand at Sixways, in what was virtual segregation. The first half of the game was extremely tense, with Rotherham leading 9–3 at the break. However, the second half saw Rotherham score two tries in 10 minutes which put the game out of Worcester&#x27;s reach. Rotherham went on to win the game 21–9, which sparked wild celebrations and a pitch invasion from the Rotherham fans.

Rotherham were often considered as Worcester&#x27;s rivals by fans who watched Worcester before 2004. However, because Worcester&#x27;s average attendances more than doubled after that, a large percentage of the Worcester fan base, many of them newer supporters, saw Gloucester as Worcester&#x27;s main rival. That was predominantly because of playing them regularly since gaining promotion to the Premiership in 2004, the geographical closeness of the two cities, and various media sources citing the game as a derby.

<text>The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 SCOTS) is an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Prior to 28 March 2006, the Royal Highland Fusiliers was an infantry regiment in its own right, created by the amalgamation of the Royal Scots Fusiliers with the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment) in January 1959.

==History==
The regiment was formed as the Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret&#x27;s Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment) on 20 January 1959 by the amalgamation of the Royal Scots Fusiliers with the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment). The Royal Highland Fusiliers, abbreviated as &#x27;The RHF&#x27;, were part of the Scottish Division.

The regiment was initially based at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh before being deployed to Singapore Lines in Aden in 1960. The regimental band played at independence ceremonies in Hargeisa in 1960. It was then posted to St. Patricks barracks in Malta in 1961, to Mons Barracks in Iserlohn in 1963, to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for six months in 1965 and to Fort George in 1967.

In 1968 the regiment was deployed to Gibraltar for six months on frontier duties after General Franco closed the frontier between Spain and Gibraltar and then undertook five tours in Northern Ireland during the Troubles in the 1970s. It relocated to Kiwi Barracks at Bulford Camp in 1970. After a two-year posting to Malaysia, the regiment returned to Redford Barracks in 1973 moving on to Barrosa Barracks at Hemer in 1979.

The regiment were at the Palace Barracks at Holywood in 1983, Berlin in 1985 and briefly back in Redford Barracks before going to Oakington Barracks at Cambridge in 1989. After taking part in the Gulf War in 1991, the regiment moved to St Barbara Barracks at Fallingbostel in 1993 from where it deployed units to Bosnia in 1994 and to Macedonia and Kosovo in 1999.

The regiment moved back to Fort George in July 2000 and to Salamanca Barracks in Cyprus in September 2003. The battalion was involved in Operation TELIC IV in Iraq in Summer 2004 and then in Operation TELIC VI in Iraq in Spring 2006.

As part of the Delivering Security in a Changing World Review of the Armed Forces, the regiment was amalgamated with the other regiments of the Scottish Division to become the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland which was formed on 28 March 2006. The battalion moved to Glencorse Barracks in Penicuik at the same time.

In Summer 2015 units of the battalion were deployed to Afghanistan to train the Afghan National Army.

Following the Army 2020 Refine, the battalion was assigned to the 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland as a light infantry battalion. In addition the changes, the reserve 6th (52nd Lowland) Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland was paired with them. On 1 August 2019, the Field Army was re-organised, and the battalion along with the 6th battalion moved under command of the 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East.

In April 2023 members of the battalion took part in the reburial of a British Soldier from the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders killed at the Battle of Camden in August 1780.

==Regimental heritage==
The regiment and current battalion has the distinction among British infantry regiments of carrying three Colours on parade. In addition to the Queen&#x27;s and Regimental Colours, the third – the Assaye Colour, was originally awarded by the Governor General in Council in India on behalf of the British East India Company to the 74th Highland Regiment for distinguished service at the Battle of Assaye in India in 1803 while under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington.

The regiment maintained the traditions of the long &#x27;Attention&#x27; command being given on parade (rather than the modern abbreviated Army &#x27;shun&#x27;) and of referring to the Commanding Officer&#x27;s orders (disciplinary parade) as &#x27;haul up&#x27; from the days of the unit acting as escorts to prisoners being transported to the colonies. Officers wore red &#x27;infantry&#x27; piping on the epaulettes of their greatcoats, a detail inherited from the Royal Scots Fusiliers and mentioned by Boris Pasternak in his book &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but long lost to other infantry regiments.

The regiment&#x27;s uniform included the blue Glengarry cap with red &#x27;tourie&#x27;, red, white and green dicing, black silk cockade and &#x27;Flaming Grenade&#x27; cap badge, Mackenzie tartan trews and black highland brogue shoes worn with white spats. In the field in combat dress, the Glengarry was replaced, when a helmet is not worn, by a khaki &#x27;tam o&#x27;shanter&#x27; bonnet with Mackenzie tartan patch and with a white hackle from the Royal Scots Fusiliers when appropriate. The Regimental capbadge was the &#x27;grenade in flames&#x27; taken from the Royal Scots Fusiliers cap badge, on which is mounted the crowned HLI monogram from the Highland Light Infantry. The tartan is &#x27;Mackenzie&#x27;, the blue and green &#x27;government&#x27; tartan with added white and red lines.

==Battle honours==
The regiment has been awarded over 200 battle honours, from Blenheim to the Gulf War, gained in every major and many minor conflicts, campaigns and theatres of war since the 21st Regiment&#x27;s first engagement at the Battle of Walcourt in 1689, a number unsurpassed by any other unit in the British Army.

The regiment&#x27;s battle honours include: Blenheim (August 1704 – War of the Spanish Succession), Assaye (September 1803 – Mahratta War), The Storming of Badajos (April 1812 – Peninsular War), Vitoria (June 1813 – Peninsular War), Waterloo (July 1815), Inkerman (November 1854 – Crimean War) and Gheluvelt (October 1914 – World War 1 – France). 44 battle honours are carried on the Regimental Colour, 29 on the Queens Colour and 2: Seringapatam and Assaye, on the Assaye Colour.

<text>The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS) is an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Prior to 28 March 2006, the Highlanders was an infantry regiment in its own right; The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons), part of the Scottish Division. The regiment was one of only two in the British Army with a Gaelic motto – &quot;Cuidich &#x27;n Righ&quot; which means &quot;Help the King&quot;. (The other is the Royal Irish Regiment.)

==History==

The regiment was formed on 17 September 1994 as part of the Options for Change defence review, by the amalgamation of the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) and the Gordon Highlanders.

The new regiment undertook a two-year tour of Northern Ireland from April 1995, and were stationed at Ebrington Barracks in County Londonderry. After being based in various locations around the United Kingdom, the battalion was deployed to Bosnia in 2003.

In 2004, as part of the restructuring of the infantry, it was announced that The Highlanders would be amalgamated with the other Scottish infantry regiments into the single large Royal Regiment of Scotland. The amalgamation took place on 28 March 2006. As with the other Scottish regiments, the Highlanders were permitted to retain their former name as the new battalion&#x27;s primary title, with the battalion number as a subtitle. They therefore became &quot;The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland&quot;.

Prior to amalgamation, the battalion moved to the Bergen-Hohne Garrison, Bad Fallingbostel, in Germany, as part of 7 Armoured Brigade, the descendants of the Second World War&#x27;s Desert Rats, equipped with the Warrior Infantry Vehicle. From here they undertook six-month tours of Iraq in 2005–06 and 2008, and Afghanistan in April 2011.

In September 2015 the battalion moved from Germany to Bourlon Barracks in Catterick Garrison, where they became a heavy protected mobility battalion forming part of 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade.

As a result of Army 2020 Refine restructure, the battalion joined the Strike Experimentation Group in 2020.

==Uniform and traditions==
While the 4 SCOTS now wear the Government 1A pattern tartan, prior to amalgamation in 2006 the regiment wore the Gordon tartan when in kilts and the Seaforth Mackenzie when in trews. The battalion&#x27;s pipers and drummers wear kilts in the Cameron of Erracht tartan. The battalion recruits from the Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the mainland counties of Inverness-shire, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Moray and Nairnshire, and from the traditional Gordon heartlands in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. The Battalion Headquarters is located at Cameron Barracks in Inverness.

The battalion is the mainstay of the British Army&#x27;s only shinty team, The Scots Shinty Club. Due to the 4th Battalion&#x27;s regular placements abroad, the team only plays in cup matches.

<doc id="972486" wikidata="Q5256166" url="?curid=972486" title="Demolition Doll Rods">
<text>The Demolition Doll Rods were an American three-piece glam/garage rock band from Detroit, Michigan. The band, known for outré stage attire, released its first record in 1994. The original line up included Dan Kroha as Danny Doll Rod (formerly of The Gories) on guitar, vocals, and harmonies, Margaret Doll Rod on guitar and lead vocals, and songwriting, Christine Doll Rod, also known as &#x27;The Thump&#x27;/Thumper/Thumpurr on drums. In March 2006 Christine went on &quot;maternity leave&quot; and was replaced by Tia &quot;Baby T&quot; Dollrod.

== History ==
The band first found national exposure in the mid-1990s on the second stage at Lollapalooza and as an opening act for, respectively, Iggy Pop, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and The Cramps. The band&#x27;s sound has been influenced primarily by other famous Motor City rockers like the MC5 and the Stooges. Their stage performances have been likened to those of the New York Dolls, and also The Cramps; the band members appearing in drag or in costume, occasionally wearing food items and often almost nothing at all. One memorable performance featured the band performing with only toy cartoon mouse heads covering their breasts, and only plastic wrap and semi-strategically placed slices of Swiss cheese covering their nether regions. In the last few years of their existence they wore leather pieces that they had made by Tom the Leatherman who designed costumes for Parliament/Funkadelic in the late 1970s.

The Doll Rods played a genre-crossing, minimalist Detroit rock style incorporating rhythm and blues and garage rock. The three piece band featured lead and rhythm guitars backed by the most basic bass-drum-floor-tom-and-snare drum kit. Their lyrics made frequent reference to sex, drug overdoses, drag racing, boys, girls, dogs, cats and good times.

== Break up ==

On April 4, 2007, Dan Kroha posted the following message to the band&#x27;s Myspace page:

To all our beloved and loyal fans . . .
This is Danny. I have decided that after thirteen years of non-stop Doll Rod action, it is time for me to take a break for a while (don&#x27;t really know how long). I am very proud of all we&#x27;ve done as a band and I want to thank everyone who has loved and supported us all these years.

The band has since been inactive, with members concentrating on other musical projects. Margaret Doll Rod released the solo LP &quot;Enchanté&quot; on the Rockin&#x27; Bones label and formed the band Heartthrob Chassis, who signed with Milan Records. Dan Kroha performs solo and leads the band Danny and the Darleans, in addition to occasional touring with a reformed Gories.

<text>Big Spring Park in Cedartown, Georgia contains a large limestone spring producing up to four million gallons of water per day providing water to 10,000 people in the area. The Cedartown Waterworks-Woman&#x27;s building and the Big Spring Park are listed on the National Register of Historic Place

==History==
The original white settlers who moved into this area of northwest Georgia centered their activities around this spring, calling their town &quot;Big Spring&quot;. Asa Prior purchased the land around Big Spring in 1834. In 1852, Prior deeded the spring and adjacent land to the newly charted city of Cedartown.

In more recent times, the spring was turned into a park. A modern water treatment facility was installed on the site at 301 Wissahickon Avenue, which pumps water via pipelines to the surrounding areas. In 2000, the American Water Works Association named the Cedartown Water Plant an American Water Landmark.

<doc id="972490" wikidata="Q2271494" url="?curid=972490" title="Mr. Big (Mr. Big album)">
<text>Mr. Big is the debut album by the American rock band Mr. Big. Produced by Kevin Elson, the album proved a partial commercial success, reaching the 46th slot on the Billboard 200 chart. Lead-off single &quot;Addicted to that Rush&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s aggressive guitar and bass playing, also brought the group some mainstream attention, reaching the No. 39 slot on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. 300,000 copies were sold, according to a &quot;Musician&quot; magazine interview with Mr. Big in 1990.

Several of the songs from the album became live staples of the band, and have since been included in various live albums. The group followed up the album with &quot;Lean Into It&quot; in 1991.

The song &quot;30 Days in the Hole&quot; was originally recorded by British rock band Humble Pie on the 1972 album &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot;. Bassist Billy Sheehan revealed on an interview on Nikki Sixx&#x27;s radio show &quot;Sixx Sense&quot; that &quot;Wind Me Up&quot; is based on &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; by Roy Orbison played backwards.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opined that &quot;the lyrics are strictly by-the-numbers, but the playing is hard, flashy and tuneful, combining Bad Company&#x27;s bluesiness with Def Leppard&#x27;s melodic metal.&quot;

<text>The Durham Gospels is a very incomplete late 7th-century insular Gospel Book, now kept in the Durham Cathedral Dean and Chapter Library (MS A.II.17). A single folio of this manuscript is now in Magdalene College, Cambridge (Pepysian MS 2981). Only two of the fully decorated pages survive: a &quot;Crucifixion&quot; (the oldest in English art) and the initial to John, and both of these are in poor condition. There were probably originally evangelist portraits and carpet pages, as in other Insular Gospel books conceived on a similar scale. The book was produced at Lindisfarne and brought to Durham when the monks of Lindisfarne removed to Durham because of Viking attacks. The Durham Gospels were written by the same scribe who wrote the Echternach Gospels, now in Paris.

The Durham Cathedral Library A. II. 10. Gospel Book Fragment is another manuscript (MS A.II.10) in the cathedral library which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Durham Gospels&quot;, but more usually as the &quot;Durham Gospel Fragment&quot;.

The Durham Gospels are used at the Enthronement of each new Bishop of Durham, for the new Bishop to take his oath on. During this service, the most senior first King’s Scholar from Durham School holds the Gospels for the Bishop to take his oath.

<doc id="972519" wikidata="Q17087755" url="?curid=972519" title="Crossover cable">
<text>A crossover cable connects two devices of the same type, for example DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE, usually connected asymmetrically (DTE-DCE), by a modified cable called a crosslink. Such a distinction between devices was introduced by IBM.

The crossing of wires in a cable or in a connector adaptor allows:
* connecting two devices directly, output of one to input of the other,
* letting two terminal (DTE) devices communicate without an interconnecting hub knot, i.e. PCs,
* linking two or more hubs, switches or routers (DCE) together, possibly to work as one wider device.

In contrast, a straight-through cable uses direct wiring to connect complementary devices, e.g. a PC to a switch.

==Concept==
Straight-through cables are used for most applications, but crossover cables are required in others.

In a straight-through cable, pins on one end correspond exactly to the corresponding pins on the other end (pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, etc.). Using the same wiring scheme at each end yields a straight-through cable (a given color wire connects to a given number pin, the same at both ends). In this case, the terminations are identical, so only one pinout is required.

In a crossover cable, pins do not correspondsome or all of the conductors are swapped at the terminations. For example, if pin 1 on one end goes to pin 2 on the other end, then pin 2 on one end goes to pin 1 on the other end, and the other pins remain unaffected. Such crossover cables are electrically symmetrical, meaning that they work identically regardless of which way you plug them in (if you turn the cable around, it still connects the same pins as before). Using different wiring at each end yields a crossover cable (a given color wire connects to one number pin at one end, and a different number pin at the other). 

==Examples==

* Null modem of RS-232 
* Ethernet crossover cable
* Rollover cable
* A loopback is a type of degraded &quot;one side crosslinked connection&quot; connecting a port to itself, usually for test purposes.

== Other technologies ==
Some connection standards use different balanced pairs to transmit data, so crossover cables for them have different configurations to swap the transmit and receive pairs:
* Twisted pair Token Ring uses T568B pairs 1 and 3 (the same as T568A pairs 1 and 2), so a crossover cable to connect two Token Ring interfaces must swap these pairs, connecting pins 4, 5, 3, and 6 to 3, 6, 4, and 5 respectively.
* A T1 cable uses T568B pairs 1 and 2, so to connect two T1 CSU/DSU devices back-to-back requires a crossover cable that swaps these pairs. Specifically, pins 1, 2, 4, and 5 are connected to 4, 5, 1, and 2 respectively.

* A 56K DDS cable uses T568B pairs 2 and 4, so a crossover cable for these devices swaps those pairs (pins 1, 2, 7, and 8 are connected to 7, 8, 1, and 2 respectively).

<text>The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s) is a light infantry company (designated as Balaklava Company, 5th Battalion, [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]) and was a line infantry regiment of the British Army that existed from 1881 until amalgamation into the Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006.

The regiment was created under the Childers Reforms in 1881, as the Princess Louise&#x27;s (Sutherland and Argyll Highlanders), by the amalgamation of the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot and 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot, amended the following year to reverse the order of the &quot;Argyll&quot; and &quot;Sutherland&quot; sub-titles. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was expanded to fifteen battalions during the First World War (1914–1918) and nine during the Second World War (1939–1945). The 1st Battalion served in the 1st Commonwealth Division in the Korean War and gained a high public profile for its role in Aden during 1967.

As part of the restructuring of the British Army&#x27;s infantry in 2006, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were amalgamated with the Royal Scots, the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret&#x27;s Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment), the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) and the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) into the seven-battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland. Following a further round of defence cuts announced in July 2012, the 5th Battalion was reduced to a single light infantry company called Balaklava Company, 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders).

==History==
===Formation===
It was formed in 1881 by the amalgamation of the 91st (Princess Louise&#x27;s Argyllshire) Regiment and the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment as outlined in the Childers Reforms. The regiment was one of the six Scottish line infantry regiments, and wore the Sutherland district tartan (Government No. 1A) as its regimental tartan; this is a lightened version of the Black Watch (Government No. 1) sett. The unit also had the largest cap badge in the British Army. The uniform included the Glengarry as its ceremonial headdress.
At the Childers Reforms amalgamation, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders already had a well-earned reputation for valour in the face of the enemy, most notably the 93rd (later 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) during the Crimean War. Here, the 93rd earned the sobriquet of &quot;The Fighting Highlanders&quot; and carried with it the status of having been the original &quot;Thin Red Line&quot;. This title was bestowed following the action of the 93rd at Balaklava on 25 October 1854 in which this single battalion alone stood between the undefended British Army base at Balaklava and four squadrons of charging Russian cavalry. The 93rd, under the command of Sir Colin Campbell, not only held steady, but for the first time in the history of the British Army, broke a large cavalry charge using musket fire alone, without having been formed into a square.

This action was witnessed by the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent William Howard Russell, who reported that nothing stood between the Russian cavalry and the defenceless British base but the &quot;thin red streak tipped with a line of steel of the 93rd&quot; a description immediately paraphrased and passed into folklore as &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. Later referred to by Kipling in his evocative poem &quot;Tommy&quot;, the saying came to epitomise everything the British Army stood for. This feat of arms is still recognised by the plain red and white dicing worn on the cap band of the A and SH Glengarry bonnets.

===Second Boer War===

The 1st Battalion arrived in the Cape in November 1899 and formed part of the 3rd or Highland Brigade. The Argylls played leading roles in the Battle of Modder River, the Battle of Magersfontein, the Battle of Paardeberg, and in an action at Roodepoort immediately preceding the Battle of Doornkop. In June 1900, the battalion was transferred to a new brigade under Brigadier General George Cunningham. They operated around Pretoria and from April 1901, in the Eastern Transvaal. Sections of Argylls formed parts of the 2nd and 12th Battalions Mounted Infantry, and a detachment, along with the Black Watch, formed an escort for Captain J. E. Bearcroft&#x27;s naval guns during the advance to Pretoria.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had two Reserve and five Territorial battalions.

===First World War===


====Regular Army====
The 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 81st Brigade in the 27th Division in December 1914 for service on the Western Front.

The 2nd Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 19th Brigade, which was operating independently, in August 1914 for service on the Western Front.

====Territorial Force====
The 1/5th (Renfrewshire) Battalion landed at Cape Helles as part of the 157th Brigade in the 52nd (Lowland) Division in June 1915; the battalion was evacuated to Egypt in January 1916 and then landed at Marseille in April 1918 for service on the Western Front.

The 1/6th (Renfrewshire) Battalion landed in France as part of the 152nd Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division in May 1915; the battalion moved to Italy in November 1917 but returned to France in April 1918.

The 1/7th Battalion landed in France as part of the 10th Brigade in the 4th Division in December 1914 for service on the Western Front.

The 1/8th (The Argyllshire) Battalion landed in France as part of the 152nd Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front.

The 14th (Service) Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 120th Brigade in the 40th Division in June 1916 for service on the Western Front.

====Irish War of Independence====
During the Irish War of Independence, the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was sent to be stationed in Claremorris, County Mayo in 1919. Though the battalion&#x27;s time in Ireland was mostly uneventful, soldiers from the regiment were involved in the death of Captain Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Boland, the officer commanding of the Crossard Company, East Mayo Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). On 27 May 1921, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders shot and killed Boland while he was allegedly attempting to escape near his home in Aghamore; Boland&#x27;s body was reportedly severely mutilated after his death.

===Second World War===

The 1st Battalion fought in the Western Desert Campaign, Crete, Abyssinia, Sicily and in the Italian Campaign. The first action for the 1st Battalion was at Sidi Barani where they joined the battle on 10 December 1940 as part of the 16th Infantry Brigade. On 17 May 1941 the battalion moved to Crete where they formed part of the defence based on the east side of the island at Tymbaki. Most of the Argylls marched from Tymbaki to the airfield at Heraklion on the night of 24 May to help support the 14th Infantry Brigade in the fighting at that airfield. They were successfully evacuated on 29 May from Heraklion but their convoy suffered air attacks and many casualties on the route away from Crete. The Argylls left at Tymbaki were captured when the island surrendered. The 1st Battalion was shipped to Alexandria and after garrison duties followed by a raid into the Gondar region of Abyssinia, they were sent back to the Western Desert where they were eventually attached to the 161st Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 4th Indian Infantry Division, and fought in the Second Battle of El Alamein. In 1943 the 1st Battalion landed on Sicily during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, attached to the 5th British Infantry Division as the 33rd Beach Brick. From February 1944 the battalion fought through the Italian Campaign with the 19th Indian Infantry Brigade, attached to 8th Indian Infantry Division.

The 2nd Battalion fought valiantly against the Imperial Japanese Army during the fighting in Malaya and Singapore (See Battle of Bukit Timah). Led by the tough Lieutenant Colonel Ian Stewart they were one of the very few British units that was prepared for the jungle warfare in Malaya. In the months before the invasion of southern Thailand and Malaya in 1941, Stewart took his battalion into the harshest terrain he could find and developed tactics to fight effectively in those areas. This training that the 2nd Argylls went through would make them arguably the most effective unit in General Percival&#x27;s Malayan Command, earning them the nickname &quot;the jungle beasts&quot;.

During the withdrawal of the 11th Indian Infantry Division, the 2nd Argylls slowed the enemy advance and inflicted heavy casualties on them. During these actions the battalion became so depleted by battle that it was ordered back into Singapore. Two days later, 2,000 or so men of the 22nd Australian Brigade (the absolute tail guard of the British forces) arrived at the causeway. An Australian staff officer was amazed to find the Argylls camped on the Malay side of the water, and asked why they were in Malaya when they could have been in the relative comfort of Singapore. Lt. Col. Stewart replied &quot;You know the trouble with you Australians is that you have no sense of history. When the story of this campaign is written you will find that the ASHR goes down as the last unit to cross this causeway what&#x27;s more – piped across by their pipers&quot;.

The Argylls had lost 800 men due to continuous action as rear guards (especially at the Battle of Slim River). When the remaining Argylls arrived in Singapore in December 1941, the battalion was reinforced with some Royal Marines who had survived the sinking of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;. The merger was held at Tyersall Park, and the battalion was informally renamed &quot;Plymouth Argylls&quot;. (This was in reference to the Argylls&#x27; affiliation with Plymouth Argyle F.C. and to the Plymouth Division of the Royal Marines, which all the Marines were from.

The battalion surrendered with the rest of the army in Singapore in February 1942. Many Argylls died in captivity as P.O.W&#x27;s or in the jungle trying to avoid capture. A few Argylls managed to escape to India, including Lt.Col. Stewart, where they lectured on jungle warfare tactics. After this the evacuees became part of No. 6 GHQ Training Team, which organised training exercises and lectures for the 14th Indian Infantry Division and 2nd British Infantry Division.

In May 1942, the 15th Battalion, raised during the war, was redesignated as the new 2nd Battalion. This battalion joined the 227th (Highland) Infantry Brigade and became a part of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, a formation that would gain an excellent reputation, in 1943. With the division, the battalion fought in the Battle for Caen, seeing its first action in Operation Epsom, as part of Operation Overlord. The division ended the war on the Elbe River.
The 5th battalion landed in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force in September 1939. They took part in the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940 and then, after converting to become the 91st Anti-Tank Regiment and seeing action at the Normandy landings in June 1944, they fought through North-West Europe to the River Elbe.

The 6th Battalion landed in France as corps troops for I Corps with the British Expeditionary Force in September 1939. They took part in the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940 and then, after converting to become the 93rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery saw action in the Tunisia campaign, in the Allied landings in Sicily and in the Allied landings in Italy.

The 7th Battalion was a Territorial Army (TA) unit serving in the 154th (Highland) Infantry Brigade. The brigade was part of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in France in 1940 as part of the British Expeditionary Force. They were stationed on the Maginot Line and so avoided being encircled with the rest of the BEF during the Battle of France. The 7th Argylls in particular suffered heavy losses during the fighting, the worst day in its history. The 154th Brigade managed to be evacuated to England after the 51st (Highland) Division was forced to surrender on 12 June 1940. The division was reconstituted by the redesignation of the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division to the 51st. The understrength 154th Brigade of the old 51st was merged with the 28th Infantry Brigade. In 1942 the new 51st Division, 7th Argylls included, were sent to join the British Eighth Army in the North African Campaign. They fought in the First Battle of El Alamein and in the Second Battle of El Alamein which turned the tide of the war in favour of the Allies. During the fighting in North Africa, Lieutenant Colonel Lorne MacLaine Campbell of 7th Argylls was awarded the Victoria Cross. In March 1942, two British privates from the 7th battalion, Macfarlane and Goldie, escaped wearing their blue work detail overalls over their battledress. They wore rucksacks to cover the markings &quot;KG&quot; (&quot;Kriegsgefangener&quot;, &quot;prisoner of war&quot;) on their backs. They secreted themselves in a rail wagon carrying salt to Belgium. There they managed to contact an escape line and, by the middle of the year, they were safely back in Scotland.

The 8th Battalion was also a Territorial Army (TA) unit serving with the 7th Battalion in the 154th (Highland) Infantry Brigade. The brigade was part of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in France in 1940 as part of the British Expeditionary Force. The 154th Brigade managed to be evacuated to England after the 51st (Highland) Division was forced to surrender on 12 June 1940. On 25 April 1943, the 8th Battalion was, by this time, serving with the 36th Brigade, part of the 78th &quot;Battleaxe&quot; Division during the Tunisian Campaign won fame during the assault of Djebel Ahmera hill on the attack on Longstop Hill, in which despite heavy casualties from mortar and machine gun fire scaled and took the heights. Major John Thompson McKellar Anderson, for inspiring his men and eliminating strong points, gained the Victoria Cross.

The 9th Battalion, also a Territorial unit, was converted to artillery as the 54th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery comprising three batteries from the former Companies: 160 (Dumbarton), 161 (Alexandria) and 162 (Helensburgh). Former B Company (Kirkintilloch) and D Company (Clydebank) formed the nucleus of the second-line regiment, the 58th LAA, comprising 172,173 and 174 Batteries.
Armed with Bofors and Lewis guns, the 54th saw action protecting the rear of the retreat of the BEF to Dunkirk, destroying the Bofors before rescue. 162 Battery became detached protecting airfields at Reims and escaped in June via Brest, St. Nazaire and La Rochelle. Between Dunkirk and D-Day they were deployed mostly in training and protecting airfields and other sites in England, including Manchester, as part of 44th AA Brigade. They participated in Operation Harlequin on the south coast. They were then transferred to 9th Armoured Division until its dispersal in 1944 and then to the 21st Army Group. They were deployed after D-Day, in August 1944, in support of the First Canadian Army, landing at Juno Beach. They provided support at Rouen and Pont-de-l&#x27;Arche and onward through northern France to Boulogne and subsequently Antwerp and Ostend in Belgium. In November they moved onward to Kloosterzande, Holland, remaining there until the end of the war. They continued into Germany as part of the BAOR, helping guard POWs at Munsterlager until November 1945, then on to Brunswick until early 1946 when the regiment was put into &quot;suspended animation&quot; and demobilised.
The 58th joined the BEF and participated in the defence of Boulogne and Calais.
From May 1941 they served as part of 11th Armoured Division, initially as part of 11th Support Group until it was disbanded 1 June 1942, then transferring to Divisional Troops.
In 1944, they were deployed in Operation Overlord and later that year south and east of Eindhoven, Holland.

===After the War===
Between 1945 and 1948, the 1st Battalion saw service in Mandatory Palestine, during the conflicts with the Jewish paramilitary organisations Irgun, Haganah and Lehi.

In 1948, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion. The battalion was one of the first British units to serve in the Korean War, arriving there in September 1950 as part of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. In its first major action, in the battle of Naktong, the battalion was involved in a tragic friendly-fire incident in the fight for Hill 282. The Argylls were noted for their reoccupation of the Crater district of Aden, under controversial Commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Colin Campbell Mitchell, during the Aden Emergency in the mid-1960s.

In 1970, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, as the junior regiment of the Scottish Division, faced disbandment as part of a general downsizing of the army. A &quot;Save the Argylls&quot; campaign involving the petitioning of Parliament resulted in a compromise under which a single regular company retained the title and colours of the regiment. &quot;Balaclava Company&quot; continued as an independent unit from 20 January 1971 until the regiment was restored to full battalion size on 17 January 1972. Between 1972 and 2003 the regiment regularly served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. 

In January 2004 the regiment was deployed to the Iraq War. During this deployment the regiment was involved in numerous actions, including at the notorious Battle of Danny Boy. On return to the UK in late 2004 the regiment was presented with The Wilkinson Sword of Peace by Queen Elizabeth II, the Colonel-in-Chief, for its contribution to peace in Belfast in the aftermath of the Holy Cross dispute. She also presented Iraq Medals to selected soldiers. 
On 28 March 2006, as part of the restructuring of the infantry, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were amalgamated with the other Scottish infantry regiments into the single Royal Regiment of Scotland. The regiment&#x27;s last role before amalgamation was in the air assault role as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. Elements of the new regiment originally affiliated with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders included a regular battalion (5 SCOTS), an affiliated company of the Territorial Army battalion, 51st Highland Volunteers (7 SCOTS) and an Army Cadet Force battalion. The 5th Battalion continued recruiting in the area allocated to the Argylls, wore a green hackle on its headdress to differentiate it from the other battalions, and were permitted to use the title &quot;The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders&quot; in parenthetis in reference to the battalion.

On 5 July 2012, a further series of measures to reduce the total size of the British Army were announced by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. These included the reduction of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (5 SCOTS) to a single company (Balaklava Company) for public (ceremonial) duties in Scotland. The Queen visited the Highlanders at Howe Barracks in Canterbury in June 2013 to mark their relocation to Scotland.

When the company is mounting royal guard/guard duties they are divided into two platoons; Pony Platoon (ceremonial) and Security Platoon. When not mounting guard, the company is divided into No. 1 and No. 2 platoons for regular deployment. Following the Army 2020 Refine, the company moved to Redford Barracks where they remain as part of the 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland.

==Regimental museum==
The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum is the regimental museum of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, their antecedent regiments, and successor battalions. Located in Stirling Castle, the museum building was built in the 1490s, and known as the &quot;King&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Old Building&quot;, thought to have been the private residence of King James IV. Entrance to the museum is included in the price of the castle entrance ticket. The museum is almost entirely maintained through public donations; the modest grant from the Ministry of Defence has been withdrawn. It is governed by a charitable trust: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum Trust.

The museum closed for refurbishment in August 2018. It re-opened again, following completion of a programme of works funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and costing £4 million, in June 2021.

<doc id="972534" wikidata="Q528824" url="?curid=972534" title="Bonsai Kitten">
<text>Bonsai Kitten was a hoax website that claimed to instruct readers how to raise a kitten in a jar, so as to mold the bones of the kitten into the shape of the jar as the cat grows in the same way as a bonsai plant. It was made by an MIT student going by the alias of Dr. Michael Wong Chang. The website generated fury with many people taking it as serious and complaining to animal rights organizations. The Michigan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) stated that &quot;while the site&#x27;s content may be faked, the issue it is campaigning for may create violence towards animals&quot;. Although the website is now shut down, petitions are still circulated to shut down the site or complain to its ISP. The website has been debunked by several organizations including Snopes.com and the Humane Society of the United States.

==Concerns about the website==
On October 30, 2000, BonsaiKitten.com was featured as a &quot;Cruel Site of the Day&quot; on the website Cruel.com. When this attracted complaints, Cruel.com removed its links to BonsaiKitten.com. Afterwards, however, when links to the BonsaiKitten.com website then spread across the world, many concerned animal lovers sent complaints to the Animal Welfare Institute and the Humane Society of the United States. Animal welfare groups made statements saying that bonsai kittens were not real. The URL drew criticism, which caused the initial host, MIT, to remove it.

==Description of the spoof==

BonsaiKitten.com&#x27;s pictures show kittens in jars, presented as real examples of the &quot;lost art&quot; as described on the Bonsai Kitten web page. The spoof, according to &quot;Dr. Chang&quot;, is that the world increasingly sees nature as a commodity, so such a site may well be in demand. The spoof came to large-scale attention as the &quot;cruel site of the day&quot; for December 22, 2000, was continually heavily condemned by animal rights organizations, and after hundreds of people complained daily to them, they stated that even if Bonsai Kitten was a spoof it &quot;encourages animal cruelty&quot;.

The webpage being featured on the Cruel.com website was significantly controversial and it was quickly removed. Initial humane society statements decrying the website as &quot;encouraging abuse&quot; caused local investigation, along with an FBI announcement that it was to investigate the hoax. The prosecution of the site by the FBI was welcomed by animal activists, but decried by web authorities. The FBI backed up its investigating of Bonsai Kitten by using a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1999. The attacking of the BonsaiKitten.com website had the effect of displacing the website, which found a new ISP two more times, before being permanently hosted on Rotten.com servers. Because the website is still kept on some mirrors, it continues to receive complaints from animal activists.

The furor over the site triggered by animal rights organizations has been offset by their continued statements that the site itself is a fake. They have been stating this since 2001.

Groups such as the Animal Welfare Institute and the Humane Society of the United States received hundreds of complaints. Animal welfare groups declared the site as fake but stated they did believe it was potentially harmful. Other animal rights groups stated that the site creates an atmosphere of cruelty to animals. There is no evidence that the site was anything more than satire. Numerous authorities have advised people to stop sending complaint forms via email.

The original BonsaiKitten.com is mirrored by many sites. The nature and presentation of the sites content is such that many animal rights activists still take issue with the context of the website. Bonsai Kitten has been further updated from other servers, but infrequently and slowly, with recent additions to the site being research indicating that cat litter causes brain damage. The website states that this enhances the Bonsai Kitten art form&#x27;s practical value.

The controversy started soon after the creation of the BonsaiKitten.com website. It was the object of numerous spam email pleas. These pleas relied on the audiences, often not knowing English, to spread them. Consequently, these petitions were often spread via the Internet in non-English-speaking countries. Blues News also provided a link, which was shortly thereafter removed from the site, as complaints against the website&#x27;s existence and its content began to surface.

== Offshoots ==
In 2021, artists &quot;Eva &amp; Franco Mattes&quot; created a sculpture called Bonsai Kitten depicting a taxidermy cat inside a glass jar, which drew inspiration from the hoax website.

<text>The UKRD Group Ltd was a British media company that owned 15 commercial radio stations in the United Kingdom. The name originates from UK Radio Developments. Since its acquisition in March 2019, it has been run as a subsidiary of Bauer Radio.

==History==
Formed on 22 August 1990 as a company to invest in commercial stations following the relaxation of station ownership laws, its first investment was a stake in Cornwall&#x27;s Pirate FM 102, which was designed and launched by former County Sound boss Mike Powell who, after leaving County Sound, had formed Infinity Radio. Shortly after the launch, Infinity Radio merged with UK Radio Developments and Powell became CEO of the embryonic UKRD Group. Under Powell&#x27;s leadership, UKRD became one of the fastest growing private radio groups in the UK, rapidly adding Star FM in Slough and winning the Guildford radio franchise which gave birth to 96.4 The Eagle, the new County Sound (a recreation of the original Guildford commercial station of the same name) and Delta Radio. Subsequently, it acquired several more stations, and launched further stations on the issue of new local licences.

UKRD acquired a significant minority share-holding in Faze FM, which ran Kiss 102 in Manchester and Kiss 105 in Yorkshire. The stations had a branding deal with EMAP&#x27;s Kiss FM, London. UKRD sold its interests in the Kiss stations in 1997 to the Chrysalis Group, who added them to its Galaxy Radio network. It also had a helping hand in the launch of South Hams Radio in December 1999, which was closed in 2009 to make way for Heart.

From 2001, the head of the organisation was William Rogers, one-time leader of Penwith District Council, Cornwall.

UKRD Group&#x27;s head office was within the Carn Brea Studios of Pirate FM 102 in Redruth, Cornwall. It also had offices in Guildford, Exeter and Bristol.

In 2009, it acquired The Local Radio Company which had 20 local radio stations. UKRD disposed of many non-profitable stations, as well as re-branding Alpha Radio, Minster Northallerton and Durham FM into Star Radio North East.

In 2010, UKRD was ranked 27th in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Best Companies to Work For (SMEs) and was ranked first in the same category every year between 2011 and 2014.

In July 2018, Global announced it had bought 2BR from UKRD. The station was previously merged with The Bee.

In March 2019, Bauer Radio acquired 10 stations from UKRD as well as three local DAB multiplexes and the interest in First Radio Sales

==Stations previously owned by UKRD Group==
Prior to their sale to Bauer Radio, UKRD owned the following stations:
* 2BR Radio 2BR
* Eagle Radio
* Eagle 70s
* Eagle 80s
* Encore Radio
* Escape to Cornwall
* KL.FM 96.7
* Minster FM
* Mix 96
* Pirate FM
* Pirate 70s
* Spire FM
* Spirit FM
* Stray FM
* Wessex FM
* Yorkshire Coast Radio

==Crowdfunded local &#x27;replacements&#x27; for former UKRD Group stations==
As most of the UKRD Group stations were rebranded under the Greatest Hits Radio brand by Bauer Radio, a number of schemes were launched to establish local radio &#x27;replacements&#x27; for these services, many of which featured the same staff/presenters as the UKRD stations and many of which were set up through crowdfunding schemes. In Sussex, V2 Radio was set up to fill the gap vacated by Spirit FM, with test transmissions starting in West Sussex in December 2020, and the new service launching fully on 18 January 2021. In York, YorkMix Radio launched with former presenters from Minster FM on air, after a successful crowdfunding scheme to get local radio back on air, whilst in the Aldershot and Woking area, Radio Biscuit could be found with presenters from Eagle Radio. and Your Harrogate Radio is scheduled to launch on 1 March.

<doc id="972543" wikidata="Q3202654" url="?curid=972543" title="The Female Man">
<text>The Female Man is a feminist science fiction novel by American writer Joanna Russ. It was originally written in 1970 and first published in 1975 by Bantam Books. Russ was an ardent feminist and challenged sexist views during the 1970s with her novels, short stories, and nonfiction works. These works include &quot;We Who Are About To...&quot;, &quot;When It Changed&quot;, and &quot;What Are We Fighting For?: Sex, Race, Class, and the Future of Feminism&quot;.

The novel follows the lives of four women living in parallel universes which differ in time and place. The women visit each other&#x27;s worlds and are startled by the different views on gender roles and social conventions surrounding women and womanhood. Their encounters influence them to reevaluate their lives and redefine what it means to be a woman. 

The title of the novel comes from the character Joanna, who transforms into a &quot;female man&quot; in order to be respected and seen beyond her sex. A &quot;female man&quot; is a woman with a man&#x27;s mind, her body and soul still female. Joanna&#x27;s metaphorical transformation refers to her decision to seek equality by rejecting women&#x27;s dependence on men and mirrors the journeys made by the other three protagonists.

==Setting==
&quot;The Female Man&quot; includes several fictional worlds.
* Joanna&#x27;s World: Joanna exists in a world that is similar to Earth in the 1970s.
* Jeannine&#x27;s World: Jeannine lives in New York City in 1969, in a world where the Great Depression never ended and World War II never happened. As a result, her world is in a never ending depression without any significant feminist movements.
* Whileaway: Janet&#x27;s world is an all-female utopian Earth ten centuries in the future called Whileaway, where all the men died from a sex-specific plague 900 years from the beginning of the novel. However in the final chapter, it is suggested by Jael that the plague was a lie and that the men were killed. The language of Whileaway is &quot;Pan-russian&quot; and is nothing like the Russian of the 20th century. To procreate, women in lesbian relationships use technology to genetically merge ova. Although Whileaway is technologically advanced, their societies are mostly agrarian. Whileaway is less concerned with equality than it is with safety. There is no sexual assault or murder, and children are free to play naked and without fear. There are duels which can end in the death of one of the dueling parties but this is commonplace in Whileaway and seen as an effective way to deal with a dispute.
* Womanland: Jael&#x27;s world is a dystopia where men (Manlanders) and women (Womanlanders) are in a literal &quot;battle of the sexes&quot;. Although their war has been ongoing for forty years, both societies trade with each other, especially children. Womanlanders keep the female children and exchange male children for resources. In order for men to cope with their sexual desires, a select number of young boys deemed not masculine enough undergo sex change surgery. In lieu of men, Womanlanders like Jael have automatons or pursue lesbian relationships.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins when Janet Evason suddenly arrives and disappears in Jeannine&#x27;s world. Janet is from Whileaway, a futuristic world where a plague killed all of the men over 800 years ago, and Jeannine lives in a world that never experienced the end of the Great Depression. Janet takes Jeannine to Joanna&#x27;s world, where both women meet in a cocktail lounge and watch Janet&#x27;s televised interview. She explains to the male interviewer the culture and customs of Whileawayans which differ greatly from Joanna&#x27;s world. When Janet begins to explain to the interviewer how women in Whileaway &quot;copulate&quot; she is abruptly cut off by a commercial break.

Acting as a guide, Joanna takes Janet to a party in her world to show her how women and men interact with each other. Janet quickly finds herself to be the object of a man&#x27;s attention as he continually harasses her. After she has had enough, Janet knocks the man down and mocks him. Her behavior shocks everyone at the party, since in Joanna&#x27;s world, it is believed that women are inferior to men. Janet then expresses her desire to experience living with a typical family to Joanna, who takes Janet to the Wildings’ household in Anytown, U.S.A. Janet meets their teenage daughter Laura Rose who instantly admires Janet&#x27;s confidence and independence as a woman. Laura realizes that she is attracted to Janet and begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. This is transgressive for both of them, as Whileaway&#x27;s taboo against cross-generational relationships (having a relationship with someone old enough to be your parent or young enough to be your child) is as strong as the taboo against same-sex relationships on Laura&#x27;s world. After the two have sex for the first time, Janet recounts to Laura how she met and fell in love with her wife, Vittoria, back in Whileaway.

Jeannine and Joanna accompany Janet back to Whileaway where they meet Vittoria and stay at their home. A small Whileawayan child follows Joanna and tells her a story about a bear trapped between two worlds as a metaphor for her life. Jeannine returns to her world with Joanna, and they both go to vacation at her brother&#x27;s house. Jeannine&#x27;s mother pesters her about her love life and asks whether she is going to get married soon. Jeannine goes on a few dates with some men but still finds herself dissatisfied. Jeannine begins to doubt her sense of reality, but soon decides that she wants to assimilate into her role as a woman. She calls Cal to pick her up and agrees to marry him.

Joanna, Jeannine, and Janet arrive in Jael&#x27;s world which has had a 40 year old war between men and women. Jael explains that she works for the Bureau of Comparative Ethnology, an organization that concentrates on people&#x27;s various counterparts in different parallel worlds. She reveals that she is the one who brought all of them together because they are four versions of the same woman. Jael takes all of them with her into enemy territory where she appears to be negotiating a deal with one of the male leaders. At first, the male leader appears to be promoting equality, but Jael quickly realizes that he still believes in the inferiority of women. He relentlessly harasses Jael and tries to convince her that it is necessary for both societies to reconcile. Jael reveals herself as a ruthless assassin, kills the man, and shuttles all of the women back to her house. At her house, the women witness Jael and Davy, her biological automaton, having sex. Jael finally tells the other women why she has assembled all of them. She wants to create secret military bases in the women&#x27;s worlds without the men&#x27;s knowledge. Her hope is that eventually, the women in each world will be empowered and overthrow their respective patriarchal societies.

Jeannine and Joanna agree to help Jael assimilate the women soldiers into their worlds, but Janet refuses, given the overall pacifism of Whileaway. Jeannine and Joanna appear to have become stronger individuals and are excited to rise up against their gender roles. Janet is not moved by Jael&#x27;s intentions so Jael suggests Janet that the reason for the absence of men on Whileaway is not because of a plague but because the women won the war and killed all of the men in its timeline&#x27;s past. Janet refuses to believe Jael, and the other women are annoyed at Janet&#x27;s resistance. The novel ends with the women separating and returning to their worlds, each with a new perspective on her life, her world, and her identity as a woman.

==Characters==

=== Major characters ===
Jeannine Nancy Dadier is a twenty-nine year old librarian who lives in a world that never escaped the Great Depression. She has a blue-eyed cat named Mr. Frosty to whom she constantly speaks and lavishes with attention. Jeannine faces constant pressure from her family and society to get married. She doubts her boyfriend Cal&#x27;s ability to make her happy, but eventually becomes engaged to him. Of all the women, she is the least radicalized and seen as the weakest of all the women. Still, Jael says she is arguably the most intelligent of the four women. At the end of the novel, Jeannine appears to have broken from the expectations of marriage and welcomes the social revolution against men.

Joanna lives in 1969, in a world remarkably similar to Earth. The feminist movement has just begun, and Joanna is determined to refute her world&#x27;s belief that women are inferior to men. Joanna is witty and smart, but she struggles to assert her abilities and intelligence among her male peers. In order to cope, she repeatedly refers to herself as the “female man” to indicate her adoption of the male gender role and separate herself from being identified as just another woman. She identifies herself as the author of the novel throughout the work. She is named after and based on Russ.

Janet Evason Belin comes from a futuristic world called Whileaway where all the men died of a sex-specific plague over 900 years ago. She is a Safety and Peace officer, similar to a police officer, and has just become an emissary to other worlds. She explains that this is because she is expendable, and relatively stupid compared to other Whileawayans. She is married to Vittoria and has two children. Janet becomes romantically involved with Laura Wilding, the teenage daughter of the family she was staying with in Joanna&#x27;s world. She is referred to by Jael as &quot;The Strong One&quot; and &quot;Miss Sweden&quot;. She is older than the other women, and is the most evolutionary advanced as she has no allergies, appendix, or double joints. In addition to being confident and assertive, Janet is perhaps the most independent from men because she has never experienced patriarchal domination.

Alice Jael Reasoner, often referred to as Jael (codename Sweet Alice), is an assassin living in a world where men and women have been at war for forty years. Each sex has made their own societies, Womanland and Manland, that excludes the other. Jael has silver claws that are revealed when she pulls back the skin and metal teeth, which she uses as her weapons. She is a radical and performs her job well. Jael is the instigator behind the four women&#x27;s meeting and proposes a revolution against all men.

=== Minor characters ===
Laura Rose, nickname Laur, is the daughter in the family that Janet stays with when she is visiting Joanna&#x27;s world. She proclaims herself to be a “victim of penis envy,” frustrated that she must stifle her potential in order to become a housewife. She is a shy tomboy with short hair and freckles who struggles in her sexual orientation and womanhood. She daydreams she is Genghis Khan to cope. Janet&#x27;s confidence and independence from men fascinates Laura, and she begins to pursue a sexual relationship with Janet.

Vittoria is Janet&#x27;s wife. She and Janet have two daughters. She is mentioned often by Janet and makes a brief appearance when all four women visit Whileaway.

Cal is Jeannine&#x27;s boyfriend and soon-to-be fiancé. He cries often and wears her necklaces. She does not believe that Cal is masculine enough to provide for her.

Bud Dadier is Jeannine&#x27;s older brother who teaches high school math. He is married and has two children. He and his mother constantly pressure Jeannine into marriage.

Mrs. Dadier is Jeannine&#x27;s mother who lives with Jeannine&#x27;s brother and his family. When Jeannine spends a vacation at her brother&#x27;s house, Mrs. Dadier plagues Jeannine with lectures regarding the importance of marriage.

Frank, also referred to as X, is a married man who takes Jeannine on a few dates while she stays at her brother&#x27;s house. He is estranged from his wife, and though Jeannine feels no connection to him, she goes out with him to appease her family.

Davy is Jael&#x27;s male automaton. His &quot;original germ-plasm&quot; is described as chimpanzee, but he resembles a beautiful young man. Devoid of will, and possibly of all higher brain functions, he is connected to Jael&#x27;s computerised home and is controlled by her facial cues and verbal commands.

Dunyasha Bernadettson is a Whileawayan philosopher brought up often by Janet throughout the novel.

==Structure and format==
The novel is divided into nine parts, with each further divided into chapters. The sections of the novel are usually dedicated to one character&#x27;s perspective, but often the point of view changes between the four characters and skips from location and time. It is often unclear who is speaking and as a result, creates confusion in the narration. The constant switching in point of view represents the women&#x27;s, and Russ&#x27;s, resistance to the male dominated genre. Joanna, Janet, and Jael&#x27;s perspectives are told in first person narrative, but they often refer to themselves in the third person while the narration is still through their point of view. Laura Wilding is the only minor character to have the narrative told through her perspective. Jeannine&#x27;s perspective is told solely through a third person narrative until she begins to question her role in a patriarchy and is absorbed in the first person point of view in the final chapter:We got up and paid our quintuple bill; then we went out onto the street. I said goodbye and went off with Laur, I, Janet; I also watched them go, I, Joanna; forever I went off to show Jael the city, I Jeaninne, I Jael, I myself. (p. 212) Joanna describes writing the novel, and acknowledges the audience in the final chapter. She describes her style of narration as feminine: I have no structure…my thoughts seep out shapelessly like menstrual fluid, it is all very female and deep and full of essences, it is very primitive and full of ‘and’s,’ it is called ‘run-on sentences&#x27;. (p. 137). Joanna also inserts imaginary conversations in the form of a script that demonstrate her frustration with men. There are also poems, and Janet often gives background history on Whileaway, including citing a Whileaway philosopher, to provide insight on her culture. Jael is introduced in part two, signaled by an italicized text; however, her story begins in part eight with a repetition of the italicized chapter. It is not until part eight that the novel focuses on Jael and formally introduces her.

==Literary significance and reception==
As the feminist movement began to gain attention, many regarded the novel as one of the most influential works in feminist literature and its wide acceptance heralded the start of feminist science fiction. Upon its release, the novel was received favorably.
Douglas Barbour in the &quot; Toronto Star&quot; wrote:
Elizabeth Lynn, of the &quot;San Francisco Review&quot; of books, described it as &quot;A stunning book, a work to be read with great respect. It’s also screamingly funny.&quot;

Though it is highly regarded as an important feminist text, the novel is not without its share of controversy. It is also considered to be dated by some, and divides critics and audiences alike. Most of the criticism received by Russ was on the radical feminism the novel is perceived to propagate. The character Jael implies that the slaughter of men was inevitable and necessary for the feminist utopia. For Jael, violence is the only means through which women can free themselves.

==Allusions and references==

===Allusions to other works===
* &quot;When It Changed&quot; by Joanna Russ: The character Janet, and a different version of Whileaway (a planet colonized from Earth, rather than a future version of Earth itself), exist in the short story &quot;When It Changed&quot;.
* &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift: Queen Anne is referred to as a &quot;female man&quot; in Chapter 4 of the Houyhnhnms section&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Beowulf&quot; from oral tradition: Joanna alludes to Grendel&#x27;s mother to demonstrate that a woman can be both a nurturing mother and an aggressive, strong woman.
* &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; by John Stuart Mill: Joanna references Mill when she lists the many examples of how men have historically oppressed women.
* &quot;The Bible:&quot; Jael is named after Yael, who kills Sisera by driving a tent peg through his skull while he sleeps. At one point Russ describes Jael in words paraphrased from the Book of Judges: &quot;At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead&quot; (Jdg. 5:27).

===Allusions to history===
Russ&#x27;s novel refers to the problematic issues in the 1970s when the feminist movement became highly influential. Because &quot;The Female Man&quot; was written during the 1970s, the character Joanna&#x27;s world is most similar to the real world Russ lived in. The novel also addresses the environmental movement as shown through Janet&#x27;s utopian society. Though Janet&#x27;s world is extremely technologically advanced, the women choose to live in agrarian societies. Whileaway forms an idealistic image of an organic environment where nature is preserved despite the radical development of technology.

The novel also mentions the Great Depression, which started in 1929 when the world&#x27;s economy was plunged into a long and deep recession. In Jeannine&#x27;s world, however, the Great Depression never ended. The text suggests that the continuation of the Great Depression forced women to seek husbands for financial support and prohibited women from finding jobs of their own, perpetuating gender roles.

==Awards and nominations==
After having been nominated for the 1975 Nebula Award for Best Novel, &quot;The Female Man&quot; won one of three Retrospective Tiptree Awards in 1996. It also won a 2002 Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame Award.

<doc id="972547" wikidata="Q7600598" url="?curid=972547" title="Star 107.9">
<text>Star 107.9 was a UK Independent Local Radio station centred on the area of Stroud, in Gloucestershire, also broadcasting to other localities including Cirencester, Tetbury and Stonehouse, and Dursley on a 107.3 FM relay (originally 107.2 FM). The station was owned by the UKRD Group, and shared its programme controller, Brody Swain, and managing director Junie Lewis with Star 107.5 in Cheltenham.

==History==
The station launched in 1998, originally known as &quot;The Falcon&quot;. UKRD rebranded the station in 2002 as &quot;Star 107&quot;, later becoming &quot;Star 107.9&quot; and then &quot;Star Radio&quot; in late 2005, based in premises in the Brunel Mall on London Road in Stroud.

===Closure===

The station ceased broadcasting on 29 September 2006 following a decision by UKRD to return the licence to the United Kingdom&#x27;s broadcasting and telecommunications regulator, Ofcom. UKRD believed that it would be impossible for anyone to make the station profitable, which, according to figures, had been loss-making throughout its entire eight-year history.

The last song played on the station was Boy Meets Girl&#x27;s &quot;Waiting For a Star to Fall&quot;.

The Paul Ellery website, has exclusive footage of the final words spoken on the station, as well as pictures from the last week of the licence.

UKRD had applied to relocate the station to share the same building with nearby sister station Star 107.5 in Cheltenham and to introduce shared programming between the Stroud and Cheltenham stations in daytime hours. While Ofcom cleared the co-location of the two stations, it refused permission for programming sharing between the two stations, believed to be the catalyst for UKRD&#x27;s decision to close the station altogether. Returning a licence to the broadcasting regulator had, until 21 September 2006, been unprecedented in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="972549" wikidata="Q677211" url="?curid=972549" title="Leontopolis">
<text>Leontopolis was an ancient Egyptian city located in the Nile Delta, Lower Egypt. It served as a provincial capital and Metropolitan Archbishopric. The archaeological site and settlement are known today as Kafr Al Muqdam.

==Name==
Known most popularly in the modern era and to scholarship by its traditional Greek name Leontopolis (literally, &quot;city of lions&quot;), or Leonto , (&quot;lion&quot;), the demographic makeup of the city varied culturally and linguistically over its long history, and the Greek name was progressively used more and more over the native Egyptian Taremu (&quot;Land of Fish&quot;). After the annexation of Ptolemaic Egypt as a Roman province, the city retained the Greek name, and was referred to in Latin sources as the oppidum Leontos, though the Egyptian name still lingered among primary speakers of Coptic Egyptian into the post-classical period. Today, the site itself is referred to in Arabic as Tell el-Muqdam (&quot;mound of the city&quot;).

==History==

The city is located in the central part of the Nile Delta region. It was the capital of the 11th nome of Lower Egypt (the Leontopolite nome) and was probably the centre of pharaonic power under the 23rd dynasty. In his conquest-stela found at the fourth Nile Cataract at Jebel Barkal, Piye writes about his conquest over Iuput II, who ruled over Leontopolis. Strabo is the earliest writer who mentions either the nome, or its chief town: and it was probably of comparatively recent origin or importance.

The Greek name of this city means &quot;City of Lions&quot;, given on account of the presence of temples to the lioness goddesses Bast and Sekhmet, and their son, Maahes, the lion prince. Live lions were kept at the temples during the time of the Greek occupation.

It became the capital of the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda.

==Ecclesiastical history==
As provincial capital it also was a Metropolitan archbishopric, known as Leontopolis in Augustamnica, which was to fade.
* Michel Le Quien lists Theodotus at the second Council of Constantinople in 553AD.

* Joaquim de Nossa Senhora de Nazareth Oliveira e Abreu, Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1815.09.04 – 1819.08.23)
* Alexander Dobrzański (1819.12.17 – 1831?)
* Ludwig Forwerk (1854.07.11 – 1875.01.08)

It was promoted circa 1880 to titular archbishopric of Metropolitan rank; it was renamed in 1925 Leontopolis, in 1933 Leontopolis in Augustamnica. It has had the following incumbents, of fitting (Metropolitan? archiepiscopal) rank :
* Jean-Pierre-François Laforce-Langevin (1891.02.06 – 1892.01.26)

==Identification==
Most scholars today agree that Leontopolis is located at Tell al Muqdam, at latitude 30° 45′ North.

Researchers were long divided as to the real site of Leontopolis. According to D&#x27;Anville (1697–1782), its ruins were covered by a mound called &quot;Tel-Essabè&quot; (Tel es-sab`), or the &quot;Lion&#x27;s Hill&quot;. Jomard (1777–1862), on the other hand, maintained that some tumuli near the village of &quot;El-Mengaleh&quot; in the Delta, represent the ancient Leontopolis, and this supposition agrees better with the account of the town given by Xenophon of Ephesus. W. Smith (1813–1893) locates the city at latitude 30° 6′ North, which is considerably further south than the actual site.

<text>The Breeze (Cheltenham &amp; North Gloucestershire) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio South West, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
The station originally launched in 1993 as CD 603, broadcasting on the AM frequency left free by BBC Radio Gloucestershire. The station went through a number of name changes in that time including 603AM, BOSS 603 and Cheltenham Radio. After securing an FM licence Cheltenham Radio relaunched on 7 September 1998 as CAT FM.

In 2002, following a takeover by UKRD Group it was re launched as Star 107.5. UKRD themselves sold the station in 2008 to Storm Media Services who later changed the station name to Total Star. In March 2013, Storm Media Services sold the station again, this time to Celador Radio who confirmed it would relaunch as The Breeze.
It was based in Knightsbridge Business park in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and played music from the 70&#x27;s to today.

As Total Star, it held responsibility for networked programmes for the short lived Total Star network of radio stations in the South West of England.

<text>The Breeze (Bristol) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Bristol.

The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio South West, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
It started out as Kute FM on 105.8 MHz FM in February 1998, being partly owned by Western Newspapers. Then on 26 November 1999, it became 107.3 The Eagle, a name similar to two other of UKRD&#x27;s stations in Guildford and Cambridge. It rebranded in 2001 to Star 107.3 and in January 2004, the frequency moved to 107.2 MHz FM. The station played pop hits mainly from the 1980s and 1990s with a target audience aiming towards female adults between 25–35. It is currently the only Bristol station playing adult contemporary music 24 hours a day.
The studios were originally in the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; building on Temple Way in Bristol.

On 7 September 2010, Southampton based Celador Radio acquired Tomahawk Radio Limited, the owners of 106.5 Jack FM and Star 107.2 FM, and in February 2011 the station&#x27;s name was changed to The Breeze 107.2.

===Licence applications===
In its pre-launch guise, Kute FM was a pirate radio station, broadcasting in an under-served radio landscape in Bristol – with only Radio Bristol and GWR FM being well established as well as other pirates. Kute broadcast legally as a training facility in 1995, with a further trail in February 1998 in a joint arrangement with the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; newspaper group and radio group UKRD with a view to gaining a permanent licence. The Radio Authority were formally advertising licence applications for several areas in the UK – including Bristol. A total of six applied for the City of Bristol licence. 
* Cabot FM (City of Bristol Broadcasting Company Ltd.)
* Future Radio Ltd.
* Respec Radio (Respec Radio Ltd)
* Kute FM (Bristol Community Radio Ltd)
* Powerjam Rad, io
* Republic Radio

Powerjam Radio, Respec Radio and Future Radio applied with an urban music format, and these applicants felt that broadcasting legitimately would create a radio format that would be a truly local service that would serve the city&#x27;s Afro-Caribbean community- which they would say are consistently ignored by the mass media. However the eight-year licence was awarded to Kute FM, in recognition of the support from UKRD and the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot;. It proposed a soft rock and classic soul format, with ten hours dedicated to specialist music genres including R &#x27;n&#x27; B and jazz. A speech minimum of 30% was also put forward with shows geared towards the Afro-Caribbean and other minority communities.

===On-air===
On 26 November 1999, Kute FM changed name launched as 107.3 The Eagle. The station was designed by
UKRD CEO, Mike Powell and fashioned on the existing 96.4 The Eagle in Guildford, complete with logo, also owned by UKRD. Its advertising campaign was carried out by advertising agency &quot;The Creative Department&quot; and posters featuring well-known lyrics from pop songs were splashed out on the back of First buses and newspaper ads. ironically in the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Western Daily Press&quot;, its pre-launch partners. On-air The Eagle featured a fairly lively sound complete with jingles to reinforce the new name in listener&#x27;s minds.

In 2000 The Eagle changed name to Star 107.3 with a new slogan different playlist, integrating the
licence remit into an adult contemporary music format.

In 2004, Star underwent a slight frequency change to 107.2 MHz FM and a power increase to better cover Bristol.

On 2 March 2009, the station was taken over by Tomahawk Radio, the owners of Bristol&#x27;s Original 106.5. Star now shares studios with its sister station in the County Gates building on Ashton Road, Bristol.

===Re-brand===
On 20 January 2011, Star 107.2 owners Celador Radio, announced that the station will re-brand to The Breeze 107.2 on 14 February 2011, following OFCOM agreeing to a format change.

===Licence awarded for Bath===
On 24 May 2011, Celador Radio won the re-advertised local radio licence for Bath. More FM then began broadcasting as The Breeze on the 107.9 FM frequency on 25 September 2011.

===In Somerset===
In August 2011, The Breeze acquired three frequencies in Somerset previously operated as Total Star Somerset. These frequencies have begun operating as The Breeze on Sunday, 7 August 2011.

<text>Chrudim () is a town in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants. It is the second largest town of the region. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. 

==Administrative division==
Chrudim consists of eight municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Chrudim I (693)
*Chrudim II (5,200)
*Chrudim III (6,571)
*Chrudim IV (9,304)
*Medlešice (601)
*Topol (222)
*Vestec (110)
*Vlčnov (172)
==Etymology==
The name was derived from the personal name Chrudim, meaning &quot;Chrudim&#x27;s (castle)&quot;.

==Geography==

Chrudim is located about south of Pardubice. It lies mostly in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is the hill Podhůra at above sea level. This hill is situated in the southern tip of the municipal territory, which extends into the Iron Mountains and the eponymous protected landscape area. The Chrudimka River flows through the town.

==History==

The oldest archeological findings which provide first signs of the settlement in this area date back to the 5th millennium BC. Various cultures succeeded one on another in the territory of today&#x27;s town of Chrudim and its vicinity. Since the 7th–8th century, the area is inhabited by Slavs.

The first written mention of Chrudim is from 1055, when Duke Bretislav I died here according to &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot;. The royal town of Chrudim was founded in 1276 by King Ottokar II for its location on a route from Prague to Moravia. From 1307, it became a dowry town, administered by Bohemian Queens.

At the beginning of the Hussite Wars, Chrudim sided with the anti-Catholic side and the German-speaking population left the town. Since then, Chrudim has been an almost exclusively Czech territory by nationality. The town was in opposition to the ruling Habsburgs during the failed Estates Revolt in 1547 and Bohemian Revolt in 1618–1620, which always had serious consequences for it. Chrudim was also severely affected by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, during which the evangelical population left as a result of re-Catholicization.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Chrudim lost partly lost its economical and administrative importance, but it has become important educational and cultural centre, which led to its gain of the nickname &quot;Athens of Eastern Bohemia&quot;. In 1871, the railway was built and the town regained economic significance.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the Chrudim District, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

There are no major industrial companies in Chrudim. A middle-sized company based in the town is BASF Stavební hmoty Česká republika, part of the BASF conglomerate producing building materials. The largest employer with its headquarters in Chrudim is Arriva autobusy a.s. with more than 1,000 employees, focused on urban and suburban passenger transport.

==Transport==
The town is situated at the crossroads of two main roads: the I/17 (connecting Čáslav with the D35 motorway) and the I/37 (connecting Hradec Králové and Pardubice with Žďár nad Sázavou the D1 motorway).

Chrudim is located on the railway lines Pardubice–Havlíčkův Brod and Chrudim–Moravany. There are four train stations in the town&#x27;s territory: &quot;Chrudim&quot;, &quot;Chrudim město&quot;, &quot;Chrudim zastávka&quot; and &quot;Medlešice&quot;.

South of the town is a public domestic airport. it was founded in 1937

==Culture==
Chrudim is known for the Loutkářská Chrudim Festival. The festival was established in 1951 and is the oldest continuous festival of puppetry in the world.

==Sport==
Chrudim is home to the professional football club MFK Chrudim. Since 2018, it plays in the Czech National Football League.

Until 1970, there was a motorcycle speedway track in the town. The site hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship in 1954, 1955 and 1961.

==Sights==

The main landmark of Chrudim is the Church of Assumption of the Virgin Mary on the town square. The originally Gothic building was founded before 1349 on the site of a castle. After it was damaged by several fires, it was reconstructed to its current Neo-Gothic form in 1857. Another notable churches with Gothic bases are Church of Saint Catherine, Church of Saint Michael, and Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.

Resselovo Square is the main square of the historic centre. It is lined with preserved burgher houses and includes the originally Renaissance town hall with Baroque façade. In the middle of the square there is the Baroque richly decorated sculptural column of the Transfiguration.

One of the architectural symbols of the town is the Renaissance Mydlářovský House, typical with arcades and oriental-looking triple tower. Today it houses the Museum of Puppetry Culture. A significant sight is also the Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque building of the Chrudim Regional Museum.

The historic centre was delimited by the town walls. Most of the walls, including several bastions, have been preserved.

<text>The Commander Islands, Komandorski Islands, or Komandorskie Islands (, &quot;Komandorskiye ostrova&quot;) are a series of islands in the Russian Far East, a part of the Aleutian Islands, located about east of the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Bering Sea. Treeless and sparsely populated, the islands consist of Bering Island ( by ), Medny Island ( by ) and fifteen islets and rocks. The largest of the latter are Tufted Puffin Rock &quot;(Kamen Toporkov&quot; or &quot;Ostrov Toporkov)&quot;, , and Kamen Ariy, which are between and west of the only settlement, Nikolskoye. Administratively, the Commanders compose the Aleutsky District of the Kamchatka Krai in Russia.

In 2005 the Comandorsky State Nature Reserve was nominated for the List of World Heritage Sites in Russia of UNESCO.

== Geography ==
The Commander Islands archipelago consists of 15 islands and is a part of a submarine volcanic ridge extending from Alaska to Kamchatka dated by the beginning of Paleogene (60-70 million years ago). The islands are the westernmost of the Aleutian Islands, most of which are part of the US state of Alaska, and are separated from the closest US island, Attu Island, and the rest of the chain by . Between the two runs the International Date Line. The relief is somewhat diverse, encompassing folded-block mountains, volcanic plateaus, terraced plains and low mountains. The geologic origins are long-extinct volcanoes on the edge of the Pacific and North American Plates. 

The highest point is Steller&#x27;s Peak on Bering Island at . The highest point on Medny Island is Stenjeger&#x27;s Peak at . 

The archipelago lies at similar latitudes to Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland, Southern Scandinavia and southern parts of the Alaskan Panhandle.

==Climate==
The climate is relatively mild for its latitude, and maritime, with 220–240 days of precipitation per year. The cool summers are notoriously foggy. The Köppen climate classification would be classed as &quot;Dfc&quot; bordering on &quot;Cfc&quot; and &quot;Dfb&quot;.

== Population ==

The only permanently inhabited locality is the village of Nikolskoye on the northwest end of Bering Island, with an estimated population of 613 . This consists almost entirely of Russians and Aleuts. The majority of the island chain’s area, as well as much of the adjacent marine habitat, , is taken up by the Komandorsky Zapovednik, a natural preserve. The economy is based primarily on fishing, mushroom gathering, the administration of the zapovednik (i.e. strictly protected wilderness), ecotourism and government services.

The village has a school, a satellite tracking station and a dirt airstrip to its south.

The other settlements on the two islands are small villages or scattering of houses:

* Severnoye
* Podutesnaya
* Gladkovskaya
* Lisennova
* Peschanka
* Preobrazhenskoye
* Glinka

== Natural history ==

There is no true forest on the Commander Islands. The vegetation is dominated by lichens, mosses and different associations of marshy plants with low grass and dwarf trees. Very tall umbellifers are also common.

===Mammals===
Due to the high productivity of the Bering Sea shelf and the Pacific slope and their remoteness from human influence, the Commander Islands are marked by a great abundance of marine animal life and a relative paucity of terrestrial organisms. Notably, significant numbers of northern fur seals (some 200,000 individuals) and Steller sea lions (approximately 5,000 individuals) summer there, both on reproductive rookeries and non-reproductive haul-outs. Sea otters, common seals and larga seals are likewise abundant. Indeed, the sea otter population is stable and possibly increasing, even as their population is falling precipitously in the rest of the Aleutian islands.

The neighboring waters provide important feeding, wintering and migrating habitat for many whale species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Among these are: sperm whales, orcas, several species of Minke whales, beaked whales, and porpoises, humpbacks and endangered species such as the North Pacific right whales and fin whales.

Bering Island was the only known habitat of Steller&#x27;s sea cows, an immense (over ) sirenian related to the dugong. The sea cow was hunted to extinction within 27 years of its discovery in 1741. 

The much less diverse terrestrial fauna includes two distinct, endemic subspecies of Arctic fox, (&quot;Alopex lagopus semenovi&quot; and &quot;A. l. beringensis&quot;). Though relatively healthy now, these populations had been significantly depleted in the past due to the fur trade. Most other terrestrial species, including wild reindeer, American mink and rats, have all been introduced to the islands by man.

===Birds===
Over a million seabirds gather to nest on numerous large colonies along almost all the coastal cliffs. The most common are northern fulmar; common, brunnich&#x27;s and pigeon guillemots; horned and tufted puffins; cormorants; gulls; and kittiwakes including the extremely local red-legged kittiwake which nests in only a few other colonies in the world. Waterfowl and sandpipers are also abundant along the pre-lake depressions and river valleys of Bering Island, though largely absent from Medny Island. Migratory birds of note with critical nesting or feeding habitat on the islands include such species as Steller&#x27;s eider, Pacific golden plover and Aleutian tern. Raptors of note include the rare Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and gyrfalcon. Other bird types include auks such as the Ancient murrelet and game birds such as the Rock ptarmigan. In total, over 180 bird species have been registered on the Commander Islands. The spectacled cormorant, a large essentially flightless bird in the cormorant family, was driven to extinction by around 1850. The islands have been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support populations of various threatened bird species, including many waterbirds and seabirds.
The fish fauna in the mountainous, fast running streams is composed primarily of migratory salmonids, including Arctic char, Dolly Varden, black spotted trout, chinook, sockeye, coho and pink salmon.

There are no amphibians or reptiles on the Commander Islands.

== History ==
The Commander Islands received their name from Commander Vitus Bering, whose ship &quot;St Peter&quot; wrecked on the otherwise uninhabited Bering Island on his return voyage from Alaska in 1741. Bering died on the island along with much of the crew. His grave is marked by a modest monument. About half of the crew did manage to survive the winter, thanks in part to the abundance of wildlife (notably the newly discovered Steller&#x27;s sea cow) and the efforts of naturalist and physician Georg Wilhelm Steller, who cured many of the men of scurvy by compelling them to eat seaweed. Eventually, a smaller boat was built from the remains of the &quot;St. Peter&quot; and the survivors found their way back to Kamchatka, heavily laden with valuable sea otter pelts. The discovery of the sea otters sparked the great rush of fur-seeking &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; which drove the Russian expansion into Alaska.
Aleut (Unangan) people were transferred to the Commander Islands early in 1825 by the Russian-American Company from the Aleutians for the seal trade. Most of the Aleuts inhabiting Bering Island came from Atka Island and those who lived on Medny Island came from Attu Island, now both American possessions. A mixed language called Mednyj Aleut, with Aleut roots but Russian verb inflection, developed among the inhabitants. Today the population of the islands is about ⅔ Russian and ⅓ Aleut.

The 1943 Battle of the Komandorski Islands took place in the open sea about south of the islands.

<text>The British National Vegetation Classification or NVC is a system of classifying natural habitat types in Great Britain according to the vegetation they contain.

A large scientific meeting of ecologists, botanists, and other related professionals in the United Kingdom resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books: &quot;British Plant Communities&quot;, edited by John S. Rodwell, which detail the incidence of plant species in twelve major habitat types in the British natural environment. They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the vegetation types of the country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (not Northern Ireland) and represent fifteen years of research by leading plant ecologists.

From the data collated from the books, commercial software products have been developed to help to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain – these include &quot;MATCH&quot;, &quot;TABLEFIT&quot; and &quot;MAVIS&quot;.

== Terminology ==

The following are lists of terms used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification, together with their meanings.

=== Communities, subcommunities and variants ===

*A community is the fundamental unit of categorisation for vegetation.
*A subcommunity is a distinct recognisable subdivision of a community.
*A variant is a further subdivision of a subcommunity.

=== Constant species ===

*A constant species in a community is a species that is always present in any given stand of vegetation belonging to that community.

For a list of the constant species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see List of constant species in the British National Vegetation Classification.

=== Rare species ===

*A rare species is a species which is associated with a particular community and is rare nationally.

:The sources used by the authors of &quot;British Plant Communities&quot; for assessing rarity were as follows. 
:a) for vascular plants, two sources were used:
::*Perring, F. H. and S. M. Walters (1962) &quot;Atlas of the British Flora&quot; – a species was regarded as rare if it was given an &quot;A&quot; rating in this work (these were plants which Perring &amp; Walters judged to be sufficiently rare to merit a special search in order to ensure all records were included in the atlas).
::*Any species included on lists compiled by the Nature Conservancy Council of plants found in less than 100 hectads.

:b) for bryophytes, the source used was Corley, M. F. V. and M. O. Hill (1981) &quot;Distribution of bryophytes in the British Isles&quot;. This lists the species and the vice-counties in which they are recorded; presence in under 20 vice-counties was the criterion used for selection as rare.

:c) for lichens, no source was available, and the authors used their own selection of species.

For a list of these rare species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see List of rare species in the British National Vegetation Classification.

== Communities by category ==

In total there are 286 communities in the British National Vegetation Classification. They are grouped into the following major categories:

* Woodland and scrub communities (25 communities, prefixed with the letter &quot;W&quot; — 19 classed as woodland, four as scrub and two as &#x27;underscrub&#x27;)
* Mires (38 communities, prefixed &quot;M&quot;)
* Heaths (22 communities, prefixed &quot;H&quot;)
* Mesotrophic grasslands (13 communities, prefixed &quot;MG&quot;)
* Calcicolous grasslands (14 communities, prefixed &quot;CG&quot;)
* Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities (21 communities, prefixed &quot;U&quot;)
* Aquatic communities (24 communities, prefixed &quot;A&quot;)
* Swamps and tall-herb fens (28 communities, prefixed &quot;S&quot;)
* Salt-marsh communities (28 communities, prefixed &quot;SM&quot;)
* Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities (19 communities, prefixed &quot;SD&quot; — one shingle, two strandline and 16 sand-dune communities)
* Maritime cliff communities (12 communities, prefixed &quot;MC&quot;)
* Vegetation of open habitats (42 communities, prefixed &quot;OV&quot;)

A full list of these communities, grouped into the above categories, can be found at List of plant communities in the British National Vegetation Classification.

<doc id="972565" wikidata="Q280158" url="?curid=972565" title="Aralkum Desert">
<text>The Aralkum Desert (Uzbek: Orolqum choʻli, Оролқум чўли, Kazakh: Аралқұм шөлі, Russian: Пустыня Аралкум) is a desert that has appeared since 1960 on the seabed once occupied by the Aral Sea. It lies to the south and east of what remains of the Eastern Basin Aral Sea in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. It is currently the youngest desert in the world.

==History==

While the level of the Aral Sea has fluctuated over its existence, the most recent level drop since the 1960s was caused by the Soviet Union building massive irrigation projects in the region. The severely reduced inflow caused the water level in the Aral Sea to drop. While the North Aral Sea rose due to the Dike Kokaral, the South Aral Sea kept dropping, thus expanding the size of the desert, until 2010, when the South Aral Sea was partly reflooded. The water level of the South Aral Sea then began to drop again, this time more severely.

In August 2021, British polar athlete Rosie Stancer led the first expedition on foot across the Aralkum desert.

== Stranded boats ==
Before its desertification, the Aral Sea sustained a large fishing industry that provided up to one-sixth of the Soviet Union&#x27;s fish. As the water receded, many fishing vessels and other boats were left behind in the desert. In the former port of the city of Moʻynoq, rusting vessels have become a tourist attraction and the site of the Stihia Festival, Central Asia&#x27;s largest electronic music festival.

==Airborne contaminants==

The sands of the Aralkum and the dust that originates from it contain pollutants. The desert&#x27;s location is on a powerful west–east airstream that carries its polluted dust around the globe. Aral dust has been found in the fields of Belarus, the forests of Norway, and in the glaciers of Greenland. Pesticides in the dust have been found in the blood of penguins in Antarctica.

<doc id="972566" wikidata="Q7794046" url="?curid=972566" title="Thomas Smith (governor of South Carolina)">
<text>Thomas Smith (16 November 1694) was an English-born administrator and planter who served as the colonial governor of South Carolina from 1693 to 1694. He was appointed deputy governor in May 1693, following Governor Philip Ludwell&#x27;s departure, but was officially commissioned as governor on 29 November 1693.

== Biography ==

He was born in Exeter, Devonshire, England, as the son of John Thomas Smith and Joan Atkins. He was the grandson of Sir Nicholas Smith MP and the great-grandson of Sir George Smith MP.

He arrived in Charles Town in 1684 with his first wife Barbara Atkins and his sons Thomas and George. He was a Cacique by 1690 and was made Landgrave by the Lords Proprietors on 13 May 1691.

He died in 1694 and is buried at Medway Plantation. A stone slab marks his grave with the inscription: &quot;Here Lieth Ye Body of the Right Honble Thomas Smith Esq. one of Ye Landgraves of Carolina who Departed This Life Ye16th of November, 1694. Governor of the Province of Carolina in Ye 46 year of his age.&quot;

Governor Archdale described Thomas Smith as &quot;a wise sober and moderate welliving man.&quot; The Proprietors, writing to Governor Archdale on 10 January 1695, stated: We forward copies of letters written by Colonel Smith not long before his death, that you may enjoy with us his satisfactory account of the growing condition of the province and of the peace and union to which he had brought it. He appears to us to have been a man not only of great parts, integrity and honesty but of a generous temper and a nobleness of spirit as to the public good as is scarcely to be met withal in this age.

His brick townhouse with a wharf on Cooper River was on the corner of East Bay and Longitude Lane.

Smith was the grandfather of Rev. Josiah Smith, a prominent minister of colonial South Carolina.

<text>Star Radio is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting on 100.7 MHz in Cambridge, 107.1 MHz in Ely, 107.3 MHz in Saffron Walden, and 107.9 MHz in Haverhill.

==History==
It was originally launched as &quot;Cambridge Café Radio&quot;. Later in 1998 it was relaunched as &quot;Cambridge Red&quot; and six months later as 107.9 The Eagle.

In 1999, the UKRD Group purchased the station. The following year it renamed Red as &quot;107.9 The Eagle&quot;, in line with the other stations they owned. In 2001, UKRD rebranded the station again to Star 107.9, in line with the rebranding of their other stations.

In 2003, Star 107.1/5 in Ely and The Fens split frequencies. 107.5 in Wisbech became Fen Radio 107.5, and 107.1 in Ely became a relay of Star 107.9. Because of this, the station adjusted their name to 107 Star FM. The name was adjusted again in 2004 to Star 107. Star 107 was rebranded in August 2005 as &#x27;Star Radio&#x27; coinciding with the rebrand of the other &#x27;Star&#x27; network stations in the UKRD Group.

On 1 January 2017, the station was sold to Mid Anglia Media Ltd and in 2019 the licence was transferred to Light Blue Media Cambridge.

In July 2020, the station moved its main frequency to 100.7 MHz from 107.9 MHz and at the same time substantially increased its transmission power whilst relocating its transmitter to the Arqiva Madingley site.

In November 2020, a new transmitter for Haverhill was switched on using the former 107.9 MHz frequency.

As of January 2021, the station is available across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on DAB digital radio.

On 10 January 2025, it was announced Bauer Media Audio UK had acquired the station, would cease local output and become a relay of Hits Radio. The station will rebrand to Hits Radio on 3 March 2025. 

==Listening figures==
As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 35,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

<text>Time 106.6 was an Independent Local Radio station for Slough, Maidenhead and Windsor. Time played a variety of music from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and today, with a strapline of &#x27;all time favourites&#x27;.
The station was available on FM on 106.6 MHz and online.

==History==
The station launched as Star FM in 1993 (later one of six local stations owned by the UKRD Group to be branded under the &#x27;Star&#x27; name), managed by Valerie Handley. Originally it was known as Star 101.6 before becoming Star 106.6, broadcasting from Slough&#x27;s Observatory Shopping Centre in studios located on the first floor above Primark which are now the home of Asian Star Radio.

Star FM was sold to the London Media Company in May 2006, a subdivision of the Sunrise Radio Group, owners of Sunrise Radio, who re-branded the station into Time 106.6, in line with three other Sunrise-owned stations in Romford, Bexleyheath and Lewisham. It operated out of studios at Radio House in Southall during this time.

In January 2014, Time 106.6 and its sister stations entered Administration, and were acquired for an estimated £2m on 4 February 2014 by Lyca Media II Ltd, a subdivision of Lycamobile. The station has retained its branding as &#x27;Time 106.6FM&#x27;.

==Programming==
Time 106.6FM broadcast live output 24 hours a day. Traffic &amp; travel news was from INRIX read by Gary Scott on the Breakfast show &amp; Nicola Richards at Drivetime. The news programming was sourced locally &amp; read by James Brydges and Kirsty Manley. Some bulletins were from Sky News. Sport was from Sports Media. Kevin Hatchard read on the breakfast show with Steve Bell at Drivetime &amp; Saturday Sportszone. Paul Owens was the Programme Controller and Morning Presenter, other Presenters at the time of closure were Steve Lee, Steve Dean, Bruce Montgomery, Richard Linton, Gary Elsden, Jason Reynolds, Mark Denholm, Andy Smith, Ben Shoveller, and Tony Fatania.

==Performance==
Audience data for period ending September 2015
TSA: This radio station broadcast to a survey area of 305,000 adults (aged 15+).
Reach: It was listened to by 16,000 people (5.0%) each week.
Hours: Each listener tuned in for 3.0 hours per week - a total of 50,000.
Share: In its area, it had a 1.1% market share. Rajar

==Closure==
The station ceased live broadcasting at 8pm on 15 October 2015, citing &quot;unforeseen circumstances with the transmitter and aerial&quot;.

Time 106.6 was broadcasting from a temporary studio, at the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough with plans for permanent studios to be built in the centre. Other Lyca Media radio stations formerly known as Sunrise Radio and Kismat Radio, now known as Lyca Radio 1458 &amp; Lyca Gold 1035 respectively are broadcasting from temporary studios in South London until they move to a permanent London home.

<text>Hussaini is a Village near Kesariya in Kesariya Assembly Constituency of East Champaran District, Bihar state, India.

==Location and overview==

Hussaini lies on the Bihar State highway, SH-74 - the only road that links Kesaria Stupa with Motihari fairly. The village has a nearby Railway Station Chakia. It is 7 km far from nearest city Kesariya and Kesariya Stupa. The associate post office is in its own area known as Hussaini Sub Post Office with the PIN code 845423.
==Languages==
Languages include Hindi, Urdu and Bhojpuri, a tongue in the Bihari Language group with almost 40 000 000 speakers, written in both the Devanagari and Kaithi scripts.

==Education==
This village has an Inter-Level Government High School for free education for boys and girls. The village also has Middle and Lower level Government schools for small children. DP High School is the Inter-Level School situated in middle of the village. Students from nearby villages also come here to study.

==Agriculture==
The soil is good, and very fertile. The old farmers looked well after it, ploughing in manure on a regular basis, and allowing fields to lie fallow as part of a good system of crop rotation. However, the intense advertising efforts of the agrochemicals industry have resulted in a current unhealthy reliance on nitrogen fertilisers.

The farming year starts around February, whenever the ground dries out enough after the winter rains to allow ploughing to begin. Much of the ploughing is still done with Oxen.

==Festival==
The most common festival celebrated here include Eid-ul-Fitra, Holi, Eid-ul-Azha, Diwali, Shab-e-baraat, Rakshabandhan, Muharram, Chhath, and Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi.

== Mazaar Sharif ==

The Sufi saints Junab Ali and Umar Ali were buried in the enclosure of Hussaini Mazaar. The Urs-e-Mubarak is celebrated every year on 6 Rabi al-Akhir by Islamic calendar.

<doc id="972579" wikidata="Q6332349" url="?curid=972579" title="KL.FM 96.7">
<text>KL.FM 96.7 (King&#x27;s Lynn FM) was an Independent Local Radio station located in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, England. It broadcast from a former bank building at 18 Blackfriars Street in King&#x27;s Lynn on 96.7 FM, the frequency previously used by BBC Radio Norfolk. The station was closed as part of a merger of dozens of local stations owned by Bauer into its national Greatest Hits Radio brand.

==History==
===Licence application===
In 1987, Mid-Anglia Radio Limited identified King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk as an area poorly served by the broadcast media. An application to the Independent Broadcasting Authority for a relay transmitter to serve this area was rejected. Discussions were then opened with the West Norfolk MP, Henry Bellingham, who wrote to the Home Office and the IBA supporting the concept of a station serving the area.

On 4 October 1990, the IBA announced that King&#x27;s Lynn was one of the areas to be advertised in the first phase of local radio licences by the new Radio Authority, who assumed responsibility for licensing and regulating commercial radio in the UK on 1 January 1991.

On 4 June 1991, the licence was formally advertised. Potential applicants had until 24 September to return their proposals. On 25 September, it was announced that three applicants had applied for the licence: King&#x27;s Lynn FM (Mid-Anglia Radio PLC), X-Cel FM (X-Cel FM LTD) and one other.

In December 1991, it was announced that Mid-Anglia Radio PLC (trading as King&#x27;s Lynn FM) had won an eight-year licence to provide the area with its own independent local commercial radio station, known initially as &quot;King&#x27;s Lynn Radio&quot; before adopting the KL.FM moniker. Two weeks of test transmissions began on 16 June 1992. Two kilowatts of power was originally used to broadcast from a transmitter at the Great Massingham transmission site; this was later increased to three kilowatts.

===Equipment===
Studio equipment originally included DAT players, a computer playout system for jingles and commercials, Technics CD players and an Audionics mixing desk. The original audio processor was an Inovonics FM 250 model. In the Summer of 2004 the old studio equipment was removed and new equipment and furniture installed. This included a Sonifex Sovereign mixing desk and a new digital playout system (RCS Master Control).

===Management===
Stewart Francis was the first Managing Director of the station, with Peter Kingham holding the post of Station Manager and Dave King was Programme Controller. Other people on the Board Of Directors were Martin George (Chairman), Dr Mary Archer MA, David Ball, Jean Barker OBE, David Cocks, Tony Durham MA, William Gibbs, Harry Giltrap, Patrick Sharman &amp; Richard Winfrey.

After Mid-Anglia Radio PLC was sold to the GWR Group in 1994 KLFM&#x27;s on-air name was changed to &quot;Greatest Hits 96.7, The New KLFM&quot;. This &quot;new&quot; service played more music and had less chat.

In late 1996, displeased with the new format, Dave King and a number of other presenters left the station and set up a 28-day Restricted Service Licence trial service. They called the station &quot;King&#x27;s Lynn Radio 105.4&quot; and the station&#x27;s tag line was &quot;All That &quot;LOCAL&quot; Radio Should Be&quot;.

In March 1997, GWR sold a number of local commercial stations, including KL.FM, as part of a planned disposal programme following the acquisition of Classic FM. Dawe Media of Cambridge bought KL.FM for £1.1 million; Stewart Francis once again became involved with the station by becoming the new chairman. It was while Dawe Media owned the station that some equipment changes were made, including the installation of a computerised playout system (the &quot;Enco DAD&quot;).

In December 1999, Dawe Media sold KL.FM to the UKRD Group. That company, in turn, was acquired in 2019 by Bauer Radio, alongside Lincs FM Group, Celador Radio &amp; Wireless Group&#x27;s Local Radio Stations.

===Replacement with Greatest Hits Radio===
On 27 May 2020, KL.FM&#x27;s owners Bauer Media announced that the station, alongside the other local stations in its portfolio, would be replaced by Greatest Hits Radio East on 1 September 2020.

==Programming==
All programming was produced and presented locally. Until 2018, KL.FM had broadcast &quot;The Vodafone Big Top 40&quot; chart show (previously The Pepsi Chart &amp; Hit40UK) which was produced from Capital FM in London and syndicated across over 140 commercial radio stations in the UK. However, the show was withdrawn from syndication and now broadcasts solely on Heart and Capital stations.

==Branding==
On-air imaging came from mainly Century 21 and JAM Creative Productions. The original jingles (July 1992-September 1993) were re-sings of Century 21&#x27;s &#x27;Madison Avenue&#x27; package. Between September 1993 and August 1994 the station used TM Century re-sings of a WPLJ package. The 1997-2002 jingle package was a re-sing of Jams &#x27;Ultimate One&#x27; package (originally created for BBC Radio 1). A recent package (the &#x27;...And Now&#x27; package) was originally produced by JAM for KIMN in Denver, Colorado and re-sung for KL.FM 96.7, although these were never used on air by KL.FM.

By the end of the station&#x27;s life, most of KL.FM&#x27;s on air branding (jingles, promotions, etc.) was produced in-house at UKRD&#x27;s production department in Bristol, but the station had re-sings of the &#x27;Star Radio&#x27; package from Reelworld.

<text>The Comte de Rochefort is a secondary fictional character in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;d&#x27;Artagnan Romances&quot;. He is described as approximately 40 to 45 years old in 1625 and &quot;fair with a scar across his cheek&quot;.

==In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;==

Known throughout the novel as &quot;The Man from Meung&quot;, his first appearance is in the opening chapter of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844). He insults d&#x27;Artagnan and steals his letter of recommendation to Monsieur de Tréville, causing d&#x27;Artagnan to swear revenge.

He reappears from time to time as the story progresses. D&#x27;Artagnan regularly sees Rochefort and tries to catch him, but each time Rochefort skillfully vanishes into the street crowds of Paris. D&#x27;Artagnan does not meet him again or learn his name until the end of the novel. It is Rochefort who kidnaps Constance Bonacieux and it is eventually revealed that he is the other main agent, in addition to Milady de Winter, of Cardinal Richelieu. He is sent by Richelieu to escort Milady de Winter in some of her missions. At the end of the novel, Rochefort tries to arrest d&#x27;Artagnan for the cardinal; Richelieu eventually orders the men to become friends. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Rochefort and an older and wiser d&#x27;Artagnan fought on three occasions, all duels being won by d&#x27;Artagnan, settling their differences and becoming friends.

==In &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;==
Rochefort reappears in the 1845 sequel, &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;. He falls out of favor with Richelieu&#x27;s successor Mazarin and spends five years in the Bastille. When Mazarin dismisses him from service for being too old, he joins the side of the Frondeurs. He aids Athos in freeing the Duke of Beaufort and reappears in the end at the riot against Mazarin&#x27;s return. Unable to recognize his friend in the chaos, d&#x27;Artagnan kills Rochefort, as he had predicted he would if they fought a fourth time.

==In other fiction==
The Comte de Rochefort was the subject of an earlier novel, &quot;Mémoires de M.L.C.D.R.&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of Monsieur Le Comte de Rochefort&quot;) written in 1678 by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras. Courtilz de Sandras also wrote &quot;Mémoires de M. d&#x27;Artagnan&quot; (1700). Dumas combined the two, replacing an aristocrat named Rosnay from the d&#x27;Artagnan story with the Comte de Rochefort.

*A thug nicknamed Rochefort plays the role in the 1993 book &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; by Arturo Pérez-Reverte.
*Rochefort is the narrator and protagonist of Mary Gentle&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;1610: A Sundial in a Grave&quot;.
*Rochefort appears in Jason Sæterøy&#x27;s 2008 graphic novel &quot;The Last Musketeer&quot; in which he colludes with the Emperor of Mars to invade Earth.
*Rochefort is an important character in &quot;The Cardinal&#x27;s Blades&quot;, a historical fantasy trilogy by Pierre Pevel set in the early 17th century.
*Rochefort appears in Tansy Rayner Roberts&#x27; science fiction retelling &quot;Musketeer Space&quot;, renamed Rosnay Cho. She is an agent in the service of the Cardinal, and the love interest of protagonist Dana Dartagnan.

==In film and television==
In film Rochefort has been played by:
*Boyd Irwin in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1921)
*Ullrich Haupt in &quot;The Iron Mask&quot; (1929) 
*Ian Keith in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948)
*Lionel Atwill in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1939) 
*Guy Delorme in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1961) 
*Christopher Lee in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1989).
*Boris Klyuyev in &quot;D&#x27;Artagnan and Three Musketeers&quot; (1978)
*Michael Wincott in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993)
*David Schofield in &quot;The Musketeer&quot; (2001)
*Mads Mikkelsen in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (2011)
*Marc Warren in the BBC TV series &quot;The Musketeers&quot; (2015), replacing Peter Capaldi&#x27;s Cardinal Richelieu.

Film incarnations tend to depict Rochefort as a far darker character than in the novel and often extend his role. D&#x27;Artagnan kills Rochefort in a duel in &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;, though he turns up alive in &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot;, only to die for real in a gunpowder explosion intended for and partially triggered by the musketeers; the character suffers the same fate in the 1993 film. In his three appearances as Rochefort, Christopher Lee wore an eyepatch, intended to make the character look more sinister. The eyepatch, a departure from Rochefort&#x27;s appearance in Dumas&#x27; novel, was deemed striking enough to be retained in several other film adaptations: Wincott, Mikkelsen, and, eventually, Warren retained it in their portrayals as did the anime version. Tim Roth&#x27;s Febre, the main villain of &quot;The Musketeer&quot;, also wears an eyepatch, though Rochefort does not.

In the cartoon series &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot;, Rochefort has a scar on his forehead rather than his cheek. Throughout the series, the title character often calls him &quot;Black Moustache&quot;.
