<text>The CASA C-212 Aviocar is a turboprop-powered STOL medium cargo aircraft designed and built by the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA). It is designed for use by both civil and military operators.

The C-212 was developed during the 1960s in response to the Spanish Air Force&#x27;s need to replace much of its transport aircraft fleet and was designed to perform numerous roles, including ambulance aircraft, paratroop carrier, and utility transport. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 26 March 1971, and an order was secured from the Spanish Air Force three years thereafter. Several other customers emerged, initially from the military sector but, due to the interest of civilian airliners, CASA developed a dedicated civil version of the C-212 as well. Production of the type at the Seville facility would continue for 40 years, with 485 aircraft produced.

Indonesia emerged as a key early customer for the C-212. During 1975, the Indonesian aircraft company IPTN successfully secured the rights to license-produce the aircraft in Bandung, Indonesia. CASA assisted the establishment of a production line there that, by 2000, had constructed a total of 95 NC-212s. The majority of Indonesian-built aircraft were sold to domestic customers, although some exports were also recorded in the Asian market. During February 2013, it was announced that Airbus (the successor company to CASA) had agreed terms with PTDI (IPTN&#x27;s successor) to fully transfer production of the C-212 to Indonesia. For a time, PTDI produced both the NC-212-200 and the -400 upgrade, which were equipped with new digital avionics and autopilot, and featured a redesigned cabin that could accommodate up to 28 passengers.

By December 2012, there were 92 operators of the C-212 around the world. These operators included numerous charter and short-haul aviation companies as well as various national air services, which commonly used as a transport, surveillance aircraft, and for search and rescue. The C-212 has been a popular aircraft among skydivers and smokejumpers due to its uncommon rear ramp arrangement amongst its competitors. In particular, the Australian airline Skytraders has used a number of C-212s to support Australian scientific research teams across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.

==Development==
During the late 1960s, the Spanish Air Force was operating a number of outdated piston-engined transports, including the three-engined Junkers Ju 52 and two-engined Douglas C-47. Seeking to fulfil the Spanish Air Force&#x27;s needs to modernise its transport force, the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) developed a proposed aircraft, designated &quot;C-212&quot;. This was a twin-engined 18-seat transport aircraft that would be capable of performing in a variety of military roles, including passenger transport, ambulance aircraft and paratroop carrier, while also being suitable for use by civil operators. On 26 March 1971, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. During 1974, the Spanish Air Force decided to purchase the C-212, which had acquired the name &quot;Aviocar&quot;, in order to update its fleet.

Several airlines expressed interest in the type, particularly in light of its success with military operators, thus CASA decided to pursue development of a dedicated commercial version of the C-212. During July 1975, the first examples of which was delivered. During 1997, the improved -400 model was introduced, featuring a glass cockpit and more powerful Honeywell TPE331 engines. By August 2006, a total of 30 CASA-built C-212s of all variants reportedly remained in airline service with various operators around the world.

During July 2010, Domingo Urena-Raso, CEO of Airbus Military, stated that the company could no longer afford to produce the C-212 in Europe. Production of the type at Airbus&#x27; Seville facility was progressively slowed to only four aircraft in two years. During December 2012, the final Spanish-assembled C-212 was delivered to its customer, the Vietnam Coast Guard. By the time of the line&#x27;s shutdown, 477 aircraft had been produced for 92 operators.

=== Indonesian production ===

During 1975, the Indonesian aircraft company IPTN successfully negotiated terms with CASA to produce up to 108 C-212s under license in Indonesia. Accordingly, IPTN and Nurtanio became involved in the manufacturing of their own C-212s, with assembly performed at IPTN&#x27;s facility in Bandung, Indonesia. CASA provided technical assistance in establishing their production line, sending a delegation of technicians to Bandung to train local personnel; the relative simplicity of the C-212 design was credited with aiding the process.

Under the terms of the license, IPTN was permitted to sell the aircraft throughout the Asian market. Despite this, the majority of Indonesian-made NC-212s were sold to domestic customers; by 1986, only six aircraft had reportedly been exported. By 2000, a total of 95 NC-212s had been completed. By this point, production of the type had become a secondary priority to other ventures, such as the larger CASA/IPTN CN-235. IPTN also undertook development of more advanced versions of the aircraft. Between 2004 and 2008, all of the jigs and fixtures necessary to produce the &quot;NC212-400&quot; were supplied by Airbus and installed at Bandung, enabling Indonesia to become the single-source manufacturer of this model. The licensing agreement was extended in 2006.

During July 2011, Airbus announced an agreement to strategically collaborate with PTDI (IPTN&#x27;s successor) on the C-212. Under the terms of this agreement, Airbus undertook an 18-month first phase of support to PTDI, after which it stated it would provide PTDI an increasing high-value industrial activity, including C-212 upgrades and production transference. In February 2013, the arrangement between the two companies was formally extended to transfer production of the C-212 to Indonesia. For a time, PTDI produced both the NC-212-200 and the -400 upgrade, which were equipped with new digital avionics and autopilot, and featured a redesigned cabin that could accommodate up to 28 passengers. During 2014, PTDI stopped producing the -400 series in favour of focusing on the improved NC-212i model.

==Design==

The CASA C-212 Aviocar is a turboprop-powered STOL-capable cargo aircraft. In terms of its basic configuration, it has a high-mounted wing, a boxy fuselage, and a conventional tail. The C-212 has been designed to operate in austere environments for extended periods without ground support apparatus. Features such as its STOL performance and rugged landing gear fitted with low-pressure tyres enables it to operate from unpaved fields and under hot-and-high conditions. For greater simplicity, the aircraft&#x27;s tricycle undercarriage is non-retractable.

Dependent on configuration, the cabin of the C-212 has a maximum occupancy of between 21 and 28 passengers. In a paratroop configuration, up to 24 paratroopers along with one jumpmaster can be accommodated on foldable sidewall seats, while in a mixed configuration, up to ten soldiers and a single vehicle can be transported. Since the C-212 does not have a pressurized fuselage, it is limited to relatively low-flight-level airline usage (below MSL), and is thus orientated for operations performing short legs and regional airline services.

==Operational history==

During 2013, it was reported that 290 C-212s were flying in 40 countries; Indonesia was the country with the most aircraft of the type, operating 70. It has seen especially wide employment as a commuter airliner and a military aircraft, with its operators including numerous charter and short-haul aviation companies and several national air forces. The C-212 is commonly used as a transport, surveillance aircraft, and for search and rescue.

The C-212 has also been in the service of the United States Army Special Operations Command, where it is operated under the designation &quot;C-41A&quot; and is commonly used for operations such as troop infiltration and exfiltration, supply drops, and airborne operations. During August 2010, Airbus Military received a contract for the sustainment and modernisation of five C-212-200s operated by the US Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC). Additional aircraft were both owned and operated by the private military contractor Blackwater; these were active during both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan, typically to conduct supply drops to US ground forces active in remote areas of these countries. During the conflict, the planes were piloted by former pilots from 160th &quot;Night Stalkers&quot; Special Operations Regiment.

One particularly ambitious use of the C-212 was undertaken by the Australian airline Skytraders, which has used its fleet to support Australia’s scientific research assets across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Various operators have elected to operate their aircraft amongst inhospitable terrain, such as desert and jungles. On account of its uncommon rear ramp arrangement, the C-212 has a unique selling point amongst its competitors; thus, it became a popular aircraft among skydivers and smokejumpers.

;2 January 1984: A Royal Jordanian Air Force CASA 212-A3 Aviocar 100 crashed near Al Qatrana/Jordan due to mechanical problems. All 13 people on board the plane were killed.
;4 March 1987: Northwest Airlink Flight 2268 crashed while landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Romulus, Michigan. Nine of the 19 passengers and crew on board were killed.
;8 May 1987: American Eagle Flight 5452 crashed while landing in Puerto Rico, killing two.
;2 August 1988: Operated by Geoterrex of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the aircraft crashed on approach to Reykjavik, Iceland with the loss of all 3 people on board. The cause was, &quot;the crew lost control of the aircraft most probably because of large fluctuations in the power output of the right engine caused by the shift of an incorrectly installed speeder spring in the right propeller governor.&quot;
;1 December 1989: A United States Army C-212-200 crashed into the Patuxent River while trying to land at the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, Maryland, killing all five people on board.
;16 January 1990: SANSA Flight 32 crashed into the Cerro Cedral, a mountain in Costa Rica shortly after takeoff from Juan Santamaria International Airport in San Jose. All 20 passengers and three crew on board died in the crash.
;24 January 1990: A Venezuelan Navy C-212 crashed into a mountain due to poor weather, killing all 24 people on board.
;27 March 1990: An Angolan government C-212 was shot down by UNITA rebels near Kuito, killing all 25 people on board.
;7 June 1992: American Eagle Flight 5456, a CASA C-212 flying from Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico crashed short of the runway in Mayagüez, killing both crew members and all three passengers. The investigation led to the discontinuation of use of the C-212 by American Eagle.
;8 March 1994: A Spanish Air Force C-212, part of the &quot;Ala&quot; 37 deployed in Vicenza, Italy, was hit in the tail by an SA-7 missile, allegedly fired by Serb rebels. east of Rijeka when ferrying UNPROFOR personnel from Zagreb to Split. The tail control surfaces were damaged, the left engine failed and four passengers were injured by splinters. The crew managed to land the aircraft at Rijeka Airport. Spanish technicians were able to repair the damage and have the aircraft back in service in 48 hours.
;27 August 1994: A DEA-operated aircraft (reg. N119CA) crashed into a mountain (or at the end of a box canyon) north of Puerto Pizana, in the Amazonian jungle department of San Martín, Peru. The crash happened while on flight from Santa Lucia to Pucallpa in the Huallaga River Valley region, and killed the CASA&#x27;s five occupants, which were all DEA Special Agents. The accident reportedly took place under bad weather and low visibility conditions during a counter-narcotics reconnaissance operation. This accident precipitated the end of Operation Snowcap, under which the ill-fated flight took place.
;17 June 1995: An Angolan Air Force C-212 carrying members of a local football club crashed while on approach to Catumbela Airport, killing 48 of the 53 people aboard.
;27 November 2004: &quot;Blackwater 61&quot; Presidential Airways CASA C-212-200 (registration: N960BW / serial nr: 231) was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense to supply American forces deployed in remote areas of Afghanistan. The aircraft entered a box canyon and struck the level of Baba Mountain, which has a peak elevation of . The flight was about north of the typical route between Bagram and Farah.
;22 February 2005: An Indonesian National Police C-212 received engine trouble during landing, causing it to crash into the sea. Of the 18 police officers on board, 15 were killed.
;26 October 2006: Swedish Coast Guard CASA C-212-200 (registration: SE-IVF/serial nr: KBV 585) crashed in the Falsterbo Canal during a surveillance mission, killing all four on board. Eyewitness accounts suggest that the accident was caused by one of the wings of the aircraft somehow detaching. The preliminary report from the Swedish Accident Investigation Board suggests that the right wing detached due to a fatigue crack which had developed in the load-bearing structure in the wing.

;15 November 2006: Mexican Navy CASA 212-200 Maritime Patrol (serial AMP-114) crashed in the sea in Campeche coast over the Mexican Gulf during a surveillance mission, all crew managed to survive, due to a smooth maneuver, reasons of the accident still unknown.

<text>The Royal Company of Archers, The King&#x27;s Bodyguard for Scotland, is a ceremonial unit that serves as the Sovereign&#x27;s bodyguard in Scotland—a role it has performed since 1822 during the reign of King George IV when the company provided a personal bodyguard to the King on his visit to Scotland. It is currently known as the King&#x27;s Bodyguard for Scotland or, more often and colloquially, The Royal Company. It is located in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. The Royal Company of Archers has a long history in Scotland as a body that celebrated both the recreation and talent of local archers. As a body established by the Monarch, the company has a long history of unique prizes, influential supporters, and ceremonial roles. It has an associated charity, the Royal Company of Archers Charitable Trust, dedicated to helping disadvantaged individuals with their health and wellbeing in Scotland.

==Early history==
During the 17th and 18th centuries in Scotland, a muster or military rendezvous, called a &quot;wapinschaw&quot; (a weapon show - Scot’s dialect wapen (weapon), shaw (show)) was held at least twice a year. Men were summoned by the sheriff and other civil magistrates to attend a muster in their respective counties at least 20 days in advance of the meeting. The civil magistrates, in conjunction with commissioners appointed by the King, supervised this body of militia, divided it into companies, and appointed captains. People of all stations were obligated to play their part in each rendezvous and to show up equipped in military kit that conformed to their respective ranks. The Lords and Barons were required to provide a list of the members of their company and the weapons they brought with them to the civil magistrates and King&#x27;s commissioners. The commissioners then compiled a list of the whole muster, which was presented to the King.

By using the old laws of &quot;wapinschaw&quot;, the Jacobites formed a plan to institutionalise a military corps, under a pretext of sports and recreation, that could be assembled by an authority as occasion offered. A society for encouraging and exercising archery had already been formed in 1676, as a private archery club. This society sought and acquired the patronage of the Scottish Privy Council, which provided a prize that was shot for by the company&#x27;s members. The company consisted of distinguished nobles and gentlemen of the day. The Marquis of Athole was the company&#x27;s Captain-General in 1670; and they held frequent meetings during the reign of the royal brothers. No traces of this company exist for some time after the Glorious Revolution. Upon the accession of Queen Anne, and death of the Marquis of Athole, they appointed Sir George Mackenzie, then Lord Tarbat and Secretary of State, and afterwards Earl of Cromarty, their Captain-General.

Having chosen a new leader, the society obtained from Queen Anne a charter under the Great Seal of Scotland, establishing it as a corporation by Letters Patent, dated 31 December 1713 into a Royal Company. These letters of patent: revived and ratified, on their behalf, the old laws and acts of Parliament that favored archery; gave them power to admit members, chose a President and council, appoint commanding officers, and to meet and act under their officers&#x27; supervision in military form for weapon-shawing as often as they should think convenient; and prohibited the civil magistrate from interrupting their activities. These rights and privileges were designed after the mode of feudal tenure, and to hold them in blanch fee (&quot;reddendo&quot;) of Her Majesty and her successors, therefore annually acknowledging a pair of barbed arrows. The society received these rights and privileges in its charter from Queen Anne in 1704. In return for being endowed with &quot;perpetual access to all public butts, plains and pasturages legally allotted for shooting arrows&quot;, the Royal Company is required to present to the Sovereign three barbed arrows on request.

The first such weapon-shawing was held on 14 June 1714, with the Marquis of Athole as the company&#x27;s Captain-General, even though he was in his 80s by this time, and the Earl of Wemyss as Lieutenant-General at the head of about 50 archers. On that occasion, the society shot a silver arrow, presented to them by the City of Edinburgh, at Leith. By the following year, the company had doubled in number and was led by David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss after the death of the Marquis of Athole.

After the Jacobite rising of 1715 no parade was held for nine years, but they resumed under James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton on 4 August 1724 at Musselburgh. However, after 1734 public parades were discontinued until the Napoleonic Wars were over.

==Traditions==
The Royal Company&#x27;s traditions relate to its reason for formation, the archery competition. To further this, it offers thirteen prizes that were at some time in the past competed for annually. Many are retained to the present day.

===The Musselburgh Arrow===
The tradition of shooting the silver &quot;Musselburgh Arrow&quot;, a small arrow presented by the town of Musselburgh in 1603, predates the creation of the Royal Company and follows in the traditions of other burghs of Scotland. A new, large arrow was presented in 1713. The victor of the shooting retains the arrow for a year, and on handing it over to the next victor appends a medal to the arrow with an engraved personal motto, all of which are held by the Royal Company. One hundred and three such medals were held by the company by 1816.

===Three Arrows===
By the 1820s three more arrows were also presented by the cities of Peebles (1626), Selkirk (1675) and Edinburgh.

&quot;The Edinburgh Arrow&quot; was presented by the City of Edinburgh in 1709, and the medals appended to it are in gold. The winner was at one time entitled to a prize of five pounds Sterling from the city, but this fell into abeyance after 1716. The &#x27;Edinburgh Arrow&#x27; is an annual competition competed for at the nearby Bruntsfield Links. It is the rule of the prize &quot;1. That the said Silver Arrow be shot for at the rovers in Leith Links, upon the second Monday of June yearly, at ten of the clock in the forenoon if the day be favourable; and if not, that the shooting be adjourned to the next fair Monday.&quot; 16 June 2009 marked the 300th anniversary of the first competition for The Edinburgh Arrow.

The three arrows are now depicted on one of the standards. Until the institution of the third prize, only a pair of arrows was presented to the Sovereign on demand, this now increased to three.

===The Silver Punch Bowl and Ladle===
The fifth prize is &quot;The Silver Punch Bowl and Ladle&quot; presented to the company in 1720, and likewise had medals appended to it by its winner.
The Bowl made to the value of £20, and the bill for its construction and the engraving on it came to £22, 13s. 9d. sterling. It had inscribed on one side the common seal of the company, and on the opposite side the reverse of the seal; and between those, on one side a Saint Andrew, and on the other the following inscription: &quot;Edinburgh, 20th June 1720. — The Councill of the Royall Company of Archers, viz., Mr David Drummond, Praeses, Thomas Kincaid, John Nairn, James Ross, Robert Lowis, John Lowis, John Carnegy, George Drummond, Tresr., William Murray and James Lowis, clerks, ordered this piece of plate to be furnished out of the stock of the Company, and to be shot for as ane annual pryze. at rovers by the said Company, as the Councill for the time shall appoint&quot;

===The Pagodas Medal===
This prize consists of a medal, one of two which were presented to the Company in 1793 by Major James Spens, The 73rd Regiment (Royal Highland East Indies). They were made from fifty &quot;pagodas&quot;, being part of the money actually paid by Tippu Sultan to the allies at the Treaty of Seringapatam in 1792.

===Silver Vase and Gold Medal===
A prize by the General John Earl of Hopetoun commemorating the 1822 visit by King George IV is also competed for annually on the king&#x27;s or queen&#x27;s birthday, and known as the Commemoration Prize.

===The Royal Prize of 20 Guineas===
Since 1677 there has also been a competition for &quot;The Royal Prize&quot; for which £20 is awarded on the condition that the winner contributes to the Company silver plate to the value of money received from the Crown. The condition is that the plate must bear the insignia of Archery.

===The Silver Bugles===
The ninth and tenth prizes are a pair of Silver Bugles, one presented to the Royal Company by one of the General Officers, Sir Henry Jardine, Knight, and which was shot for on 9 April 1830, for the first time. The second was presented later by the Sovereign&#x27;s Bodyguard.

===St. Andrew&#x27;s Prize===
St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross, given in the 1840s by Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, of Coul, to the Royal Company, and called the &quot;St.Andrew&#x27;s Prize.&quot;

The above prizes were competed at the 180, 185 and 200 yards distance with two targets or &#x27;clouts&#x27; as the aiming mark, one located at each end of the range.
Two further prizes are competed for &#x27;at butts&#x27; or point blank distance.

===Prize of the Goose===
The Prize of the Goose was competed for since 1703 and involved a live goose, requiring the winner to kill the goose when only its head protruded from the mark. The winner was to be known as the Captain of the Goose for a season.
At some time in the history of the company the above method was adopted for shooting for the prize of the Goose by inserting a small glass globe of about an inch in diameter in the centre of the butt-mark, which is a circular piece of cardboard, four inches in diameter. The competitor whose arrow first breaks this globe is declared &quot; Captain of the Goose &quot; for the year, and was awarded the other gold medal presented by Major Spens.

===The Gold Medal===
This is the more often competed for prize, the competition being held three times a year for three days each time, the scoring accounted in points like the usual archery competition.

===Competition rules===

The rules and regulations of the Royal Company of Archers have never been printed, and, in fact, were never completed. The society may, therefore, be considered as &quot;lawless&quot; when within the precincts of their shooting ground.

==Duties==
The main duties of the company are now ceremonial, and since the 1822 appointment as the Sovereign&#x27;s &#x27;Body Guard in Scotland&#x27; for George IV&#x27;s visit to Edinburgh, include attending the Sovereign at various functions during the annual Royal Visit to Scotland when he or she approaches within five miles of Edinburgh, including the Order of the Thistle investitures at the High Kirk of Edinburgh (St Giles&#x27; Cathedral), the Royal Garden Party and the Ceremony of the Keys at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and the presentation of new colours to Scottish regiments.

The Company arrives at the Palace of Holyroodhouse by march at noon, preceded by their pipes and drums band, and holding the unstrung bows in their right hands. Initially they occupy the colonnades of the façade.

The company has a march, the Archer&#x27;s March composed by Allan Ramsay, which was played on special occasions.

==Organisation==
The Royal Company of Archers has its base in Buccleuch Street, Edinburgh at Archers&#x27; Hall. Building commenced on 15 August 1776, and was completed by Alexander Laing in 1777. The Hall was extended in 1900 by A.F. Balfour Paul, and recently refurbished. The Hall consists of a hall, forty feet by twenty-four, and eighteen feet high; two rooms of eighteen by nineteen, and kitchen, cellars, lobby, and other apartments. Until 2010, the ground behind the house was laid out into a bowling-green, known as The Meadows or Hope Park, a spot deriving its name from Sir Thomas Hope, who drained and converted it into an archery ground, maintained by the Edinburgh Bowling Club. The Hall serves as a venue for various dinners and meetings of the Royal Company.

The affairs of the Royal Company are managed by a President and six counsellors, who are chosen annually by the whole membership. The Adjutant, an officer, is the only ex-officio member of Council. The council is vested with the power of receiving or rejecting candidates for admission, and of appointing the company&#x27;s officers, civil and military.

The structure of the organisation is divided between officers and Archers. By seniority, the officers comprise one Captain-General, four Captains, four Lieutenants, four Ensigns and twelve Brigadiers.

From the starting membership of 50 the number of the corps numbered about 1,000 in the late 18th century, but only exceeded five hundred by the 1930s. 
The Captain-General is the Gold Stick for Scotland.

The Royal Company of Archers functions as the Sovereign&#x27;s &#x27;Body Guard in Scotland&#x27;. Every officer of The Royal Company is of the rank of a general, and the Archers of the corps rank at Court as colonels.

Members of the Royal Company must be Scots or have strong Scottish connections. Membership is by election; the present membership totals around 530, with an active list of some 400. Members pay an annual subscription, and are also expected to cover the cost of their uniforms and equipment, as well as of travel and other expenses incidental to their duties.

==Company standards==

The Royal Company has two standards. The first of these bears on one side Mars and Cupid encircled in a wreath of thistles, with this motto: &quot;In peace and war&quot;. On the other, a yew tree, with two men dressed and equipped as archers, encircled as the former motto: &quot;Dal gloria vires&quot; (Glory Gives Strength). The other standard displays on one side, on a field or, a lion rampant gules, encircled with a double tressure flory-counter flory of the second (the Royal Arms of Scotland); on the top, a thistle and crown, motto: &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot; (no one provokes me with impunity). On the other, St Andrew on the cross on field argent; at the top, a crown, motto: &quot;Dulce pro patria periculum&quot; (danger is sweet for one&#x27;s country).

The three arrows on the standard were added after introduction of a third-place winner in the competition since 1720.

==Uniforms==
The Royal Company of Archers have the distinction of being the first unit in the service of the British Crown who adopted tartan as a part of their uniform.

The original uniform of the corps appears to have been a &quot;shooting&quot; dress, consisting of a tartan, lined with white, trimmed with green and white ribbons; a white sash, with green tassels; and a blue bonnet, with a St. Andrew&#x27;s cross, a tartan coat, with knee-breeches and white vest; and a &quot;common uniform&quot;, the coat of which was &quot;a green lapelled frock.&quot; Tartan was fashionable at the time as an expression of anti-Union and pro-Jacobite sentiment and many of the company were known Jacobites.

From 1713 to 1746 a red tartan was used for shooting uniform&#x27;s dress-like tunic, coat, and short trews. The tartan was thought lost for some time, but some of the tunics survive at Archers&#x27; Hall, and the sett of the quite complicated tartan has been analysed in detail (including variations). After 36 years following the Battle of Culloden the Act of Proscription passed by Parliament which &quot;proscribed or banned the making or wearing of Tartan cloths&quot; was repealed, and from 1783 tartans were worn again. However, in 1789 the red tartan sett was discarded for the Black Watch one. In 1734 the headgear worn by the corps was a flat bonnet, ornamented with green and white feathers. Until 1823 (and possibly later) the Royal Company of Archers still wore tartan.

Late in the 19th century when the Queen Victoria opened the Glasgow Exhibition, Her Majesty&#x27;s Scottish Body Guard wore their dark green tunics (formerly of the &quot;Black Watch&quot; tartan), with black braid facings and a narrow stripe of crimson velvet in the centre; shoulder wings and gauntleted cuffs similarly trimmed; dark green trousers with black and crimson stripe; a bow case worn as a sash, adorned with two arrows forming a St. Andrew&#x27;s cross surmounted by a crown; a black leather waist-belt with richly chased gold clasp; a short, gilt-headed Roman sword, like an English bandsman&#x27;s; Highland bonnet with thistle and one or more eagle feathers.

Their uniform until the Second World War, however, had been a court dress of green with gold embroidery, and cocked hat with a plume of dark cock&#x27;s feathers. The officers&#x27; dress has gold embroidery, and their rank is indicated by two or, in the case of the captain, three, feathers being worn in the bonnet. The corps shooting dress is a dark-green tunic with crimson facings, shoulder-wings and gauntleted cuffs and dark-green trousers trimmed with black and crimson, a bow-case worn as a sash, of the same colour as the coat, black waistbelt with sword, Highland cap with thistle ornament and one or more eagle feathers, and a hunting knife.

<text>Ernest Paul Lehman (December 8, 1915 – July 2, 2005) was an American screenwriter and film producer. He was nominated six times for Academy Awards for his screenplays during his career, but did not win. At the 73rd Academy Awards in 2001, he received an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of his achievements and his influential works for the screen. He was the first screenwriter to receive that honor.

He received two Edgar Awards of the Mystery Writers of America for screenplays of suspense films he wrote for director Alfred Hitchcock: &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), his only original screenplay, and &quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976), one of numerous adaptations.

==Early life and education==
Lehman was born in 1915 to Gertrude (Thorn) and Paul E. Lehman. Their Jewish family was based on Long Island. Lehman attended the College of the City of New York (The City College of New York), from which he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

During World War II he was trained at the New England Radio Institute, then worked as a radio operator for the aviation industry.

==Career==
After graduation, Lehman started working as a freelance writer. Lehman felt that freelancing was a &quot;very nervous way to make a living&quot;, so he began writing copy for a publicity firm that focused on plays and celebrities. He drew from this experience for the screenplay of the film &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), which he co-wrote with playwright Clifford Odets.

Lehman also published many short stories and novellas in magazines such as &quot;Colliers&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. These attracted the attention of Hollywood managers, and in the mid-1950s Paramount Pictures signed him to a writing contract. His first film, &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954), was a success.

Lehman was asked to collaborate on the romantic comedy &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), which was released the same year and also became a hit. Some of his most notable works are the screenplay adaptations of the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and the mega-hit film version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), another musical.

===Collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock===
In 1958, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had hired Hitchcock to make a film called &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot;, based on Hammond Innes&#x27; novel of the same name. Collaborating with Lehman, Hitchcock produced &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) instead. This was one of Lehman&#x27;s few original screenplays (rather than adaptations). The film starred Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government agent by a group of menacing spies (led by James Mason and Martin Landau). Lehman later said he intended &quot;North by Northwest&quot; to be &quot;the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures.&quot; The writing process took Lehman a year, including several periods of writer&#x27;s block, as well as a trip to Mount Rushmore to do research for the film&#x27;s climax.

&quot;North by Northwest&quot; was one of Lehman&#x27;s greatest triumphs in Hollywood and a huge hit for Hitchcock. For his efforts, Lehman received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, as well as a 1960 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay.

===Other projects===
In addition to screenwriting, Lehman tried his hand at producing. He was among the few people who initially favored a film adaptation of Edward Albee&#x27;s play &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;. He persuaded studio executive Jack L. Warner to allow him to take on the project, and the film was a critical sensation, garnering many Academy Award nominations. Lehman was also nominated for an Academy Award for producing &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), starring Barbra Streisand.

In 1972, Lehman directed &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, based on the novel by Philip Roth; this was his only directorial work. Later, he earned another Edgar Award for his screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final movie, &quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976).

By 1979, Lehman had stopped writing screenplays, aside from some television projects. He turned down offers to write for Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Lehman completed adaptations for two films that were never made: a screenplay for the Noël Coward classic &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, and one for a musical version of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;. The latter was intended for direction by Robert Wise and starring actors Anthony Quinn and John Travolta.

In 1977, Lehman published the bestselling novel &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot;, about a group of unemployed, middle-class Americans who hijack a French cruise ship for a $35 million ransom. It was adapted as a TV miniseries in 1979.

==Personal life==
Lehman married Jacqueline Shapiro in 1942. They had two sons, Roger and Alan. Jacqueline died in 1994.

In 1997, Lehman married Laurie Sherman. They had one son, Jonathan, and were married until his death.

===Amateur radio===
Lehman held amateur radio callsign K6DXK. He was an active member of the Bel Air Repeater Association.

===Death===
Lehman died on July 2, 2005, at UCLA Medical Center after an apparent heart attack. He was buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="959813" wikidata="Q345620" url="?curid=959813" title="Juan de la Cosa">
<text>Juan de la Cosa (c. 1450 – 28 February 1510) was a Castilian navigator and cartographer, known for designing the earliest European world map which incorporated the territories of the Americas discovered in the 15th century.
De la Cosa was the owner and master of the &quot;Santa María&quot;, and thus played an important role in the first and second voyage of Christopher Columbus to the West Indies.

In 1499, he served as the chief pilot in the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda to the coasts of South America. Upon his return to Andalusia, he drew his famous mappa mundi (&quot;world map&quot;) and soon returned to the Indies, this time with Rodrigo de Bastidas. In the following years, De la Cosa alternated trips to America under its own command with special duties from the Crown, including an assignment as a spy in Lisbon and participation in the board of pilots held in Burgos in 1508. In 1509, he began what would be his last expedition, again with Ojeda, to take possession of the coasts of modern Colombia.

De la Cosa died in an armed confrontation with indigenous people before he could get possession of Urabá.

== Origin and youth ==

No one knows exactly where Juan de la Cosa was born. Canovas del Castillo (1892) states that he was from Santoña, Cantabria, because there are documents showing that he was a resident there and his wife and daughter lived in that city. Some 16th-century chroniclers called him &quot;the Biscayne&quot;, leading to confusion with another sailor called &quot;Juan Vizcaino&quot;. However, today they are known to be different people.

His date of birth is also unknown, but it is estimated between 1450 and 1460, nor is any information available from his childhood or adolescence. It is assumed that the young man took part in sailing voyages around the Bay of Biscay and then towards the Canary Islands and West Africa.

The first solid references come from 1488, when Juan de la Cosa was in Portugal. At that time, navigator Bartolomeu Dias had just arrived in Lisbon, after having reached the Cape of Good Hope. The Catholic Monarchs may have sent de la Cosa to that city as a spy to obtain information and details of the discovery. He managed to return to Castile before Portuguese officers captured him.

Early in the 1490s, Juan de la Cosa was living in El Puerto de Santa María and owned a ship called &quot;Marigalante&quot; or &quot;Galician&quot;. It is believed that it was there that he established a business relationship with the Pinzón brothers.

== Travels==
===Travels with Christopher Columbus===
Juan de la Cosa sailed with Christopher Columbus on his first three voyages to the New World. He owned and was master of the &quot;Santa María&quot; (second-in-command to Columbus), flagship of Columbus&#x27;s first voyage in 1492. The vessel shipwrecked that year on the night of 24–25 December off the present-day site of Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. De la Cosa, in a notable act of cowardice (or treason, in Columbus&#x27;s documented opinion), fled the sinking Santa Maria (his partial ownership of the vessel notwithstanding) in the flagship&#x27;s boat, rather than endeavor to assist Columbus in kedging the stricken vessel from off the coral reef on which it had run aground. He and a handful of loyals made for &quot;La Nina&quot;, waiting a few hundred yards astern of the flagship, but they were turned back by &quot;La Nina&quot;&#x27;s captain Vicente Yanez.

On Columbus&#x27;s second voyage, in 1493, de la Cosa was mariner and cartographer on the ship &quot;Colina&quot;. On Columbus&#x27; third voyage, in 1498, de la Cosa was on the ship &quot;La Niña&quot;. Some historians believe de la Cosa did not participate in this voyage.

In 1494 de la Cosa received compensation from the Spanish monarchs for the sinking of his ship on his first voyage. He was awarded the right to transport &quot;docientos cahíces de trigo&quot; (&quot;two hundred cahices of flour&quot;) from Andalucia to Biscay, and exempted from certain duties.

===First voyage with de Ojeda===
On his fourth voyage, in 1499, de la Cosa was the first pilot for the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda and Amerigo Vespucci, and with them was among the first to set foot on the South American mainland on the Gulf of Paria. At the same time they explored the coast from Essequibo River to Cape Vela.

In spite of not receiving much remuneration, De la Cosa had benefited considerably, having mapped in detail the coast of the region he explored, information he would use to create his famous map.

On the fifth voyage, in 1500, de la Cosa, Rodrigo de Bastidas, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa explored the lands of present-day Colombia and Panama. He explored further along the South American coast to the isthmus of Panama, and returned to Haiti in 1502. When the Spanish court found soon afterwards that the Portuguese had made several incursions into the newly discovered country, Queen Isabella sent Juan de la Cosa at the head of a delegation to Portugal to protest this incursion. De la Cosa was arrested and incarcerated, liberated only with the help of Queen Isabella.

===First independent voyage===
De la Cosa was nominated an &quot;alguazil&quot;, and in 1504–05(?) (or 1506) was commander of an expedition to the Pearl Islands and the Gulf of Urabá to found settlements there. At the same time he visited Jamaica and Haiti.

===Second voyage with de Ojeda and de la Cosa&#x27;s death===

In 1509 Juan de la Cosa set out for the seventh and last time for the New World. He carried two hundred colonists on three ships, and on reaching Haiti placed himself under the command of Alonso de Ojeda, who added another ship with one hundred settlers to the expedition. After having settled an old border dispute between Alonso de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa, they went with Francisco Pizarro into de Ojeda&#x27;s territory and landed at the future site of Cartagena. This was against the warnings of de la Cosa, who proposed they disembark on the more peaceful coast of the Gulf of Urabá. When the Spanish came ashore, they got in a fight with the natives on the Bay of Calamar, and drove them off. Emboldened by the Spanish victory, de Ojeda decided to go further into the forest, to the native village at the future site of Turbaco. When they arrived at the town, they were attacked by the natives, and de la Cosa was shot with poison arrows and killed. De Ojeda escaped, and fled to the coast. Another Spanish expedition passed by, and de Ojeda told them of the murderous natives. The men of the other expedition joined de Ojeda for a punitive attack on that village, killing all of its inhabitants to avenge de la Cosa&#x27;s death. De la Cosa&#x27;s widow received 45,000 maravedís and all the natives he had in his possession as indemnity for services rendered.

== Cartography ==

Juan de la Cosa made several maps of which the only survivor is his famous world map from 1500. It is the oldest known European map that shows the New World. Of special interest is the outline of Cuba, which Christopher Columbus never believed to be an island. Walkenaer and Alexander von Humboldt were the first to point out the great importance of this chart. It is now in the Museo Naval in Madrid. Reproductions of it were first given by Humboldt in his &quot;Atlas géographique et physique&quot;.

<doc id="959823" wikidata="Q6929939" url="?curid=959823" title="Mrs Dale's Diary">
<text>Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary was the first significant BBC radio serial drama. It was first broadcast on 5 January 1948 on the BBC Light Programme, later BBC Radio 2; it ran until 25 April 1969. A new episode was broadcast each weekday afternoon, with a repeat the following morning. A few days after the final episode, a new serial drama, &quot;Waggoners&#x27; Walk&quot;, took over the time slot.

The main scriptwriter for many years was Jonquil Antony, and her first collaborator (under a pseudonym)
was Ted Willis, later to create &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;.

The lead character, Mrs Dale, was played by Ellis Powell until she left the show in 1963 and was replaced by Jessie Matthews.

== Format ==
An innovative characteristic of the programme was that a brief introductory narrative in each episode was spoken by Mrs Dale as if she were writing her diary.

The serial centred on Mrs Mary Dale, a doctor&#x27;s wife, and her husband Jim, and the comings and goings of a middle class society. The Dales lived at Virginia Lodge in the fictional London Metro-land-style suburb of Parkwood Hill. They had moved there from the real area of Kenton, which straddles the border between the London boroughs of Brent and Harrow. Later in the series, to modernise the programme and its setting, the producers relocated the family in the fictional new town of Exton New Town.

Mrs Dale&#x27;s mother was Mrs Rosemary Freeman, whom Jim always called, rather gravely, &quot;mother-in-law&quot;. Dr and Mrs Dale had a daughter, Gwen, and a son, Bob, who worked in the motor trade. He was married to Jenny; they had twins. Gwen was widowed after her husband David was killed in a water-skiing accident in the Bahamas where he was holidaying with his rich mistress. Mary Dale&#x27;s sister, Sally, (which she always pronounced &quot;Selly&quot;) lived in Chelsea and moved in exotic circles. The Dales and their friends (along with Captain, Mrs Freeman&#x27;s cat, apparently named after the rank of her late husband, who had been killed in the First World War) got along in almost perfect harmony. It was all respectable, comfortable and middle-class.

==Treatment of homosexuality==

The programme is thought to be the first British mainstream drama which depicted a character known to be homosexual sympathetically in a leading part – Richard Fulton (portrayed by David March), Sally&#x27;s husband. It was a brave move to feature a gay man, especially when homosexuality was still illegal in the United Kingdom. Clearly the programme&#x27;s makers considered the time was right for the subject to be featured. Richard Fulton, however, was an odd character to use, in several ways. Not least is that (though apparently based on the homosexual writer Patrick White) Richard&#x27;s history in the serial was heterosexual. He was in fact a character who had developed a lot, having been presented in the early days as a monster of petulance.

== Changes to the format ==
On 26 February 1962, the serial was renamed The Dales. The linking narratives by Mrs Dale were dropped. The reason was that the BBC was conscious that the series was considered by the media to be twee and hopelessly old fashioned. The changes included a new theme tune composed by Ron Grainer, composer of the theme music for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. &quot;Dance in the Twilight&quot; from Eric Coates&#x27; &quot;Springtime Suite&quot; also served as a signature tune for a time.

In 1975, Matthews&#x27;s biographer, Michael Thornton, wrote:
On 19 February, 1963, a plump and embittered fifty-six-year-old character actress called Ellis Powell walked out of Broadcasting House for the last time. She was not a star. In fact, she had earned less than £30 a week. But her voice was as well known in Britain as that of Queen Elizabeth II, for it was heard twice a day by seven million devoted listeners. Miss Powell was Britain&#x27;s most sacrosanct fictional paragon, Mrs. Dale, in the radio serial &quot;Mrs. Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot;. And now, after fifteen years in the role she had created, the BBC had summarily fired her partly because of her drinking habits, and partly because it was felt that the role, and also the entire programme, was in need of a facelift. Three months later, at the age of fifty-seven, she died. Her friends believed she never recovered from the shock and distress of her summary dismissal by the BBC. In the last weeks of her life she worked as a demonstrator at the Ideal Home Exhibition and as a cleaner in an hotel.

==&quot;The Dales&quot;==
In its last years, &quot;The Dales&quot; became more sensational. Mrs Dale became a councillor, a position she had to give up after she had caused a man&#x27;s death by careless driving. A heart attack forced Dr Dale to retire from practice. Perhaps the most famous storyline was Jenny&#x27;s getting measles; listeners wrote in thousands complaining that she had already had measles in 1949.

When it became &quot;The Dales&quot;, the show did try to copy &quot;The Archers&quot;, which was originally a medium to disseminate information to the agricultural community, and to give an insight into rural affairs to the public. In &quot;The Dales&quot; the plots now revolved around medical conditions and problems. When the series ran a story about the importance of women having regular cervical smear tests and checking their breasts for lumps, the junior health minister praised the programme, saying it had encouraged thousands of women to see their doctor.

The serial ran for 5,531 episodes, culminating with the engagement of Mrs Dale&#x27;s daughter Gwen to a famous TV professor on 25 April 1969. On news of its demise, Liberal MP Peter Bessell attempted to introduce a reprieve for the series in Parliament. The BBC Sound Archive holds only five complete episodes of &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot;, and seven complete episodes of &quot;The Dales&quot;.

==Spin-offs==
Over the years it ran there were a number of books written around the characters, several authored in whole or part by Jonquil Antony, the most important scriptwriter at the beginning and for many years. In 1970, the year after the programme finished, she took back her former characters after a fashion, publishing &quot;Dear Dr. Dale&quot;, a novel set after the end of the serial.

In the same year Charles Simon, who had played Dr Dale in the Jessie Matthews years, did his own continuation of the story, going on tour in &quot;At Home With The Dales&quot;. This show has its place in theatre history as the first professional venture of Cameron Mackintosh, later renowned for large-scale musicals. The Dales play was written by Charles Henry, who was soon discovered to be the versatile and experienced Charles Simon. Later dates in the tour were cancelled because the audience did not seem to be there. &quot;It would have been different if Jessie had done the tour&quot; Charles Simon remarked a few months later (to actor Roger Sansom, with whom he was in a broadcast). He was, however, the only member of the radio cast to make the transition.

The play was published, but has seldom been revived. In 1972 it received an amateur production at Rugby Theatre, with Bridget Watson as Mrs Dale and Harry Roberts as her husband the doctor. The only professional revival seems to have been in 1997 at the Kenneth More Studio Theatre in Ilford, when Angela Ellis and Roger Braban played the senior Dales.

==Catchphrase==

The phrase seized on by caricaturists as typical of Mrs Dale&#x27;s narrative was &quot;I&#x27;m rather worried about Jim...&quot; Indeed, the phrase was a staple of many comedy programmes, radio and television, in the early 1960s aiming to poke fun at safe, staid and undemanding middle-class lifestyles. The last episode ended with Mrs Dale saying, &quot;There&#x27;s one thing that won&#x27;t change – I shall always worry about Jim...&quot;

== Parodies ==

===&quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot;===
Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary was the basis of &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot; in the fortnightly satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The writers (primarily John Wells) presented Mrs Wilson as seeing herself as comfortably middle class, in contrast to the working class pretensions (and middle class actuality) of her husband, for example the Wincarnis (a brand of tonic wine) and the worsted suits with two pairs of trousers (Wilson was from Huddersfield, a town known for the manufacture of worsted cloth).

===&quot;The Goon Show&quot;===

The show was mentioned in the following episodes of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;:
* In an untitled episode (s02 e01 - 22 January 1952), listeners are given an example of how &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; would sound as produced by Americans. It includes over-hyped music, multiple in-show advertisements for bizarrely named products, and ends with several murders.
* In &quot;The Man Who Tried To Destroy London&#x27;s Monuments&quot;, (s04 ep02 - 9 October 1953), Eccles regains consciousness and is told he is in Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary.
* &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Five&quot;, (s05 ep15 - 5 January 1955), in which mention is made of &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Real Diary&quot; when the character Bluebottle is reading a book:
:&quot;Seagoon&quot;: I want to read it. What&#x27;s it called?
:&quot;Bluebottle&quot;: It&#x27;s called Mrs Dale&#x27;s &quot;Real&quot; Diary.
:&quot;Seagoon&quot;: Mrs Dale&#x27;s...?? Heavens -- would the BBC stop at nothing? So this was how they kept the masses from thinking.
:&quot;Bluebottle&quot;: Eheehee! Look at this page! Eheehee! It&#x27;s a Three-D picture of Mrs Dale in her nightshirt being chased by Richard Dimbleby... Eheehee! Eheeheehee! Eheeheeoooooughhhh... pauses to wipe drool off chin.

It was also one of the recordings used for torture in the BBC Listening Room, that episode&#x27;s parody of Room 101.

<text>Christine Josephine Cavanaugh (&quot;née&quot; Sandberg; August 16, 1963 – December 22, 2014) was an American actress, who had a distinctive speaking style and provided the voice for a large range of cartoon characters. She was the original voice of Chuckie Finster in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot; and the voices of Gosalyn Mallard in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, Bunnie Rabbot from DIC Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; television series, Oblina in &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; and the original voices of the titular protagonists of the 1995&#x27;s &quot;Babe&quot; and Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, respectively.

Cavanaugh retired from voice acting and public life in general in 2001, although some media with her contributions continued to be released until 2003. She died at age 51 on December 22, 2014, at her home in Cedar City, Utah.

==Early life==
Christine Josephine Sandberg was born in Layton, Utah, on August 16, 1963, to Waldo Eugene Sandberg and Reta Mason. At the age of 15, she was adopted by Kirt and Linda Johnson, who she considered as her parents for the rest of her life, after her &quot;mamma&quot;, Margaret Sandberg, died. Cavanaugh was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She graduated from Layton High School in 1981.

==Career==
In 1991, Cavanaugh began voicing Gosalyn Mallard, the titular character&#x27;s adoptive daughter on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; as well as Chuckie Finster on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot; and later in 1994, Oblina on &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;.

Cavanaugh could also be heard on &quot;The Critic&quot; as the voice of Marty, Jay Sherman&#x27;s son. Her voice credits also include the animated series &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot;, &quot;Hercules: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Recess&quot;, as well as the voice of Birdie in &quot;The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald&quot;.

In 1995, Cavanaugh lent her voice to the live-action film &quot;Babe&quot; in the starring role of the titular character. She was offered to reprise her role for the sequel, &quot;&quot;, but decided against it when contract negotiations fell through, so the role was instead played by her &quot;Rugrats&quot; co-star Elizabeth Daily. Also in 1995, Cavanaugh began voicing the eponymous character of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, which began as a short under Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; show, and later became the first short to be adapted into its own series for Cartoon Network. She later won an Annie Award in 2000 for her voice performance in the hour-long TV special &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory: Ego Trip&quot;.

Cavanaugh also guest starred on several TV shows including &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and &quot;ER&quot;, and had supporting roles in the feature films &quot;Soulmates&quot; and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. Cavanaugh retired from voice acting in 2001 to spend more time with family, although some TV episodes and films with her recordings continued to be released until 2003. After her retirement, she was replaced by Candi Milo on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and by Nancy Cartwright, her co-star in &quot;The Critic&quot;, as the voice of Chuckie in the &quot;Rugrats&quot; franchise.

==Death==
On December 22, 2014, Cavanaugh died at her home in Cedar City, Utah, at the age of 51. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered into the Great Salt Lake.

===Legacy===
Cavanaugh&#x27;s legacy was acknowledged by Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, as he cited her death as one of the factors in his refusal to create a revival of the show.

<text>Sebilla Alida Johanna Niemans (27 September 1927 – 31 October 1959), known as Blonde Dolly, was a Dutch prostitute and businesswoman who was murdered by strangulation. Her murderer was never caught.

==Biography==
Sebilla Niemans was born in Amsterdam-West on 27 September 1927. Her father, Hendricus Johannes Niemans (born 1899), was a shoemaker; her mother was Sebilla Alida Johanna Streelder (born 1900). When she was young, after her chronically ill mother was admitted to hospital, Niemans and her elder brother were sent to the Groot Kijkduin children&#x27;s home in Zandvoort. When Nazi Germany occupied the area during the Second World War, Niemans and her brother went back to Amsterdam to live with their father, who by now had become married to a new wife.

As she did not get on with her stepmother, Niemans left home looking for a job and accommodation. Through a fortune teller and a purported Italian sailor who was, in fact, a pimp, she entered prostitution in the Kerkstraat. After being investigated by police, Niemans returned to her father and stepmother and started training in dressmaking.

In 1948, Niemans moved to the Hague, where she returned to prostitution and rented a window at 21 Doubletstraat. She was originally known as &quot;Black Dolly&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Zwarte Dolly&quot;) from her dark hair, but later bleached it. In 1950 she purchased a house at 498 Nieuwe Haven.

Later in 1950, Niemans married Botto van den Bergh, a violinist in Hague&#x27;s Residentie Orchestra. She accompanied her husband when he was travelling with the orchestra, and was introduced to the worlds of classical music, fashion and art; she occasionally worked as a fashion model. However, Niemans&#x27;s marriage to van den Bergh broke down after a year and, following a lengthy and complex legal procedure, the couple were divorced in 1957.

==Murder==

Niemans was found dead in bed in her bedroom at 498 Nieuwe Haven on 2 November 1959. It was estimated that she had been strangled on the night of 30-31 October. There were no signs of violence, and a considerable amount of cash was found in the residence by the police. Robbery was ruled out as a motive for the crime.

The murder sparked a considerable stir. There was speculation that Niemans&#x27;s &quot;blue book&quot;, which the police refused to release to the public, contained names of high-ranking regular customers. This caused rumours that one of Niemans&#x27;s customers was involved in her murder. No evidence to substantiate these rumours was ever presented, nor that of a political cover-up. The international press picked up the case, linking it to the murder in Germany of Rosemarie Nitribitt in 1957, in which there were also allegations of politicians being involved.

The main suspect in the case was a bodyguard named &quot;Gerard V&quot;, whose services Niemans had used after another prostitute, Marietje van Es, had been robbed in December 1958. Gerard had fallen in love with Niemans but she had rejected him. He was never charged, and the investigation was closed.

According to the politician Hans Gualthérie van Weezel, his father, the police commissioner Jan Gualthérie van Weezel, knew who had committed the murder. Gualthérie van Weezel Sr. would keep a file on the case at home with the instruction to destroy it after his death. Before carrying out this instruction, his son would have read the name of the perpetrator in the file.

==In popular culture==
The life and death of Blonde Dolly was incorporated in Michel Dubois&#x27; novel &quot;Murder on Black Martha&quot; (1962), and was portrayed in director Gerrit van Elst&#x27;s film &quot;Blonde Dolly&quot; (1987). Casper Postmaa wrote a book about the case. In 2019 appeared Blonde Dolly by Tomas Ross with new details about the murder.

<text>Rajgir, old name Rajagriha, meaning &quot;The City of Kings,&quot; is an ancient city and university town in the district of Nalanda in Bihar, India. It was the capital of the Haryanka dynasty, the Pradyota dynasty, the Brihadratha dynasty and the Mauryan Empire, as well as the dwelling ground of historical figures such as Buddha, Mahavira and Bimbisara. Due to its religious significance, the city holds a place of prominence in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scriptures. As of 2011, the population of the town was reported to be 41,000 while the population in the community development block was about 88,500. 

Rajgir was the first capital of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, a state that would eventually evolve into the Mauryan Empire. It finds mention in India&#x27;s renowned literary epic, the Mahabharata, through its king Jarasandha. The town&#x27;s date of origin is unknown, although ceramics dating to about 1000 BC have been found in the city. The 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall is also located in the region. 

The ancient Nalanda university was located in the vicinity of Rajgir, and the contemporary Nalanda University named after it was founded in 2010 nearby. The town is also famed for its natural springs and towering hills that dominate the landscape.

== Etymology ==
The name Rajgir, literally meaning &quot;royal mountain&quot;, comes from the historic Rājagṛiha (Sanskrit &quot;Rājagṛha&quot;, Pali: &quot;Rajagaha&quot;), meaning &quot;house of the king&quot; or &quot;royal house&quot;. It has also historically been known as Vasumati, Brhadrathapura, Grivraja/Girivraja and Kusagrapura. Girivraja, a name given in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; as well as in Pali texts (as &quot;Giribajja&quot;), is explained by Buddhaghosa as meaning &quot;an enclosure of hills&quot;. &quot;Vasumatī&quot; is a name given in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; because of the city&#x27;s legendary founding by Vasu, the fourth son of Brahmā. The &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, on the other hand, attributes the city&#x27;s founding to Bṛhadratha, and accordingly it calls the city Bārhadrathapura. The name Kuśāgrapura is given in the &quot;Jinaprabhasūri&quot; and also (in Chinese) by Xuanzang; this name means &quot;the place of superior reed grass&quot;.

==History==

The epic Mahabharata calls it Girivraja and recounts the story of its king, Jarasandha, and his battle with the Pandava brothers and their allies Krishna. Mahabharata recounts a wrestling match between Bhima (one of the Pandavas) and Jarasandha, the then king of Magadha. Jarasandha was invincible as his body could rejoin any dismembered limbs. According to the legend, Bhima split Jarasandha into two and threw the two halves facing opposite to each other so that they could not join. There is a famous Jarasandha&#x27;s Akhara (the place where martial arts are practised).

Rajgir was the capital of Haryanka dynasty kings Bimbisara (558–491 BC) and Ajatashatru (492–460 BC). Ajatashatru kept his father Bimbisara in captivity here. The sources do not agree on which of the Buddha&#x27;s royal contemporaries, Bimbisara and Ajatashatru, was responsible for its construction. It was the ancient capital city of the Magadha kings until the 5th century BC when Udayin (460–440 BC), son of Ajatashatru, moved the capital to Pataliputra (modern Patna). Shishunaga (413-395 BC) founded Shishunaga dynasty in 413 BC with Rajgir as its initial capital before it was moved to Pataliputra.

It is associated with the founders of both the religions: Jainism and Buddhism, associated with both the historical Arihant Shraman  Bhagawan Mahavira and Buddha.

It was here that Gautama Buddha spent several months meditating, and preaching at Gridhra-kuta, (&#x27;Hill of the Vultures&#x27;).It was also the relaxing place of him in Venuban which is a government owned tourist place now. He also delivered some of his famous sermons and initiated king Bimbisara of Magadha and others to Buddhism. It was here that Budhha delivered his famous Atanatiya Sutra. On one of the hills is the Saptaparni Cave where the First Buddhist Council was held under the leadership of Maha Kassapa.

Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara spent fourteen years of his life at Rajgir and Nalanda, spending &quot;Chaturmas&quot; (i.e. 4 months of the rainy season) at a single place in Rajgir (Rajgruhi) and the rest in the places in the vicinity. It was the capital of one of his Shravaks (follower) King Shrenik. Thus Rajgir is also of religious importance to Jains. The twentieth Jain Tirthankara, Munisuvrata is supposed to have been born here. An ancient temple (about 1200 years old) dedicated to Tirthankara Munisuvrata is also present here along with many other Jain temples. This temple is also a place for four Kalyanakas of Tirthankara Munisuvrata.It is also mentioned in Jain and Buddhist scriptures, which give a series of place-names, but without geographical context. The attempt to locate these places is based largely on reference to them and to other locations in the works of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, particularly Faxian and Xuanzang. It is on the basis of Xuanzang in particular that the site is divided into Old and New Rajgir. The former lies within a valley and is surrounded by low-lying hills, Rajgir Hills. It is defined by an earthen embankment (the Inner Fortification), with which is associated the Outer Fortification, a complex of cyclopean walls that runs (with large breaks) along the crest of the hills. New Rajgir is defined by another, larger, embankment outside the northern entrance of the valley and next to the modern town.

The old site of Rajgir was surrounded by an almost 50 km-long cyclopean wall that followed the tops of the surrounding hills. It likely served a dual purpose as both defense against attackers and protection from potential flooding caused by monsoon rainwater flowing down from the hills. 16 towers were also built along the walls at irregular intervals to strengthen the defenses. The most notable of these was the Pippala stone house, whose remains have been identified on the eastern slope of the Vaibhara hill. Probably originally built to house guards, it later became known as a place where the Buddha often stayed. Later, when it was no longer used for defensive purposes, the Pippala house&#x27;s 11 small cells were likely repurposed to serve as individual meditation rooms for Buddhist monks. Based on archaeological finds, the cyclopean walls of old Rajgir are dated to about the 6th century BCE, while &quot;New&quot; Rajgir was probably fortified around the 1st century BCE.

=== Gupta and Pala periods ===
Rajgir appears to have declined in importance somewhat after the 1st or 2nd century CE. Xuanzang visited the site in the 7th century, but the only contemporary activity he mentioned was two old Buddhist monasteries that still had active monastic communities; other than that, he only wrote about Rajgir&#x27;s ancient past. He attributed almost all the religious monuments he saw to Bimbisara or Ashoka and did not mention any contemporary patrons or building activity. This stands in stark contrast to his descriptions of Nalanda and Bodh Gaya, which both contain reference to events that took place either during his own lifetime or in the recent past. (For example, he referred to Nalanda&#x27;s alleged vandalism by Shashanka and restoration under Purnavarmana, as well as patronage at Bodh Gaya by the Gupta rulers Kumaragupta I [aka Shakraditya], Budhagupta, and Narasimhagupta [aka Baladitya].) Yijing&#x27;s account from later in the 7th century also refers only to Rajgir&#x27;s ancient past. Kakoli Ray describes the impression of Rajgir from these accounts as a place &quot;[living] in its own past, haloed by sacred memory and association but uncared for by [their] contemporaries.&quot;

Rajgir was hardly abandoned, though – in fact, the first clear evidence of Hindu activity dates from this period, during the 5th century. The Maniyar &quot;maṭha&quot;, variously identified as a Shiva temple or a Naga shrine, dates from this period, although it appears to have been built on the site of an older structure dating back to the early centuries BCE. Some ceramic and sculptural finds from the site are stylistically dated to later, with isolated sculptures dated as late as the 7th through 9th centuries, indicating that Hindu worship continued at the site throughout that period. Although Buddhist activity does seem to have dwindled significantly at Rajgir during this period, some Buddhist finds are attributed to as late as the 10th through 12th centuries. Some of these may have been made at Nalanda before being transported to Rajgir. Meanwhile, Rajgir never seems to have lost importance for Jains, who continued to actively patronise the site. A ruined Jain temple on the Vaibhara hill probably dates from the 5th century, while an image of Rishabhanatha donated by the acharya Vasantanandi is dated to the 8th or 9th century.

Rajgir also kept political significance during this period, as the capital of a vishaya in Magadha bhukti attested during the Gupta and Pala periods. An inscribed copper seal that once belonged to the Rajgir vishaya&#x27;s guild of blacksmiths and carpenters, palaeographically dated to perhaps the 5th century, was found at Rajgir, indicating a certain level of commercial organisation at Rajgir during this period.

==Geography and climate==
The modern town of Rajgir lies just to the north of the Rajgir Hills, an isolated pair of parallel ridges that rise sharply up from the flat surrounding plains. The ancient site of Rajgir was located in the narrow valley between the two sets of hills. Historically, Rajgir was thought of as lying between five hills, but different texts give them different names (the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; even gives two different lists of five names in the same chapter), making it difficult to identify the five hills with their modern counterparts. The modern names are Vaibhara, Vipula, Chaṭa, Shaila, Udaya, Sona, and Ratnagiri. Of these, Ratnagiri is the highest, at about 305 m.

Rajgir is known for its hot springs, which have held religious significance since ancient times. The best-known today is Brahmakuṇḍa, and there are several other springs in this area whose waters merge to form a stream. Another prominent spring is the Sūryakuṇḍa, which is part of a cluster of springs on the north side of the hills. Sūryakuṇḍa&#x27;s water is stagnant and murky and a favored habitat by frogs. Another major water feature in the area is the Panchane River (from &quot;Pañcānanā&quot;, &quot;having five mouths&quot;), which flows to the east of Rajgir.

Rajgir has a monsoon climate, with an annual rainfall of about 113 cm. Rainfall peaks in July and August.
* Summer temperature: maximum 44 °C (111.2 °F), minimum 20 °C (68 °F)
* Winter temperature: maximum 28 °C (82.4 °F), minimum 6 °C (42.8 °F)
* Rainfall: 1,860 mm (mid-June to mid-September)
* Dry/warm season: March to October

=== Rajgir Wildlife Sanctuary ===

The landscape of Rajgir or Pant WLS is uneven terrain enclosed by five hills; Ratnagiri, Vipulgiri, Vaibhagiri, Songiri and Udaygiri. It is situated in Nalanda Forest Division covering an area of 35.84 km2 under the Nalanda district administration. This wildlife sanctuary, notified in 1978, represents a remnant patch of forests nestled in the Rajgir hills within the south Gangetic Plain.

It is home to a number of wild animals including: mammals – blue bull (&quot;Boselaphus tragocamelus&quot;), chital or spotted deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;), Indian crested porcupine (&quot;Hystrix indica&quot;), small Indian civet (&quot;Viverricula indica&quot;), jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;); birds – painted spurfowl (&quot;Galloperdix lunulata&quot;), Eurasian thick knee (&quot;Burhinus oedicnemus&quot;), painted sandgrouse (&quot;Pterocles indicus&quot;); reptiles and amphibians – Bengal monitor (&quot;Varanus bengalensis&quot;), Indian bullfrog (&quot;Hoplobatrachus tigerinus&quot;), Jerdon&#x27;s bullfrog (&quot;Hoplobatrachus crassus&quot;), ornate narrow-mouthed frog (&quot;Microhyla ornata&quot;), and Indian tree frog (&quot;Polypedates maculatus&quot;).

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to 2011 Indian Census, Rajgir had a total population of 41,587, of which 21,869 were males and 19,718 were females. The population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 6,922. The total number of literates in Rajgir was 24,121, which constituted 58.0% of the population with male literacy of 65.4% and female literacy of 49.8%. The effective literacy rate of the 7+ population of Rajgir was 69.6%, of which the male literacy rate was 78.1% and the female literacy rate was 60.1%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 11,724 and 42 respectively. Rajgir had 7030 households in 2011.

===Religion===
The town is also notable in Jainism and Buddhism. It was the birthplace of the 20th Jain Tirthankar Munisuvrata, and is closely associated with the Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. Both Mahavira and Buddha taught their beliefs in Rajgir during the 6th and 5th century BC, and the Buddha was offered a forest monastery here by the king Bimbisara. As such, the city of Rajgir became one of the Buddha&#x27;s most important preaching locations. 

==Tourism==
The main tourist attractions include the ancient city walls from Ajatashatru&#x27;s period, Bimbisar&#x27;s Jail, Jarasandh&#x27;s Akhara, Gridhra-kuta, (&#x27;Hill of the Vultures&#x27;), Son Bhandar Caves and the Jain temples on the five peaks.
Another major attraction is the peace pagoda, &quot;Vishwa Shanti Stupa&quot;, built-in 1969, one of the 80 peace pagodas in the world, to spread the message of peace and non-violence. It is the oldest peace pagoda in India. The rope-way that leads to it is another attraction, which was gifted by Japanese spiritual leader Fuji Guruji in the 1960s.

A new rope way has been planned.

Rajgir has hot water springs, locally known as &quot;Brahmakund&quot;, a sacred place for Hindus where water from seven different springs (&quot;Saptarshi&quot;) merge and is notable for its healing effects. 

There is a Japanese temple beside the Venu Vana, an artificial forest with historical associations to Buddha and the kings of the region. Other places of interest include the Rajgir Heritage Museum, the Sariputta Stupa, Ghora Katora Lake, and the Rajgir glass bridge.
The Son Bhandar caves are situated in Rajgir. The caves are concerned with Jainism and are considered to belong to 3–4 century AD. After Cunningham&#x27;s inspection, several scholars visited this place and some had opinions to concern with Buddhism. After some time all Buddhism connections were refused because of an inscription found on the southern wall of a cave. According to this inscription these caves were built by inspiration of a Jain Muni Vair for Jain ascetics. Sculptures of Teerthankaras were also carved in these caves. From an architectural aspect; these caves are analogous to Nagarjuni cave and Barabar Caves caves of Mauryan era. Therefore, it can be concluded that construction time should not differ much from the above-mentioned caves. 

These caves should be related to Digambar sect of Jainism as Xuanzang wrote in his book about Vaibhar Hill of Rajgir that the place was occupied by Digambar Jain monks for meditation purposes. After some centuries these caves were converted by Hindus as Vishnu sculpture was also found from the mound of a cave. 

Makhdum Kund, also recognised as Dargah-e-Makhdoomiya is a sacred site situated in Rajgir. Renowned for its thermal spring and the tomb of Makhdoom Syed Ghulam Ali, as well as the prayer space of Sharfuddin Yahya Maneri, it holds significance for pilgrims and visitors alike.
The thermal spring, dating back approximately 800 years, attracts numerous visitors who utilise it for ablution (Wudu) and bathing purposes. The Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar also took bath here in his childhood.

<text>Maria Catherina van der Linden-Swanenburg (9 September 1839 – 11 April 1915) was a Dutch serial killer who murdered at least 27 people and was suspected of killing more than 90 people.

== Early life ==
Maria Swanenburg was the daughter of Clemens Swanenburg and Johanna Dingjan. After Swanenburg&#x27;s first two daughters died at a young age, she married Johannes van der Linden on 13 May 1868. The result of this marriage was five sons and two daughters. The marriage lasted until 29 January 1886.

Her nickname was &quot;Goeie Mie&quot; (&quot;Good Mie&quot;), bestowed because of her amiable, neighbourly assistance with babysitting and taking care of the poor, sick, and elderly in Leiden, where she herself lived.

== Murders ==
Her first victim was her mother Johanna, in 1880; not long thereafter, she poisoned her father, Clemens.

It was established with certainty that Swanenburg poisoned at least 102 people with arsenic between 1880 and 1883. Twenty-seven of her victims died, of whom 16 were her relatives. The investigation included more than 90 suspicious deaths. 45 survivors sustained chronic health issues after having ingested the poison.

Swanenburg&#x27;s motive was the payout of her victims&#x27; insurance or their inheritance. She had secured most of the insurance policies herself.

=== Capture and imprisonment ===
Swanenburg was caught after she poisoned the Frankhuizen family in December 1883. Her trial began on 23 April 1885. Swanenburg was found guilty of having killed at least three victims, and she was sentenced to life imprisonment in a correctional facility, where she died in 1915.

<doc id="959887" wikidata="Q1501247" url="?curid=959887" title="River Lagan">
<text>The River Lagan (; Ulster Scots: &quot;Lagan Wattèr&quot;) is a major river in Northern Ireland which runs from the Slieve Croob mountain in County Down to Belfast where it enters Belfast Lough, an inlet of the Irish Sea. The Lagan forms much of the border between County Antrim and County Down in the east of Ulster. It rises as a stream near to the summit of Slieve Croob. It runs to Belfast through Dromara, Donaghcloney and Dromore. On the lower slopes of the mountain, it combines with a branch from Legananny Mountain, just opposite Slieve Croob. The river then turns east to Magheralin into a broad plain between the plateaus of Antrim and Down.

The river drains approximately 609 square km of agricultural land and flows to the Stranmillis Weir, from which point on it is estuarine. The catchment consists mainly of enriched agricultural grassland in the upper parts, with the lower section draining urban Belfast and Lisburn. There is one significant tributary, the Ravernet River, and there are several minor tributaries, including the Carryduff River, the River Farset and the Blackstaff River. Work is proceeding to restore a self-sustaining population of Atlantic salmon to the river.

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river called Λογια (&quot;Logia&quot;). The river name is thought to connect with Old Irish &quot;loeg&quot; (&quot;calf&quot;) and with *&quot;laks&quot; (&quot;salmon&quot;).

==The Lagan in Belfast==
The name Belfast originates from the Irish &quot;Béal Feirste&quot;, or the mouth of the Farset, the river on which the city was built and which flows into the Lagan. The Farset has been superseded by the River Lagan as the most important river. A section of the Farset is covered over by the city&#x27;s High Street.

===Laganside Corporation===
In 1989 the Laganside Corporation was established by the British government to redevelop the areas surrounding the Lagan in Belfast. Major developments of the Laganside Corporation along the river include the regeneration of the city&#x27;s former Gasworks, and the Lanyon Place development, which includes the Waterfront Hall.

One of the earliest and most important undertakings of the corporation was the Lagan Weir. Completed in 1994 at a cost of £14 million (equivalent to £ million in ), the weir controls the level of water upstream. One of the main functions of the weir was to reduce unsightly mud flats at low tide. This was mostly successful, but mud flats are still evident on the river. The weir is a series of large steel barriers which are raised as the tide retreats to keep the river at an artificially constant level. Dredging and aeration have increased water quality in the river.

===Sport===
The river is used by a number of rowing clubs, including Queen&#x27;s University Boat Club, Queen&#x27;s Ladies Boat Club, Methodist College Boat Club, Royal Belfast Academical Institution (RBAI) Rowing Club, Belfast Rowing Club (BRC) and Lagan Scullers Club. The Boathouses are all based between the Governors Bridge and the Stranmillis Weir.

==The Lagan in Lisburn==
Lisburn City Council built the Lagan Valley Island complex; a new headquarters for the council and an Arts Centre, wedding and conference facilities and a restaurant. Opened in 2001, the building is surrounded by the Lagan on one side and a channel linked to the river on the other.

==The Lagan Navigation==
In the late 19th century the Lagan Canal was built from Lough Neagh to Belfast, using some of the river as a navigable waterway and diverting water from other areas to supply separate canal sections. However, by the mid-20th century the route had fallen into disuse and was largely derelict. The M1 motorway (Northern Ireland) was built across a large section of the route. Currently, the section of the navigation&#x27;s towpath running from Lisburn to the centre of Belfast has been restored. A section of National Cycle Route 9, which will eventually link Belfast with Dublin, follows this towpath.

==Angling==
Atlantic salmon became extirpated in the River Lagan, which enters the Irish Sea through the port of Belfast, between 1750 and 1800, coinciding with a period of major population growth, industrialisation and the construction of a navigable waterway based on the river. The latest record of a salmon population in the river dates from 1744. From 1950 to 1990, water quality in the river improved as a result of improved sewage treatment, the Lagan Navigation was abandoned and fell into disuse, and many industrial effluents were diverted to sewer. A fish survey in the early 1970s found no fish at all in the urban reach of river through Belfast. Brown trout and several other species remained present in the upper reaches of the river throughout the worst of the downstream urban problems. The 1980s saw some recreational angling for non-migratory fish developing in the Belfast reaches of the river, and there were very occasional reports of migratory salmon or sea trout being seen in the river. In 1991, the first of a series of stockings took place and the first adult salmon returned to the Lagan in 1993.

==Wildlife==
Plants such as &quot;Elodea&quot; and others have been recorded from the Lagan. The river also hosts a population of otters and a variety of wildfowl.

<text>Garrick is a personal name, and is both a surname and a given name (usually masculine). 

The name has two identified points of origin. 

Garrick originated in Old English and/or French. Old English &quot;garrick&quot; means &quot;one who governs with a spear&quot;, or &quot;spear king&quot;. In French, &quot;garric&quot; is derived from an Occitan word meaning &quot;oak tree grove&quot;. 

Garrick is also an anglicised spelling and pronunciation of the Scottish name Garrioch. This variation originated in the Aberdeenshire area Garioch. The placename Garioch comes from the Gaelic word &quot;Gairbheach&quot;, meaning &quot;place of roughness&quot;. Examples of family members using Garrioch and Garrick can be seen on adjacent gravestones in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney.

<doc id="959907" wikidata="Q897767" url="?curid=959907" title="Brand X">
<text>Brand X were a British jazz fusion band formed in London in 1974. They were initially active until 1980, followed by reformations between 1992–1999 and 2016–2021. 

Despite sometimes being considered to be a Phil Collins side project (due to Collins&#x27; participation as drummer between 1975 and 1977 in between his commitments to Genesis), the band was in fact centred on a core composing/playing trio of John Goodsall (guitar), Percy Jones (bass) and Robin Lumley (keyboards), with Lumley also playing a prominent production role. Other members of the band at various times included Morris Pert, J. Peter Robinson, Kenwood Dennard, Chuck Burgi, John Giblin, Mike Clark, Frank Katz, Kenny Grohowski and Chris Clark.

Jones would ultimately remain the sole constant member throughout Brand X&#x27;s existence (both during the original 1970s run and throughout the assorted twenty-first century reunions), with Goodsall and Lumley playing a part in most of the albums and tours. Jones ended all Brand X activities in 2020, despite resistance from the band&#x27;s management and their attempts to revive the band with all-new personnel. Jones is now the sole surviving core member, with John Goodsall having died on 10 November 2021 and Robin Lumley having died on 9 March 2023.

==History==
===1974: Origins===

In 1974, Atomic Rooster guitarist John Goodsall plus fellow guitarist Pete Bonas, drummer John Dillon and percussionist/singer Phil Spinelli were carrying out jazz fusion jam sessions at Island Studios in London. Simultaneously, at London&#x27;s PSL studios, keyboard player Robin Lumley and bass guitarist Percy Jones were playing with the jam band Karass (which also featured members of the Keith Tippett band, Blodwyn Pig, Traffic and Atomic Rooster). Jones and Lumley were introduced to Bonas and Goodsall, who invited them to play at Island Studios, eventually forming a six-piece &quot;Island band&quot; salaried by Island Records under the guidance of A&amp;R man Danny Wilding. Following the departure of Dillon in 1975, the band attempted to recruit Bill Bruford before being introduced to Genesis drummer Phil Collins (at the time unsure about his future with Genesis following Peter Gabriel&#x27;s departure).

Newly christened Brand X (after Wilding wrote down &quot;Brand X&quot; to keep track of their activity on the studio calendar), the band began recording a debut album featuring Spinelli&#x27;s vocals in addition to the instrumental content. When the vocals were negatively received by Island management, Goodsall, Lumley, Jones and Collins began secretly rehearsing as an instrumental four-piece, subsequently parting company with Spinelli and Bonas. Recordings of the four-piece formed the foundation of what would become the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot;, recorded in September and October 1975 at Trident Studios with Jack Lancaster guesting on saxophone. At the behest of Collins, Genesis manager Tony Smith became Brand X&#x27;s manager and publisher (via his Hit &amp; Run company) and signed them to Genesis&#x27; record label Charisma Records, who bought out their deal with Island. Under this arrangement, Goodsall, Lumley and Jones were the legal members of the group; although Collins was nominally a member, both he and subsequent Brand X musicians were &quot;hired in&quot; via arrangements with Collins&#x27; own company and were thereby shielded from legal liabilities.

===1977–1978: Initial albums and tours===

Brand X played their first gigs with a series of low key warm-up shows in November and December 1975. In preparation for further gigs, the four were joined by Geoff Seopardi on percussion by December 1975. The band began a full-scale tour across the UK from February 1976, mainly on the college circuit. They had little in the way of funds, resorting to renting a synthesiser and PA system and operating with a small road crew, and often played support for the headlining act.
The band recorded their second album, &quot;Moroccan Roll&quot;, with percussionist Morris Pert added to the line-up. The album was released in April 1977 and peaked at No. 37 in the UK and No. 125 in the US. With Collins leaving the group for Genesis commitments, Kenwood Dennard of Pat Martino&#x27;s group was recruited in New York City in time for their 32-date US tour in May and June 1977. Collins briefly returned later in 1977 for a series of dates, including a spot at the tenth Crystal Palace Garden Party in London and the Fête de l&#x27;Humanité in Paris on the same day on a specially chartered plane, the latter attended by an estimated 200,000 people. &quot;Livestock&quot;, a live album culled from several shows (some with Collins and some with Dennard), was released in November 1977, and won the &quot;Best Live Recording&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; at the end of the same year.

Following the 1977 tour, Brand X parted company with Lumley by mutual consent: Lumley wished to concentrate on record production, and the band was now aiming to make music which would work better in the American jazz fusion market which had previously embraced Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Lumley&#x27;s replacement as keyboard player was J. Peter Robinson. The band also hired a new drummer, Chuck Burgi, with Morris Pert now adding electric piano to his own instrumental duties.

This line-up recorded the &quot;Masques&quot; album, which was released in 1978. It was the only Brand X album during the band&#x27;s original run without Phil Collins. Pert remained onboard for the subsequent tour, although Burgi did not: the band performed with a number of alternative live drummers. Goodsall was obliged to sit out part of the European and American tour due to a severe case of tendonitis, so Brand X brought in American session guitarist Mike Miller to cover for him in concert, although Goodsall continued as a member of the touring party (&quot;to monitor the comings and goings, and to keep an eye on the cash&quot;). Goodsall would later participate in certain shows on the 1978 tour, dependent on the state of his recovery and the performance anxieties relating to it.

In 1979, Goodsall was fully recovered and able to join the band for a follow-up American tour, now minus Pert but with Phil Collins back on drums after a two-year absence. Lumley returned to Brand X during the same year, becoming part of a dual keyboard team alongside Robinson.

===Double line-up, 1979===

Due to their deals with Charisma Records and Hit &amp; Run Publishing, Brand X had been able to enjoy a working lifestyle and tour support closer to that of a contemporary rock band than to that of a jazz band, including being able to take advantage of the services of Hipgnosis, whose artwork adorned the covers of their 1970s albums. Members have admitted that this facilitated &quot;outrageous, sometimes destructive behavior&quot;, as well as helping them to fund and schedule rehab treatment for John Goodsall&#x27;s &quot;severe (but functional)&quot; heroin addiction, which provided the band with another challenge.

Disappointing record sales, however, led to more external pressure from Charisma, Hit &amp; Run and the band&#x27;s American distributor Passport Records, all of whom (post-&quot;Masques&quot;) began pushing for the band to add songs and horn sections to their music to make it more commercially viable. This eventually led to Brand X beginning to operate with two line-ups during 1979. While Goodsall has stated that this was in order to cope with musician unavailability or scheduling problems, Jones cited his own battles with label and publisher demands, in particular those of Hit &amp; Run.

The double line-up began following two weeks of the existing line-up carrying out &quot;managerially-pressured&quot; rehearsals at Rupert Hines&#x27; Farmyard Studio. With Jones disgruntled and briefly absent (having been determined that Brand X should create music without &quot;pandering&quot; to external demands), Goodsall began working with bassist John Giblin (whom Jones would much later describe as having been &quot;brought in to fill a few parts which [Jones] had no interest in playing.&quot;) In order to pacify Charisma, Robin Lumley had obtained a favourable deal to rent Ringo Starr&#x27;s Startling Studios in Ascot and pledged to record two albums there during the time usually required for just one.

During the day, a line-up of Lumley, Goodsall, Phil Collins and John Giblin recorded material with a more vocally-orientated and &quot;rockier&quot; aspect; during the night a line-up of Goodsall, the returned Jones, Peter Robinson, and drummer Mike Clark (sometimes joined by Morris Pert) recorded in the ongoing less commercial Brand X style that Jones favoured. During this tense period, Goodsall held what would be described as &quot;a middle ground&quot; with his compositions and attempts to hold the group together by being the persistent element, while other group members who overlapped the sessions &quot;chose not to make waves&quot;. Jones has subsequently said that the results were &quot;schizophrenic&quot; and that &quot;there was really no another solution, apart from me to concede to Hit &amp; Run. I have thought about the situation since and I probably would have done the same thing again. It became a musical marketing construct, actually. As for whether it worked, the proof was in the pudding.&quot;

The Startling Studios sessions produced two immediate albums: 1979&#x27;s &quot;Product&quot; and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Do They Hurt?&quot;. &quot;Product&quot; also generated a single, &quot;Don’t Make Waves&quot; - composed by Goodsall and sung by Collins (and inspired by the difficult band politics of the time). It charted in both the UK and the USA. A concert line-up of Goodsall, Jones, Collins, Lumley, and Robinson embarked on a world tour, after which Collins departed for the final time (continuing with Genesis and eventually launching a solo career). Clark returned to the drum stool for the final Brand X tours of the UK in April and May 1980 and in 1981 (for which they co-headlined with Bruford): for these tours, Lumley alternated with Robinson as the keyboard player.

===Band splits, 1981===

Brand X dissolved in 1981, with Robin Lumley stating that &quot;there were no hard feelings; we just ran out of music to write together.&quot; Other issues affecting the band, however, included the impact of a long-running legal case between Charisma and Island Records, plus the release of Goodsall and Jones from Hit &amp; Run management contracts. Percy Jones relocated to New York City, while John Goodsall moved to Los Angeles to become a session musician. Lumley returned to production, as well as forming another jazz-rock band including former Brand X percussionist Morris Pert. J. Peter Robinson would continue with a career as session keyboard player, arranger and eventually film music composer. Mike Clark would continue his work as a jazz drummer.

A final Brand X album from this period, &quot;Is There Anything About?&quot;, would be released in 1982. This consisted of rough mixes and demos from the Startling Studios double-line-up sessions, and was put together by Lumsley at the behest of Charisma Records. The band have subsequently described it as &quot;leftover compositions&quot; and &quot;mostly rubbish&quot;.

===1992–2020: Reunions===

In 1992, Jones was planning a solo album on the Ozone Records label with contributions from drummer Frank Katz, and invited Goodsall to contribute guitar parts. At the record label&#x27;s behest (and to Jones and Goodsall&#x27;s reluctance) the project was reconceived as a Brand X reunion. An album &quot;X-Communication&quot; was assembled &quot;hastily&quot;, with Jones playing keyboards as well as bass, and with the band&#x27;s old ally Danny Wilding contributing flute: it was released in 1992, to mixed reviews, and disappointing commercial returns. The band toured, mostly on the West Coast of the US, where John Goodsall lived. A compilation album &quot;The Plot Thins: A History of Brand X&quot; was released in 1992 to take advantage of the reunion.

In 1997, the Jones/Goodsall/Katz line-up was reactivated to record and tour the album &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;. Keyboard player Franz Pusch contributed to the album, as did vibraphonist Marc Wagnon (Jones&#x27; bandmate in Tunnels), and Danny Wilding on flute. Gong drummer Pierre Moerlen replaced Katz for the &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; tour. &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; would prove to be the last album of new Brand X material.

2012 saw an abortive attempt to reunite the band with Goodsall, Jones and keyboard player David Sancious. The management for this line-up were unable to organise the necessary concerts and touring, resulting in Sancious withdrawing. For a while, former Yes/Moody Blues keyboard player Patrick Moraz was in the frame to replace Sancious, but continuing problems in arranging concerts resulted in this line-up foundering as well.

The band reunited once more in July 2016 with a line-up of Goodsall, Jones and Kenwood Dennard joined by keyboard player Chris Clark and percussionist/producer Scott Weinberger (with Dennard later replaced by Kenny Grohowski).

===2020–present day: Final split and aftermath===

After bassist Percy Jones refused to continue performing live with Brand X in 2020, Jeff Berlin was briefly announced as his replacement, but quickly backed out. Jones says that Berlin, and other bassists, refused offers to join Brand X because they were warned about unethical behavior of management.

Following John Goodsall&#x27;s death in November 2021, Percy Jones and Robin Lumley confirmed on Facebook on 14 November that the Brand X name was now officially retired, and that no further activity would be done under that name. In a 2022 interview, Jones explained that he left the band due to tensions with management and percussionist Scott Weinberger. Jones alleges that the band&#x27;s management has used the Brand X Facebook account to misrepresent the band&#x27;s status following Goodsall&#x27;s death and the official retirement of the name. The recent history of the band is explained on their official website which is endorsed by Jones.

<text>Melbourne tram route 96 is operated by Yarra Trams on the Melbourne tram network from East Brunswick to St Kilda Beach. The 13.9 kilometre route is operated out of Southbank and Preston depots with C2 and E class trams.

==History==
Part of the route opened as a cable tram line operated by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company on 30 August 1887, operating along Bourke and Nicholson Streets. It operated until 26 October 1940, when the Bourke Street cable lines were abandoned by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) in favour of double decker buses. The Bourke Street cable lines were the last cable trams to operate in Melbourne.

The MMTB, unhappy with the performance of the buses, decided to reinstate trams when the buses reached life expiry, and rebuilt the tram tracks of the cable car routes. Trams on the route to East Preston (predecessor to the modern 86) started on 26 June 1955, while trams to Brunswick East began operating on 8 April 1956 as route 96.

The W7 class trams were built for running on these two lines. The new Z class trams first ran on route 96 in June 1975.

In the 1980s, it was decided to close the short St Kilda and Port Melbourne railway lines and convert them to &#x27;light rail&#x27;. The tracks along Bourke Street were taken round into Spencer Street, south along Clarendon Street to then turn into the rail reservation to St Kilda along the former St Kilda railway line. At the former terminus at St Kilda Station, the line ran past the station building, and turned into Fitzroy Street, joining existing lines round The Esplanade to terminate in Acland Street. The first trams ran on 20 November 1987. The broad gauge railway track was replaced with standard gauge , and the overhead voltage was reduced from 1500 V DC to 600 V DC. Low platforms were built adjacent to the former stations&#x27; platforms, with the station buildings put to other uses.

With the closure of North Fitzroy depot on 19 December 1993, its route 96 duties were transferred to South Melbourne depot.

After the merger of the M&gt;Tram network with Yarra Trams in 2004, most D2 class trams were transferred from Malvern depot to Southbank depot to help alleviate the congestion on the route. After the introduction of these low floor Siemens Combino trams on the route, accessible stops were built on Bourke Street, Fitzroy Street and St Kilda Esplanade, increasing customer safety and comfort.

In response to frequent overcrowding on the tram system in 2008, the state government leased new C2 class trams from Mulhouse, France specifically to run the route. The first of these new trams began operation on 11 June 2008 with the nickname &quot;Bumble Bee 1&quot;. In November 2013, the first E class trams entered service on the route. In January 2016, Route 96 began operating through the night on Fridays and Saturdays as part of the Night Network.

In July 2023, PTV began trialling a new NaviLens information system for those with vision impairments on Route 96.

== Route 96 Project ==
On 17 April 2012, it was announced that Route 96 would become the focus of tram upgrades to transform it from a tramway to a light rail system; a &quot;model&quot; for how Melbourne&#x27;s tram network should operate. The Route 96 Project superseded a similar project of the previous government, Tram 109.

The proposed aims of the project are:
*Providing level access stops along the entire route
*Upgraded termini at Blyth Street, East Brunswick, and Acland Street, St Kilda
*Segregation treatments to better separate low-floor trams from traffic
*Improved priority for low-floor trams at traffic lights
*Improved customer information

The objectives are to:
*Increase access to trams and safety for customers through providing improved infrastructure and information
*Improve tram reliability and efficiency through increased priority and accessible infrastructure 
*Ensure better utilisation of the road network with a focus on moving people 
*Design a full route of enhancements to demonstrate the benefits of a modern light rail system in Melbourne conditions, compared with a traditional tram network.

In mid-2013, the proposed changes were released to the public. They involved an eventual segregation of trams from traffic along nearly the entire route, and the upgrade of all stops to level access to improve passenger flow and make the network disability-compliant. On Nicholson Street, all on-street parking would eventually be removed to create dedicated tram lanes where it is illegal for cars to drive. &quot;Easy-access stops&quot; (level access by raising the road to footpath level) would be constructed between Blyth Street and Brunswick Road, while centre island superstops would be constructed between Brunswick Road and the CBD.

The Batman Park (previously the World Trade Centre) and Clarendon Street Junction stops in South Melbourne would be redesigned with a separate bay for the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant, while in St Kilda, some parts of Acland Street would be closed to cars in favour of widened footpaths, pedestrian plazas and tram right of way.

The project has received strong support from commuters, urban planners and public transport advocates, while there have been concerns from shop owners along the route that a loss of on-street parking will negatively affect business.

Work completed as at October 2018 has included:

*new Blyth Street terminus headshunt at the northern end in July 2015
*new Clarendon Street Junction stop in January 2016
*new Acland Street terminus in December 2016
*stop upgrades at Johnston Street, Moor street and Melbourne Museum in September 2018 along with stop removal at Hoddle St and Hanover street

==Route==

Route 96 runs from the terminus at Blyth Street, East Brunswick, travelling south on Nicholson Street through the suburbs of Carlton North, Fitzroy North, Carlton and Fitzroy, passing the Royal Exhibition Building and Melbourne Museum. It enters the CBD on Spring Street turning right into Bourke Street at Parliament House, travels through the Bourke Street Mall and turns left into Spencer Street, passing Southern Cross station. It crosses the Yarra River and enters Southbank on Clarendon Street before passing through the suburbs of South Melbourne, Albert Park, Middle Park and St Kilda on a right-of-way track. The tram line exits the private right-of-way and travels along Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade to Acland Street, St Kilda where it terminates.

==Operation==

Route 96 is operated out of Southbank and Preston depots with C2 and E class trams. Occasionally, A class trams are also used.

==Special events and services==
Several annual events affect the usual services along route 96:
*Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix - most services terminate at Middle Park and are replaced with buses
*RMIT University exams - (held at Melbourne Sports &amp; Aquatic Centre) additional services 
*St Kilda Festival - additional services but terminate at St Kilda station

==In popular culture==
Route 96 is featured in the Courtney Barnett song Elevator Operator.

<doc id="959918" wikidata="Q685664" url="?curid=959918" title="Fu Jen Catholic University">
<text>Fu Jen Catholic University (FJU, FJCU or Fu Jen; or ) is a private Catholic university in Xinzhuang, New Taipei City, Taiwan. The university was founded in 1925 in Beijing at the request of Pope Pius XI and re-established in Taiwan in 1961 at the request of Pope John XXIII. 

Fu Jen has consists of twelve colleges and schools, among which are several of Taiwan&#x27;s first or only academic units in Italian language, info-management, museology, religious studies, philosophy. The campus is served by Fu Jen University Station, Taiwan&#x27;s first metro station named after a university.

Fu Jen is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit-affiliated institution of higher education in the Sinophone world, under the direct authority of the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Holy See. It is also a non-state actor of Track II diplomacy in the Holy See–Taiwan relations. Therefore, Fu Jen has special importance internationally and is known for its strong ties with the Roman Curia. In the past nearly one hundred years of history, the Benedictine, the Verbites, and the Jesuits from all over the world have participated in the management of the university.

The university has the nation&#x27;s first business school there with AACSB accreditation and also the medical college was the earliest to promote PBL as pedagogy for medical education. Fu Jen alumni include Premier Lin Chuan, former First Lady of China Wang Guangmei, and politicians in the Legislative Yuan.
==History==
===Early history===
The institution was originally established in Beijing in 1925 by the Benedictines of St. Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at the request of the Holy See, with Archabbot Aurelius Stehle serving as chancellor. Fu Jen, then commonly known as the Catholic University of Peking, was itself a successor to the Fu Jen Academy (), which was created through the efforts of Catholic scholars Ma Xiangbo and Ying Lianzhi. The university&#x27;s first president (1925–1927) was the American missionary George Barry O&#x27;Toole, OSB. He was succeeded by Chen Yuan, a Chinese Protestant and renowned historian, who remained university president until the school&#x27;s forced closure by the Chinese Communist government in 1952.

In 1933 the Benedictines in the United States, in the midst of the Great Depression, were no longer able to sustain Fu Jen&#x27;s mission. Administration of the university passed to the Society of the Divine Word in Germany. Its affiliation with Germany, an ally of Imperial Japan, helped protect university personnel from extreme brutality inflicted elsewhere by occupying Imperial Japanese soldiers during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

===After World War II===

Since the university&#x27;s operation had not been interrupted by the war, it quickly became one of China&#x27;s top science programs. Well-known scientists such as Chien Shih-Liang taught at Fu Jen, and graduates such as Lee C. Teng and Wang Guangmei became famous alumni. On December 24, 1945, Thomas Tien Ken-sin, the university chairman, was made a cardinal. The following year, the School of Agriculture was added and preparations for the School of Medicine began. Also in the same year, the first Taiwan Alumni Association of Fu Jen was established in Dadu, Taichung, Taiwan.

After the Communists assumed power in China in 1949, religious organisations, including the Catholic Church, began to be systematically repressed. In 1952 this intensified and the government merged Fu Jen with the Beijing Normal University, Peking University, Renmin University, China University of Political Science and Law, and Central University of Finance and Economics. Under Mao Zedong&#x27;s arrangement, Chen Yuan, the former president of Fu Jen, was transferred to the Normal University as the new president.

===Cold War era===
Although the Taiwan Provincial Government promised to donate land near Yuanshan Area in Taipei in 1948 to serve as the school site for Fu Jen to move to Taiwan, the Roman headquarters of the Society of the Divine Word soon ordered the suspension of all activities. The following year, the university&#x27;s American representative Rev. Ralph Thyken, S.V.D. came to Tokyo, Japan, to prepare for the establishment of a new Nagoya Catholic University, which is now Nanzan University. Until the Holy See formally ordered the university&#x27;s re-establishment in Taiwan, the history of Fu Jen was interrupted for about ten years.

Fu Jen Catholic University was re-established in 1961 in Taiwan, and Paul Yu Pin, the former Ordinary of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nanjing, was appointed as the new president by Pope John XXIII. The new school opened under the auspices of the Chinese Regional Bishops&#x27; Conference, the Society of Jesus, and the Society of the Divine Word.

The new Fu Jen&#x27;s academics sprouted from Western history, medieval philosophy, Christian thought, and European languages. It is the only comprehensive university in Taiwan that fully integrates Western thought, history, language, religion, and art. Since the 1960s, the university&#x27;s philosophical tradition has been Scholasticism and Paul Yu Pin&#x27;s &quot;Three Kinds of Knowing&quot; (三知論), focusing on the development of a Catholic philosophy that incorporates Confucianism and opposing the &quot;relativism hegemony.&quot;

During the thirty years of the Cold War, many Western priests and nuns were sent to teach at the university and imported advanced scholarship into Taiwan. Many professors have been commended for this in recent years, such as Daniel Ross from the United States, Leopoldo Vicente from Spain, Marcina Stawasz from Poland, etc.

===Modern era===
In 1997, the Nobel Prize winner 14th Dalai Lama came to Fu Jen to hold a Dharma promotion conference (lecture) and held talks with Taiwan Governor James Soong (Taiwan&#x27;s second most powerful person) in the university president’s office.
Fu Jen has expanded rapidly since the 1990s. The number of students and social influence has long maintained the top five in the country, and the number of colleges has been closely following the National Taiwan University. So far in the 21st century, the university has since grown to comprise twelve colleges and schools and a hospital. In 2001, Fu Jen has been the first college in Taiwan that actively reduces tuition and fees.

Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital was opened in September 2017. The College of Medicine can be used as a conduit for cooperation between different academic disciplines, and assume a leading role in bringing together the colleges of biotechnology, chemistry, physics, engineering, management, and foreign languages. The establishment of a completely new curriculum and unique program will include training in hospital management and medical translation, research in laser technology and biotechnology, integration of Western and Chinese medicine, and robotic surgery.

==Ideal and governance==
The university motto, 真、善、美、聖 (&quot;Veritas, Bonitas, Pulchritudo, Sanctitas&quot; in Latin), expresses four ideals: truth, goodness, beauty and sanctity.

The laurel wreath symbolizes honor and peace while the twelve stars signify the Virgin Mary. The cross represents the Christian faith. The two colors on the shield suggest Christ&#x27;s dual nature as the rounded shape of the shield recalls the Sacred Heart. The Latin words on the banner beneath the emblem, the university motto, express the four ideals of the university while the three folds of the banner suggest the Trinity.

Based on the Christian faith, the university president clearly supports the abolition of the death penalty, opposes abortion, and opposes the utilitarianization of higher education.

== Impact ==

Relying on the authority of the Vatican and the Society of the Divine Word, Fu Jen, then known as the Catholic University of Peking, was the only university in Beijing that was not taken over and controlled by Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the white terror period of the cold war, Fu Jen was able to prevent the Kuomintang regime from interfering in school affairs and protect the students&#x27; freedom of speech under the serious concern of the Secretariat of State (Holy See).

Fu Jen Catholic University belongs to the International Federation of Catholic Universities (IFCU) under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). After the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 came into effect in 1971, Fu Jen is the only university in Taiwan that has continuously participated in UNESCO for a long time. In the official Holy See–Taiwan relations, the university has repeatedly promoted substantial exchanges between the two countries. All the traditional Taiwanese ambassadors to the Holy See will be awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Fu Jen after leaving office. All the papal nuncio in Taiwan will also participate in the annual university opening ceremony.

The appointment and removal of the post of Fu Jen university president is a matter of inquiry by the Secretary of State of the Holy See, and has been compared with the membership of the United Nations of the Republic of China (Taiwan). The issue of the internal reorganization of Fu Jen has also widely affected the intervention of the Ministry of Education of the two countries and the papal nuncio to Taiwan.

The chairman or the president of the university has always accompanied the president of Taiwan to visit the Holy See. In 2005, under the intervention of Fu Jen, the seat of the Taiwanese president was placed in the first row of heads of state, ahead of the US Vice President Dick Cheney and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In 2013, the university further designated the products of the Fu Jen alumni&#x27;s enterprise Franz-porcelains as the official national gift, which were presented to Pope Francis and the retired Pope Benedict XVI respectively.

<text>Steel River Blues is a British television drama series, created by Patrick Harbinson, that was first broadcast in September 2004 on ITV. Produced by Ken Horn, the series follows the working and private lives of a group of firefighters, known as Blue Watch, who are based in Middlesbrough. Critics were quick to dub the series &quot;Middlesbrough&#x27;s Burning&quot; or &quot;Teesside&#x27;s Burning&quot;, after the popular fire-fighting drama that preceded it, &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, yet there were very few similarities between the two, apart from them being about the business of firefighting.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Steel River Blues&quot; was an ensemble drama without any single starring part, though perhaps the best-known actor was Daniel Casey, who was previously a co-star in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. Other stars included Joanne Farrell, Stuart Graham, Daniel Ainsleigh and Satnam Bhogal. The series title music was an original composition performed by Middlesbrough-born singer-songwriter Chris Rea. It was announced in January 2005 that the series would not be recommissioned due to low viewing figures. Subsequently, the series has never been released on DVD.

<text>Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen and published in a book of the same name. GTD is described as a time management system. Allen states &quot;there is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done&quot;.

The GTD method rests on the idea of moving all items of interest, relevant information, issues, tasks and projects out of one&#x27;s mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items with &quot;known time limits&quot;. This allows one&#x27;s attention to focus on taking action on each task listed in an external record, instead of recalling them intuitively.

First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in 2015 to reflect the changes in information technology during the preceding decade.

== Themes ==
Allen first demonstrates stress reduction from the method with the following exercise, centered on a task that has an unclear outcome or whose next action is not defined. Allen calls these sources of stress &quot;open loops&quot;, &quot;incompletes&quot;, or &quot;stuff&quot;.
#The most annoying, distracting, or interesting task is chosen, and defined as an &quot;incomplete&quot;.
# A description of the successful outcome of the &quot;incomplete&quot; is written down in one sentence, along with the criteria by which the task will be considered completed.
# The next step required to approach completion of the task is written down.
# A self-assessment is made of the emotions experienced after completing the steps of this process.
He claims stress can be reduced and productivity increased by putting reminders about everything one is not working on into a trusted system external to one&#x27;s mind. In this way, one can work on the task at hand without distraction from the &quot;incompletes&quot;. The system in GTD requires one to have the following tools within easy reach:
*An inbox
* A trash can
* A filing system for reference material
* Several lists (detailed below)
* A calendar (either a paper-based or digital calendar)

These tools can be physical or electronic as appropriate (e.g., a physical &quot;in&quot; tray or an email inbox). Then, as &quot;stuff&quot; enters one&#x27;s life, it is captured in these tools and processed with the following workflow.

=== Workflow ===

The GTD workflow consists of five stages. The workflow is driven by five steps (numbered on the top-left in the diagram on the right): capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. (The first edition used the names collect, process, organize, plan, and do; the descriptions of the stages are similar in both editions). Once all the material (&quot;stuff&quot;) is captured (or collected) in the inbox, each item is clarified and organized by asking and answering questions about each item in turn as shown in the black boxes in the logic tree diagram. As a result, items end up in one of the eight oval end points in the diagram:
* in the trash
* on the someday/maybe list
* in a neat reference filing system
* on a list of tasks, with the outcome and next action defined if the &quot;incomplete&quot; is a &quot;project&quot; (i.e., if it will require two or more steps to complete it)
* immediately completed and checked off if it can be completed in under two minutes
* delegated to someone else and, if one wants a reminder to follow up, added to a &quot;waiting for&quot; list
* on a context-based &quot;next action&quot; list if there is only one step to complete it
* on one&#x27;s calendar
Empty one&#x27;s inbox or inboxes daily or at least weekly (&quot;in&quot; to empty). Do not use one&#x27;s inbox as a &quot;to do&quot; list. Do not put clarified items back into the inbox. Emptying one&#x27;s inbox does not mean finishing everything. It just means applying the &quot;capture, clarify, organize&quot; steps to all one&#x27;s &quot;stuff&quot;.

Next, reflection (termed planning in the first edition) occurs. Multi-step projects identified above are assigned a desired outcome and a single &quot;next action&quot;. Finally, a task from one&#x27;s task list is worked on (&quot;engage&quot; in the 2nd edition, &quot;do&quot; in the 1st edition) unless the calendar dictates otherwise. One selects which task to work on next by considering where one is (i.e., the &quot;context&quot;, such as at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at one&#x27;s computer, with a particular person), time available, energy available, and priority.

=== Implementation ===
Because hardware and software is changing so rapidly, GTD is deliberately technologically neutral. (In fact, Allen advises people to start with a paper-based system.) Many task management tools claim to implement GTD methodology and Allen maintains a list of some technology that has been adopted in or designed for GTD. Some are designated &quot;GTD Enabled&quot;, meaning Allen was involved in the design.

=== Perspective ===
Allen emphasizes two key elements of GTD—&quot;control&quot; and &quot;perspective&quot;. The workflow is the center of the control aspect. The goal of the control processes in GTD is to get everything except the current task out of one&#x27;s head and into this trusted system external to one&#x27;s mind. He borrows a simile used in martial arts termed &quot;mind like water&quot;. When a small object is thrown into a pool of water, the water responds appropriately with a small splash followed by quiescence. When a large object is thrown in the water again responds appropriately with a large splash followed by quiescence. The opposite of &quot;mind like water&quot; is a mind that never returns to quiescence but remains continually stressed by every input. With a trusted system and &quot;mind like water&quot; one can have a better perspective on one&#x27;s life. Allen recommends reflection from six levels, called &quot;Horizons of Focus&quot;:
* Horizon 5: Life
* Horizon 4: Long-term visions
* Horizon 3: 1–2 year goals
* Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
* Horizon 1: Current projects
* Ground: Current actions

Unlike some theories, which focus on goal-setting, GTD works in the opposite direction. Allen argues that it is often difficult for individuals to focus on big picture goals if they cannot sufficiently control the day-to-day tasks that they frequently must face. By developing and using the trusted system that deals with day-to-day inputs, an individual can free up mental space to begin moving up to the next level.

Allen recommends scheduling a weekly review, reflecting on the six different levels. The perspective gained from these reviews should drive one&#x27;s priorities at the project level. Priorities at the project level in turn determine the priority of the individual tasks and commitments gathered during the workflow process. During a weekly review, determine the context for the tasks and put each task on its appropriate list. An example of grouping together similar tasks would be making a list of outstanding telephone calls, or the tasks/errands to perform while out shopping. Context lists can be defined by the set of tools available or by the presence of individuals or groups for whom one has items to discuss or present.

=== Summary ===
GTD is based on storing, tracking, and retrieving the information related to each thing that needs to get done. Mental blocks we encounter are caused by insufficient &#x27;front-end&#x27; planning. This involves thinking in advance, and generating a series of actions which can later be undertaken without further planning. The mind&#x27;s &quot;reminder system&quot; is inefficient and seldom (or too often) reminds us of what we need to do at the time and place when we can do it. Consequently, the &quot;next actions&quot; stored by context in the &quot;trusted system&quot; act as an external support which ensures that we are presented with the right reminders at the right time. As GTD relies on external reminders, it can be seen as an application of the theories of distributed cognition or the extended mind.

== Reception ==
In 2004, James Fallows in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described GTD&#x27;s main promise as not only allowing the practitioner to do more work but to feel less anxious about what they can and cannot do. 

In 2005, &quot;Wired&quot; called GTD a &quot;new cult for the info age&quot;, describing the enthusiasm for this method among information technology and knowledge workers as a kind of cult following. Allen&#x27;s ideas have also been popularized through &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; (Stern referenced it daily throughout 2012&#x27;s summer) and the Internet, especially via blogs such as 43 Folders, Lifehacker, and The Simple Dollar.

In 2005, Ben Hammersley interviewed David Allen for &quot;The Guardian&quot; article titled &quot;Meet the man who can bring order to your universe&quot;, saying: &quot;For me, as with the hundreds of thousands around the world who press the book into their friends&#x27; hands with fire in their eyes, Allen&#x27;s ideas are nothing short of life-changing&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; the self-help business book of its time.

In 2007, &quot;Wired&quot; ran another article about GTD and Allen, quoting him as saying &quot;the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission ... to simplify a complex event, you need a complex system&quot;.

A 2008 paper in the journal &quot;Long Range Planning&quot; by Francis Heylighen and Clément Vidal of the Free University of Brussels showed &quot;recent insights in psychology and cognitive science support and extend GTD&#x27;s recommendations&quot;.

<doc id="959930" wikidata="Q612051" url="?curid=959930" title="The Curse of Peladon">
<text>The Curse of Peladon is the second serial of the ninth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 29 January to 19 February 1972.

The serial is set on the superstitious and mineral-rich planet Peladon. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and his travelling companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) discover the High Priest Hepesh (Geoffrey Toone) conspiring to stop Peladon from joining the Galactic Federation so that the old ways on the planet are preserved.

==Plot==
The planet Peladon, led by its young king Peladon, is on the verge of joining the Galactic Federation, their delegates ready to deliberate and take a final vote. High Priest Hepesh is opposed, warning that the curse of Aggedor the Royal Beast of Peladon will visit doom upon them.

The TARDIS materialises on the edge of a cliff below the castle. The Third Doctor and Jo barely leave the ship before it tumbles over the edge of the cliff; they climb to the castle to get help.

Peladon asks for Hepesh&#x27;s support to join the Federation, but Hepesh does not trust the aliens. The Doctor and Jo are discovered by palace guards, who take them to the throne room where the delegates are gathered: Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, and Lord Izlyr and Ssorg of the Ice Warriors. The Doctor is mistaken for the delegate from Earth. He introduces Jo as &quot;Princess Josephine of TARDIS&quot;, a neutral royal observer from Earth. Several unusual accidents affecting the delegates lead The Doctor to suspect the Ice Warriors.

Exploring the tunnels under the palace, the Doctor runs into, and flees from, the creature known as Aggedor. Entering the beast&#x27;s shrine room, he is discovered by Hepesh. Hepesh accuses the Doctor of sacrilege, who must endure trial by combat, a duel to the death with the royal champion. Later, in the Doctor&#x27;s cell, Hepesh helps him escape, only to encounter Aggedor again, only this time he calms the beast with a hypnotic device. 

The Doctor tries to tell Peladon about the beast, but Hepesh again orders that he be taken away to face the royal champion, who is defeated, the Doctor also sparing his life. Arcturus tries to kill the Doctor but is shot by Ssorg. It is revealed that Hepesh, his accomplice, tried to frame the Ice Warriors, and trained Aggedor to maintain superstition, having made an agreement with Arcturus over Peladon&#x27;s mineral deposits. The vote for intervention carries unanimously, but the delegates cannot communicate with their ships. Hepesh&#x27;s forces take the throne room and hold Peladon hostage. Hepesh orders him to go back to the old ways or die. The Doctor arrives with Aggedor, who kills Hepesh.

On their way to attend Peladon&#x27;s coronation, the Doctor and Jo see the real delegate from Earth, who has just arrived. They rush back to the TARDIS to avoid explaining themselves.

==Production==
The story was broadcast during the 1972 UK Miner&#x27;s Strike, which led to many parts of the UK undergoing scheduled power cuts. This may account for the drop in viewers for the last two episodes. According to the DVD notes for &quot;The Peladon Tales&quot;, this industrial action partly inspired the sequel &quot;The Monster of Peladon&quot;.

During production it was noted that Alpha Centauri had a somewhat phallic appearance. So director Lennie Mayne insisted on the addition of a yellow cape to the costume in an attempt to rectify this.

According to the extensive production paperwork published as part of the 2023 re-release of the story as part of &quot;Doctor Who - The Collection&quot; Box Set, Hayles&#x27; first two commissions were rejected by the production team. The first was titled &quot;The Shape of Terror&quot; and did not feature the Ice Warriors. When this was rejected, Hayles was asked to incorporate the Ice Warriors into his next treatment, &quot;Doctor Who and the Brain Dead&quot;, which was also rejected. The delays in commissioning the story meant that production of the next adventure, &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; was brought forward while Hayles developed the accepted storyline. Working titles for this story included &quot;The Curse&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Peladons&quot;. The original 625-line master videotapes of the serial were wiped around 1975. In the late 1970s, 525-line NTSC copies were returned to the BBC from Canada. The tape of Episode Three was in a very poor condition and a salvage transfer to 625-line was made in 1982 for a repeat of the story; the NTSC tape was then reported to be junked. As a result, it was feared that it might not have been possible to make a new Reverse Standards Conversion (RSC) of the episode. However, the NTSC tape of Episode Three had not been lost but had instead been given to Ian Levine; Levine then lent the tape to the restoration team. After heat treatment, the restored NTSC tape was then used to create a new RSC 625-line videotape digital copy.

The &quot;Venusian lullaby&quot; sung to Aggedor is to the tune of the Christmas carol, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;.

===Cast notes===
David Troughton is the son of Second Doctor actor Patrick Troughton. He had previously appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Moor in &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969), and he would appear in the revived series episode entitled &quot;Midnight&quot; (2008). Geoffrey Toone previously appeared as Temmosus in the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965).

==Themes and analysis==
The story can be seen as a political allegory about the real-world issue of whether Britain should join the European Economic Community, with the alien delegates representing Europeans, King Peladon representing a younger generation of hope in agreement with joining the Federation, and Hepesh, who wants to preserve the status quo, representing the decision not to join. An allegory can also be drawn to the conflict of religion and science.

==Broadcast and reception==
Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), described &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot; as &quot;dull, but worthy&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the inventiveness and individuality of the aliens, as well as the change of the Ice Warriors from evil to good. They concluded that it was &quot;a hugely enjoyable story, and one of the real gems of the third Doctor&#x27;s era&quot;. In 2009, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; called the story an &quot;exciting, elegant four-parter&quot;. He praised Jo and the various aliens, though he felt Aggedor was less successful and would have been better if he was bigger. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott gave the serial four and a half out of five stars, writing that it &quot;has everything that a fan could want: some interesting aliens, old adversaries, a solid mystery, a good amount of action, and a healthy dollop of humor&quot;. He praised the character of Hepesh and effort gone into making the aliens unique, but felt that the King was the weakest aspect as he was not a good leader, which made the romance with Jo not as believable. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn stated that the serial was a success in returning to an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; format, but the murder-mystery genre was not fully realised, with the Doctor not figuring it out and Hepesh taking up most of the fourth episode.

This story was repeated on BBC One (excluding BBC Wales) as two 50min compilation episodes on 12 and 19 July 1982 as part of &quot;Doctor Who and the Monsters&quot;, achieving viewing figures of 5.2 and 4.2 million respectively.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Brian Hayles, was published by Target Books in January 1975. In 1995 the abridged novel was released by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Jon Pertwee. An unabridged reading of the novel was released in 2013 on CD by AudioGo, this time read by David Troughton, who had played King Peladon in the TV serial.

===Home media===
&quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot; was released on VHS in August 1993 for the series&#x27; 30th anniversary. The story&#x27;s original soundtrack was released in the UK in November 2007 and linking narration was provided by Katy Manning. The CD also featured a bonus interview with the actress. The serial was released on DVD on 18 January 2010 in a boxset entitled &quot;Peladon Tales&quot;, along with &quot;The Monster of Peladon&quot;. In March 2023, the story was released again in an upgraded format for Blu-ray, being included with the four other stories from Season 9 in the &quot;Doctor Who - The Collection&quot; Box Set.

<text>The House of the Free Press (), known under Communist rule as Casa Scînteii, &#x27;House of &quot;The Spark&quot; (newspaper)&#x27;, is a building in northern Bucharest, Romania, the tallest in the city between 1956 and 2007.

==History==
A horse race track was built in 1905 on the future site of the House of the Free Press. A third of the track was removed in 1950 to make way for a wing of the building, and the race track was finally closed and demolished in 1960, after a decision by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

Construction began in 1952 and was completed in 1956. The building was named &quot;Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii &quot;I.V.Stalin&quot;&quot; and later &quot;Casa Scînteii&quot; (&quot;Scînteia&quot; was the name of the Romanian Communist Party&#x27;s official newspaper). It was designed by the architect , in the Stalinist style of Socialist realism, resembling the main building of the Moscow State University, and was intended to house all of Bucharest&#x27;s printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff.

It has a foundation with an area of , the total constructed surface is and it has a volume of . Its height is without the television antenna, which measures an additional , bringing the total height to .

Between 1952 and 1966, Casa Scînteii was featured on the reverse of the 100 lei banknote.

On 21 April 1960, a statue of Vladimir Lenin, made by Romanian sculptor Boris Caragea, was placed in front of the building. However, this statue was removed on 3 March 1990, following the Romanian Revolution of 1989. On 30 May 2016, the Monument of the Anti-Communist Fight (&quot;Wings&quot;) was inaugurated in the same place.

Renamed (&quot;House of the Free Press&quot;), the building has basically the same role nowadays, with many of today&#x27;s newspapers having their headquarters in it. The Bucharest Stock Exchange (&quot;Bursa de Valori București&quot;, BVB) was located in the Southern wing at one point.

As of 2023, the House of the Free Press is the only building in Bucharest that has kept the hammer and sickle communist symbol, which appears on reliefs on its façade.

<doc id="959943" wikidata="Q278321" url="?curid=959943" title="Circuit Switched Data">
<text>In communications, Circuit Switched Data (CSD) (also named GSM data) is the original form of data transmission developed for the time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based mobile phone systems like Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). In later years, High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) was developed providing increased data rates over conventional CSD. After 2010 many telecommunication carriers dropped support for CSD and HSCSD, having been superseded by GPRS and EDGE (E-GPRS).

== Technical ==
CSD uses a single radio time slot to deliver 9.6 kbit/s data transmission to the GSM network switching subsystem where it could be connected through the equivalent of a normal modem to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), allowing direct calls to any dial-up service. For backwards compatibility, the IS-95 standard also supports CDMA Circuit Switched Data. However, unlike TDMA, there are no time slots, and all CDMA radios can be active all the time to deliver up to 14.4 kbit/s data transmission speeds. With the evolution of CDMA to CDMA2000 and 1xRTT, the use of IS-95 CDMA Circuit Switched Data declined in favour of the faster data transmission speeds available with the newer technologies.

Prior to CSD, data transmission over mobile phone systems was done by using a modem, either built into the phone or attached to it. Such systems were limited by the quality of the audio signal to 2.4 kbit/s or less. With the introduction of digital transmission in TDMA-based systems like GSM, CSD provided almost direct access to the underlying digital signal, allowing for higher speeds. At the same time, the speech-oriented audio compression used in GSM actually meant that data rates using a traditional modem connected to the phone would have been even lower than with older analog systems.

A CSD &quot;call&quot; functions in a very similar way to a normal voice call in a GSM network. A single dedicated radio time slot is allocated between the phone and the base station. A dedicated &quot;sub-time slot&quot; (16 kbit/s) is allocated from the base station to the transcoder, and finally, another time slot (64 kbit/s) is allocated from the transcoder to the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC).

At the MSC, it is possible to use a modem to convert to an analog signal, though this will typically actually be encoded as a digital pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal when sent from the MSC. It is also possible to directly use the digital signal as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) data signal and feed it into the equivalent of a remote access server.

== High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) == 

High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) is an enhancement to CSD designed to provide higher data rates by means of more efficient channel coding and/or multiple (up to 4) time slots. It requires the time slots being used to be fully reserved to a single user. A transfer rate of up to 57.6 kbit/s (i.e., 4 × 14.4 kbit/s) can be reached, or even 115 kbit/s if a network allows combining 8 slots instead of just 4. It is possible that either at the beginning of the call, or at some point during a call, it will not be possible for the user&#x27;s full request to be satisfied since the network is often configured to allow normal voice calls to take precedence over additional time slots for HSCSD users.

An innovation in HSCSD is to allow different error correction methods to be used for data transfer. The original error correction used in GSM was designed to work at the limits of coverage and in the worst case that GSM will handle. This means that a large part of the GSM transmission capacity is taken up with error correction codes. HSCSD provides different levels of possible error correction which can be used according to the quality of the radio link. This means that in the best conditions 14.4 kbit/s can be put through a single time slot that under CSD would only carry 9.6 kbit/s, i.e. a 50% improvement in throughput.

The user is typically charged for HSCSD at a rate higher than a normal phone call (e.g., by the number of time slots allocated) for the total period of time that the user has a connection active. This makes HSCSD relatively expensive in many GSM networks and is one of the reasons that packet-switched General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), which typically has lower pricing (based on amount of data transferred rather than the duration of the connection), has become more common than HSCSD.

Apart from the fact that the full allocated bandwidth of the connection is available to the HSCSD user, HSCSD also has an advantage in GSM systems in terms of lower average radio interface latency than GPRS. This is because the user of an HSCSD connection does not have to wait for permission from the network to send a packet.

HSCSD is also an option in Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) systems where packet data transmission rates are much higher. In the UMTS system, the advantages of HSCSD over packet data are even lower since the UMTS radio interface has been specifically designed to support high bandwidth, low latency packet connections. This means that the primary reason to use HSCSD in this environment would be access to legacy dial up systems.

HSCSD was specified in 1997. Nokia 6210 was the first mobile phone from Nokia that supported HSCSD.

== Successors ==
GSM data transmission has advanced since the introduction of CSD:
* General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) provides more efficient packet-based data transmission directly from the mobile phone at speeds roughly twice those of HSCSD.
* Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) (E-GPRS) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) provide improved radio interfaces with higher data rates, while still being backward compatible with the GSM core network.
* Enhanced Circuit Switched Data (ECSD) was developed alongside GPRS/EDGE
In some places CSD services have continued to operate on 2G networks for a long time. In the Netherlands operator KPN switched the service off in 2021.

<text>Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston Barnett, DBE (&quot;née&quot; Rowland; 4 May 1851 – 10 June 1936) was an English social reformer, educationist, and author. She and her husband, Samuel Augustus Barnett, founded the first &quot;University Settlement&quot; at Toynbee Hall (in the East End of London) in 1884. They also worked to establish the model Hampstead Garden Suburb in the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Born in Clapham, London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland lost her mother (Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges) at an early age. Her father, Alexander William Rowland, a wealthy businessman associated with the Macassar Oil Company, raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in Kent, where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits. One of her sisters was the philanthropist Alice Hart.

At age 16, Henrietta was sent to a boarding school in Devon run by the Haddon sisters, who, influenced by James Hinton, were committed to social altruism. When her father died in 1869, Henrietta moved with two sisters to Bayswater, where she met and helped social activist and housing reformer Octavia Hill. Hill introduced Henrietta to the writings of John Ruskin, as well as many influential people similarly interested in improving the condition of London&#x27;s poor.

==Marriage and activism==
Through Hill, Henrietta met Canon Samuel Barnett, then the curate of St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square. They married in 1873. The newlyweds soon moved to the impoverished Whitechapel parish of St Jude&#x27;s, intent on improving social conditions. Henrietta continued her parish visiting activities, with a focus on women and children, including the more than 2,000 prostitutes then active in Whitechapel alone. In 1875, Henrietta became a woman guardian for the parish, and the following year was named a school manager for the Poor Law district schools in Forest Gate. Another social initiative which the Barnetts helped set up was the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants (1876), with Jane Senior; the organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provided domestic servants. The Barnetts&#x27; experiment in sending slum children for country holidays grew into the Children&#x27;s Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country), established in 1877, becoming the Children&#x27;s Country Holidays Fund in 1884. Henrietta Barnett promoted Homes for Workhouse Girls starting in 1880, and founded the London Pupil Teachers Association in 1891. She also served as vice-president of the National Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-Minded (1895) and National Union of Women Workers (1895–96), as well as Hon. Secretary of the State Children&#x27;s Aid Association.

In 1884, the Barnetts established (and began living at) Toynbee Hall, a pioneering university settlement named after the recently deceased distinguished historian Arnold Toynbee, who had advocated education of the working classes and reduction of the division between social classes. In 1897 annual loan exhibitions of fine art began at the nearby Whitechapel Gallery through the Barnetts&#x27; efforts. In 1903 Richard Tawney began working with them, the Children&#x27;s Country Holiday Fund, and the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. William Beveridge and Clement Attlee also worked with the Barnetts as they started their own careers. A visit to Toynbee Hall inspired Jane Addams to found Hull House in Chicago.
In 1889 the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard&#x27;s End in the Hampstead area of north-west London. The Barnetts became inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by Letchworth garden city). Building on the principles of Toynbee Hall, Henrietta had a vision of a garden community where all classes could live together in a light and airy environment, with beautifully designed housing and gardens, as well as protecting part of nearby Hampstead Heath from development by Eton College. She began by establishing a committee to protect part of nearby Hampstead Heath from development by Eton College, raising £43,000 and purchasing 80 hectares of the Heath for the public. In 1904, they established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green. This became the Hampstead Garden Suburb, a model garden city developed through their efforts and those of architects Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens and which ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres. In 1909, an adult education institute opened in the middle of the new Hampstead Garden Suburb, with cultural programmes and discussion groups. Soon a school for girls was established and named the Henrietta Barnett School.

Although the suburb was never completely developed according to Lutyens&#x27;s plan (and soon became a middle class enclave rather than a mixture of classes), it did include Grade I listed St Jude&#x27;s Church, as well as a clubhouse and a tea house (for non-alcoholic social focus), a Quaker meeting house, children&#x27;s homes, a nursery school, and housing for old people.

The Barnetts never had children of their own. They adopted Dorothy Woods, and Henrietta also served as legal guardian for her brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny. After Samuel died in 1913, Henrietta founded Barnett House at Oxford (1914) in his memory. She helped it become the university&#x27;s centre for social work and social policy education.

==Writing==
Barnett wrote several books, alone and with her husband. Their Christian Socialist beliefs are set out in &quot;Practicable Socialism&quot; (1889) and &quot;Toward Social Reform&quot; (1909).

Her early books concerned domestic issues: &quot;The Making of the Home&quot; (1885), &quot;How to Mind the Baby,&quot; (1887) and, written with her husband and Ernest Abraham Hart (her brother-in-law), &quot;The Making of the Body&quot; (1894). With Kathleen Mallam, Henrietta Barnett also edited a collection of essays entitled &quot;Destitute, Neglected, and Delinquent Children&quot; (Pan-Anglican papers, 1908). After her husband&#x27;s death, Henrietta Barnett finished their &quot;Illustrated British Ballads Old and New&quot; (1915), wrote his multi-volume biography, &quot;Canon Barnett: his life, work and friends&quot; (1918) as well as published collections of essays, most notably &quot;Matters that Matter&quot; (1930).

==Honours==
For her work as a social reformer, Barnett was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1917, and elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1924. In 1920, she was named honorary president of the 480-member American Federation of Settlements.
==Death and legacy==
For the final dozen years of her life, Henrietta Barnett took up painting and often lived at 45 Wish Road, Hove (today marked by a blue plaque).

She died at Hampstead in 1936 (aged 85) and is buried (with Samuel) in the churchyard of St Helen&#x27;s Church, Hangleton, East Sussex.

Henrietta is remembered (with Samuel) in the Church of England with a commemoration on 17 June.

<doc id="959956" wikidata="Q4116608" url="?curid=959956" title="Anchor escapement">
<text>In horology, the anchor escapement is a type of escapement used in pendulum clocks. The escapement is a mechanism in a mechanical clock that maintains the swing of the pendulum by giving it a small push each swing, and allows the clock&#x27;s wheels to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the clock&#x27;s hands forward. The anchor escapement was so named because one of its principal parts is shaped vaguely like a ship&#x27;s anchor.

The anchor escapement was invented by clockmaker William Clement,
 who popularized the anchor in his invention of the longcase or grandfather clock around 1680. Clement&#x27;s invention was a substantial improvement on Robert Hooke&#x27;s constant force escapement of 1671. The oldest known anchor clock is Wadham College Clock, a tower clock built at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1670, probably by clockmaker Joseph Knibb. The anchor became the standard escapement used in almost all pendulum clocks.

A more accurate variation without recoil called the deadbeat escapement was invented by Richard Towneley around 1675 and introduced by British clockmaker George Graham around 1715. This gradually superseded the ordinary anchor escapement and is used in most modern pendulum clocks.

==How it works==
The anchor escapement consists of two parts: the &quot;escape wheel&quot;, which is a vertical wheel with pointed teeth on it rather like saw teeth, and the &quot;anchor&quot;, shaped vaguely like a ship&#x27;s anchor, which swings back and forth on a pivot just above the escape wheel. On the two arms of the anchor are curved faces which the teeth of the escape wheel push against, called &quot;pallets&quot;. The central shaft of the anchor is attached to a fork pushed by the pendulum, so the anchor swings back and forth, with the pallets alternately catching and releasing an escape wheel tooth on each side.

Each time one pallet moves away from the escape wheel, releasing a tooth, the wheel turns and a tooth on the other side catches on the other pallet, which is moving toward the wheel. The momentum of the pendulum continues to move the second pallet toward the wheel, pushing the escape wheel backward for a distance, until the pendulum reverses direction and the pallet begins to move away from the wheel, with the tooth sliding along its surface, pushing it. Then the tooth slides off the end of the pallet, beginning the cycle again.

Neither the anchor escapement nor the deadbeat form, below, are self-starting. The pendulum must be given a swing to get them going.

===Recoil===
The backward motion of the escape wheel during part of the cycle, called &quot;recoil&quot;, is one of the disadvantages of the anchor escapement. It results in a temporary reversal of the entire wheel train back to the driving weight with each tick of the clock, causing extra wear in the wheel train, excessive wear to the gear teeth, and inaccuracy. It can also cause the points of the escape wheel teeth to dig into the pallet surface. The teeth are slanted backward, opposite the direction of rotation, and the surface of the pallets is slightly convex, to prevent this.

Another reason the escape wheel teeth are slanted backward is as a safety measure. If the clock is moved without immobilising the pendulum, the uncontrolled swinging of the pendulum can cause the anchor pallets to collide violently with the escape wheel. The slanted teeth ensure that the flat faces of the anchor pallets hit the sides of the teeth first, protecting the delicate points from being broken.

The deadbeat escapement (below) doesn&#x27;t have recoil. One way to determine whether an antique pendulum clock has an anchor or deadbeat escapement is to observe the second hand. If it moves backward slightly after every tick, showing recoil, the clock has an anchor escapement.

===Crutch and fork===
The shaft of the anchor, called the &quot;crutch&quot; ends in a fork which embraces the shaft of the pendulum, giving it transverse impulses. The pendulum rod is hung from a short straight suspension spring attached to a sturdy support directly behind the anchor. The pivot of the anchor is aligned with the bending point of the spring. This arrangement results in a more stable pendulum support than simply suspending the pendulum directly from the anchor.

===Design details===
The anchor is very tolerant of variations in its geometry, so its shape varied widely. In the late 19th century, in Britain, the usual design was a 90° angle between the pallets, which meant locating the anchor pivot a distance of ≈ 1.4 times the escape wheel radius from the escape wheel pivot. In a grandfather clock, which had a pendulum which swung once per second, the escape wheel often had 30 teeth, which made the escape wheel rotate once per minute so the second hand could be attached to its shaft. In a 30-tooth escape wheel the pallets span about 7½ teeth. The impulse angle of the pallets, which determined the swing of the pendulum, was 3–4°.

==History==
The anchor was the second widely used escapement in Europe, replacing the primitive 400-year-old verge escapement in pendulum clocks. The pendulums in verge escapement clocks had very wide swings of 80° to 100°. In 1673, seventeen years after he invented the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens published his mathematical analysis of pendulums, &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;. In it he showed that the wide pendulum swings of verge clocks caused them to be inaccurate, because the period of oscillation of the pendulum was not isochronous but varied to a small degree due to circular error with changes in the amplitude of the pendulum&#x27;s swing, which occurred with unavoidable changes in drive force. The realization that only small pendulum swings were nearly isochronous motivated clockmakers to design escapements with small swings.
The chief advantage of the anchor was that by locating the pallets farther from the pivot, the swing of the pendulum was reduced from around 100° in verge clocks to only 4°-6°. In addition to the improved accuracy due to isochronism, this allowed clocks to use longer pendulums, which had a slower &#x27;beat&#x27;. Lower air drag (aerodynamic drag rises with the square of speed, so a faster pendulum experiences greatly-increased drag) meant they needed less power to keep swinging, and caused less wear on the clock&#x27;s movement. The anchor also allowed the use of a heavier pendulum bob for a given drive force, making the pendulum more independent of the escapement (higher Q), and thus more accurate. These long pendulums required long narrow clock cases. Around 1680 British clockmaker William Clement began selling the first commercial clocks to use the anchor escapement, tall freestanding clocks with 1 meter (39 inch) seconds pendulums contained inside a long narrow clock case that came to be called longcase or &#x27;grandfather&#x27; clocks. The anchor increased the accuracy of clocks so much that around 1680–1690 the use of the minute hand, formerly the exception in clocks, became the rule.

The anchor escapement replaced the verge in pendulum clocks within about fifty years, although French clockmakers continued to use verges until about 1800. Many verge clocks were rebuilt with anchors. In the 18th century the more accurate deadbeat form of the escapement replaced the anchor in precision regulators, but the anchor remained the workhorse in home pendulum clocks. During the 19th century the deadbeat form gradually took over in most quality clocks, but the anchor form is still used in a few pendulum clocks today.

Tower clocks are one of the few types of pendulum clock which the anchor escapement did not dominate. The varying force applied to the wheel train by the large exterior hands, exposed to wind, snow, and ice loads, was better handled by gravity escapements.

==Disadvantages==
The anchor escapement is reliable and tolerant of large geometrical errors in its construction, but its operation is similar to the old verge escapement, and retains two of the major disadvantages of the verge: 
*It is a &quot;frictional&quot; escapement; the pendulum is always being pushed by an escape wheel tooth throughout its cycle, and never allowed to swing freely. This makes the clock&#x27;s rate sensitive to changes in the drive force. Any small changes in the force applied to the pallets, for example by a change in lubrication due to oil aging, or the declining force of a clock&#x27;s mainspring as it runs down, will change the period of the pendulum&#x27;s swing. Anchor escapement clocks driven by a mainspring required a fusee to even out the force of the mainspring.
*It is a &quot;recoil&quot; escapement as mentioned above; the momentum of the pendulum pushes the escape wheel backward during part of the cycle. This causes extra wear to the movement, and applies varying force to the pendulum, causing inaccuracy.

==Deadbeat escapement==
The above two disadvantages were removed with the invention of an improved version of the anchor escapement: the deadbeat or Graham escapement. This is often erroneously credited to English clockmaker George Graham who introduced it around 1715 in his precision regulator clocks. However it was actually invented around 1675 by astronomer Richard Towneley, and first used by Graham&#x27;s mentor Thomas Tompion in a clock built for Sir Jonas Moore, and in the two precision regulators he made for the new Greenwich Observatory in 1676, mentioned in correspondence between Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed and Towneley.

The deadbeat form of the anchor escapement is less tolerant to inaccuracy in its manufacture or wear during operation and was initially used only in precision clocks, but its use spread during the 19th century to most quality pendulum clocks. Almost all pendulum clocks made today use it.

===How it works===
The deadbeat escapement has two faces to the pallets: a &quot;locking&quot;, or &quot;dead&quot;, face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis on which the anchor rotates, and a sloping &quot;impulse&quot; face. When an escape wheel tooth is resting against one of the dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor&#x27;s pivot axis, so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this &quot;dead&quot; face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum&#x27;s outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is &quot;locked&quot; and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum&#x27;s swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted &quot;impulse&quot; face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet. It is still a frictional rest escapement because the sliding of the escape tooth on the dead face adds friction to the pendulum&#x27;s swing, but it has less friction than the recoil escapement because there is no recoil force.

In contrast to the backward slant of the anchor escape wheel teeth, the deadbeat escape wheel teeth are radial or slant forward to ensure that the tooth makes contact with the &quot;dead&quot; face of the pallet, preventing recoil.

===The Airy condition===
Clockmakers discovered in the 1700s that for accuracy, the best place to apply the impulse to keep the pendulum swinging was at the bottom of its swing, as it passes through its equilibrium position. If the impulse is applied during the pendulum&#x27;s downswing, before it reaches the bottom, the impulse force tends to decrease the period of the swing, so an increase in drive force causes the clock to gain time. If the impulse is applied during the pendulum&#x27;s upswing, after it reaches the bottom, the impulse force tends to increase the period of the swing, so an increase in drive force causes the clock to lose time. If the impulse is applied at the bottom, changes in the impulse force theoretically should have no effect on the period.

In 1826 British astronomer George Airy proved this; specifically, he proved that a pendulum that is driven by a drive impulse that is symmetrical about its bottom equilibrium position is isochronous for different drive forces, ignoring friction, and that the deadbeat escapement approximately satisfies this condition. It would be exactly satisfied if the escape wheel teeth were made to fall exactly on the corner between the two pallet faces, but for the escapement to operate reliably, the teeth must be made to fall above the corner, on the &quot;dead&quot; face.

==Comparison of motion in anchor and deadbeat==
A major cause of error in clocks is changes in the drive force applied to the escapement, caused by small changes in the friction of the gears or the pallets, or the diminishing force of the mainspring as it unwinds. An escapement in which changes in drive force do not affect the rate is called isochronous. The superior performance of the deadbeat over the recoil is due to improved isochronism. This is due to the different ways changes in drive force affect the swing of the pendulum in the two escapements:
*In the anchor escapement, an increase of drive force causes the pendulum to swing back and forth more quickly, but does not increase the pendulum&#x27;s amplitude, the length of its swing, much. The increased force of the escape wheel tooth on the pallet during the recoil part of the cycle tends to decrease the pendulum&#x27;s swing, while the force of the tooth during the forward &quot;impulse&quot; part of the cycle tends to increase the pendulum&#x27;s swing. These tend to cancel each other out, leaving the swing unchanged. But both these effects decrease the time of swing. In other words, increased force knocks the pendulum back and forth in a fixed arc faster.
*In the deadbeat escapement, there is no recoil and increased drive force causes the pendulum to swing in a wider arc as well as move faster. The time required to cover the extra distance exactly compensates for the increased speed of the pendulum, leaving the period of swing unchanged. However, the wider swing causes a slight increase in period due to circular error. For domestic clocks this effect is negligible, but it is a limitation on the accuracy that can be achieved by precision regulator clocks with deadbeat escapements.

When the deadbeat was invented, clockmakers initially believed it had inferior isochronism to the anchor, because of the greater effect of changes in force on the pendulum&#x27;s amplitude. Recent analyses point out that the nonisochronism of the anchor escapement can cancel the circular error of the pendulum. That is, an increase in amplitude of swing in the anchor causes a slight increase in period of a pendulum due to circular error, and that this can compensate for the decreased period due to isochronism. Due to this effect, a carefully adjusted anchor escapement with polished pallets might be more accurate than a deadbeat. This has been confirmed by at least one modern experiment.

<doc id="959959" wikidata="Q7169987" url="?curid=959959" title="Perry v. Sindermann">
<text>Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court decision affecting educational case law involving tenure and due process.

==Facts==
Sindermann was a teacher at several schools in the state college system of the State of Texas under a system of one-year contracts from 1959 to 1969. In 1965, he became a professor at Odessa Junior College, where he was successful enough to be appointed department co-chair for a time. During the 1968-1969 academic year, Sindermann became involved in public disagreements with the policies of the Board of Regents as president of the Texas Junior College Teachers Association. In May 1969, his one-year contract was terminated and was not renewed. The Regents issued a press release alleging insubordination, but no official hearing was provided Sindermann to contest the basis for non-renewal.

==Issues==
*Does a non-tenured teacher still have due process rights as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment by a &quot;de facto&quot; tenure policy created by rules and policy?
*Were Sindermann&#x27;s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights violated?

==Decision==
In an opinion written by Justice Stewart, the court decided that Sindermann had alleged enough facts to show that he was entitled to some kind of process and that the lack of a contractual or tenure right taken alone did not defeat his claim that the nonrenewal of his contract violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. While Sindermann did not have tenure &quot;per se&quot;, his length of service at his last institution (more than the four years mentioned as the probationary period for a full-time instructor in the “Policy Paper 1” guidelines), he had asserted that he had &quot;de facto&quot; tenure.

The court pointed to &quot;Board of Regents v. Roth&quot;, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), as an example of a non-tenured teacher not having a claim for a hearing. However, Sindermann was able to point to the policy paper as providing an expectancy of treatment as if being tenured, the expectancy gave him a viable claim that he had a property interest in the job such that it could fall under the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The court ruled that &quot;the respondent must be given an opportunity to prove the legitimate of his claim of such entitlement in light of the policies and practices of the institution. Proof of such a property interest would not, of course, entitle him to reinstatement. But such proof would obligate college officials to grant a hearing at his request, where he could be informed of the grounds for his non-retention and challenge their sufficiency.&quot;

The problem that the court faced was that without having a record of a hearing of Sindermann’s non-renewal, the court was unable to determine if Sindermann’s First Amendment right to free speech had been violated since there was no documented reason for the non-renewal. The court required for Sindermann to be given a hearing at which it could be determined if his First Amendment rights had been violated by the Regents&#x27; refusal to renew his contract for his public utterances.

Justice Powell took no part in the decision.

Justice Brennan dissented in part, joined by Justice Douglas, place who wrote that since the respondent was denied due process, he should be entitled to summary judgment on that issue.

Justice Marshall also dissented.

<doc id="959963" wikidata="Q5344872" url="?curid=959963" title="Edward Plunkett, 20th Baron of Dunsany">
<text>Edward John Carlos Plunkett, 20th Baron of Dunsany (10 September 1939 – 24 May 2011), was the grandson of the author Lord Dunsany, and a modern artist (painter and sculptor) and landowner. He succeeded to the title in 1999 on the death of his father, Randal Plunkett, 19th Baron of Dunsany.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Plunkett was born in Dublin on September 10, 1939, and brought to Brazil for the years of World War II, returning to Ireland at the age of 7, speaking only Brazilian Portuguese. His parents were divorced in 1947, and he was brought up by his grandparents (he was estranged from his father, and his mother lived primarily in Brazil). Plunkett was educated at Eton College and the Slade School of Fine Art (1957 to 1960), where he showed himself to be a skilled draughtsman.

===Career===
Plunkett apprenticed with Loio Persio in Rio de Janeiro from 1961 to 1962, and worked and studied gravure with S.W. Hayter in Paris in 1962. He then attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1962 to 1964. By then an experienced artist in paint and pencil, who later added architectural studies and design work to his skills, Plunkett worked next at Vence in the south of France, where he was the resident painter at the Foundation Karolyi in 1969, then moved to Rome, where he established a studio in Trasteveri. Sometime after a major exhibition in Rome in 1975, he suffered a breakdown in a major partnership and lost much of his art.

Plunkett moved to the USA in 1977, where he developed a studio in Manhattan, New York and took up design as a significant area of work. While in New York, he married and co-founded de Marsillac Plunkett Inc, Designers and Architects, a New York-based partnership for which he provided design elements for his wife&#x27;s architectural work.

In 1991 Plunkett and his family moved to London, where he kept a studio from 1991 to 1993. He returned to the family&#x27;s Dunsany estate near the Hill of Tara in 1994, and set up his main studio in the old Estate Office in the castle. While in Ireland, he did design work for companies working with glass bottles, including mineral water and champagne suppliers.

He was primarily a painter, but also produced sculptures designed by him and manufactured in France or the UK. He painted official portraits of two former Taoisigh (Prime Ministers) of Ireland, Charles Haughey and John Bruton.

Plunkett was exhibited on multiple occasions, the last public showing being a one-man exhibition in Rome. His appearances included:
* 1968: Mayor Gallery, London
* 1969: ICA, London - &quot;Young and Fantastic&quot; (group exhibition)
* 1970: Living Irish Artists, Dublin and Belfast (group exhibition)
* 1971: ROSC, Galway (group exhibition)
* 1972: The Agnew Somerville Gallery, Dublin
* 1972: The Graphic Biennale, Krakow (group exhibition)
* 1974: Mayor Gallery, London
* 1974: Galleria deli&#x27;Obelisco, Roma (group exhibition)
* 1975: Galleria Il Collezionista d&#x27;Arte Contemporarea
* 2005: Galleria Candido Portinari, Palazzo Pamphilj, Rome
He was also successful at product design. His last architectural work was the contemporary conversion of an 18th-century wing of Dunsany Castle into a studio and exhibition area. It is called The Plunkett Gallery and it houses Lord Dunsany&#x27;s paintings, lithographs, drawings, architectural projects, sculptures and designed objects (perfume bottles, Champagne bottles, and numbered editions of vases and dinner services); the gallery is open to visitors by appointment.

Aside from the gallery at Dunsany Castle, Plunkett&#x27;s work is held by, among others, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery in Dublin, the Arts Council of Ireland, the Irish State and its Office of Public Works, the British Board of Works, the National Museum of Poland at Wroclaw and the Centre for Contemporary Art in Toronto, Canada.

===Personal life===
In 1982, Plunkett married Maria Alice Villela de Carvalho, a descendant of the explorer Vasco Da Gama and of Pedro Álvares Cabral, the founder of Brazil. Plunkett and his wife, Lady Dunsany, an architect qualified in the US, Ireland and the UK, lived at Dunsany Castle, Dunsany, County Meath, Ireland. They had two sons, Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, and Oliver Plunkett. In addition, he had two stepchildren. Their father was his first cousin and great friend, Jayme de Marsillac.

He died in May 2011, after some years of chronic illness, including having cerebral palsy. A private funeral with his widow, sons and step-children, sister, close family friends and staff, was conducted within the ancestral castle. He was buried in the grounds, by the Church of St. Nicholas, the reconsecration of which he had helped arrange for his stepson&#x27;s marriage. The six pallbearers were his sons and stepson, a family friend and Dunsany curator, and two members of the Castle staff. A memorial service was held in Dunsany Parish Church a week after the funeral.

<text>Masterpoints or master points are points awarded by bridge organizations to individuals for success in competitive bridge tournaments run under their auspices. Generally, recipients must be members in good standing of the issuing organization. At the international level, competitions and point awards are administered by the World Bridge Federation (WBF); its affiliates at the multi-national level, such as the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), also issue points as do national federations such as the English Bridge Union (EBU), and the Deutsche Bridge Verband (DBV) and independent leagues such as the American Bridge Association (ABA) and Bridge Base Online (BBO).

In general, each organization has its own scheme for categorizing competitive bridge events and has a parallel scheme for awarding various categories of points to successful players. Upon reaching certain thresholds in point accumulation or retention, most organizations rank the individual in recognition of their achievements. Points and rankings generally have no monetary value, but have prestige value for some players and are sought after by them over a lifetime of play.

In some cases, the point awarding scheme is an important means of raising revenue for the bridge organization insofar as they charge entry fees for each tournament where points are awarded and their availability acts as an incentive to participation; the more prestigious the points, the higher the entry fees.

In the past, points were issued as paper certificates, which gave the player a tangible record of his or her achievement, but these are now increasingly replaced by electronic recording.

&quot;Masterpoint&quot;, as a single word, is a registered trademark of the ACBL in the United States.

==Awards of masterpoints==

Players who achieve a high placing in an event sanctioned by the sponsoring bridge organization (a club game, sectional tournament, regional tournament, etc.) are awarded masterpoints according to their placing and the number of pairs, individuals, or teams who played in the event.

Some events have an upper masterpoint limit, meaning that only players with a masterpoint holding under the limit may participate. This allows less experienced players more of a chance to place high since they will not be playing against players who are significantly more experienced. Additionally, some events are stratified. This means that players with various masterpoint holdings play together, but in the final standings, players receive masterpoints based on their position within their stratum. For example, if you are first in stratum C, second in B and fourth in A, and the upper masterpoint limits are 300 for C, 500 for B, and 1000 for A, that means that among players with fewer than 300 masterpoints, you did the best. Among players with 500 points or fewer, you did second-best, and among players with fewer than 1000, you did fourth-best. With those divisions, a player with 700 points would be able to place in stratum A, but not in B or C.

==American Contract Bridge League==
The ACBL awards several categories of masterpoints, each associated with the type of event and designated by a distinct color:
* Online - Also commonly referred as &quot;unpigmented&quot;, are awarded in online club games
* Black - awarded in brick-and-mortar club games
* Silver - awarded in sectional tournaments, as well as Sectional Tournaments at Clubs (STaCs)
* Red - awarded in regional tournaments (for places other than overall and section tops), as well as North American Open Pairs (NAP) and Grand National Teams (GNT) games at clubs
* Gold - awarded for overall and section tops in regionals, as well as in NABCs (North American Bridge Championships) with an upper masterpoint limit of 750 or more
* Platinum - awarded in national-rated events with no upper masterpoint limit

Like most bridge governing bodies, the ACBL assigns ranks to players according to their masterpoint holdings; the requirements for its various ranks are listed below.

Masterpoints are partly a measure of skill, but the system is regarded by many players as a measure of experience and longevity rather than skill. Experience is often related to skill, but not necessarily. Throughout a lifetime, a player can earn many points, just with average play. For example, the same number of masterpoints, and hence the same rank, may have been achieved by Player A over 2 years and by Player B over 20 years.

When an ACBL member achieves the &quot;Life Master&quot; rank, the first digit of their 7-digit ACBL number is replaced with a letter according to the following chart. (New membership cards are sent accordingly at that rank.)
==American Bridge Association==
The American Bridge Association system of masterpoint ranking is as follows: 
==World Bridge Federation Master Points==
In contrast, the World Bridge Federation system of Master Points annually reduces players&#x27; holdings of points older than one year by 15% and uses another classification of points, known as Placing Points, to record players&#x27; lifetime accumulation. The WBF also distinguishes between points earned in Open, Women&#x27;s, Mixed, or Senior events and awards its Titles (such as World Grand Master), based upon the accumulation and retention scheme for the particular point classification.

==Comparison of Masterpoints between organizations==
It is difficult to compare masterpoints between various organizations as they are not consistent in value.

The ACBL awards new ACBL members 10% of their ABA master points (up to 200 ACBL black points) and 20% of their WBF master points.

For tournament seeding, the ACBL uses 50% of a person&#x27;s ABA master points plus their ACBL masterpoints.

For tournament seeding, the ABA uses 200% of a person&#x27;s ACBL masterpoints (if less than 5,000) plus their ABA master points. If the player has 5,000+ ACBL masterpoints, they are seeded with 10,000 plus their ABA master points.

<text>The Ohio Women&#x27;s Methodist Seminary was a seminary located in Delaware, Ohio.

The seminary provided general educational opportunities to women in an era when co-educational institutions of higher learning were not yet fully open to students of both sexes. The Women&#x27;s Seminary was governed by a board of directors chosen by the Methodist Episcopal Church, which oversaw the operation, and ensured that the curriculum was in keeping with church teachings.

<doc id="959976" wikidata="Q950551" url="?curid=959976" title="William Knight (bishop)">
<text>William Knight (1475/76 – 1547) was the Secretary of State to Henry VIII of England, and Bishop of Bath and Wells.

Knight was sent to Rome in 1527 to try to get Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled. He rebuilt Horton Court in Gloucestershire using ideas from Italian architecture.

==Life==
Born in London, he entered Winchester School as a scholar in 1487, and proceeded in 1491 to New College, Oxford, where he became Fellow in 1493. He afterwards proceeded D.C.L. 12 October 1531. In 1495 Knight went to court, where Henry VII made him one of his secretaries. He was frequently employed as an ambassador in the reign of Henry VIII. On 3 June 1512 he went with Sir Edward Howard to Spain, and, after storms and sickness, reached Valladolid 18 February 1513. He had received a commission authorising him and John Stile to treat with Ferdinand II of Aragon about the defence of the church. Knight remained at Valladolid till June 1513.

On 3 April 1514 he was at Mechlin on the first of a long series of embassies to the Low Countries. Richard Wingfield and Spinelly were with him (18 April), and on 12 June he was at The Hague with Sir Edward Poynings. In July he seems to have visited Switzerland. He received, on 14 July 1514, a grant of arms; in the grant he is described as prothonotary.

In May 1515 Knight is styled chaplain to the king; in the same year he became dean of the collegiate church of Newark, Leicestershire. On 7 May he was appointed ambassador with Sir Edward Poynings to Prince Charles, to renew the league of 9 February 1505. They had a conference with Cuthbert Tunstall, 23 May, at Bruges, and an audience with Charles at Bergen-op-Zoom on 29 May. He remained in Flanders during the rest of 1515, and found himself short of money. In February 1516 the treaty had been concluded.

He probably came to England in 1516, as he was in that year collated to the prebend of Farrendon-cum-Balderton in Lincoln Cathedral. On 30 December 1516 he was, in company with Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, again appointed ambassador to the Emperor, and he had an interview with Charles, 22 January 1517. Throughout 1518 he was English representative to Margaret of Austria in the Low Countries, and sailed home from Calais 15 February 1519. As one of Henry&#x27;s chaplains and clerk of the closet he was at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520; and seems to have been made prebendary of Llanvair in Bangor Cathedral in the same year.

On 10 June 1520 he was commissioned, with Sir Thomas More, John Hussee, and Hewester, to settle the disputes between the English merchants and the Teutonic Hanse, and went again to the Netherlands. Sir Richard Wingfield, writing from Oudenarde, 28 October 1521, reported that Knight was to take his place as ambassador to the emperor, but it seems that the emperor objected to his low birth, and expressed a preference for Sir Robert Wingfield. Knight made a journey on diplomatic business into Switzerland in 1522; went on an embassy to the empire respecting the wool staple, and was (11 November) admitted archdeacon of Chester. In 1523 he concluded with Charles III, Duke of Bourbon a treaty against France, but was back at Brussels in August. On 11 September 1523 he was appointed archdeacon of Huntingdon. About August 1526 he became secretary to the king.

In 1527, though he complained that he was old and losing his sight, Henry decided to send him to Rome to promote his divorce; Thomas Wolsey thought Jerome de Ghinucci, bishop of Worcester, would have been better suited to the work. On 10 September Knight saw Wolsey at Compiègne, and at his directions went on to Venice to watch for an opportunity to get access to the captive Pope Clement VII. He managed to get a safe-conduct through Gambara the prothonotary, but was nearly murdered at Monterotundo (4 December 1527), and when he entered Rome all he could do was to send in his letters of credence with a note of what the king wished. On 19 December 1527 Knight, while still in Italy, was made canon of Westminster. By the end of December, Henry Jerningham wrote that the secret of Knight&#x27;s negotiation had not been well kept, and that the Emperor had written to the pope accordingly. Full instructions were then sent to Knight, with a commission to Wolsey and another, which, if signed by the pope, would have empowered them to settle the divorce. On 1 January 1528 the Pope had been set free, and Knight visited him at Orvieto. Cardinal St. Quatuor (to whom two thousand crowns were given) had made some alterations in the commission, and the pope signed it. Knight arrived in London in February 1528 and admitted the failure of this embassy.

He went (13 December 1528) on another mission with William Benet to Anne de Montmorency, to confer about Italian affairs, and was instructed to proceed on again to Rome. On 31 January 1529, however, Stephen Gardiner joined Knight and Benet at Lyon and brought new instructions; Knight went back to Paris and acted through March and April with Sir John Taylor as ambassador; in June Suffolk and Fitzwilliam were with him. On 30 June 1529, Knight, with Tunstall, More, and Hacket, arranged the Treaty of Cambray. He was at the convocation of Canterbury of 1529 and was admitted archdeacon of Richmond on 7 December until 1541.
In February 1532 Hacket and Knight were appointed to treat with the emperor&#x27;s commissioners about commerce; the embassy did not bear much fruit. Knight held at this time the rectory of Romald Kirk, Yorkshire. On 30 January 1535 Knight was a commissioner for collecting the ecclesiastical tenths, and on 15 October 1537 was present at the christening of Edward VI.

On 29 May 1541 he was consecrated bishop of Bath and Wells, in succession to John Clerk, and he resigned all his other preferments. At Wells Thomas Fuller relates that he built a market cross with the assistance of Dean Woolman. He died in 1547 at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, and was buried in Wells Cathedral next to Sugar&#x27;s Chapel, where a pulpit which he had erected and which bears his arms served as a monument. He was a patron of Henry Cole. When in London Knight lived in a house in Cannon Row, Westminster, afterwards (1536) assigned, in accordance with an act of 27 Henry VIII, to the bishops of Norwich. By his will he left money to Winchester and New Colleges.

<doc id="959981" wikidata="Q1099137" url="?curid=959981" title="Clavius (crater)">
<text>Clavius is one of the largest crater formations on the Moon and the second largest crater on the visible near side (very close in size to Deslandres). It is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon, to the south of the prominent ray crater Tycho. It is named for the Jesuit priest Christopher Clavius.

Clavius is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

== Description ==
Clavius&#x27; location toward the southern limb of the Moon causes it to appear oblong due to foreshortening. Its great size makes it visible to the unaided eye as a prominent notch in the terminator about one to two days after the Moon reaches first quarter. 

It has a low outer wall in comparison to its size and is heavily worn and pock-marked by craterlets. The rim does not significantly overlook the surrounding terrain making it a &quot;walled depression&quot;. The inner surface of the rim is hilly, notched and varies in width with the steepest portion to the south. The rim has been observed to have a somewhat polygonal outline overall.

== Crater floor ==
The floor of Clavius forms a convex plain that is marked by some interesting crater impacts. The most notable of these is a curving chain of craters that begins with Rutherfurd in the south then arcs across the floor in a counterclockwise direction forming a sequence of ever diminishing diameters. From largest to smallest, these craters are designated Clavius D, C, N, J, and JA. This sequence of diminishing craters has proved a useful tool for amateur astronomers who want to test the resolution of their small telescopes.

The crater floor retains a remnant of a central massif, which lies between Clavius C and N. The relative smoothness of the floor and the low size of the central peaks may indicate that the crater surface was formed some time after the original impact.

== Presence of water ==
In October 2020, NASA confirmed the existence of molecular water near Clavius, at concentrations of up to 412 parts per million. The water could be trapped into tiny beadlike structures in the soil that form out of the high heat created by micrometeorite impacts. The water might also be sheltered between lunar soil grains. Another possibility is from very small asteroid strikes, such as a rubble pile from a much more massive &quot;parent&quot; asteroid collision. Pulled apart in its descent to the lunar surface similar to Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, and hitting the surface in a modest dispersal area with a small mass at low, oblique impact angle and bouncing could allow some water to remain in the lithic matrix. The carbonaceous chondrite class is often water-rich, and the CI sub group are as much as 22% water.

== Nearby craters ==
Notable nearby craters include Scheiner to the west; Blancanus to the southwest; Maginus in the northeast, and Longomontanus to the northwest. The crater Rutherfurd lies entirely within the southeastern rim, while Porter overlays the northeast wall. The smaller crater Clavius L lies across the western rim while Clavius K breaks through the west-southwest rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Clavius.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="959985" wikidata="Q697832" url="?curid=959985" title="Kili Island">
<text>Kili Island or Kili Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is a small, () island located in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. As of 2021, 415 people lived on the island, many of whom were descended from islanders who originally lived on Bikini Atoll. They were relocated when they agreed to let the U.S. government temporarily use Bikini for nuclear testing in 1945, which they were told was of great importance to humankind, though it is sometimes considered a forced relocation. Kili Island became their home after two prior relocations failed. The island does not have a natural lagoon and cannot produce enough food to enable the islanders to be self-sufficient. It is part of the legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands. The island is approximately southwest of Jaluit. It is a good sized island for the Marshall Islands, but it is not an atoll with a lagoon.

== History ==
Captain Thomas Dennet of the British vessel &quot;Britannia&quot; sighted the atoll in 1797 on route from Australia to China and named it Hunter Island.

Kili Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

== Bikini Atoll residents arrive ==
Kili was uninhabited until November 2, 1948 when the United States government relocated the Bikini Atoll&#x27;s indigenous population from Rongerik Atoll, where they had previously been relocated after their first relocation to Kwajalein Atoll failed. The islanders had consented to what they believed was temporary use of their island for nuclear tests, thinking they would be able to return to their island home within a few years.

On Kwajalein Atoll, the islanders were living in tents on a strip of grass alongside the airport runway. In June 1948 the Bikini residents chose Kili Island as a long-term home. The small island was uninhabited and was not ruled by a paramount king, or iroij. In June the Bikini community chose two dozen men to accompany eight Seabees to Kili to begin constructing a village. In November 1948, the residents, now totaling 184 individuals, moved to Kili Island, but soon learned that the new location was incompatible with their traditional diet and lifestyle based on lagoon fishing.

In 1957, the Bikini residents, without any legal representation, signed an agreement with the United States that gave the U.S. complete control of Bikini Atoll. The Bikini families also gave up the right for any future claims against the United States. In exchange, they received $25,000 in cash and an additional $300,000 trust fund that yielded a semi-annual interest payment of approximately $5,000, or about $15 per person per year. They were also given Kili Island and several islands in Jaluit Atoll.

In the 1980s, there was a lawsuit that was dismissed, but overall it was seen that the Bikini deserved more help. Two large multi-million dollar trust-funds were setup at the time as resettlement trust. In the following decades the trust fund, amounting to over 70 million dollars, delivered steady payments. In 2017 the KBE leaders requested unrestricted access to the whole Trust fund. The United States, which had previously monitored expenditures, reluctantly agreed. With full control over the Trust Fund, the total amount dropped from $70 million to $100,000 by early 2023. This triggered a financial collapse on on Kili, with defaults on loans, unpaid wages, and services were halted. This situation created a major crisis, with a large amount of finger pointing. There were criticisms directed at officials in the USA, but in the end they had no control over the expenditures in this time period. This triggered investigations and protests.

== Limited sea access ==

Kili cannot be reached by ship four months out of the year because of rough seas. The grass Kili Airport is served by Air Marshall Islands, although flights have been grounded when its aircraft are not operational, or when the runway is flooded by rising ocean .

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates Kili Elementary School. Students are zoned to Jaluit High School in Jaluit Atoll.

== Food production ==

Kili does not provide enough food for the transplanted residents. In 1949 the Trust Territory administration donated a ship for transporting copra between Kili and Jaluit Atoll. But the ship was washed by heavy surf onto the Kili reef in 1951 and was lost.

The main agricultural product of the island is currently copra. Island produce consists of (in descending order of quantity) coconuts, limes, breadfruit, squash, bananas, papayas, and sugar cane. Fishing in the ocean around the island is difficult due to the lack of protection by a lagoon.

The small island, about 1/6 the size of Bikini Atoll which is 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) long, also suffers from overpopulation. , the population is approximately 1000, composed primarily of descendants of refugees of Bikini. Residents must import food paid for by a settlement agreement with the United States government to supplement what they can grow locally.

Each family on the island receives 2–3 shipments a year consisting of 1–2 boxes of frozen chicken, 2–4 50-lb bags of flour, and 2–4 bags of rice; this shipment is provided by the Bikinian government in conjunction with the U.S. government. Imports are overseen by the Bikini Public Works Department, which also maintains houses and runs the power plant on the island. There is currently a government effort to increase farming on the island, but the coral reef soil is poor. However, there is a small farm that produces melons and some vegetables. There are several small stores operated out of homes that provide nonperishable food items such as salt, Tabasco, candy, and canned items.

Families on Kili live in cinder block houses with air-conditioning and electricity. Most houses on Kili have kitchens, but many prefer to cook outdoors in cook-huts over an open flame.

== Climate change impact ==

Beginning in 2011 the resettled residents of Kili Island began to experience periods of ocean flooding they attribute to global warming. The highest point of Kili Island is only above sea level. Ocean waves have covered portions of the island at least five times from 2011 to 2015, contaminating all of the wells on the island. The runway servicing the island is unusable during and after rains because it becomes extremely muddy. In August 2015, the Bikini Council passed a resolution requesting assistance from US government to modify terms of the Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini to be used for the population&#x27;s relocation once again, this time outside of the Marshall Islands.

== Churches and education ==

Kili has two Christian churches: the Assembly of God and Protestant church. There is an elementary school on Kili for students from Kindergarten to eighth grade. There is a class for each age group, in addition to one class for students with special needs. Classes typically range in size from 6 to 18 students. Some of the teachers are native to Kili, some come from neighboring islands. The Dartmouth Volunteer Teaching Program has placed 2–4 American volunteer teachers at the school every year since 2000. The teachers provide English language instruction in addition to other curricula because there are few instructional materials or books written in Marshallese. The American volunteers stay and teach for one or more years. Toward the end of their eighth grade year, students must pass a standardized test to gain admission to public high school in Jaluit or Majuro.

<text>Jane Smiley (born September 26, 1949) is an American novelist. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1992 for her novel &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; (1991).

==Biography==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Smiley grew up in Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, and graduated from Community School and from John Burroughs School. She obtained an AB in literature at Vassar College (1971), then earned an MA (1975), MFA (1976), and PhD (1978) from the University of Iowa. While working toward her doctorate, she also spent a year studying in Iceland as a Fulbright Scholar. From 1981 to 1996 she was a Professor of English at Iowa State University, teaching undergraduate and graduate creative writing workshops. In 1996, she relocated to California. She returned to teaching creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, in 2015.

===Career===
Smiley published her first novel, &quot;Barn Blind&quot;, in 1980, and won a 1985 O. Henry Award for her short story &quot;Lily&quot;, which was published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Her best-selling &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot;, a story based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1992. It was adapted into a film of the same title in 1997. Her novella &quot;The Age of Grief&quot; was made into the 2002 film &quot;The Secret Lives of Dentists&quot;. Her essay &quot;Feminism Meets the Free Market&quot; was included in the 2006 anthology &quot;Mommy Wars&quot; by &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Leslie Morgan Steiner. Her essay &quot;Why Bother?&quot; appears in the anthology &quot;Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting, &quot;published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in 2013.
&quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel&quot; (2005), is a non-fiction meditation on the history and the nature of the novel, somewhat in the tradition of E. M. Forster&#x27;s seminal &quot;Aspects of the Novel&quot;, that roams from eleventh century Japan&#x27;s Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; to 21st-century American women&#x27;s literature.

In 2001, Smiley was elected a member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters. She has participated in the annual &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Festival of Books, the Cheltenham Festival, the National Book Festival, the Hay Festival of Literature and the Arts, and many others. She won the PEN USA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006, and chaired the judges&#x27; panel for the prestigious Man Booker International Prize in 2009.

Jonathan Franzen, author of &quot;The Corrections&quot; (2001), considers Smiley&#x27;s book &quot;The Greenlanders&quot; to be greatly underappreciated and among the best works of contemporary American fiction.

Smiley&#x27;s then wrote a trilogy of novels about an Iowa family over the course of generations. The first novel of the trilogy, &quot;Some Luck&quot;, was published in 2014 by Random House. The second volume followed in the spring of 2015, and the third volume in the fall of 2015.

==Awards==
Smiley received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1992. In 2006, she received the Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award which is given annually in Rockville, Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried, as part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Festival.

<text>Deslandres is the heavily worn and distorted remains of a lunar impact crater. It is located to the southeast of the Mare Nubium, in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. In dimension it is the third-largest crater formation on the visible Moon, being beaten only by Clavius (231 km) and by the 303-kilometer-diameter walled plain Bailly. The northern and eastern parts of the floor display a relatively level surface, but it is pock-marked with numerous craters. There is a small region of mare material, due to basaltic lava, along the eastern interior floor.

The crater Walther is attached to the remnant of the eastern rim, and Ball intrudes into the southwestern rim. The crater remnant Lexell has broken across the southeastern rim, forming a &quot;harbor&quot; in the crater floor due to the wide gap in its northern rim. The irregular crater Regiomontanus is attached to the northeast rim of Deslandres. The crater Hell lies entirely within the western rim.

The satellite crater Hell Q lies at the center of a patch of higher albedo surface located in the eastern half of Deslandres. Around the time of the full moon this feature is one of the brightest spots on the lunar surface. The light hue indicates a relatively youthful feature in lunar geological terms. This patch is sometimes referred to as &quot;Cassini&#x27;s bright spot&quot;, as it was first mapped by Cassini in 1672 at the Paris Observatory.

This feature is so heavily eroded and degraded by overlapping impacts that it was not actually recognized as a crater formation until the 20th century. The name for this formation was suggested by Eugène M. Antoniadi in 1942, and was passed during the general assembly of the IAU in 1948.

According to one version, Luna 5 impacted lunar surface in this crater ().

The first released images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 were of the area in the southern part of this crater.

<text>Grimaldi is a large basin located near the western limb of the Moon. It lies to the southwest of the Oceanus Procellarum, and southeast of the crater Riccioli. Between Oceanus Procellarum is Damoiseau, and to the north is Lohrmann.

The inner wall of Grimaldi has been so heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts that it forms a low, irregular ring of hills, ridges and peaks, rather than a typical crater rim. However, there are peaks remaining that reach heights of over 2 kilometers. The mare lava floor is the most notable feature of this crater, forming a flat, relatively smooth and featureless surface with a particularly low albedo. The dark shade of the floor contrasts with the brighter surroundings, making the crater easy to locate. The approximate diameter of the inner rim is 174 kilometers.

Beyond the basin are the scattered remnants of an outer wall, which has a diameter of 220 kilometers. This exterior rim is more intact to the north and west of the crater than elsewhere. To the southeast of Grimaldi is a system of rilles named the Rimae Grimaldi. To the northwest, rilles belonging to the Rimae Riccioli approach the western edge of Grimaldi&#x27;s rim.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, has been identified in the center of Grimaldi (corresponding with the mare). The mascon was mapped at high resolution by GRAIL.

Grimaldi has a history of transient lunar phenomena, including occasional flashes of light, color patches, and areas of hazy visibility. Gaseous emissions from this area have also been detected using spectroscopy.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Grimaldi.

<doc id="960010" wikidata="Q2915508" url="?curid=960010" title="Charles Sobhraj">
<text>Charles Sobhraj (born Hotchand Bhawnani Gurmukh Sobhraj, 6 April 1944) is a French serial killer, fraudster, and thief who preyed on Western tourists travelling on the hippie trail of South Asia during the 1970s. He was known as the Bikini Killer because of the attire of several of his victims, as well as the Splitting Killer and the Serpent for &quot;his snake-like ability to avoid detection by authorities&quot;.

It is thought that Sobhraj murdered at least 20 tourists in South and Southeast Asia, including 14 in Thailand. He was convicted and jailed in India from 1976 to 1997. After his release he returned to France. Sobhraj went to Nepal in 2003, where he was arrested, tried, and given a life sentence. On 21 December 2022, the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered his release from prison because of his old age, after he had served 19 years of his prison term. On 23 December, he was released and deported to France. 

Described as &quot;handsome, charming and utterly without scruple&quot;, he used his looks and cunning to advance his criminal career and obtain celebrity status; he is known to have enjoyed his infamy. Sobhraj has been the subject of four biographies, three documentaries, a Bollywood film titled &quot;Main Aur Charles,&quot; 2021 eight-part BBC/Netflix drama series &quot;The Serpent&quot; and 2025 Netflix India series &quot;Black Warrant&quot;.

==Early years==
Hotchand Bhawnani Gurmukh Sobhraj was born on 6 April 1944 in Saigon, within the Indochinese Union, to an Indian Sindhi father and Vietnamese mother. Sobhraj&#x27;s birthplace being a French colonial territory made him eligible for French citizenship. His parents were never married and his father denied paternity. Sobhraj was taken in by his mother&#x27;s new husband, a French Army lieutenant stationed in French Indochina. His name was entered as Charles Gurmukh Sobhraj in church records in 1959. In his new family, he felt neglected in favour of the couple&#x27;s later children. Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between Southeast Asia and France with the family.

As a teenager, he began to commit petty crimes; he received his first custodial sentence for burglary in 1963, serving his sentence at Poissy prison near Paris. While imprisoned, Sobhraj manipulated prison officials into granting him special favours, such as being allowed to keep books in his cell. Around the same time, he met and endeared himself to Felix d&#x27;Escogne, a wealthy young man and prison volunteer.

After being paroled, Sobhraj moved in with d&#x27;Escogne and spent his time moving between the high society of Paris and the criminal underworld. He began accumulating riches through a series of burglaries and scams. During this time, Sobhraj met and began a romantic relationship with Chantal Compagnon, a young Parisian woman from a conservative family. Sobhraj proposed marriage to Compagnon but was arrested later the same day for attempting to evade police while driving a stolen vehicle. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, yet Chantal remained supportive throughout the entirety of his sentence. Sobhraj and Compagnon were married upon his release. By 1970, he had become a French citizen through his mother, as she was a natural-born citizen of Vietnam, a former French colony.

Sobhraj, along with a pregnant Compagnon, left France in 1970 for Asia to escape arrest. After travelling through Eastern Europe with fake documents, robbing tourists whom they befriended along the way, Sobhraj arrived in Bombay (Mumbai) later the same year. Chantal gave birth to a baby girl, Usha, in the city. In the meantime, Sobhraj resumed his criminal life, running a car theft and smuggling operation. Sobhraj&#x27;s growing profits went towards his budding gambling addiction.

In 1973, Sobhraj was arrested and imprisoned after an unsuccessful armed robbery attempt at a jeweller&#x27;s at The Ashok, in New Delhi. Sobhraj was able to escape, with Compagnon&#x27;s help, by faking illness, but was recaptured shortly thereafter. Sobhraj borrowed money for bail from his father, and soon afterwards fled to Kabul. There, the couple began to rob tourists on the hippie trail and were arrested again. Sobhraj escaped in the same way he had in India, feigning illness and drugging the hospital guard. Sobhraj fled to Iran, leaving his family behind. Compagnon, though still loyal to Sobhraj, wished to leave their criminal past and returned to France, vowing never to see him again.

Sobhraj spent the next two years on the run, using as many as 10 stolen passports. He passed through various countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sobhraj was joined by his younger half-brother, André, in Istanbul. Sobhraj and André became partners in crime, participating in various criminal activities in both Turkey and Greece. The duo were eventually arrested in Athens. After an identity-switch hoax went awry, Sobhraj managed to escape but his half-brother was left behind. André was handed over to the Turkish police by Greek authorities and served an 18-year sentence.

==Murders==
On the run, Sobhraj financed his lifestyle by posing as either a gem salesman or drug dealer to impress and befriend tourists, whom he defrauded. In India, Sobhraj met Marie-Andrée Leclerc from Lévis, Quebec, a tourist looking for adventure. Dominated by Sobhraj, Leclerc became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women.

Sobhraj gathered followers by gaining their loyalty; a typical scam was to help his target out of difficult situations. In one case, he helped two former French policemen, Yannick and Jacques, recover missing passports that Sobhraj himself had actually stolen. In another scheme, Sobhraj provided shelter to a Frenchman, Dominique Renelleau, who appeared to be suffering from dysentery; Sobhraj had actually poisoned him. He was joined by a young Indian man, Ajay Chowdhury, a fellow criminal who became Sobhraj&#x27;s second-in-command.

Sobhraj and Chowdhury committed their first known murders in 1975. Most of the victims had spent some time with the pair before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join them in their crimes. Sobhraj claimed that most of his murders were accidental drug overdoses of temazepam and heroin, but investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim was a young woman from Seattle, Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book &quot;Serpentine&quot;), who was found drowned in a tidal pool in the Gulf of Thailand, wearing a flowered bikini. It was months later that Knowlton&#x27;s post-mortem, as well as forensic evidence, proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident, was murder.

The next victim was a young nomadic Turkish Sephardic Jew, Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body was found on the road to the Pattaya resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. Dutch students Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fiancée Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in Hong Kong. They, like many others, were poisoned by Sobhraj, who nursed them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim&#x27;s French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend&#x27;s disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled Bintanja and Hemker out. Their bodies were found strangled and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar-styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj&#x27;s earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of the two women were not connected by investigators at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the sobriquet &quot;The Bikini Killer&quot;.

On 18 December, the day the bodies of Bintanja and Hemker were identified, Sobhraj and Leclerc entered Nepal using the deceased couple&#x27;s passports. They met in Nepal and, between 21 and 22 December, murdered Canadian Laurent Carrière, 26, and American Connie Jo Bronzich, 29. Sobhraj and Leclerc returned to Thailand, using their latest victims&#x27; passports before their bodies could be identified. Upon his return to Thailand, Sobhraj discovered that his three French companions had started to suspect him of serial murder, having found documents belonging to the murder victims. Sobhraj&#x27;s former companions then fled to Paris after notifying local authorities.

Sobhraj&#x27;s next destination was either Varanasi or Calcutta, where he murdered Israeli scholar Avoni Jacob to obtain Jacob&#x27;s passport. Sobhraj used the passport to travel with Leclerc and Chowdhury; first to Singapore, then to India, and, in March 1976, returning to Bangkok, despite knowing that the authorities there sought him. The clan were interrogated by Thai police in connection with the murders but were released.

Meanwhile, Dutch diplomat Herman Knippenberg and his then-wife Angela Kane were investigating the murders of Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met, Sobhraj, although the latter&#x27;s true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With the help of Nadine and Remi Gires (Sobhraj&#x27;s neighbours), Knippenberg built a case against him. He was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj&#x27;s apartment a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims&#x27; documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes.

The criminal trio&#x27;s next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was seen; neither Chowdhury nor his remains have been found. It is believed Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia in order to continue his and Leclerc&#x27;s roles as gem dealers in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in West Germany, but the claim appeared unsubstantiated, so the search for Chowdhury continued.

In May 1976, Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Sobhraj, which charged him with four murders in Thailand.

Back in Asia, Sobhraj started forming a new criminal group, starting with two Western women, Barbara Smith and Mary Ellen Eather, in Bombay. Sobhraj&#x27;s next victim was a Frenchman, Jean-Luc Solomon, who was poisoned during a robbery. The act was committed with the intention of incapacitating Solomon, but it killed him.

In July 1976 in New Delhi, Sobhraj, joined by his three-woman criminal clan, tricked a tour group of French post-graduate students into accepting them as tour guides. Sobhraj drugged them by giving them poisoned pills, which he told them were anti-dysentery medicine. When the drugs took effect more quickly than Sobhraj had anticipated, the students began to fall unconscious. Three of the students, realising what Sobhraj had done, overpowered him and contacted the police, leading to his capture. Sobhraj&#x27;s accomplices, Smith and Eather, confessed during interrogation. Sobhraj was charged with the murder of Solomon and all four were sent to Tihar Jail in New Delhi.

==Imprisonment in India==
Smith and Eather attempted suicide in prison during the two years before their trial. Sobhraj, who had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in bribing captors, was living comfortably in jail. He turned his trial into a spectacle, hiring and firing lawyers at will, bringing in his recently paroled brother André to assist, and eventually going on a hunger strike. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Leclerc was found guilty of drugging the French students but was later paroled and returned to Canada when she developed ovarian cancer. She was still claiming her innocence and was reportedly still loyal to Sobhraj when she died at her home in April 1984. She was 38.

Sobhraj&#x27;s systematic bribery of prison guards at Tihar reached outrageous levels. He led a life of luxury inside the prison, with television and gourmet food, having befriended both guards and prisoners. He gave interviews to Western authors and journalists, such as &quot;Oz&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Neville in 1977 and Alan Dawson in 1984. Neville was accompanied by his future wife, Julie Clarke, who has frequently written about him. Clarke has said that Sobhraj sold the rights to his life story to a Bangkok businessman, who then sold them to Random House. Because of Neville&#x27;s hippie trail connections, Random House offered him a contract to go to Delhi to research the case, even though he and Clarke, both journalists in New York City, had no experience in crime reporting. They were out of their depth, having to deal with Sobhraj&#x27;s &#x27;creepy emissaries,&#x27; who kept them under surveillance and arranged for them to visit him in prison, where he described the murders in detail. Clarke was very relieved when they left Delhi.

Although Sobhraj had freely talked to Neville and Clarke about his murders, he later denied everything he had told them, and pretended his actions were in retaliation against &quot;Western imperialism&quot; in Asia.
Sobhraj&#x27;s prison sentence in India was due to end before the 20-year Thai statute of limitations expired, ensuring his extradition and almost certain execution for murder in Thailand. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, Sobhraj threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills and walked out of the prison. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Bombay Police apprehended Sobhraj in O&#x27;Coqueiro Restaurant in Goa; his prison sentence was extended by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence, and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.

==Imprisonment in Nepal==
Sobhraj retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris. He charged large sums of money for interviews and photographs. The rights to a film based on his life were sold for over US$15 million.

In 2003, Sobhraj returned to Nepal, one of the few countries where he could still be arrested and where he was still eagerly sought by authorities. According to &quot;The Himalayan Times&quot;, Sobhraj had returned to Kathmandu to set up a mineral water business. His return is thought to have been the result of his yearning for attention and overconfidence in his own intellect.

On 1 September 2003, Sobhraj was spotted by a journalist for &quot;The Himalayan Times&quot; in a casino in Kathmandu. The journalist followed him for two weeks and wrote a news report in &quot;The Himalayan Times&quot; with photographs. The Nepalese police saw the report, raided the casino and arrested an unaware Sobhraj, who was still gambling there. The police reopened the double murder case in 1975. On 20 August 2004, Sobhraj was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Kathmandu district court for the 1975 murder of Connie Jo Bronzich.

Most of the photocopy evidence used against him in this case had been gathered by Knippenberg, the Dutch diplomat, his then-wife Angela Kane and Interpol. Sobhraj appealed against the conviction, claiming he had been sentenced without trial. His lawyer announced that Chantal Compagnon, Sobhraj&#x27;s wife in France, was filing a case before the European Court of Human Rights against the French government for refusing to provide him with any assistance.

In late 2007, Sobhraj&#x27;s lawyer appealed to then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy for intervention with Nepal. In 2008, Sobhraj announced his engagement to a Nepali woman, Nihita Biswas, who later participated in the reality show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;. The authenticity of the couple&#x27;s relationship was confirmed in an open letter from American conductor David Woodard to &quot;The Himalayan Times&quot;. On 7 July 2008, issuing a press release through his fiancée Biswas, Sobhraj claimed he was never convicted of murder by any court, and asked the media not to refer to him as a serial killer.

It was claimed that Sobhraj married his fiancée on 9 October 2008 in prison during the Bada Dashami festival. The following day, Nepalese authorities dismissed the claim of his marriage. They said that Biswas and her family had been allowed to conduct a tika ceremony, along with the relatives of hundreds of other prisoners. They further claimed that it was not a wedding but part of the ongoing Dashain festival when elders put the vermilion mark on the foreheads of those younger than them to signify their blessings.

In July 2010, the Supreme Court of Nepal postponed the verdict on an appeal filed by Sobhraj against a district court&#x27;s verdict sentencing him to life imprisonment for the murder of American backpacker Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. Sobhraj had appealed against the Kathmandu district court&#x27;s verdict in 2006, calling it unfair.

On 30 July 2010, the Supreme Court upheld the life sentence issued by the district court for the murder of Connie Jo Bronzich, plus another year and a Rs 2,000 fine for entering Nepal illegally. The seizure of all Sobhraj&#x27;s properties was also ordered by the court. Sobhraj&#x27;s supposed wife Biswas and mother-in-law Shakuntala Thapa, a lawyer, expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict, with Thapa claiming that Sobhraj had been denied justice and that the &quot;judiciary is corrupt&quot;. They were charged and sent to judicial custody for contempt of court because of these remarks.

On 18 September 2014, Sobhraj was convicted in the Bhaktapur district court of the 1975 murder of Canadian tourist Laurent Carrière, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 2018, Sobhraj was in critical condition and had received several open-heart surgeries and was scheduled for more.

On 21 December 2022, the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered his release from prison because of old age, after serving 19 years of his prison term. He was ordered to leave the country within 15 days. On 23 December 2022, he was released from prison on account of his age and good behaviour. He was deported to France and will not be able to return to Nepal for at least 10 years.

== Personal life ==
In 2010, he married his Indian-Nepali interpreter, Nihita Biswas, in prison. The daughter of his lawyer, she was 20 years old and 44 years his junior. One of the prison staff told &quot;Paris Match&quot; in 2021: &quot;It&#x27;s a legend; there is no proof of their union&quot;. She told the media that his gaze and his eyes were mesmerizing and that his French charm had done everything. In 2017, she donated blood to save him during an open-heart operation.

==Portrayal==
Sobhraj has been the subject of three non-fiction books, &quot;Serpentine&quot; (1979) by Thomas Thompson, &quot;The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj&quot; (1980) by Richard Neville and Julie Clarke, and the section titled &quot;The Bikini Murders&quot; by Noel Barber in the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; collection &quot;Great Cases of Interpol&quot; (1982). Neville and Clarke&#x27;s book was the basis for a 1989 made-for-TV film, &quot;Shadow of the Cobra&quot;.

The 2015 Hindi film &quot;Main Aur Charles&quot;, directed by Prawaal Raman and Cyznoure Network, is reportedly based on Charles Sobhraj&#x27;s escape from Tihar Jail in New Delhi. The film was initially produced by Pooja Bhatt, but due to disagreements during the shoot, Bhatt left the film.

An eight-part BBC-commissioned miniseries called &quot;The Serpent&quot; was broadcast in the UK in January 2021, starring Tahar Rahim as Sobhraj, before being streamed on Netflix in April 2021.

Netflix released &quot;Black Warrant&quot; based on a book by the same name in January 2025 where Sidhant Gupta played the role of Charles Sobhraj.

<text>Dornfelder () is a dark-skinned variety of grape of German origin used for red wine. It was created by August Herold (1902–1973) at the grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg region in 1955. Herold crossed the grape varieties Helfensteiner and Heroldrebe, the latter which bears his name, to create Dornfelder. Helfensteiner (Frühburgunder/Pinot Noir Précoce × Trollinger/Schiava Grossa) and Heroldrebe (Blauer Portugieser × Blaufränkisch/Lemberger) were both crosses created some decades earlier by Herold. Dornfelder received varietal protection and was released for cultivation in 1979. It was named in honor of Immanuel August Ludwig Dornfeld (1796–1869), a senior civil servant who was instrumental in creating the viticultural school in Weinsberg.

Traditionally, the red wines of Germany were mostly pale and light-bodied, but new breeds of dark-skinned grapes led by Dornfelder have allowed the production of more internationally styled reds. Dornfelder
has a depth of color, good acidity and the ability to benefit from barrique aging and the associated oak flavours. In comparison to traditional red wine varieties of Germany, Dornfelder is easier to grow than Spätburgunder, has better resistance to rot than Blauer Portugieser (as well as deeper color, more powerful flavours and more tannin), has stronger stalks than Trollinger, ripens earlier than Lemberger, and achieves higher must weights, i.e., higher natural alcohol levels than most of these varieties. Dornfelder can be very productive, and yield up to 120 hectoliter per hectare, but quality-conscious producers typically keep yields much lower. Higher-quality Dornfelder wines are velvety textured, slightly floral, often show flavours of plums, blackberries or cherries, and are typically oaked. Sometimes the wines have a hint of sweetness.

Dornfelder is the second most grown red wine grape variety in Germany. Steadily increased plantings throughout the 1980s and 1990s allowed it to overtake Blauer Portugieser in 2001. It has established itself in most German regions, and been particularly successful in Rheinhessen and the Palatinate. In 2006, Dornfelder was grown on in Germany, and no longer has an increasing trend.

==History and relationship to other grapes==

Dornfelder was created in 1956 at the Weinsberg Research Center in Baden-Württemberg by German grape breeder August Herold. The variety was created as a cross of two &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; crossing previously created by Herold, Helfensteiner (a cross of Frühburgunder/Pinot Précoce noir and Trollinger/Schiava Grossa created in 1931) and Heroldrebe (a cross of Blauer Portugieser and Blaufränkisch/Lemberger created in 1929). The variety was named after one of the 19th century founders of the school of viticulture at Weinsberg, Immanuel August Ludwig Dornfeld.

Originally created as a blending variety to add color to the pale red wines of Germany, plantings of Dornfelder were initially slow to take off. By 1970 there was only around of the variety planted. The grape was officially approved for German wine production in 1980 with plantings rapidly increasing throughout the rest of the 20th century. From 2000 to 2005-2006, plantings again doubled as wine produced from Dornfelder earn commercial success.

As a successful &quot;vinifera&quot; crossing, Dornfelder was used as a parent variety to create several new varieties including Acolon (a 1971 crossing with Blaufränkisch), Cabernet Dorio (a 1971 crossing with Cabernet Sauvignon), Cabernet Dorsa (another 1971 crossing with Cabernet Sauvignon) and Monarch (a 1988 crossing with Solaris).

==Viticulture==
Dornfelder was bred to be a vigorous and high yielding grape variety, easily capable of producing up to 120 hl/ha (≈ 6 tons/acre), with a high concentration of color phenolics that can contribute to producing a darker colored red wine than what was typically found in German wine regions. The variety tends to be an early to mid budding and ripening grapevine with thick skins that give it good resistance to the viticultural hazards of fungal infections such as botrytis bunch rot.

==Wine regions==

Most plantings of Dornfelder can be found in its viticultural homeland of Germany where there were plantings of the grape in production in 2012. Nearly of those plantings were found in Germany&#x27;s two largest wine regions, the Palatinate and Rheinhessen. From Germany, plantings of Dornfelder spread in the late 20th century to nearby Switzerland where, by 2009, there were found mostly in the cantons of Schwyz and Zürich.

The grape was first introduced to England in the late 1980s where it has mostly been used for rosés and sparkling wine production. While some English producers do make light bodied red wines, its use for red wine production has largely fallen out of favor as the hybrid grape Regent gains in popularity. By 2007 there were an estimated in England. In the Czech Republic, there are some limited plantings of Dornfelder.

Outside of Europe, Dornfelder can be found in the Lodi and Sta. Rita Hills AVA of California, the Finger Lakes AVA of New York as well as in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Plantings of the grape can also be found in Canada in the British Columbia wine region of Vancouver Island. In the Rio Grande do Sul region of Brazil, some South American wine producers are experimenting with the variety as are Japanese winemakers on the island of Hokkaido where there of Dornfelder in production as of 2009.

==Styles==

Due to its thick skins that are high in phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, Dornfelder tends to produce deeply colored red wines that can have a soft, rich texture in the mouthfeel. The wine usually have a fair amount of acidity with some examples showing floral aroma notes. The overall quality of the wines produced from Dornfelder tend to be dependent on harvest yields with wines produced from lower yields being more likely to have the concentration of fruit needed to complement a period of oak aging that can add more body and complexity to the wine.

Early in its history, German producers would use Dornfelder to make Beaujolais nouveau style wine using carbonic maceration to make a light bodied, fruity wine, sometimes with a bit of residual sugar. Today, most examples of Dornfelder are fermented dry, though some off-dry examples exist, with flavors of sour cherry and blackberries.

==Synonyms==
The only known synonyms for Dornfelder are its breeding codes Weinsberg S 341 and We S 341. S for seedling, WE S for Weinsberg seedling.

<doc id="960014" wikidata="Q7734756" url="?curid=960014" title="The Forces of Evil">
<text>The Forces of Evil was an Orange County-based ska punk band, formed in January 2001 with the intention of creating a ska supergroup, being the side project of fellow ska punk band Reel Big Fish. The band released their only album, &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;, in 2003. They split in 2005 after releasing a four-song EP, which was available on their website.

==History==
Aaron Evil, guitar (Aaron Barrett), of Reel Big Fish fame, formed The Forces Of Evil in January 2001 by recruiting three members of the then recently defunct ska group Jeffries Fan Club at their farewell concert, Justin Evil, drums (Justin Ferreira), Chris Evil, trombone (Chris Colonnier) and Derek Evil, bass (Derek Gibbs). Jay Evil, trumpet (Jay Lafayette of The Scholars) and Jonny Evil, trombone (John Throop of Lone Raspberry) were later added to the line-up, and with the addition of friend John Evil, trumpet (John Christianson), the band was made complete.

According to Barrett, He created the Forces of Evil as a fall-back plan, as he believed that Reel Big Fish was going to tank after releasing &quot;Cheer Up!&quot;, thinking everyone would hate it. In the commentary for the Reel Big Fish DVD &quot;You&#x27;re All In This Together,&quot; He said he started FoE because &quot;if Reel Big Fish was over, then I&#x27;d still want to prove to everyone that I still love ska and love to play it.&quot; 

Between formation and June 2002, the band played many concerts across the U.S., playing both songs written by the band and covers of other songs from many genres.

In June 2002, the band released their first record, an EP titled &quot;Because We Care...&quot;, featuring tracks that had seen popular receptions during concerts. The first album to be released by The Forces Of Evil appeared in October 2003, titled &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot; and featuring all of the tracks previously released on the EP as well as many new tracks, one of particular note being &quot;Fight&quot;, which was the theme song for Ska Summit 2003, a huge achievement for such a newly formed band and one that served to increase the group&#x27;s popularity not only in US Ska circles but also in Ska fans across the world. As such, the band was signed by Jive Records.

In 2005, The Forces Of Evil disbanded, while in the process of recording their second album for Jive Records. Finished songs from the planned album were later posted on the internet under the title &quot;Four Song Obituary&quot;.

Barrett later stated the work effort was too similar to the work he was doing with Reel Big Fish, and he decided to concentrate his efforts on the other band. Barrett also noted the president of Jive at the time of the release of &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot; was angered by the fact that it was not the new Reel Big Fish album, and wondered why it wasn&#x27;t; former Reel Big Fish bassist Matt Wong said he wondered the same thing as well.

<text>Conrad Michael Richter (October 13, 1890 – October 30, 1968) was an American novelist whose lyrical work is concerned largely with life on the American frontier in various periods. His novel &quot;The Town&quot; (1950), the last story of his trilogy &quot;The Awakening Land&quot; about the Ohio frontier, won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His novel &quot;The Waters of Kronos&quot; won the 1961 National Book Award for Fiction. Two collections of short stories were published posthumously during the 20th century, and several of his novels have been reissued during the 21st century by academic presses.

==Early life==
Conrad Michael Richter was born in 1890 in Tremont, Pennsylvania, near Pottsville, to John Absalom Richter, a Lutheran minister, and Charlotte Esther (née Henry) Richter. Coming from a long line of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors, his grandfather, uncle and great-uncle were also Lutheran ministers, and descended from German colonial immigrants. As a child, Richter lived with his family in several small central Pennsylvania mining towns, where he encountered descendants of pioneers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who shared family stories. These inspired him later to write historical fiction set in changing American frontiers. Attending local public schools, Richter finished his formal education when he graduated high school at age fifteen.

==Early career, marriage and move to New Mexico==
At the age of 19, Richter started working as an editor of a local weekly newspaper, the Patton, Pennsylvania &quot;Courier&quot;. In 1911 Richter relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, and worked as the private secretary to a wealthy manufacturing family. Richter married Harvena Maria Achenbach in 1915. They had their only child, Harvena Richter, in 1917. Richter worked subsequently for a small publishing company, initiated a juvenile magazine, and started writing short stories. During the 1930s, he also performed two brief stints as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Hollywood, California.

Richter continued writing and trying to sell short stories. In 1913, a young Conrad Richter sent manuscripts to literary editor Frederic Taber Cooper. Responding to Richter’s letter, Cooper writes that he does not give “gratuitous opinions on manuscripts, either to friends or strangers ... I suspect that your main difficulty is that, in straining after originality, you fail to make your stories ring true. Try to be simpler.” His short story &quot;Brothers of No Kin,&quot; published in &quot;Forum&quot; magazine in 1914, was included in the &quot;Roll of Honor for 1914&quot; of American stories by Edward J. O&#x27;Brien, editor of the &quot;Best Short Stories of 1915.&quot; O&#x27;Brien wrote in his &quot;Introduction&quot; that Richter&#x27;s story was the best of all those published in 1914; the editor was explicitly concerned with the development of an &quot;American literature&quot; and considered Richter as integral to this. This short story was re-issued as the title story of a posthumous collection published in 1973.

In 1928 Richter relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the sake of his wife&#x27;s health. During this period, he also collected much material from which he created short stories about the Southwest frontier days. By 1933, Richter and his wife had returned to live in his hometown of Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. They subsequently alternated between Pine Grove, Albuquerque, and Florida.

==Writing career==
During the early 1930s, Richter had numerous stories published in pulp magazines such as &quot;Triple-X&quot;, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, &quot;Complete Stories&quot;, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, and &quot;Blue Book&quot;. His &quot;Early Americana and Other Stories&quot; (1936) was considered his first successful book.

He persisted with his work, gradually writing and publishing full-length novels. Richter set his novels in different periods of American history on its changing frontier. He may be best known for &quot;The Sea of Grass&quot; (1936), set in late nineteenth-century New Mexico, and featuring conflict between ranchers and farmers. It was later adapted as a movie of the same name, directed by Elia Kazan and featuring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, released in 1947.

Richter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; (1953), set in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania and Ohio, featured challenges faced by a young white man who had become an assimilated Lenape Amerindian after being taken captive as a child. After the boy was returned as a youth to white culture, he was considered suspicious. This novel also became very popular and had a second life as a movie, released in 1958. Richter returned to the topic of the white child raised in an alien culture in his later novel &quot;A Country of Strangers&quot; (1966). As noted by Ernest Cady in his review in the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, both books were written from the point of view of Indians. He wrote of Richter,

He simply tells how he thinks things were for both Indians and whites, in a hard time of violence and danger and change on a raw frontier. And does it so convincingly that the reader senses that this indeed, is how it must have been.

During this period, Richter also published the novels of his trilogy The Awakening Land, about the Ohio frontier: &quot;The Trees&quot; (1940), &quot;The Fields&quot; (1946), and &quot;The Town&quot; (1950). In 1947 he won the Ohioana Book Award for &quot;The Fields.&quot; &quot;The Town&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1951. In a review of the last novel, Louis Bromfield, also an Ohio writer and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, wrote of the trilogy:

the three books are not only concerned with Sayward and her family but the growth and the astonishingly rapid development of a whole area which has played a key role in the nation&#x27;s history… Mr. Richter has reproduced the quality and the speech of these people so well that a thousand years from now, one may read his books and know exactly what these people were like and what it was like to have lived in an era when within three or four generations a frontier wilderness turned into one of the great industrial areas of the earth…. &#x27;The Town&#x27; stands on its own as an entity and may be read on its own as a full, rich and comprehensive novel based upon the lives of ordinary people, brave and ever heroic in their own small way...
The trilogy was first published in one volume in 1966 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was adapted as a TV miniseries of the same name in 1978, in which several plot changes were made as a result of the changing social culture of the time, especially concerning race and sexuality. 
Richter&#x27;s short story, &quot;Doctor Hanray&#x27;s Second Chance&quot;, first published in the magazine &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1950 (June 10), has a theme of reconciling with the past. Richter returned to this theme in his 1960 autobiographical novel, &quot;The Waters of Kronos&quot; (Chronos). (Chronos was the ancient Greek personification of Time.) This novel won the U.S. National Book Award in 1961.

The short story &quot;Doctor Hanray&quot; was republished in the anthology, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post Fantasy Stories&quot; (1951) and in several later speculative fiction anthologies published by the &quot;Post&quot; and others. The Internet Speculative Fiction Database catalogs five of Richter&#x27;s stories, including a very early one, &quot;The Head of His House&quot;, from a 1917 anthology, &quot;The Grim Thirteen&quot; (Dodd, Mead).

After Richter&#x27;s death, two short story collections were published posthumously. Additionally, several of his novels have been reissued by academic presses. When &quot;The Waters of Kronos&quot; was reissued in paperback format in 2003, one reviewer wrote,

<text>Formula Vee (Formula Fau Vee in Germany) or Formula Volkswagen is a popular open wheel, single-seater junior motor racing formula, with relatively low costs in comparison to Formula Ford.

On the international stage, Niki Lauda, Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg, all Formula 1 champions, and Scott Dixon, a six-time IndyCar champion, raced Formula Vees in Europe, New Zealand, or America at the beginning of their careers. In Australia, V8 Supercar drivers Larry Perkins, Colin Bond, John Blanchard, John Bowe, Jason Bargwanna and Paul Stokell were also racers in Formula Vee.

Formula First, raced in the US and New Zealand, employs the same chassis, but with upgraded motor, brakes and steering. Australia&#x27;s modern Formula Vee car rules are the definition for Formula First in these countries

==Description==

The class is based on the pre-1963 Volkswagen Beetle, utilizing a collection of stock parts to form a competitive race car around a purpose-built tube frame and racing tires. The VW engine, transmission, front suspension, brakes, and wheels are stock or modified stock parts. The body is fiberglass or carbon fiber. The intention of this class is for the average person to be able to build and maintain the car.

Over the years, the rules have evolved to improve performance, lower cost, and to allow the replacement of discontinued parts. In 2003, &quot;Grassroots Motorsports&quot; presented Formula Vee with the Editors&#x27; Choice Award.

Unlike many open-wheel formulas, Formula Vee cars are not permitted to use wings or ground effect to produce aerodynamic downforce. The lack of these features, the limited engine power, and the similar performance of the cars makes taking advantage of slipstreaming a key tactic.

The engines are based on either the 1200cc or 1600cc variants of the Volkswagen Beetle engine. Unlike many amateur categories, competitors are permitted to build and tune their engines themselves, within strict limitations on the extent of modifications from stock permitted. The 1600cc engines used in the Australian Formula Vee series produce approximately &quot;70-75hp&quot;; the original 1200cc engine produces considerably less. This makes Formula Vee cars among the least powerful vehicles used in circuit racing (for comparison, the contemporary Formula 4 category uses 160 hp engines).

A top-running Formula Vee car will go and corner at about 1.6 g. It weighs a minimum of with driver or with driver as raced in the Australian specification.

Purchasing and running a Formula Vee car is relatively affordable compared to most motorsport categories. In 2022, a brand-new race car for the Australian Formula Vee series was estimated to cost approximately AU$50,000 to AU$55,000 (approximately $US37,000), with competitive second-hand cars costing much less. Renting a car for a race meeting was estimated at $A1000 (approximately $US700).

Each year, Formula Vee is one of the classes at the SCCA Runoffs, which awards a national championship. While it is primarily a class in the Sports Car Club of America, many other organizations have adopted Formula Vee as a class.

==Variants==
Variants of the Formula Vee rules exist in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the UK &amp; Ireland, South Africa, and New Zealand.

Particularly notable is Formula First, racing in the US and New Zealand, which employs the same chassis, but with later model Beetle parts, a larger motor (New Zealand uses the variant) and other upgraded components such as disc brakes rack and pinion steering.

(Formula Super Vee, although initially similar, soon moved to water-cooled VW four-cylinder engines for higher-tech and faster cars).

<text>The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) is an agency of the United States Department of Transportation. MARAD administers financial programs to develop, promote, and operate the U.S. Maritime Service and the U.S. Merchant Marine. In addition, it conducts research and development activities in the maritime field; regulates the transfer of U.S. documented vessels to foreign registries; maintains equipment, shipyard facilities, and reserve fleets of Government-owned ships essential for national defense. MARAD also maintains the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) as a ready source of ships for use during national emergencies and logistically supporting the military when needed.

==History==
When the United States Maritime Commission was abolished on May 24, 1950, its functions were split between the Federal Maritime Board which was responsible for regulating shipping and awarding subsidies for construction and operation of merchant vessels, and Maritime Administration, which was responsible for administering subsidy programs, maintaining the national defense reserve merchant fleet, and operating the United States Merchant Marine Academy.

In 1961, the Federal Maritime Board regulatory functions were assumed by the newly created Federal Maritime Commission, while the subsidy functions were assigned to the Maritime Subsidy Board of the Maritime Administration.

On August 6, 1981, MARAD came under control of the Department of Transportation thereby bringing all transportation programs under one cabinet-level department.

==Leadership==
*Ann C. Phillips, Administrator 
*Lucinda Lessley, Deputy Maritime Administrator
*Kevin Tokarski, Associate Administrator, Strategic Sealift
*Vice Admiral Jack Buono, USMS, Superintendent, United States Merchant Marine Academy
*Delia Davis, Associate Administrator, Administration
*Corey Beckett, Associate Administrator, Budget and Programs/Chief Financial Officer 
*Michael Carter, Associate Administrator, Environment and Compliance
*William Paape, Associate Administrator, Ports &amp; Waterways
*David Heller, Associate Administrator, Business and Finance Development

==Maritime Academies==
The Maritime Administration collaborates with stakeholders from all transportation sectors and modes in order to accomplish its mission to improve the U.S. marine transportation system. MARAD operates one federal service academy and administers a Grant-In-Aid Program for six state-operated maritime academies:

Students at these academies can graduate with appropriate United States Coast Guard licenses (Mate or Engineer) if they choose to take the Coast Guard License exam. They may become commissioned reserve officers in any branch of the service when graduating from USMMA or a ROTC scholarship from one of the other maritime schools.

==Subsidies==
The Maritime Subsidy Board negotiates contracts for ship construction and grants operating-differential subsidies to shipping companies.

==Maritime Security Program==
The Maritime Administrator is vested with the residual powers of the Director of the National Shipping Authority, which was established in 1951 to organize and direct emergency merchant marine operations.

The Maritime Security Program (MSP) authorizes MARAD to enter into contracts with U.S.-flag commercial ship owners to provide service during times of war or national emergencies. As of 2007, ten companies have signed contracts providing the MSP with a reserve of sixty cargo vessels.

<text>Maginus is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands to the southeast of the prominent crater Tycho. It is a large formation almost three quarters the diameter of Clavius, which lies to the southwest. Just to the north of Maginus is the smaller crater Proctor, and to the southeast is Deluc.

The rim of Maginus is heavily eroded, with impact-formed incisions, and multiple overlapping craters across the eastern side. The wall is broken through in the southeast by Maginus C, a worn crater. Little remains of the original features that formed the rim of Maginus, and it no longer possesses an outer rampart. The floor is relatively flat, with a pair of low central peaks.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maginus.

In 1994, Cocquivacoa won Venezuela&#x27;s first Little League World Series title. Then aged 10, Quiróz started every game that season as a catcher. Two year later, Quiróz won the Senior League World Series.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===

Quiróz was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays as a non-drafted free agent in 1998, before his 17th birthday, with a $1 million signing bonus. He progressed through Toronto&#x27;s system as the team&#x27;s number-one catching prospect. In addition, Baseball America rated him as the Blue Jays&#x27; third best prospect in their 2004 pre-season rankings, and the 35th best prospect in all of baseball.

Defensively, Quiróz has good skills. In 2003, he threw out 45% of base stealers, and was the starting catcher for the World Team in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game.

He missed the end of the 2003 season with a collapsed lung. The broken hand and torn arm muscle he suffered in 2004 hurt his chances of taking over as the Blue Jays&#x27; starting catcher in 2005. Gregg Zaun and Greg Myers were re-signed to give Quiróz more time in the minors. However, Quiróz was set further back that season, due to shoulder strain and another collapsed lung.

In 2006, the Blue Jays signed catcher Jason Phillips initially as the backup to Gregg Zaun. They later signed Bengie Molina to be their new starter. This placed three catchers ahead of Quiróz on the Blue Jays&#x27; depth chart.

===Seattle Mariners===
On March 31, 2006, Quiróz was put on waivers by the Blue Jays, but was picked up by the Seattle Mariners on the same day.

<doc id="960034" wikidata="Q5244526" url="?curid=960034" title="De La Salle High School (Concord, California)">
<text>De La Salle High School is a private Lasallian Catholic school for boys run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers of the San Francisco New Orleans District within the Diocese of Oakland. It is located in Concord, California. The school was founded in 1965.

De La Salle currently enrolls 1,036 students, and roughly 99% of each graduating class goes on to attend a university or college. It is home to the Spartans, the athletic varsity teams of the school, and its school colors are green and silver. The school motto is &quot;Les Hommes De Foi&quot;, French for &quot;Men Of Faith,&quot; which is based on the order&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;Signum Fidei&quot;.

==Athletics==
===Baseball===
The De La Salle baseball team as of 2023 had won six straight North Coast Section (NCS) Championships, and five of the prior eight EBAL Championships. It won the inaugural CIF Division 1 NorCal Championships in 2022, and again in 2023. In 2015-16 it was 25-3 and was ranked second in the nation.

In 2017-18 it was 26-4 and was ranked second in the nation. As a sophomore in 2018 future San Francisco Giants pitcher Kyle Harrison was 9-1 with a 1.17 ERA. He was named EBAL Pitcher of the Year, a 2018 MaxPreps National All-American, and Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass. In 2018-19 it was 29-1 and was ranked second in the nation. As a junior in 2019 Harrison was 10–0 with a 1.26 ERA for the Spartans, with 103 strikeouts in 61 innings, and also played first base.

Connor “Bear” Harrison, Kyle Harrison&#x27;s younger brother, in May 2023 was named Cal-Hi Sports North Coast Section Baseball Player of the Year after batting .419 while playing catcher his junior year; he also played first base and pitched as a closer. In his senior season in 2023, Bear batted .404 and was named first team all-state and the Bay Area News Group Player of the Year.

===Football===
De La Salle High School holds the national record 151-game winning streak spanning from 1992 to 2004. The streak occurred under the leadership of Bob Ladouceur, who began coaching at the school in 1979. It ended when they were defeated on September 4, 2004, by Bellevue High School (Washington), outside Seattle. De La Salle finished the 2007 football season 13–0 and as state champions. In 2009, De La Salle defeated Crenshaw 28–14 to win the state title again. In 2010, De La Salle defeated Servite, ranked #7 in the nation, 48–8, to win the state title game for a second straight year. De La Salle finished the season 14–0 and ranked #1 in the nation by MaxPreps.

During the winning streak, De La Salle was named national champion in seven different years; once by ESPN (1994), five times by &quot;USA Today&quot; (1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003), and once by the National Sports News Service (1999). The Spartans have been named national champions by ESPNRISE.com (formerly Student Sports) six times, including four straight years (2000–03). They have also been honored as the top team in California 19 times (1992, 1994–2003, 2007, 2009–2012, 2014–2015) and competed in 25 California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) North Coast Section (NCS) championship games with 23 victories (12 of which were attained during the 151-game winning streak). For the 2008–2009 school year, De La Salle was ranked the 18th best high school football team in the country by &quot;USA Today&quot;, the 37th by ESPNRISE, the 19th by MaxPreps, and the 14th by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

In somewhat recent years, the team has won the California Open Division State Championships six times (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015). They have appeared in the Open Division state title game every year from the founding of the division in 2008 until 2019. Prior, they had competed in Division I, where they were the 2007 State Champions and the 2006 and 2008 runner-up. They have won the North Coast Section championships every year since 1992, with the league&#x27;s restructuring. From 1991 to 2021, they had a streak of 318 games without a loss when playing Northern California schools (going 316–0–2). This ended on September 10, 2021, when they lost to St. Francis High School of Mountain View. The Lancers, coached by St. Francis alum Greg Calcagno, beat De La Salle in the closing seconds of the game by the score of 31-28.

==Campus ministry and spirituality==

In the minds of the Brothers, their purpose &quot;is to give a human and Christian education to the young, especially the poor, according to the ministry which the Church has entrusted to it.&quot;
 De La Salle Concord sponsors Nativity school in Shinara, Eritrea. Students have the opportunity to participate in many retreats and immersion experiences throughout their time at the school, including a &quot;Ven a Ver&quot; program (Come to See), which involves spending five days with the disadvantaged people of Salinas or Tijuana.

== In media ==
The De La Salle football team was the subject of two 2003 books. &quot;One Great Game: Two Teams, Two Dreams, in the First Ever National Championship High School Football Game&quot;, by Don Wallace, follows the undefeated 2001 season and national championship showdown with Long Beach Polytechnic High School, and splits its focus between the schools. &quot;When the Game Stands Tall&quot; was written by &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; sportswriter Neil Hayes, who followed the team for practices, games, and meetings during its undefeated 2002 season. The foreword was written by former Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa. The 2014 movie &quot;When the Game Stands Tall&quot; is based on Neil Hayes&#x27; book&quot;.&quot;

<text>The verge (or crown wheel) escapement is the earliest known type of mechanical escapement, the mechanism in a mechanical clock that controls its rate by allowing the gear train to advance at regular intervals or &#x27;ticks&#x27;. Verge escapements were used from the late 13th century until the mid 19th century in clocks and pocketwatches. The name verge comes from the Latin &quot;virga&quot;, meaning stick or rod.

Its invention is important in the history of technology, because it made possible the development of all-mechanical clocks. This caused a shift from measuring time by continuous processes, such as the flow of liquid in water clocks, to repetitive, oscillatory processes, such as the swing of pendulums, which had the potential to be more accurate. Oscillating timekeepers keep time for all modern clocks.

==Verge and foliot clocks==
The verge escapement dates from 13th-century Europe, where its invention led to the development of the first all-mechanical clocks. Starting in the 13th century, large tower clocks were built in European town squares, cathedrals, and monasteries. They kept time by using the verge escapement to drive a &quot;foliot&quot;, a primitive type of balance wheel. The foliot was a horizontal bar with weights near its ends affixed to a vertical bar called the verge which was suspended free to rotate. The verge escapement caused the foliot to oscillate back and forth about its vertical axis. The rate of the clock could be adjusted by moving the weights in or out on the foliot.

The verge escapement probably evolved from an alarm mechanism to ring a bell which had appeared centuries earlier. There has been speculation that Villard de Honnecourt invented the verge escapement in 1237 with an illustration of a strange mechanism to turn an angel statue to follow the sun with its finger, but the consensus is that this was not an escapement.

It is believed that sometime in the late 13th century the verge escapement mechanism was applied to tower clocks, creating the first mechanical escapement clock. In spite of the fact that these clocks were celebrated objects of civic pride which were written about at the time, it may never be known when the new escapement was first used. This is because it has proven difficult to distinguish from the meager written documentation which of these early tower clocks were mechanical, and which were water clocks; the same Latin word, &quot;horologe&quot;, was used for both. None of the original mechanisms have survived unaltered. Sources differ on which was the first clock &#x27;known&#x27; to be mechanical, depending on which manuscript evidence they regard as conclusive. One candidate is the Dunstable Priory clock in Bedfordshire, England built in 1283, because accounts say it was installed above the rood screen, where it would be difficult to replenish the water needed for a water clock. Another is the clock built at the Palace of the Visconti, Milan, Italy, in 1335. Astronomer Robertus Anglicus wrote in 1271 that clockmakers were trying to invent an escapement, but hadn&#x27;t been successful yet. However, there is agreement that mechanical clocks existed by the late 13th century.

The earliest description of an escapement, in Richard of Wallingford&#x27;s 1327 manuscript &quot;Tractatus Horologii Astronomici&quot; on the clock he built at the Abbey of St. Albans, was not a verge, but a variation called a &#x27;strob&#x27; escapement. It consisted of a pair of escape wheels on the same axle, with alternating radial teeth. The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the staggered teeth pushed past. Although no other example is known, it is possible that this design preceded the more usual verge in clocks.

For the first two hundred years or so of the mechanical clock&#x27;s existence, the verge, with foliot or balance wheel, was the only escapement used in mechanical clocks. In the sixteenth century alternative escapements started to appear, but the verge remained the most used escapement for 350 years until mid-17th century advances in mechanics, resulted in the adoption of the pendulum, and later the anchor escapement.
Since clocks were valuable, after the invention of the pendulum many verge clocks were rebuilt to use this more accurate timekeeping technology, so very few of the early &quot;verge and foliot&quot; clocks have survived unaltered to the present day.

How accurate the first verge and foliot clocks were is debatable, with estimates of one to two hours error per day being mentioned, although modern experiments with clocks of this construction show accuracies of minutes per day were achievable with enough care in design and maintenance. Early verge clocks were probably no more accurate than the previous water clocks, but they did not require water to be manually hauled to fill the reservoir, did not freeze in winter, and were a more promising technology for innovation. By the mid-17th century, when the pendulum replaced the foliot, the best verge and foliot clocks had achieved an accuracy of 15 minutes per day.

==Verge pendulum clocks==
Most of the gross inaccuracy of the early verge and foliot clocks was due not to the escapement itself, but to the foliot oscillator. The first use of pendulums in clocks around 1656 suddenly increased the accuracy of the verge clock from hours a day to minutes a day. Most clocks were rebuilt with their foliots replaced by pendulums, to the extent that it is difficult to find original verge and foliot clocks intact today. A similar increase in accuracy in verge watches followed the introduction of the balance spring in 1658.

== How it works ==

The verge escapement consists of a wheel shaped like a crown, called the escape wheel, with sawtooth-shaped teeth protruding axially toward the front, and with its axis oriented horizontally. In front of it is a vertical rod, the verge, with two metal plates, the pallets, that engage the teeth of the escape wheel at opposite sides. The pallets are not parallel, but are oriented with an angle in between them so only one catches the teeth at a time. Attached to the verge at its top is an inertial oscillator, a balance wheel or in the earliest clocks a &quot;foliot&quot;, a horizontal beam with weights on either end. This is the timekeeper of the clock.

As the clock&#x27;s gears turn the crown wheel &quot;(see animation)&quot;, one of its teeth catches on a pallet, pushing on it. This rotates the verge and foliot in one direction, and rotates the second pallet into the path of the teeth on the opposite side of the wheel, until the tooth slides off the end of the pallet, releasing it. Then the crown wheel rotates freely a short distance until a tooth on the wheel&#x27;s opposite side contacts the second pallet, pushing on it. This reverses the direction of the verge rod and foliot, rotating the verge back the other direction, until this tooth pushes past the second pallet. Then the cycle repeats. The result is to change the rotary motion of the wheel to an oscillating motion of the verge and foliot. Each swing of the balance wheel thus allows one tooth of the escape wheel to pass, advancing the wheel train of the clock by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward at a constant rate. The moment of inertia of the foliot or balance wheel controls the oscillation rate, determining the rate of the clock. The escape wheel tooth, pushing against the pallet each swing, provides an impulse which replaces the energy lost by the foliot to friction, keeping it oscillating back and forth.

In a verge pendulum clock &quot;(see picture)&quot; which appeared after the pendulum was invented in 1656, the escapement was turned 90° so the verge rod was horizontal, while the escape wheel&#x27;s axis was vertical, located under the verge rod. In the first pendulum clocks the pendulum was attached to the end of the verge rod instead of the balance wheel or foliot. In later pendulum clocks the pendulum was suspended by a short straight spring of metal ribbon from the clock frame, and a vertical arm attached to the end of the verge rod ended in a fork which embraced the pendulum rod; this avoided the friction of suspending the pendulum directly from the pivoted verge rod. Each swing of the pendulum released an escape wheel tooth.

The escape wheel must have an odd number of teeth for the escapement to function. With an even number, two opposing teeth will contact the pallets at the same time, jamming the escapement. The usual angle between the pallets was 90° to 105°, resulting in a foliot or pendulum swing of around 80° to 100°. In order to reduce the pendulum&#x27;s swing to make it more isochronous, the French used larger pallet angles, upward of 115°. This reduced the pendulum swing to around 50° and reduced recoil (below), but required the verge to be located so near the crown wheel that the teeth fell on the pallets very near the axis, reducing initial leverage and increasing friction, thus requiring lighter pendulums.

==Disadvantages==
As might be expected from its early invention, the verge is the most inaccurate of the widely used escapements. It suffers from these problems:
* Verge watches and clocks are sensitive to changes in the drive force; they slow down as the mainspring unwinds. This is called lack of isochronism. It was much worse in verge and foliot clocks due to the lack of a balance spring, but is a problem in all verge movements. In fact, the standard method of adjusting the rate of early verge watches was to alter the force of the mainspring. The cause of this problem is that the crown wheel teeth are always pushing on the pallets, driving the pendulum or balance wheel throughout its cycle; the timekeeping element is never allowed to swing freely. Thus a decreasing drive force causes the pendulum or balance wheel to swing back and forth more slowly. All verge watches and spring driven clocks required fusees to equalize the force of the mainspring to achieve even minimal accuracy.
* The escapement has &quot;recoil&quot;, meaning that the momentum of the foliot or pendulum pushes the crown wheel backward momentarily, causing the clock&#x27;s wheel train to move backward, during part of its cycle. This increases friction and wear, resulting in inaccuracy. One way to tell whether an antique watch has a verge escapement is to observe the second hand closely; if it moves backward a little during each cycle, the watch is a verge. This is not necessarily the case in clocks, as there are some other pendulum escapements which exhibit recoil.
* In pendulum clocks, the wide pendulum swing angles of 80°-100° required by the verge cause an additional lack of isochronism due to circular error.
* The wide pendulum swings also cause a lot of air friction, reducing the accuracy of the pendulum, and requiring a lot of power to keep it going, increasing wear. So verge pendulum clocks had lighter bobs, which reduced accuracy.
* Verge timepieces tend to accelerate as the crown wheel and the pallets wear down. This is particularly evident in verge watches from the mid-18th century onward. It is not in the least unusual for these watches, when run today, to gain many hours per day, or to simply spin as if there were no balance present. The reason for this is that as new escapements were invented, it became the fashion to have a thin watch. To achieve this in a verge watch requires the crown wheel to be made very small, magnifying the effects of wear.

==Decline==
Verge escapements were used in virtually all clocks and watches for 400 years. Then the increase in accuracy due to the introduction of the pendulum and balance spring in the mid 17th century focused attention on error caused by the escapement. By the 1820s, the verge was superseded by better escapements, though inexpensive verge watches continued to be made through the 19th century.

In pocketwatches, besides its inaccuracy, the vertical orientation of the crown wheel and the need for a bulky fusee made the verge movement unfashionably thick. French watchmakers adopted the thinner cylinder escapement, invented in 1695. In England, high end watches went to the duplex escapement, developed in 1782, but relatively inexpensive verge fusee watches continued to be produced until the mid 19th century, when the lever escapement took over. These later verge watches were colloquially called &#x27;turnips&#x27; because of their bulky build.

The verge was only used briefly in pendulum clocks before it was replaced by the anchor escapement, invented around 1660 probably by Robert Hooke, and widely used beginning in 1680. The problem with the verge was that it required the pendulum to swing in a wide arc of 80° to 100°. Christiaan Huygens in 1674 showed that a pendulum swinging in a wide arc is an inaccurate timekeeper, because its period of swing is sensitive to small changes in the drive force provided by the clock mechanism.

Although the verge is not known for accuracy, it is capable of it. The first successful marine chronometers, H4 and H5, made by John Harrison in 1759 and 1770, used verge escapements with diamond pallets., In trials they were accurate to within a fifth of a second per day.

Today the verge is seen only in antique or antique-replica timepieces. Many original bracket clocks have their Victorian-era anchor escapement conversions undone and the original style of verge escapement restored. Clockmakers call this a &quot;verge reconversion&quot;.

<doc id="960042" wikidata="Q1276093" url="?curid=960042" title="Humboldt (crater)">
<text>Humboldt is a large lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. Due to foreshortening this formation has an extremely oblong appearance. The actual shape of the crater is an irregular circle, with a significant indentation along the southeastern rim where the prominent crater Barnard intrudes. To the north-northwest of Humboldt is the large crater Hecataeus. Phillips is attached to the western rim. The rim of Humboldt is low, worn, and irregular in outline. The central peak forms a range on the crater floor. The floor surface contains a network of rilles forming a pattern of radial spokes and concentric arcs. There are also some dark patches located near the walls to the northeast, northwest, and southeast. There is a chain of craters leading from the northwest crater rim to a distance almost as long as the crater is wide. This formation is designated Catena Humboldt. Due to its location near the lunar limb, little detail was known about this crater until it was photographed by orbiting spacecraft (mainly Lunar Orbiter 4).

The crater was named after German philologist Wilhelm von Humboldt by the IAU.

Humboldt is one of the largest craters of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Humboldt. Humboldt N is the largest crater within Humboldt itself, located north of the central peak. Humboldt B is located to the south of Humboldt, on the west rim of the crater Barnard.

== Catena Humboldt ==
Catena Humboldt is a crater chain that extends northeast from crater Humboldt, and it is approximately 162 km long. It was named by the IAU in 1976. It passes between the craters Gibbs and Schorr.
==Apollo 12 Views==
The Apollo 12 mission in 1969 obtained many photographs of Humboldt crater. In the photos below, the central peaks appear white because of the high-Sun elevation angle. The arcuate fractures within Humboldt are evidence of the forces working on the surface of the Moon to change the lunar topography.
==Apollo 15 Views==
The Apollo 15 mission in 1971 obtained many more photographs of Humboldt crater.

In 2000, the Oireachtas (bicameral parliament of Ireland) enacted a law giving the Minister for Public Enterprise the power to make regulations regarding the registration of .ie domain names. In 2007 this power was transferred to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

== Registration policy ==

The IEDR is considered more conservative than other similar authorities and places certain restrictions on registration. The .ie ccTLD is primarily a business orientated ccTLD for Irish businesses and businesses doing business in or with Ireland. It has allowed personal domain name (PDN) registrations, though these would only account for approximately 1% of the number of .ie domain registrations. An individual is allowed to register their own name or a variant of it with a utilities bill or passport as proof of entitlement.

Registration policies have been liberalised somewhat in recent years and rules such as the one against registering generic domain names have been dropped. The .ie ccTLD is a managed ccTLD where applicants for .ie domain names have to provide proof of entitlement to the domain that they want to register. In August 2017 IEDR began a consultation on removing this restriction and allowing first-come first-served registration; the requirement of a connection to Ireland will remain.

Registration is restricted to entities with a connection to Ireland. Thus, American singer Melanie was not allowed to register codice_1; whereas Microsoft, which has a corporate presence in Ireland, was allowed to register codice_2, a domain hack whose full name reflects its purpose as support for IE (Internet Explorer).

In February 2016 IEDR began a consultation on the introduction of internationalized domain names, in particular the vowel + &quot;fada&quot; characters (á é í ó ú) used in Irish orthography. IDN domains were launched on a phased basis starting with existing domain holders on 23 October 2016, with general availability starting on 17 November 2016.

== Registering a domain ==

The typical registration fee via accredited .ie registrars is approximately €25 (plus VAT of €5.75). Registration is free for charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. Evidence of entitlement to the domain name (such as evidence of entitlement to use a particular business name via a Registered Business Name certificate or registered company name) and a connection with the island of Ireland are required for registration. The requirement to provide a &#x27;claim to the name&#x27; was removed in March 2018, following public consultation.

== Second-level domains ==

There is no official second-level domain policy. A number of domain names, typically those of other TLDs, two letter domains and potentially offensive domains are forbidden from being registered. Nevertheless, the Government of Ireland began using the codice_3 domain where once it used codice_4. Some government departments continue to use their own non codice_5 domains.

Prior to 16 December 2015, two character domains consisting of one letter and one number were permitted, but two-letter domain registrations were not permitted. The only exceptions to the old two letter rule were codice_6, which was registered by the University of Limerick before the rule came into effect, and codice_7, which is used for the .ie name servers. The domains in the &quot;forbidden&quot; category will return a record for a WHOIS query but they are not in the .ie zone. In June 2015, the IEDR announced that two-letter names would soon be available; a 30-day registration began in November for a go-live date of 16 December 2015. Where there were multiple applicants for a given combination, an auction was held in early 2016.

== Number of registered domains ==

On 31 March 2022, there were 330,000 registered .ie domain names. This has surpassed the number of Irish-owned and or hosted .com domain names. It is the preferred extension for new Irish businesses. Approximately 140 new .ie domains are registered each working day.

<doc id="960062" wikidata="Q7492781" url="?curid=960062" title="Sheffield Wicker railway station">
<text>Wicker railway station (later Wicker Goods railway station) was the first railway station to be built in Sheffield, England. It was to the north of the city centre, at the northern end of the Wicker, in the fork formed by Spital Hill and Savile Street. It was opened on 31 October 1838 as the southern terminus of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, which ran north to Rotherham Westgate railway station.

In 1840, the line was connected to the North Midland Railway at Rotherham Masborough railway station. Carriages from Sheffield would be attached to North Midland trains for onward travel. A southbound curve was added in 1869.

On 1 January 1847, a half-mile connecting line from the Wicker to the Bridgehouses station of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had been constructed in order to increase goods traffic and enable wagon transfers. This short steeply graded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the &quot;Fiery Jack&quot;.

Wicker was replaced as a passenger station by Sheffield Midland Station on 1 February 1870 when the Midland Railway opened a new direct route from Chesterfield to just north of Wicker, now part of the Midland Main Line. Railway workers refer to this route as the &quot;New Road&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Old Road&quot; of the original North Midland line. It has gradients of 1 in 100, a viaduct and three tunnels, including Bradway Tunnel, long.

Wicker remained open as a goods station until 1965 and has now been demolished. The site is currently occupied by a Tesco Extra supermarket, having previously contained car dealerships and was, until 2006 when the Spital Hill / Savile Street corner was remodelled as part of the Sheffield Northern Relief Road, the home of Amanda King&#x27;s &quot;Made In Sheffield&quot; sculpture, now removed.

<doc id="960065" wikidata="Q544104" url="?curid=960065" title="Solomon Grundy (nursery rhyme)">
<text>&quot;Solomon Grundy&quot; is an English nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19299.

==Lyrics==
The rhyme has varied very little since it was first collected by James Orchard Halliwell and published in 1842 with the lyrics:

The words of a French version of the rhyme were adapted by the Dada poet Philippe Soupault in 1921 and published as an account of his own life:

PHILIPPE SOUPAULT dans son lit / né un lundi / baptisé un mardi / marié un mercredi / malade un jeudi / agonisant un vendredi / mort un samedi / enterré un dimanche / c&#x27;est la vie de Philippe Soupault

<text>This list of lakes in France roughly distinguishes three categories: the mountain lakes, sorted first by massif, and then by &quot;départements&quot;; the lakes in plains, sorted by river basin; and the coastal lakes.

Lake Geneva (Lac Léman), the largest in western Europe with , partly in France, partly in Switzerland, is listed in Haute-Savoie for its French part.

==Mountain lakes==

The lakes of mountain massifs can be natural, often of glaciary origin (G), or volcanic (V), or artificial, generally built for hydraulic energy purposes (H) or flow regulation (F).

<text>Gay News was a fortnightly newspaper in the United Kingdom founded in June 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE). At the newspaper&#x27;s height, circulation was 18,000 to 19,000 copies.

==History of &quot;Gay News&quot;==
The original editorial collective included Denis Lemon (editor), Martin Corbett (who later was an active member of ACT UP), David Seligman, a founder member of the London Gay Switchboard collective, Ian Dunn of the Scottish Minorities Group (and later co-founder of the Paedophile Information Exchange), Glenys Parry (national chair of CHE), Suki J. Pitcher, and Doug Pollard, who later went on to launch the weekly gay newspaper, &quot;Gay Week&quot; (affectionately known as &quot;Gweek&quot;) (he later became a presenter on &quot;Joy Melbourne 94.9FM&quot;, Australia&#x27;s first full-time GLBTI radio station, and was for a time editor of &quot;Melbourne Star&quot;, the city&#x27;s fortnightly gay newspaper). Amongst Gay News&#x27;s early &quot;Special Friends&quot; were Graham Chapman of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, his partner David Sherlock, and Antony Grey, secretary of the UK Homosexual Law Reform Society from 1962 to 1970.

Sex between men had been partially decriminalised for males over the age of 21 in England and Wales with the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. After the Stonewall Riots in New York in 1969, the Gay Liberation Front spread from the United States to London in 1970. &quot;Gay News&quot; was the response to a nationwide demand by lesbians and gay men for news of the burgeoning liberation movement.

The paper played a pivotal role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. It was described by Alison Hennegan (who joined the newspaper as Assistant Features Editor and Literary Editor in June 1977) as the movement&#x27;s &quot;debating chamber&quot;. Although essentially a newspaper, reporting alike on discrimination and political and social advances, it also campaigned for further law reform, including parity with the heterosexual age of consent of sixteen, against the hostility of the church which treated homosexuality as a sin, and the medical profession which treated homosexuality as a pathology. It campaigned for equal rights in employment (notably in the controversial area of the teaching profession) and the trades union movement at a time when left politics in the United Kingdom was still historically influenced by its Nonconformist roots in its hostility to homosexuality. But under the influence of its features editors, Howes and Hennegan, it also excavated the lesbian and cultural history of past decades as well as presenting new developments in the arts. Keith Howes later published the encyclopaedic reference, &quot;Broadcasting It&quot;, ostensibly dealing with homosexuality in film, radio and TV from 1923 to 1993 but amounting to a cultural review of British homosexuality in the 20th century.

Two of the paper&#x27;s news staff, Michael Mason and Graham McKerrow, later founded the London weekly newspaper &quot;Capital Gay&quot; which was launched in June 1981.

&quot;Gay News&quot; challenged the authorities from the outset by publishing personal contact ads, in defiance of the law; in early editions this section was always headlined &quot;Love knoweth no laws.&quot;

In the first year of publication, editor Denis Lemon was charged and fined for obstruction, for taking photographs of police behaviour outside the popular leather bar in Earls Court, the Coleherne pub.

In September 1973 &quot;Gay News,&quot; in conjunction with the Gay Liberation Front, recognised that they were receiving a large volume of information calls to their offices. Accordingly, they put out a call for a switchboard to be organised. Six months later, on 4 March 1974, the London Gay Switchboard (now Switchboard - LGBT+ Helpline) was formed. &quot;Gay News&quot; alongside Switchboard and the Health Education Council went on to hold the first open conference on HIV/AIDS in Britain on 21 May 1983. At this conference Mel Rosen, of Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis, New York, declared &quot;I hope you get very scared today because there is a locomotive coming down the tracks and it&#x27;s leaving the United States.&quot;

In 1974, &quot;Gay News&quot; was charged with obscenity, having published an issue with a cover photograph of two men kissing. It won the court case.

The newspaper was featured in the 1975 film &quot;Tommy&quot;.

In 1976 Mary Whitehouse brought a private prosecution of blasphemy (&quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot;) against both the newspaper and its editor, Denis Lemon, over the publication of James Kirkup&#x27;s poem &quot;The Love that Dares to Speak its Name&quot; in the issue dated 3 June 1976. Lemon was found guilty when the case came to court in July 1977 and sentenced to a suspended nine-month prison sentence and personally fined £1,000. When all totalled up, fines and court costs awarded against Lemon and &quot;Gay News&quot; amounted to nearly £10,000. After a campaign and several appeals the suspended prison sentence was dropped, but the conviction remained in force. The case drew enormous media coverage at the time. In 2002 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play about the trial.

Gay News Ltd ceased trading on 15 April 1983.

==Campaign against W.H. Smith==
One of the biggest problems the newspaper faced was that, although it was not an obscene publication, sale outlets were hard to find. W.H. Smith then controlled about one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK through a wholly owned subsidiary. They rejected the paper&#x27;s initial request for distribution, citing the low potential for sales. In July 1975, after the paper&#x27;s readership had grown, W.H. Smith agreed to distribute the paper in its London bookstalls. In January 1978, W.H. Smith dropped &quot;Gay News&quot; from distribution after a row with the paper over its coverage of the Paedophile Information Exchange. W.H. Smith&#x27;s action prompted widespread backlash, causing protests outside of its branches and at the firm&#x27;s Annual General Meeting. In 1982, W.H. Smith again agreed to distribute the paper, noting that its circulation figures of approximately 20,000 copies per issue made it financially attractive.

<text>Lake Paladru (&quot;Lac de Paladru, nicknamed &quot;Lac Bleu&quot; by local residents&quot;) is a small lake located in the Isère &quot;département&quot; of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, near Charavines, in France.

The lake was formed by the glacier of the Rhône. It is 5.3 kilometres long and 1.2 kilometres wide when full, the maximum depth is 36 metres. The lake is shared between four municipalities and two cantons. It is the fifth largest natural lake of glacier origin in France.

It is a major archaeological site, with several protected natural areas that are inaccessible by the public.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Lake Paladru is located in the Isère &quot;département&quot;, in the region of the Miocene hills of Bas-Dauphiné called &quot;Terres froides&quot; and between the towns of Voiron and La Tour-du-Pin. It extends in a north-east or south-west orientation over 5.3 kilometres for a width of 650 metres. The average depth is 25 metres, with a maximum depth of 36 metres. The lake contains 97 million m³ of water, and is located 492 metres above sea level.

Four municipalities share the lake; Charavines to the south, Villages du Lac de Paladru (merge of Le Pin and Paladru in 2017) to the west and north, Montferrat and Bilieu to the east.

The main beaches are located at the northern and southern ends, the shores on the side have a steeper gradient.

=== Access ===
The lake is bordered by two departmental roads which allow access:

* The route départementale 50 (D50) which connects the town of La Bâtie-Divisin (at a junction with the D1075) to the town of La Murette (at a junction with the D520)
* The route départementale 90 (D90) which connects the town of Charavines with Villages du Lac de Paladru along the eastern shore.

The lake is located about 5 kilometres from the A48 autoroute, which connects the A43 to Grenoble. The lake can be accessed from either junction 9 for Rives, or junction 10 for Voiron.

=== Hydrography ===

==== Water source ====
The lake is fed by two streams which are two tributaries of La Fure:

* the Courbon, a 3.7 kilometre long stream which originates at Montferrat and joins the lake at Paladru.
* the Surand, also known as Chantabot or Marais stream. This is an outlet from the Vivier pond, a body of water located in the municipality of Valencogne.

==== The source of La Fure ====
La Fure enters the lake at Charavines. This river joins the Isère at Tullins, after 20 kilometres having crossed Rives.

=== Weather ===
The lake area has a cool temperate climate. The north–south orientation and relatively high altitude means the average temperature is around 10 °C. Rainfall is irregular, with most rain occurring in June and October with the rise of humid air masses from the Mediterranean. January is the coldest month, with freezing occurring frequently.

== Toponymy ==
There are two possibilities to explain the origin of the name:

* the word &quot;palud&quot; (sometimes written palue) means &quot;marais&quot; (marsh in English) in ancient French. The term &quot;Paladru&quot;, attached to the village of the same name, is similar to this term. A marsh is located north of the lake.
* According to Dauphinois historian Nicolas Chorier, the term Paladru could refer to the presence of oaks (&quot;δρύς&quot; &quot;drús&quot; in Greek).

== History ==
Between 1909 and 1913, the lake served as an experimental ground for prototype seaplanes built by Raymond de Montgolfier.

<text>Beauvais–Tillé Airport (; ) , branded as Paris-Beauvais Airport, is an international airport near the city of Beauvais in the commune of Tillé in France. In 2016, it was the tenth busiest airport in France, handling 3,997,856 passengers, and is mostly used by charter and low-cost airlines.

Despite its brand name, the airport is located in the Hauts-de-France region and north-northwest of Paris.

==History==
===German use during World War II===
This airport was built in the 1930s and seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France. Beauvais was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation. Known units assigned (all from Luftflotte 3, Fliegerkorps IV):

* Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) June – 24 October 1940 Dornier Do 17Z-2 (Fuselage Code: F1+)
* Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 (SKG 1) July 1940 Junkers Ju 87B Stuka

The initial German use of the airport was as a bomber base. kg 76 and SKG 1 both took part in the Battle of Britain. kg 76 was reduced to 19 out of 29 serviceable machines by 18 August 1940. kg 76 raided London on 7 and 15 September 1940.

* Kampfgeschwader 26 (KG 26) September 1940 – February 1941 Heinkel He 111H (Fuselage Code: 1H+)
* Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77) 3–22 March 1941 Junkers Ju 88A-1 (Fuselage Code: 3A+)
* Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) 30 June – 19 July 1941 Heinkel He 111H (Fuselage Code: 5J+)
* Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54) 9 July – 16 August 1942 Junkers Ju 88A-1 (Fuselage Code: B3+)
* Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6) December 1942 – February 1943 Junkers Ju 88A-1 (Fuselage Code: K6+)

With the Luftwaffe switching to night attacks on England, the badly damaged units at Beauvais were replaced by a series of He 111 and Ju 88A units that carried out anti-shipping missions (KG 26, KG 77) and night bombing missions over England (KG 4, KG 54, KG 6).

* Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) 15 August – 3 October 1943 Focke-Wulf Fw 190A
* Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) 6–30 June 1944 Messerschmitt Bf 109G

The increasing number and frequency of USAAF Eighth Air Force Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator daylight heavy bomber raids over occupied Europe and Germany made the Luftwaffe move out the bomber units and assign day interceptor fighter units to attack the American bombers as part of the Defense of the Reich. After the invasion of Normandy, elements of JG 1 were moved to France and were tasked with providing air support to the German army, along with their normal air defense role against Allied bombers.

In response to the interceptor attacks, Beauvais was attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers with 500-pound general-purpose bombs, unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the North American P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep.

===American use===
It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 3 September 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command 818th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft. Little battle damage was sustained, and the airport became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as Advanced Landing Ground &quot;A-61&quot; about 15 September, also being known as &quot;Beauvais/Tille Airfield&quot;.

From Beauvais, the Ninth Air Force 322d Bombardment Group flew B-26 Marauder medium bombers from mid-September until March 1945. Once the combat unit moved east, the airport was used by transport units, flying in supplies from England and evacuating combat casualties on the return trip. The Americans returned full control of the airport to French authorities on 17 August 1945.

===Development since the 1950s===
In 1950, the Air Ministry offered to provide the wartime air base to NATO as part of the Cold War development of the alliance.

Demolition crews arrived and removed the wartime wreckage, and any unexploded munitions were removed from the site. Funding shortages did not allow the construction of an jet runway, dispersal pads and other features found at a modern military airfield. Instead, in 1953, the NATO plans for Beauvais were discontinued and the airport was returned to private hands.

==Facilities==
===Control tower===
The new control tower is active since 22 January 2019. It is located on the southern side of the airport and is replacing the one of 1962, sitting between the two terminals.

===Runway===
The main runway has an Instrument landing system CAT III for runway 12 and CAT I for runway 30 plus a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) for both runways. This enables aircraft to land at the airport in bad weather conditions, with visibility as low as 75 metres.

===Terminal===
When the low-cost airline Ryanair chose Beauvais–Tillé in May 1997 for three daily connections with Dublin, the terminal of this regional airport consisted of a simple hangar built in 1979. Since then four additional stations for planes and in 2010 a second terminal of had to be built to face a significant increase in traffic. The airport is equipped to handle medium-sized passenger jets. Since 2007 the ban on night flying has been strictly enforced for the benefit of local residents. The terminal building closes between the hours of 23:30 and 06:30. The airport has two terminals, some restaurants, snack bars, and shopping areas, both airside and in the publicly accessible area. An Ibis Budget hotel, which provides 78 rooms, has been built next to Terminal 2.

<doc id="960088" wikidata="Q7996106" url="?curid=960088" title="Whitehouse v Lemon">
<text>Whitehouse v Lemon is a 1977 court case involving the blasphemy law in the United Kingdom. It was the last successful blasphemy trial in the UK.

==&quot;The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name&quot;==

&quot;The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name&quot; is a poem by James Kirkup. It is written from the viewpoint of a Roman centurion who describes having sex with Jesus after his crucifixion, and also says that Jesus had had sex with other men including disciples, guards, and Pontius Pilate. The poem itself was considered of low artistic value, both by critics and the author himself.

In 1976 the poem was published in &quot;Gay News&quot;, with an accompanying illustration.
== Prosecution ==
In early November 1976, Mary Whitehouse obtained a copy of the poem and announced her intention to bring a private prosecution against the magazine. Leave to bring this prosecution was granted on 9 December 1976. The charges named Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon as the publishers. A charge against Moore Harness Ltd for distributing was subsequently dropped. The indictment described the offending publication as &quot;a blasphemous libel concerning the Christian religion, namely an obscene poem and illustration vilifying Christ in his life and in his crucifixion&quot;.

The Gay News Fighting Fund was set up in December 1976. Judge Alan King-Hamilton QC heard the trial at the Old Bailey on 4 July 1977, with John Mortimer QC and Geoffrey Robertson QC representing the accused and John Smyth representing Mary Whitehouse. 

=== Verdict and sentence ===
On Monday 11 July, the jury found both defendants guilty. Gay News Ltd was fined £1,000. Denis Lemon was fined £500 and sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment suspended. It had been &quot;touch and go&quot;, said the judge, whether he would actually send Denis Lemon to jail.

Mary Whitehouse&#x27;s costs of £7,763 were ordered to be paid four-fifths by Gay News Ltd and one-fifth by Lemon. 

=== Appeals ===
Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon appealed against conviction and sentence. On 17 March 1978, the Court of Appeal quashed Denis Lemon&#x27;s suspended prison sentence but upheld the convictions on the basis that the law of blasphemy had been developed before &quot;mens rea&quot;, literally, a &quot;guilty mind&quot;, became an essential element of a crime. 

&quot;Gay News&quot; readers voted by a majority of 20 to 1 in favour of appealing to the House of Lords. The Law Lords heard the appeal against conviction and delivered their judgment on 21 February 1979. 

At issue was whether or not the offence of blasphemous libel required specific intent of committing such a blasphemy. By a majority of 3 to 2, the Lords concluded that intention was not required. Lord Scarman was of the opinion that blasphemy laws should cover all religions and not just Christianity and sought strict liability for those who &quot;cause grave offence to the religious feelings of some of their fellow citizens or are such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read them&quot;. The appeal was lost.
The European Commission of Human Rights declared the case inadmissible to be heard by the European Court of Human Rights on 7 May 1982. The £26,435 raised by the Gay News Fighting Fund through benefits and donations from the gay community and others, including a £500 donation from Monty Python, was sufficient to cover the costs of the trial and appeals.

==Abolition of blasphemous libel as an offence==
Blasphemous libel ceased to be a common law offence in England and Wales with the passing of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.

==Later appearances of the poem==
In 1996, the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement was investigated by the police after publishing a hyperlink to the Queer Resources Directory, an American website, that included a copy of the poem. In April 1997 the police declared that they did not intend to prosecute. The investigation was commented on by civil liberties groups as raising issues about whether linking constituted legally publication. However, it did not produce a legal precedent on the question as it did not go to court.

In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of the poem took place on the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, London, without any incidents. Kirkup criticized the politicizing of his poem.

<doc id="960101" wikidata="Q7575798" url="?curid=960101" title="Speiser v. Randall">
<text>Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958), was a U.S. Supreme Court case addressing the State of California&#x27;s refusal to grant to ACLU lawyer Lawrence Speiser, a veteran of World War II, a tax exemption because that person refused to sign a loyalty oath as required by a California law enacted in 1954. The court reversed a lower court ruling that the loyalty oath provision did not violate the appellants&#x27; First Amendment rights.

==Facts==
The State of California allowed a number of tax exemptions one of which was an exemption of property tax for veterans of World War II. Anyone desiring to claim the exemption was required to complete a standard form of application and submit the form with the local tax assessor.

In 1954, the form was revised to add a loyalty oath, which the applicant had to sign: &quot;I do not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means, nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in event of hostilities.&quot;

The appellants refused to sign the oath and contended the condition of requiring the oath to obtain a tax exemption was unconstitutional. The assessors denied the exemption solely because the appellants had refused to execute the oath by signature. The assessors based their reasoning on Article XX, 19, of the California Constitution, adopted in a general election in 1952, which includes language similar to the text of the loyalty oath.

==Issue==
Was the oath requirement a violation of the appellants&#x27; First Amendment rights and a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

==Lower courts==
The appellees argued that a tax exemption is a privilege and so its denial did not infringe on free speech. The lower California courts did not agree and recognize that conditions imposed on privileges provided by the state had to be reasonable.

However, the Supreme Court of California construed the constitutional amendment to deny the tax exemption only to claimants who may be criminally punished under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act (California Statute 1919, c. 188) or the Federal Smith Act (18 U.S.C. 2385).

==Decision==
The US Supreme Court in its review asked a more basic question: with the loyalty oath, has California chosen a fair method to determine whether a tax exemption claimant is in fact someone to whom the criminal acts specified applies. In other words, though it is reasonable to deny a claimant a tax exemption if the claimant is involved in a criminal behavior, has the state arrived at a mechanism that demonstrates the criminal behavior?

The court ruled that because the state requires the claimant to show they are not advocating state overthrow and hence are not criminals within the applicable laws, the loyalty oath requirement to obtain the tax exemption is unconstitutional. The burden of proof for a criminal action rests on the state and not on the individual private citizen. In other cases, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of loyalty oaths requirements but those involved public officials and not private citizens.

<text>The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) is an Internet exchange point based in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Established in the early 1990s, AMS-IX is a non-profit, neutral and independent peering point.

==History==


In February 1994, a layer 2 shared infrastructure, used between academic institutes, was connected with CERN to exchange traffic. Other Internet service providers were allowed to connect and the name AMS-IX was first used. In 1997, the AMS-IX Association was founded by twenty of the connected Internet service providers and carriers.

In 2002, the Neutral Internet Exchange was founded as an alternative or backup for the Amsterdam Internet Exchange.

in November 2008 The total amount of data transferred by month was 75,940 TB (Avg. incoming and outgoing) . By April 2009, it had grown to 124,550 TB, 64% more in a 5-month period. , AMS-IX connected 396 members on 684 ports and had peak incoming traffic of 1.513 Tbit/s and of outgoing traffic 1.512 Tbit/s (compared to 0.833 Tbit/s average incoming and outgoing in January 2012.) In November 2016, AMS-IX broke through the 5 Tbit/s ceiling.

These traffic speeds made the Amsterdam Internet Exchange the second largest Internet exchange in the world in 2010, when measured by number of connected members and by Internet traffic, next to the Deutscher Commercial Internet Exchange (traffic).

In September 2013, the board voted to create a legal framework to facilitate an expansion into the United States. An AMS-IX press release said that: SURFnet, a member of the exchange, had expressed its objection to the proposal, citing the possibility that such interception would be demanded.
AMS-IX has increased its average internet traffic from about 5 Tbps in March 2020 to about 7 Tbps in March 2021.


==Co-locations==
AMS-IX members are able to connect at 16 locations, all located within the greater Amsterdam/Rotterdam area:

* Digital Realty AMS5 (Formerly Interxion Schiphol Rijk)
* Digital Realty AMS9 (formerly Interxion Science Park, Vancis, SARA)
* Digital Realty AMS17
* Digital Realty AMS18 (formerly Telecity AMS4)
* Equinix AM1/2 (South East)
* Equinix AM3 (Science Park)
* Equinix AM5 (formerly TeleCity AMS5)
* Equinix AM6 (formerly TeleCity AMS6)
* Equinix AM7 (formerly TeleCity AMS2)
* euNetworks (Amsterdam Amstel Business Park)
* GlobalSwitch (Slotervaart)
* Greenhouse Datacenters
* Iron Mountain (formerly Evoswitch Haarlem)
* NIKHEF (Science Park Amsterdam)
* NorthC Amsterdam (Formerly Datacenter Group)
* SmartDC (Rotterdam)

Third-party network transport links also offer access to AMS-IX peering VLAN via &quot;Reseller Program&quot;. Under the program, reseller could arrange one physical connection toward AMS-IX platform (now solely a 10G connection, but in prospect of going to 100G), and multiplexes &quot;virtual-link&quot; of other parties that connect to AMS-IX peering VLAN.

==Network==
The AMS-IX platform is continually evolving due to its rapid growth in traffic and number of connected member ports. Up until the end of 2009, it was using a redundant hub-spoke architecture using a core switch and multiple edge switches. This double-star topology had the advantage of being able to perform maintenance on the network without any impact on customer traffic, and to anticipate on fiber and equipment problems by (automatically) switching to the backup topology as soon as a failure in one of the active components occurs. The active switching topology star is determined by means of the VSRP protocol. This topology is AMS-IX version 3.

However, since 2009; AMS-IX platform has migrated from a pure Layer2 network to a VPLS/MPLS network (using Brocade hardware) in order to cope with future growth (this is AMS-IX version 4).

AMS-IX members connect to the platform with 1, 10, 100 Gbit/s Ethernet connections, or using multiple gigabit or 10 gigabit aggregated ports, utilizing the 802.3ad standard. Gigabit Ethernet and lower speed ports are directly connected to Brocade - Foundry Networks BigIron 15000 or RX-8 network switches. 10 gigabit member ports are connected to Glimmerglass Systems photonic switches which maintain an optical connection to the stub switch on the currently active side of the network, following the VSRP protocol. For each 10-gigabit port there is an active and a backup stub switch, for which BigIron RX-8, RX-16 or NetIron MLX-16 switches are used. The core consists of two Brocade NetIron MLX-32 switches, to which all edge switches are connected using 10 gigabit aggregated connections and WDM technology.

With the new VPLS/MPLS setup; the BigIron RX and legacy BigIron 15000 are no longer in-use. AMS-IX has migrated all the hardware to the MPLS-capable MLX platform. Stub switch is either MLX-8, MLX-16 or MLX-32.

Since May 2011, AMS-IX engineers have started testing 100GE along with LimeLight Network.

<text>José Ramón Herrera Catalino (born August 30, 1972) is a former professional baseball outfielder. He played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics (1995–96). He also played in the Korea Baseball Organization in 2001–02. In 2010, he played for the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and in the minor leagues for the Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles.

== Career ==
In 1993, Herrera was traded by the Toronto Blue Jays along with pitcher Steve Karsay to the Oakland Athletics for Major League Baseball&#x27;s all-time stolen base leader, Rickey Henderson, who helped Toronto win the 1993 World Series. He played in 141 games in the majors for the Oakland Athletics in 1995 and 1996, his only major league action. He played in the minors for Oakland through 1997, and joined the Blue Jays organization again in 1998, playing for the Syracuse SkyChiefs. 

In 1999, Herrera signed with the Baltimore Orioles organization and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate. While playing for the Rochester Red Wings, Herrera outran Zippy Chippy in a 40-yard race on August 18, 2000. A famous thoroughbred racing loser, Zippy Chippy went winless in 100 races. In three tries against a human, he beat Red Wings&#x27; outfielders Darnell McDonald and Larry Bigbie, but lost to Herrera.

In 2001, Herrera played in Korea for the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball Organization, and in 2002 he played for the Lotte Giants. In 2003 and 2004 he played for the Leones de Yucatan of the Mexican League. In 2005, he briefly played for the Orioles Double-A affiliate, the Bowie Baysox, before being released and signing with the Newark Bears.

=== Atlantic League ===
After his 106 games stint for the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, Herrera played for Newark from 2006 to 2008, and batted .305, .357, and .331. He is currently the team&#x27;s all-time leader in at bats with 1470, hits with 482, doubles with 78, RBIs with 259 and runs with 248. He was named MVP of the Atlantic League playoffs in 2007 when he hit 3 home runs against the Somerset Patriots in the deciding game four in Newark on September 24, 2007, helping guide the Bears to their second league championship.

Herrera played with the Long Island Ducks in 2009 before being acquired the Revolution for third baseman Matt Padgett. He became a free agent after the 2010 season.

He signed a contract with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs on January 13, 2011.

<text>Christopher Anvil (March 11, 1925 – November 30, 2009) is a pseudonym used by American author Harry Christopher Crosby.

==Biography and work==
Crosby was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the only child of Harry Clifton Crosby and Rose Glasbrenner. After serving as a pilot with the U.S. military, he began publishing science fiction with the story &quot;Cinderella, Inc.&quot; in the December 1952 issue of the magazine &quot;Imagination&quot;. By 1956, he had adopted his pseudonym Christopher Anvil and his science-fiction work was being published in &quot;Astounding&quot;. He went on to a long and successful career in the field.

His stories usually about characters in different human government organizations, gadgetry, and subterfuge both internal and external while on an adventure. His military background enabled him to bring a certain realism to his portrayal of action and intrigue, which counterpointed the more fantastical elements of his stories.

Anvil appeared in &quot;Astounding&quot;/&quot;Analog&quot; throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s. This was due his ability to write stories aimed at one of &quot;Astounding&quot; editor John W. Campbell&#x27;s preferred concepts: alien opponents with superior firepower losing out to the superior intelligence or indomitable will of humans. Anvil also used humor in his characterization of story crafting, where his protagonists slid from disaster to disaster with the best of intentions, and through exercise of fast thinking, managed to snatch victory somehow from the jaws of defeat. According to David Weber, who acknowledges being influenced by Anvil:
His stories became a perennial favorite with readers, and then ... &quot;he hit a winning streak in the late 1960s in a series which seemed straight out of &quot;Star Trek&quot; ... The Interstellar Patrol&quot;.

Many of his nonseries stories are almost purely idea-driven science fiction. Some of the most striking of these, for example &quot;Gadget vs. Trend&quot;, entirely lack dialogue and almost entirely lack characters; these stories consist of a series of newspaper reports or other similar materials. In these and other stories, Anvil&#x27;s technique is to put forth a gadget, invention, or social trend and logically develop the consequences.

==Modern reprints==
As with other 20th century science fiction writers, Anvil&#x27;s work became available through print-on-demand and ebooks. 

One of Anvil&#x27;s best-known short stories is &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Planet&quot;, which appeared first in &quot;Astounding&quot; in September 1956. It has since been reprinted several times, and also combined with the other stories in his Pandora series into a full length &quot;fixed-up&quot; novel, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Legions&quot;. 

Anvil also published a number of stories which he and John Campbell referred to as the &quot;Colonization Series&quot;:

<text>Rear-Admiral Frederick William Beechey (17 February 1796 – 29 November 1856) was an English naval officer, artist, explorer, hydrographer and writer.

==Life and career==
He was the son of two painters, Sir William Beechey, RA and his second wife, Anne Jessop. Born in London on 17 February 1796, his brothers included the British admiral and painter Richard Brydges Beechey, the portraitist Henry William Beechey and the painter George Duncan Beechey. Frederick entered the Royal Navy at the age of 10 under the command of John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent. He was promoted to midshipman on February 8 1807 and saw active service during the War of 1812. He served in the Battle of New Orleans. Because of this, he was promoted to 2nd lieutenant on March 10 1815

In early 1818, and now a lieutenant, Beechey sailed on HMS &quot;Trent&quot; under Lieutenant John Franklin in David Buchan&#x27;s Arctic expedition, of which at a later period he published a narrative. In the following year he accompanied Lieutenant W. E. Parry in , sailing as far north as Melville Island. In 1821, as an officer on HMS &quot;Adventure&quot;, he took part in the survey of the Mediterranean coast of Africa under the direction of Captain William Henry Smyth. His brother, Henry William Beechey, and he made an overland survey of this coast and published a full account of their work in 1828 under the title of &quot;Proceedings of the Expedition to Explore the Northern Coast of Africa from Tripoly Eastward in 1821-1822&quot;.
In 1825, Beechey was appointed to command . His task was to explore the Bering Strait in concert with Franklin and Parry operating from the east. In the summer of 1826, he passed the strait and a barge from his ship reached 71°23&#x27;31&quot; N., and 156°21&#x27;30&quot; W. near Point Barrow, which he named, a point only 146 miles west of that reached by Franklin&#x27;s expedition from the Mackenzie River. The whole voyage lasted more than three years, and in the course of it, Beechey discovered several islands in the Pacific, and an excellent harbour near Cape Prince of Wales.

In 1826, he visited a Catholic mission in California. He wrote, &quot;...with whips, canes and goads or sharp, pointed sticks to preserve silence and maintain order, and what seemed more difficult than either, to keep the congregation in their kneeling posture. The goads would reach a long way and inflict a sharp puncture without making any noise. The end of the church was occupied by a guard of soldiers under arms with fixed bayonets.&quot;

In July 1826, he named the three islands in the Bering Strait. Two were the Diomede Islands that Vitus Bering had named in 1728: &quot;Ratmanoff Island&quot; (Big Diomede) and &quot;Krusenstern Island&quot; (Little Diomede). Beechey called the uninhabited third islet &quot;Fairway Rock&quot;, which is still its contemporary name. One of his crew, Petty Officer John Bechervaise, gave a detailed account of the voyage in his &quot;Thirty-six Years of a Seafaring Life by an Old Quartermaster&quot;, published privately in 1839. (The crewmember&#x27;s namesake and great-great-grandson John Béchervaise (1910–1998) was a noted explorer of Antarctica.) In 1831, there appeared Beechey&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific and Bering&#x27;s Strait to Co-operate with the Polar Expeditions, 1825-1828&quot;.

In 1835 and &#x27;36, Captain Beechey was employed on the coast survey of South America, and from 1837 to 1847, carried on similar work along the Irish coasts, and in the North Sea and English Channel. He carried out detailed tidal surveys during this period, which were published, with charts, in two Royal Society papers in 1848 and 1851. This was the first published work of its kind since Edmond Halley&#x27;s tidal chart appeared in about 1702. He was appointed in 1850 to preside over the Marine Department of the Board of Trade.

In 1854, he was made rear admiral, and in the following year was elected president of the Royal Geographical Society.

Beechey Island, where Sir John Franklin wintered, was named by him after his father.

==Family of painters==
His daughter was painter Frances Anne Hopkins, who lived in Canada for 12 years and painted many scenes of canoe travel.

His parents and three of his brothers were painters: admiral and painter Richard Brydges Beechey, portraitist Henry William Beechey, and portraitist George Duncan Beechey.

<doc id="960224" wikidata="Q1281533" url="?curid=960224" title="Peter Breck">
<text>Joseph Peter Breck (March 13, 1929 – February 6, 2012) was an American character actor. The rugged, dark-haired Breck played the gambler and gunfighter Doc Holliday on the ABC/Warner Bros. Television series &quot;Maverick&quot; as well as Victoria Barkley&#x27;s (Barbara Stanwyck) hot-tempered middle son Nick in the 1960s ABC/Four Star Western &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. Breck also had the starring role in an earlier NBC/Four Star Western television series entitled &quot;Black Saddle&quot;.

==Early years==
Joseph Peter Breck was born in Rochester, New York. He grew up living with his grandparents in Haverhill, Massachusetts, because they felt they could provide a more stable home environment than his father, who often traveled as a jazz musician. He attended the University of Houston, where he studied English and drama.

==Family==
Breck was the son of bandleader Joe Breck, who was nicknamed &quot;the Prince of Pep&quot;, and whose band once included trombone player Jerry Colonna. His parents divorced when Peter was eight. Peter went with Joe, while his younger brother George accompanied their mother, resulting in a decades-long separation. In 1959, an Associated Press photograph showed the brothers reunited after being out of touch for 22 years. The caption explained: &quot;George told newsmen he saw Peter on television and recognized a resemblance. He went to the actor&#x27;s studio and the relationship was confirmed.&quot;

==Career==

===Early career===
After post-World War II United States Navy service in the 1940s on the aircraft carrier , Breck played professional basketball for the Rochester Royals during the 1948–49 season. He then worked as a ranch hand while studying drama at the University of Houston, and went on to make his on-screen debut in a 1958 film that was eventually released under the title &quot;The Beatniks&quot;.

As well as performing in live theatre, Breck had several guest-starring roles on a number of popular series, such as &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, several episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (a disturbed cowboy in the 1963 title role in &quot;The Odyssey of Jubal Tanner&quot;).

When Robert Mitchum saw Breck in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;The Man of Destiny&quot; in Washington, DC, he offered Breck a role as a rival driver in &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (1958). Mitchum helped Breck to relocate to Los Angeles. As Breck then did not have his own car, Mitchum lent him his Jaguar. Mitchum introduced Breck to Dick Powell, who contracted him to Four Star Productions, where Breck appeared in the CBS Western anthology series, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;.

Breck appeared with fellow guest star Diane Brewster in the 1958 episode &quot;The Lady Gambler&quot; of the ABC Western series, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, starring Pat Conway and Richard Eastham. That same year, Breck appeared in an episode of the syndicated &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, starring Broderick Crawford. He was also cast in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, starring John Payne. He appeared in a 1958 episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing the role of murder suspect, “Fly Hoyt”, a cowboy working on a Texas cattle drive. That same year, Breck played the role of a bad guy in an episode of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Story of Tobias Jones&quot;, opposite Lou Costello.

From January 1959 to May 1960, Breck starred as Clay Culhane, the gunfighter-turned-lawyer in the ABC Western &quot;Black Saddle&quot;, with secondary roles for Russell Johnson, Anna-Lisa, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, and Walter Burke. Unlike in &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, in which Breck played an easily angered rancher, he is low-key, restrained, and considerate as the lawyer Culhane.

Breck was later a contract star with Warner Bros. Television, where he appeared as Doc Holliday on &quot;Maverick&quot;, a part that had been played twice earlier in the series by Gerald Mohr and by Adam West on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lawman&quot;. Breck appeared in several other ABC/WB series of the time, such as &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; (as trumpet player Joe Peabody in the episode &quot;Big Town Blues&quot;), and &quot;The Gallant Men&quot;. He was cast as a young Theodore Roosevelt in the 1961 episode &quot;The Yankee Tornado&quot; of the ABC/WB Western series, &quot;Bronco&quot;, starring Ty Hardin. &quot;The Yankee Tornado&quot; featured Will Hutchins of the ABC/WB Western series &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; in a crossover appearance.

Breck&#x27;s first starring role in a film was &quot;Lad, A Dog&quot; (1962). The next year, he played the leading roles in both Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; and the science-fiction horror film &quot;The Crawling Hand&quot;. He also costarred in the cavalry film &quot;The Glory Guys&quot;. Between 1963 and 1965, Breck made three guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, in the roles of Clay Eliott in the 1963 episode &quot;The Case of the Bluffing Blast&quot;, defendant William Sherwood in the 1964 episode, &quot;The Case of the Antic Angel&quot;, and defendant Peter Warren in the 1965 episode, &quot;The Case of the Gambling Lady&quot;. During this time, he appeared on episodes of such television series as &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

Breck claimed to have been considered for leads on two successful television series produced by Quinn Martin: &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1963) and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1964), with Breck commenting, &quot;If you are a leading man in Hollywood, you either draw $250,000 like Steve McQueen or you had better be in a series.&quot;

===&quot;The Big Valley&quot;===

From 1965 to 1969, Breck starred on &quot;The Big Valley&quot; as Nick Barkley, foreman of the Barkley ranch and son to Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s character, Victoria Barkley. The second of four children, Nick was hot-headed, short-tempered, and very fast with a gun. Always spoiling for a fight and frequently wearing leather gloves, Breck&#x27;s character took the slightest offense to the Barkley name personally and quickly made his displeasure known, as often with his fists as with his vociferous shouts. Often, this proved to be a mistake, and only through the calming influence of his mother and cooler-headed siblings, Jarrod (Richard Long), half-brother Heath (Lee Majors), sister Audra (Linda Evans), and Eugene (Charles Briles; written out after season one when he was drafted into the Army), would a difficult situation be rectified. Having been a Barbara Stanwyck admirer since the 1940s, when he was a teenager, Breck developed an on- and off-screen chemistry with her, practicing longer lines and even being a ranch foreman on the set. After the series was cancelled, he stayed close to her until her death.

===After &quot;The Big Valley&quot;===
In 1970 he appeared as Lafe Harkness on the TV Western &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; (rebranded name for &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;Hannah&quot;. Most of his roles in the 1970s and 1980s were television guest-starring performances on such series as &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (again with Lee Majors), &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, as well as roles as himself on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; which also starred former television &quot;brother&quot; Lee Majors.

In the mid-1980s, Breck moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with his wife Diane and their son, Christopher. He was asked by a casting director to teach a weekly class to young actors on film technique. That once-a-week class became a full-time acting school - The Breck Academy - which he operated for 10 years. In 1990, Breck appeared in the Canadian cult film &quot;Terminal City Ricochet&quot;.

On January 20, 1990, while teaching at the drama school, Breck was notified of Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s death. She requested no funeral nor memorial.

In 1991, he appeared as Sham-Ir, the chief of all genies, in the NBC television special &quot;I Still Dream of Jeannie&quot;, the second reunion film that reunited &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; TV series co-stars Barbara Eden and Bill Daily, along with Al Waxman and Ken Kercheval.

In the film &quot;The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot; (1993), Breck played Sheriff Hatch.

In 1996, he appeared in an episode of the new version of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;.

Breck provided the voice of Farmer Brown in &quot;Critters&quot;, a 1998 episode of &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

His last television performance was on an episode of &quot;John Doe&quot; in 2002. Prior to his death, most of his film performances have been in undistributed films that are shown only at film festivals.

==Personal life==
Breck married dancer Diane Bourne in 1960. They had a son, Christopher, who died of leukemia at age 30.

==Death==
In June 2010, Breck&#x27;s wife Diane announced on his website that he had been suffering from dementia and could no longer sign autographs for fans, although she said that he still read and enjoyed their letters. Despite this diagnosis, she said he was still physically healthy and did not require medication.

Thereafter, Diane Breck reported that her husband was hospitalized on January 10, 2012. On February 6, 2012, Peter Breck died from his illness at the age of 82 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

<text>Verdaccio is an Italian name for the mixture of black, white, and yellow pigments resulting in a grayish or yellowish (depending on the proportion) soft greenish brown. 

Verdaccio became an integral part of fresco painting, in which this color is used for defining tonal values, forming a complete monochromatic underpainting. Often architectural details in frescoes are left in verdaccio without any additional color layers; a notable example is the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, where verdaccio underpainting can be clearly seen, left as it is on all architectural details of the composition.

In oil painting, a similar technique is used by Flemish painters, referred to as the &quot;dead layer,&quot; is applied over the traditional bone colour (one part raw umber to one part yellow ochre) priming to refine the values and remove the warm tone of the primer. The resulting &quot;white to olive green to black&quot; underpainting is &quot;like being illuminated by moonlight.&quot; It does not affect the tonality of the final painting.

<doc id="960232" wikidata="Q4925325" url="?curid=960232" title="Blasphemous libel">
<text>Blasphemous libel was originally an offence under the common law of England. Today, it is an offence under the common law of Northern Ireland, but has been abolished in England and Wales, and repealed in Canada and New Zealand. It is a form of criminal libel that consists of the publication of material which exposes the Christian religion to scurrility, vilification, ridicule, and contempt, with material that must have the tendency to shock and outrage the feelings of Christians.

Historically, the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were adopted from the common law of England as common law offences in British colonies and territories. From the late 19th century, several colonies and countries replaced the common law offences with adopted versions of the draft code called &quot;the Stephen Code&quot; written by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen as part of a Royal Commission in England in 1879. The Stephen Code included the offence of blasphemous libel but omitted blasphemy. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales with the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 but the offences remain as part of the common law, criminal code, or criminal statute in various countries, states, territories, and legal jurisdictions.

== United Nations General Comment 34 ==
Blasphemy laws are incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In July, 2011, the UN Human Rights Committee released a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression. Paragraph 48 states:

==Defence==
In both Canada and New Zealand and other jurisdictions that adopted versions of the Stephen Code under their respective legislation, it was not blasphemous libel to express in good faith and decent language any opinion on a religious subject.

==Australia==

The offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in English common law were carried over to the Australian colonies and &quot;received&quot; into state law. 

Blasphemy and blasphemous libel are not criminal offences under Australian federal law, and the common law offences were abolished by the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1995&quot;.

These offences were abolished completely in Queensland and Western Australia when those jurisdictions adopted Criminal Codes that abolished the common-law offences, in 1899 and 1913 respectively, and did not replace them with code offences.

The 1924 Criminal Code of Tasmania includes the offences of both blasphemy and blasphemous libel, and also abolished both common law offences, while in New South Wales, the Crimes Act recognises blasphemous libel and the common-law offences have not been abolished: in both states, the relevant laws have not been enforced for many years, and are generally regarded as obsolete.

The Australian Capital Territory abolished the common law offence of blasphemous libel, but not blasphemy, with the &quot;Law Reform (Abolitions &amp; Repeals) Act 1996&quot;. 

In South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, the situation is uncertain as the local Criminal Codes (or Crimes Act in Victoria) do not mention blasphemy or blasphemous libel, but did not specifically abolish the common law offences: in the event, these laws have not been enforced for many years, and are regarded as obsolete.

==Canada==
===Summary of offence and defence===
Blasphemy and Blasphemous libel were common law offences before the Criminal Code Act of 1892 abolished the common law offence of Blasphemy but included the offence of Blasphemous libel. Before repeal in December 2018, blasphemous libel was an offence under section 296 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

It was an indictable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. The offence of blasphemous libel, like all other laws of Canada, was subject to section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects freedom of expression. Before the law&#x27;s repeal, no court was asked to consider whether blasphemous libel was consistent with the Charter&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of expression, which came into force in 1982.

===Last prosecution: &quot;R v Rahard&quot; (1935)===
The last prosecution of a charge of blasphemous libel was in 1935, in &quot;R v Rahard&quot;, in Quebec. In that case, the court adopted an argument that prosecutor E. J. Murphy had proffered in the case of &quot;R v Sperry&quot; (unreported) in 1926. Mr. Murphy put the issue this way:

In &quot;Rahard&quot;, the Court found the Rev. Victor Rahard of the Anglican Church of Canada guilty of blasphemous libel for his aspersions upon the Roman Catholic Church.

The words &quot;calculated and intended to insult the feelings and the deepest religious convictions of the great majority of the persons amongst whom we live&quot;, which the court used, were adopted from the summing up of Lord Coleridge, LCJ. in &quot;R v Bradlaugh&quot;.

===Repeal===
On 6 June 2017, Bill C-51 was introduced into the 42nd Canadian Parliament by the Minister of Justice to repeal the blasphemous libel law, among other provisions that were found to be unconstitutional or obsolete. The bill passed the House of Commons on 11 December 2017. The Senate passed the bill with amendments on 30 October 2018. The House, however, notified the Senate on 10 December that it disagreed with the amendments, so on 11 December the Senate voted not to insist on them and the bill was passed. On 13 December, the governor general formally granted royal assent making the repeal official.

==Republic of Ireland==

In the Republic of Ireland, §13 of the Defamation Act, 1961 prescribed penalties for blasphemous libel, but did not define the offence. The only attempted prosecution since the 1937 Constitution was in 1999; the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution had extinguished the common law offence of blasphemous libel, since when &quot;it is impossible to say of what the offence of blasphemy consists&quot;. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a new offence of &quot;Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter&quot;, which was held to be required by Article 40.6.1.i. of the Constitution, which states &quot;The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law&quot;. The 37th amendment subsequently deleted &quot;blasphemous&quot; from the constitution.

==New Zealand==

It was an offence in New Zealand under section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 to publish any blasphemous libel. The maximum punishment was one-year imprisonment. No one could be prosecuted without the consent of the Attorney General.

Section 123(3) of the Crimes Act 1961 provided:

===Repeal===
On 19 March 2018, Justice Minister Andrew Little introduced a Crimes Amendment Bill which included repeal of section 123. The bill passed the first reading on 28 March and was referred to the Justice select committee which reported back on 28 September with the recommendation that the repeal of Section 123 proceed without change. The bill passed second reading on 11 December 2018, the Committee of the Whole House on 20 February 2019, and the third reading on 5 March 2019. The royal assent was received on 11 March and the Act came into force on 12 March 2019 repealing Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 on that date.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
In 1985, the Law Commission (England and Wales) published a report, &quot;Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship&quot;, that concluded that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement. In England and Wales, the common law offence of blasphemous libel was abolished on 8 July 2008 by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 created an offence of inciting hatred against a person on the grounds of their religion.

===Northern Ireland===
Blasphemous libel is an offence under the common law of Northern Ireland.
Section 7 of the Libel Act 1843 creates a defence.

See also the Criminal Libel Act 1819, the Libel Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 60) and section 8 of the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888.

<doc id="960235" wikidata="Q5129262" url="?curid=960235" title="Claudia Severa">
<text>Claudia Severa (born 11 September in first century, fl. 97–105) was a literate Roman woman, the wife of Aelius Brocchus, commander of an unidentified fort near Vindolanda fort in northern England. She is known for a birthday invitation she sent around 100 AD to Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of Flavius Cerialis, commander at Vindolanda. This invitation, written in ink on a thin wooden tablet, was discovered in the 1970s and is probably the best-known item of the Vindolanda Tablets.

The first part of the letter was written in formal style in a professional hand evidently by a scribe; the last four lines are added in a different handwriting, thought to be Claudia&#x27;s own.

The translation is as follows:

:&quot;Claudia Severa to her Lepidina greetings.&quot;

:&quot;On 11 September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday, I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us, to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival, if you are present. Give my greetings to your Cerialis. My Aelius and my little son send him their greetings.&quot;

:(2nd hand) &quot;I shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail.&quot;

:(Back, 1st hand) &quot;To Sulpicia Lepidina, (wife) of Cerialis, from Cl. Severa.&quot;&quot;

The Latin reads as follows:

:&quot;Cl. Severá Lepidinae [suae] [sa]l[u]temiii Idus Septembres soror ad diemsollemnem natalem meum rogólibenter faciás ut veniasad nos iucundiorem mihi&quot;

:&quot;[diem] interventú tuo facturá siaderisCerial[em t]uum salutá Aelius meus [...]et filiolus salutant&quot;

:&quot;sperabo te sororvale soror animamea ita valeamkarissima et have&quot;

The Vindolanda Tablets also contain a fragment from another letter in Claudia&#x27;s hand. These two letters are thought to be the oldest extant writing by a woman in Latin found in Britain, or perhaps anywhere. The letters show that correspondence between the two women was frequent and routine, and that they were in the habit of visiting one another, although it is not known at which fort Severa lived.

There are several aspects of Severa&#x27;s letters that should be regarded as literary, even though they were not written for a wide readership. In particular, they share several thematic and stylistic features with other surviving writings in Latin by women from Greek and Roman antiquity. Although Severa&#x27;s name reveals that she is unlikely to be related to Sulpicia Lepidina, she refers frequently to Lepidina as her sister, and uses the word &quot;iucundus&quot; to evoke a strong and sensual sense of the pleasure Lepidina&#x27;s presence would bring, creating a sense of affection through her choice of language. In the post-script written in her own hand, she appears to draw on another Latin, literary model, from the fourth book of the Aeneid, in which at 4.8 Vergil characterises Anna as Dido&#x27;s &quot;unanimam sororem&quot;, &quot;sister sharing a soul&quot;, and at 4.31, she is &quot;cherished more than life&quot; (&quot;luce magis dilecta sorori&quot;). Although this is not proof that Severa and Lepidina were familiar with Virgil&#x27;s writing, another letter in the archive, written between two men, directly quotes a line from the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, suggesting that the sentiments and language Sulpicia used do indeed draw on a Virgilian influence.

The Latin word that was chosen to describe the birthday festivities, &quot;sollemnis&quot;, is also noteworthy, as it means &quot;ceremonial, solemn, performed in accordance with the forms of religion&quot;, and suggests that Severa has invited Lepidina to what was an important annual religious occasion.

==Display of letter==
The invitation was acquired in 1986 by the British Museum, where it holds registration number 1986,1001.64. The museum has a selection of the Vindolanda Tablets on display, and loans some to the museum at Vindolanda.

<text>The Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) was the third generation of the Volkswagen Transporter. It was marketed under various nameplates worldwide – including the Transporter or Caravelle in Europe, Type 25 (T25) in the UK, Microbus and Kombi in South Africa/Brazil/Australia, Kampeerauto in Netherlands, Combi in France and Vanagon in North and South America.

It was larger, heavier, and more angular in its styling than its T2 predecessor, but shared the same rear-engine, cab-over design. It was produced in a rear wheel drive version as well as a 4WD version marketed as &quot;Syncro.&quot;

The T3 was manufactured in Hannover, Germany from 1979 until 1991. Production of the Syncro continued until 1992 at Puch in Graz, Austria, where all 4WDs were built. A limited number of 2WD models were also produced at the Graz factory after German production had ended. South African production of the T3 continued, for that market only, until 2002.

The T3 was the final generation of rear-engined Volkswagens.

==History==
While the T3 initially featured air-cooled engines, later years had water-cooled engines in both boxer and inline configurations.

Volkswagen marketed the Westfalia camper variant throughout the T3 production, with features including a raised roof (either pop-up or fixed), refrigerator, sink, and stove.

Examples built between 1979 and 1985 featured round headlights and
basic steel or chrome-plated steel bumpers with plastic end-caps. Air-cooled models (1979 to mid-1983) lack the lower grill above the radiator of the water-cooled models, except on models with factory air conditioning. Production of the Syncro four-wheel drive model began in late 1984, with its official debut taking place at the Brussels Commercial Vehicle Show in January 1985. The original Syncros came with the 1.9 L petrol Wasserboxer and a &quot;4+G&quot; gearbox, with G being a low gear for offroad use (&quot;Gelände&quot; in German).

1986 model year revisions include a tachometer, more fabric choices, redesigned air conditioning, enlarged water-cooled engine with a more advanced engine management system, and redesigned transmissions. Exterior changes include rectangular headlights (on selected models), and different paint options. Alloy wheels and larger fiberglass bumpers with trim along the rocker panels were optional (standard on Hannover and Wolfsburg Edition vans). For the 1990 and 1991 model years, a &quot;Carat&quot; trim level was available which included all available options except the Westfalia conversion and Syncro.

Some 1979 through 1981 models received 6 welded-in metal slats covering the engine ventilation passages behind the rear windows. All later models had black plastic 16-slat covers that slotted in at the top and screwed down at the bottom.

During the 1980s, the U.S. Army and Air Force in Germany used T3s as administrative (non-tactical) vehicles. In military use, the vehicle&#x27;s nomenclature was &quot;Light Truck, Commercial&quot;.

==Features==
With the engine and transaxle mounted very low in the back, the T3 had much larger disc brakes in the front, and drums in the rear. Axle weight is very nearly equal on both the front and back ends of the vehicle. Unlike the earlier T2, the T3 was available with amenities such as power steering, air conditioning, power door locks, electrically controlled and heated mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors, and a light above the glove box. Some of these were standard equipment in later, non-commercial vehicle models.

The automatic transmission was the same 090/010 hydraulic three-speed unit used in Audis of the era, and featured a cast aluminium alloy case for the transmission section and a cast iron case for the final drive section.

The 091 manual transmission was a four-speed unit featuring a lightweight aluminium alloy case. From 1983 a 5-speed transmission was available as an option on certain models. A 5-speed was standard equipment on Syncro four-wheel-drive models.

The automatic features a 1.0 ratio top gear, while the manual features a 0.85 top gear.

The oil filler tube for the engine is located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil dipstick and the power steering fluid reservoir (when fitted) on Petrol models. Diesel models have the reservoir in the front right corner of the engine bay. Early models had a twist-on/off non-locking gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was standard on later models. 4 Wheel Drive (Syncro) models have the fuel tank in the rear above the transmission so the filler is on the right-side rear corner. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van, just below the radiator.

==Engines==
Because of the engine placement, a T3 has nearly equal 50/50 weight distribution fore and aft. The early air-cooled engines were somewhat expensive to produce and had some reliability problems. Volkswagen originally meant to replace them with the Golf&#x27;s inline-four engine but the cost of re-engineering both car and engine made them opt for updating the flat-four instead. An overhead-cam design was mooted but rejected as a willingness to rev was considered to be of less importance than low-end flexibility and low cost. The new 1.9 L &quot;Volkswagen Wasserboxer engine&quot; was also originally considered for use in certain other Volkswagens such as the Gol, which still relied on the old air-cooled flat-four at that time.

The U.S version 1.9-litre and up water-cooled petrol engines experienced significant and repeated problems with cylinder head surface erosion and coolant leaks. 2.1 L engines suffered the same, mostly due to not having the antifreeze changed often enough, and the use of phosphated coolant, which caused corrosion in the cooling system.

===Petrol engines===
There were four general petrol engine variants between 1979 and 1991, with several sub-models. All were flat-four boxer engines with overhead valves, push-rods, and rocker arms. Available engine options differed between regions.
* Air-cooled (1979–1983) &quot;Type 4 engine&quot;
** (Serial # CT) air-cooled, single Solex 34 PICT-4 carburettor (not available in the United States)
** (Serial # CU or CV) air-cooled, twin Solex 34 PDSIT-2/3 carburettor or fuel injected (Bosch L-Jetronic) flat-four in the 1980 to 1983 models

The Wasserboxer features an aluminium case, cylinder heads, and pistons, and a forged steel crankshaft. As with earlier VW boxer engines, it has a gear-driven camshaft. It also features Heron, or &quot;bowl-in-piston&quot; combustion chambers, where combustion takes place within the piston bowl area rather than in the cylinder head as would be the case with flat top pistons. The switch to water-cooled boxer engines was made mid-year in 1983. T2 transporters or &#x27;bay window&#x27; vans, produced in Brazil until 2013, were switched to inline-four-cylinder water-cooled engines and a front-mounted radiator in 2005. Over 3 million vans were produced in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

* Water-cooled (1983 onwards)
** 1.9 Litre engines:
*** (Serial # DH) &quot;Wasserboxer&quot; engine used for the 1983 to 1985 models, has a fuel injection system known as &quot;Digijet&quot; (Digital Jet-tronic)
*** (Serial # DF) 8.6:1 compression ratio, 34-PICT carburettor
*** (Serial # DG) 8.6:1 compression ratio, 2E3 or 2E4 carburettor
*** (Serial # EY) 7.5:1 compression ratio, 34-PICT carburettor
*** (Serial # GW) 8.6:1 compression ratio, Bosch Digijet electronic fuel injection
** 2.1 Litre engines:
*** (Serial # MV) Wasserboxer, used until the end of Vanagon importation to the US in 1991. Uses an engine management system known as Bosch &quot;Digifant&quot; which digitally manages both ignition timing and fuel delivery.
*** (Serial # SS) 9:1 compression ratio Wasserboxer
*** (torque 128) (Serial # DJ) 10.3:1 compression ratio, Digijet injection, only sold in European countries not requiring catalytic converter.

===Diesel engines===
In contrast to the petrol engines&#x27; flat-four layout, the diesel engine options were all of an inline-four configuration. A turbodiesel arrived in January 1985.
* (Serial # CS) Naturally aspirated diesel I4. In the US this was available on 1982 and 1983 models only.
* (Serial # JX) Turbocharged I4.
* (Serial # KY) Naturally aspirated I4.

==U.S. model variations==

In the U.S., the T3 was sold as the Vanagon, which is a portmanteau of van and station wagon. The name Vanagon was coined by Volkswagen to highlight their claim that the T3 had the room of a van, but drove like a station wagon. U.S. Vanagon model variations included the Vanagon, featuring vinyl seats and a spartan interior; the Vanagon L with optional cloth seats, more upscale interior panels, and an optional dashboard blower; the Vanagon GL with more equipment like a padded steering wheel and front armrests; and the Westfalia pop-top camper Vanagons, which came in two versions. A Camper version known as the &quot;Campmobile&quot; with integrated kitchen, complete with refrigerator (which ran on propane, 110 V or 12 V), a two-burner stove, and stainless steel sink with onboard water supply. A fold-down rear bench seat converted to a bed and the pop-top included a fold-out bed; these models could sleep four adults. A &#x27;Weekender &#x27; version that lacked the refrigerator, propane stove, and sink of the full &#x27;camper&#x27; versions offered an optional removable cabinet with a 12 volt cooler and self-contained sink. In 1984, the Wolfsburg edition was configured with a rear bench seat and two forward-facing middle seats. Under the bench seat, which folded down to make full-size bed, was a storage compartment and a rear heater.

Wolfsburg Edition &quot;Weekender&quot; models featured two rear-facing seats behind the front seats in place of a centre bench seat and a table that could fold up from the sidewall – or fold down when not in use. Multivan models featured Wolfsburg Edition trim and an interior with rear-facing seats, the same fold up table, a pop-top with an upper bed, and cabinet behind the rear seat on the driver&#x27;s side. Wolfsburg Edition and camper van vehicles were outfitted for Volkswagen by the Westfalia factory.

Syncro models were manufactured in limited numbers from 1984 through 1992, with the four-wheel-drive system added by Steyr-Daimler-Puch Works in Graz, Austria, with a short wheelbase and 48/52 front/rear weight distribution. The majority of the Syncro production run used the same 14 inch wheels as the RWD version. A limited number of 16&quot; Syncro versions were also produced. The main differences between the 2 models was 16&quot; wheels with 205R16 tyres, larger front brakes 280mm discs instead of 254mm disc that was on the 14&quot; Syncro but they shared the same calipers and brake pads. The 16&quot; Syncro had larger rear brakes taken from the VW LT and fender flares which hid the area where VW trimmed the arches to give more room for larger tyres.

Model years 1980 through 1985 featured round sealed beam headlights. Subsequent models for North American and European markets featured round sealed beam headlights or smaller square headlights, with the primary lights outboard and high beams inboard. Later models from South Africa returned to round headlight housings for both the primary headlights and high-beams. This is known to VW enthusiasts as the &quot;South African look,&quot; and swapping the square headlights to round headlights is a popular conversion by van owners with non-South African vehicles.

The T3 was replaced by the T4 (Eurovan) in the U.S. market in 1993 (1992 saw no Volkswagen vans imported to the U.S. market, aside from custom campers sold by companies other than Volkswagen). 
Top-of-the-line Wolfsburg Edition Westfalia Campers, which had all options, were at the top of the price range. In addition to the camper models, a Carat trim level was available for 1990 and 1991 model years. This model included all options available for the Vanagon. Some models featured optional aluminium alloy wheels.

==South African models==
Production of the T3 continued in South Africa until June 2002, when, due to the economies of scale, Volkswagen SA were obliged to discontinue production after parts supply started to become an issue. The post-1991 South African T3s had a face-lift which included modified front door sheet metal, bigger side windows behind the B pillars, and different rear grilles in the D pillars. The bodyshell is a true RHD design lacking the unused door track cover on the offside and LHD wiper arm mount points found on earlier models which had adapted a LHD twin-sliding door bodyshell. On models with 5-cylinder engines, the boot floor was raised to accommodate the taller engine, leaving small storage areas either side of the engine hatch. Internal changes include a fully padded dashboard featuring a smaller glove box and updated vacuum-powered ventilation controls operated by round knobs rather than slide levers, while the fuse box was also relocated to the right-hand side of the steering column. At the front of the vehicle, twin headlamps in both round and rectangular configurations were fitted along with a full width lower grille incorporating the indicator lenses, which were changed from amber to smoked lenses from 1999 onwards. This grille and headlight combination was not found anywhere else in the world. These later South African T3s became known as Big Window T3s due to their larger side windows.

In January 1991 the 2.1-litre Wasserboxer engines were replaced with five-cylinder Audi engines in the &quot;Microbus&quot; and &quot;Caravelle&quot;, while a VW 1.8-litre inline-four cylinder engine was used in the &quot;Kombi&quot; and &quot;Van&quot; models. A 2.1-litre Wasserboxer Syncro Big Window model was also added, in Microbus or Caravelle trim. 89 Big Window Syncros were sold in 1992; the big-window body was used in the Syncro from 1990 and in 1991, mixed in the &quot;German&quot; small-window body, so exact numbers of Big Window Syncros are unknown, although 89 were sold in 1992. The Syncro model was discontinued in 1992. There were also 4 or 5 factory-built 5 cylinder 2.5i Syncros, with K-Jetronic fuel injection, 16&quot; rear trailing arms and brakes and 15&quot; wheels. One was in a small window body, 3 are known to survive (1 small window, and 2 Big Window Syncros). The five-cylinder T3s came out initially with a 2.5-litre K-Jetronic fuel-injected engine in 1991, but this was replaced in March 1995 with a 2.6-litre with an improved fuel injection system and two styles of 15&quot; alloy wheels as standard (Rhein or Starburst) along with larger ventilated front disc brakes. The automatic option for the 2.5-litre was dropped, leaving only the five-speed manual. A slightly lower spec 2.3-litre five-cylinder fuel-injected model was introduced four months after the 2.6-litre, but was equipped with a 4-speed transmission and modified wrap-around steel bumpers. There was also a basic bus, with an inline-4 inclined 1.8-litre carburettor engine. The 1.8-litre carb motor was a Golf-derived motor, fitted into the bus like an inline-4 diesel in a T3. Called the &quot;Volksie bus&quot;, it was a basic bus, with steel 15&quot; rims, single round headlights, steel wrap-around bumpers, and with no aircon or PAS.

Near the end of production, a top of the range Caravelle 2.6i known as the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; incorporated two rear-facing seats in place of the centre bench seat, a fridge and a folding table in the back of the vehicle and Carat 2 alloy wheels. A Microbus 2.6i with similar features, but with Rhein alloy wheels were known as the &quot;Activ&quot;. The last T3 off the production line in Uitenhage on Friday 16 June 2002 was a gold-coloured Microbus 2.6i which Volkswagen SA retained for their AutoPavilion, Place of Cars and Legends, which first opened its doors in 2004. The vehicle was later written off in a transporter roll-over accident in November 2006, after returning from a display in Cape Town.

;Five-cylinder Audi engines used:
* 1.8 I4 (AAX) at 5200 rpm
* 2.3i I5 (AFU) 
* 2.5i I5 (AAY) 
* 2.6i I5 (ADV) at 5200 rpm

==Safety and Crash Tests==
In 1994, the Swedish insurance company, Folksam tested a Vanagon T3 in a head-on collision with a Volvo 700 series wagon (estate). The crash test was full-frontal (50/50) at . The result was that the driver of the Volvo would have received a head injury criterion (HIC) of 3868. An HIC of 1000 is considered deadly. The Vanagon driver would receive a HIC of only 155. Furthermore, the &quot;chest impact&quot; for the Volvo driver was 65. A chest impact of 60 is considered deadly. The Vanagon driver&#x27;s impact was only 30.

Furthermore, the German engineering testing laboratory for the insurance industry Allianz Zentrum für Technik (AZT) performed tests on 4 June 1984 in Japan. The results were published in the September 1984 ADAC Motorwelt journal. The Vanagon/Caravelle with subjected to crash tests into a fixed 40% barrier at 35 km/h, which corresponds to a head-on collision at 50–55 km/h. According to AZT, this test is said to be representative of 90% of all accidents. A series of these crash tests were performed, which compared the T3 to similar vans manufactured by Nissan, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and two vans from Toyota. The written results stated, &quot;The Volkswagen Transporter type 2 affords excellent passenger safety&quot;. &quot;The legs were not endangered. And the legroom was only slightly restricted.&quot; All doors opened easily. With regard to repair of the vehicles after the crash tests, the five Japanese vehicles were declared a &quot;total loss&quot; or &quot;write-offs&quot;. Regarding the Vanagon, the report states &quot;It would be possible to fully repair the VW type 2 at reasonable cost&quot;.

Crash tests were also conducted using US market vehicles by Californian firms Calspan and NTS on behalf of the NHTSA. Three full-frontal tests at speeds of with a fixed barrier were conducted between 1980 and 1988. While all three tests showed minor passenger compartment intrusion, the resultant HIC for the driver of the Vanagon ranged between 1313 and 1905. The passenger dummy fared better receiving a HIC between 831 and 1060.

In a crash between the front of a Volkswagen LT31 (structurally the same as a T3) and rear of a stationary full-size Chevrolet Impala, the rear of the Impala was completely destroyed, with the rear trunk being pushed up to just behind the driver&#x27;s seat while the VW remained &quot;operational&quot; (drivable), &quot;the doors could be opened relatively easily&quot;, and &quot;the deformation of the interior was negligible&quot;, as declared by the testing agency.

In an rollover test of &quot;a fully equipped VW (Type 2 T3) Westfalia customized camping vehicle&quot; traveling &#x27;sideways&#x27; at a speed of on a specially designed &#x27;sled&#x27; that &#x27;launched&#x27; the vehicle causing two complete rollovers, the report found that &quot;the roof remained fully intact and the doors remained closed&quot;. The report went on to say, &quot;If passengers wear seatbelts, the danger of injury in this kind of accident is relatively low&quot;. In another rollover test, the T3 was rolled down a hill — equivalent to a 3-storey building. This resulted in the van flipping over 4 1/2 times. It was reported, &quot;the shape of the body and the roof remained intact.&quot;

These vans were made with a &quot;forward deformation zone&quot; consisting of four &quot;side members&quot; below and in front of the passenger compartment making a four-pronged forked frame with a &quot;deformation element&quot; which is mounted in front of this making it extremely effective at absorbing impact. The front cab has extensive protection by means of four vertical struts that connect an impact-absorbing box section cross-member. Additionally, there is another box framed horizontal strut on the inside of the vehicle that attaches to the door frames. And another yet goes through the sides of the doors to help protect passengers from lateral impact. The steering wheel has two energy-absorbing buckle points, with a detachable steering column that prevents the steering wheel from being pushed into the cabin. The spare tyre, which is mounted on the underside in the front of the vehicle, is also used to absorb shock.

==Engine-swapped limited production versions==
===Porsche B32===
Porsche created a limited edition version of the T3 called the B32. The van was based on the luxurious Carat model, and came equipped with the 3.2 litre Carrera engine. It was originally developed to support Porsche&#x27;s testing activities in Algeria. Ten were built, with some sold by Porsche to special customers, even having a Porsche VIN. Porsche themselves also used B32 buses to quickly transport staff. Top speed was around , although Porsche only claimed to ensure that the numbers could be replicated with nine people in the car and with the air conditioning on full.

===Claer CT3===
Customiser Claer built a small series of T3s with Porsche six-cylinder engines, called the CT3.

===Oettinger T3===
Aftermarket VW specialist Oettinger offered their own Flat-six engine, called the Oettinger WBX6, in some VW Transporters. Development of this engine was undertaken by Oettinger under contract to Volkswagen, with the intent that it be used in the T3. When VW abandoned the project, Oettinger bought the rights to the design and brought it to market.

Technically, the WBX6 draws heavily on the original Wasserboxer design, and shares many parts with the four-cylinder engine. The WBX6 was originally only available with a three-speed automatic transmission incorporating many Audi 100 parts to accommodate the higher power and torque.

Approximately 45 WBX6 3.2i Oettinger engines were imported to South Africa.
* Oettinger WBX6 (aftermarket)
** VW-Oettinger Wasserboxer, fuel injected.
** VW-Oettinger Wasserboxer, fuel injected.

==Today==
The T3 has a large cult following, especially the Westfalia camper version. Many owners have had the VW engines replaced in pursuit of improved power and reliability, particularly the Wasserboxer due to phosphated coolant.

Apart from the Porsche and Oettinger engines already mentioned, swaps have used VW Rabbit diesel engines, the 2.0 L Tico Engine, Golf/Jetta petrol engines and Ford Zetec engines.

Subaru EJ engines are among the most popular engines to install for increased power, as the EJs flat-4 design is similar in size and configuration to the original VW engines.

<text>The Morava () is a river in Central Europe, a left tributary of the Danube. It is the main river of Moravia historical region in the Czech Republic, which derives its name from the river. The Morava originates on the Králický Sněžník mountain in the north-eastern corner of Pardubice Region, near the border between the Czech Republic and Poland and has a vaguely southward trajectory. The lower part of the river&#x27;s course forms the border between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and then between Austria and Slovakia.

==Etymology==
The root of the river&#x27;s name, &quot;mor-&quot;, is derived from the Proto-Indo-European word for &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;marsh&#x27;, from which the Latin word &quot;mare&quot; arose. The suffix &quot;-ava&quot; is a Slavic form of the Proto-Germanic word &quot;ahwa&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;river&#x27;. The name of the river was first documented as &quot;Maraha&quot; in an 892 deed. The river gave its name to the entire historical land of Moravia, yet the oldest surviving record of the land (from 822) is older than the record of the river. The German name of the Morava, &quot;March&quot;, was derived from the Slavic name.

==History==
The banks of the Morava have been inhabited for a very long time. The village of , on the Austrian part of the river, was already the location of a human settlement 30,000 years ago. Agriculture began to be practiced in the Morava valley approximately 7,000 years ago, and fortified settlements began to appear during the New Stone Age.

The lower part of the river, downstream of the confluence with the Thaya at Hohenau an der March, which today marks the Austro-Slovakian border, is one of the oldest national boundaries still extant in continental Europe: it was the eastern boundary of the Carolingian Empire with the Avar Khaganate around 800, and from the 10th century onward marked the border of the Imperial &quot;marcha orientalis&quot;, later Duchy of Austria, with the Kingdom of Hungary (within the Habsburg monarchy during 1526–1918 because of imperial expansion). During the Cold War, this section of the river was part of the Iron Curtain, forming the frontier between Austria and Czechoslovakia.

In July 1997, the Morava basin (especially its northern and eastern part) was affected by heavy stratiform rain, which lasted several days and caused catastrophic floods.

==Course==

The Morava originates in the territory of Dolní Morava in the Králický Sněžník Mountains, on the slope of the Králický Sněžník mountain at an elevation of , not far from the border with Poland. The lowlands formed by the river are the Upper Morava Valley and then the Lower Morava Valley in Moravia, the &quot;Morava Field&quot; or Marchfeld in Lower Austria, and the Záhorie Lowland in Slovakia. The latter three are actually continuous parts of one large basin, forming a major part of the Vienna Basin.

In the Czech Republic, several larger cities and towns lie on the Morava, particularly Olomouc, Kroměříž, Otrokovice, Uherské Hradiště, Veselí nad Moravou and Hodonín. Brno, the second largest city of the Czech Republic, lies within the river basin. As of 2009, the catchment area of the river had a population of million people. Downstream of Hodonín, the river flows along a sparsely inhabited, forested border area, all the way to its outfall into the Danube, just below Devín Castle on the outskirts of the Slovak capital Bratislava.

The total length of the Morava is , of which is in the Czech Republic (including the Czech-Slovak border), making it the third longest river in the Czech Republic. The Morava feeds the Danube with an average discharge rate of , collected from a drainage area of , of which is in the Czech Republic.

The Morava is a lowland river with a basin that consists of 51% plains; mountains make up only seven percent of the basin while thirty five percent are considered highland. The average slope of the river is 1.8‰ and at the confluence 4‰. The bedrock of the river basin is mostly crystalline bedrock and flysch.

The Morava is unusual in that it is a European blackwater river.

The longest tributary of the Morava is the Thaya, flowing in at the tripoint of the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. The longest tributaries of the Morava are:
==Ecology==

The Morava River forms an important link between the Danube Valley and the plains of northern Europe, for animals as well as, at least historically, for humans. Its weak slope across flat plains furthermore means that the river is prone to meander and flood, creating vast floodplains. Because of these reasons, the floodplains of the Morava River are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in Europe. Its richness in plant and animal species (some 12,000 species have been identified) ranks it second in diversity only to the Danube Delta. During the 20th century however, large tracts of the river, especially downstream from Litovel, have been regulated with the ensuing effect of loss of inundation areas (floodplains). Since the river basin is densely populated and, especially the Czech part, industrialised, the river also receives a lot of wastewater. Agriculture also contributes to spreading nitrogen and other nutrients into the river. Nevertheless, the central part of the river has retained much of its natural character and in later years conscious efforts have been made to protect the nature and ecosystem of the river basin.

<text>The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster (often referred to as Eighties Matchbox, 80s Matchbox, TEMBD, TEMBLD or shortened to just Eighties or 80s) were an English rock band from Brighton, formed in 1999. They released three albums, &quot;Hörse of the Dög&quot; (2002), &quot;The Royal Society&quot; (2004) and &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; (2010).

== History ==
Originally formed in 1999, the band comprised Guy McKnight (vocals), Andy Huxley (lead guitarist), Marc R. Norris (rhythm guitarist), Symren &#x27;Sym&#x27; Gharial (bassist), and Tom Diamantopoulo (drummer), until May 2005, in which Andy Huxley &quot;decided to leave due to a decrease in musical similarities&quot; to form the band Vile Imbeciles and was replaced by Rich Fownes from With Scissors. In their first few years as a band, they were known for their large black car with red and orange flames on each side. According to Guy McKnight on MTV Two&#x27;s Gonzo, the car has now gone. The band were renowned for their intense live shows, where McKnight regularly left the stage during numbers to mingle with the crowd.

They released three full-length albums, &quot;Hörse of the Dög&quot; in 2002, &quot;The Royal Society&quot; in October 2004 and &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; in May 2010. The band also released eight singles on various formats, each release has had several B-sides included, and so the band have a large number of songs that cannot be found on their albums. The song &quot;Mister Mental&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, which also contained posters and other references to the band.

The band on rare occasion disguised themselves (dressed up as green bees) as a band called The Boogs, a band that had apparently signed with their old record label, No Death. They released one song as The Boogs which was a B-side on one of their singles. The song is titled &quot;Palomino&#x27;s Dream&quot;. A video was also made for the song, which featured them dressed up as green bees in New York City.

In 2003, Guy McKnight, Tom Diamantopoulo and former member Andy Huxley all became Buddhists after giving up drugs. In an interview, former member Andy Huxley was questioned about his reasons for giving up drugs he said &quot;Because it&#x27;s irresponsible, and you can&#x27;t get anything done, and it stifles your creativity, and there&#x27;s no benefit in it really, apart from its like going on vacation constantly, I can&#x27;t write any songs when I&#x27;m on drugs, I need to be sober&quot;.

The band played at both The Glastonbury Festival and The Reading and Leeds Festivals for several years running. They also toured and supported many mainstream bands, including; System of a Down, Placebo, Klaxons, Murderdolls, Queens of the Stone Age, and Scars on Broadway.

They released their EP, &quot;In the Garden&quot; on 23 July 2009 on digital format, with the hard copy&#x27;s release being pushed back to the first week of September. The hard copy was released with a bonus live album and Ouija Board. This was the first release from the band since the departure of Huxley in May 2005. A 15 date tour took place to promote the release, starting in Manchester on 23 July 2007 and ending in London on 7 August; this was the first time the band had toured for two years. A mini tour took place during the end of 2007 and the start of 2008, with Christmas, Halloween and New Years shows.

On 7 April 2008, a few days after an announcement that Fownes was joining Nine Inch Nails, it was announced via Eighties&#x27;s MySpace page that Fownes would be leaving the band. The band stated that they had no intention of splitting up and would begin auditioning for a new lead guitarist.

During gigs in July 2008, Fownes was replaced by friend of the band, Tristan McLenahan. In November 2008 McLenahann became a full member of the band. It was announced that the band were to travel to France to record their new album. In late 2009 the band posted several snippets of new material on their Myspace page, and on 15 December a re-designed Myspace page stated that they were signed across two labels; No Death and Black Records.

The band released their third studio album, &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; on 17 May 2010. It was preceded by the single &quot;Love Turns to Hate&quot; on 10 May 2010.

On 17 March 2011, guitarist Dominic Knight officially announced on their official Facebook page that the band had disbanded to pursue other projects.

Over a year after splitting, the band received an unexpected boost to their profile when in May 2012 their track &quot;Chicken&quot; was used in &quot;My Time Is Now&quot;, a global advert for Nike Football.

In June 2012, the band announced that they would re-form with original founding members Huxley and Norris to perform their debut material at three shows.

On 13 May 2013, the band announced via their Facebook page that they decided to disband. The reason given was that no shared musical common ground was found when recording new material and that the band did not have the strength to carry on. It was also announced that members would now work individually on future projects.

Diamantopoulo left music behind and became a fine artist. He now works from his studio in Brighton creating large abstract works which are rooted in colourism and expressionism.

In 2015, The Prodigy released the album &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;, which featured a cover version of the band&#x27;s 2005 single &quot;Rise of the Eagles&quot; as a bonus track.

In 2015, Huxley and Gharial announced they had started a new project, Piano Wire, and released &quot;The Genius of the Crowd&quot; EP on Demand Vinyl. In autumn 2016, Piano Wire announced they would release debut album &quot;Dream Underground&quot; on their own Hanging Houses record label in February 2017, along with lead single &quot;Get a Life&quot; produced by Gil Norton. The band broke up the following year.

In 2018, following a move to Liverpool, McKnight formed the synth-pop band The DSM IV. Their debut single &quot;Racist Man&quot; was released in October 2018, and was followed by further single &quot;Funland&quot; in January 2019, and a third single, &quot;Killing Your Time&quot;, in March 2020.

In 2019, Norris – now based in Germany – formed The Famous Painters, releasing their debut EP &quot;Shit Life Syndrome&quot; that year, and follow up &quot;Indigenous Perambulations&quot; in October 2020.

Also in 2019, Gharial started recording under the name Primitive_Ignorant. His first two solo singles, both collaboration with Ladybug and Red Lady, were released in September and October 2019 respectively. Across 2020, Gharial released tracks from the debut Primitive_Ignorant album as singles, with the debut album &quot;Sikh Punk&quot; released in October of that year, and featuring collaborations with members of IDLES and The Clash.

<doc id="960256" wikidata="Q1884048" url="?curid=960256" title="Underpainting">
<text>In art, an underpainting is an initial layer of paint applied to a ground, which serves as a base for subsequent layers of paint. Underpaintings are often monochromatic and help to define color values for later painting. Underpainting gets its name because it is painting that is intended to be painted over (see overpainting) in a system of working in layers.

There are several different types of underpainting, such as veneda, verdaccio, morellone, imprimatura and grisaille. The different types have different colourings. Grisaille is plain grey. Verdaccio is a grey tending towards yellow or green that brings out more luminous tones, while imprimatura uses earth tones.

Underpainting has several advantages over working from a plain canvas. The neutral colours of the underpaint will not distract if they are not completely covered. It also aids the painter in getting a correct tone. Comparing colours to a white background is very different from the colouring of the final painting. A multi-color underpainting can also add to a work and was used by artists such as Giotto (whose technique is described in detail by Cennino Cennini), as well as by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden (whose technique has been studied with modern scientific analysis). This technique was pioneered by Titian in the High Renaissance. The colors of the underpainting can be optically mingled with the subsequent overpainting, without the danger of the colors physically blending and becoming muddy. If underpainting is done properly, it facilitates overpainting. If it seems that one has to fight to obscure the underpainting, it is a sign that it was not done properly.

<doc id="960259" wikidata="Q10915529" url="?curid=960259" title="Political divisions of Taiwan (1895–1945)">
<text>Taiwan was under Japanese rule after the First Sino-Japanese War, as per the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. There were still several changes until the Japanese political system was adopted in 1920. This system was &quot;de facto&quot; abolished in 1945 and &quot;de jure&quot; in 1952.

==Introduction==
Administrative divisions of Taiwan by types and times. Like the administrative divisions in mainland Japan, most of them are translated to &quot;prefectures&quot; in English.



==Early years (1895–1901)==
The political divisions changed frequently between 1895 and 1901.

==Chō (1901–1920)==
The former system was abolished 11 November 1901, and twenty local administrative offices (&quot;chō&quot;) were established. Usage of &quot;Ken&quot; divisions was discontinued.

===Structural hierarchy===

===Prefectures===

* Shinkō, Byōritsu, Toroku, Ensuikō were split and merge with the two Chō in the right.

===Demographics===
Population of Formosa according to census taken 31 December 1904, arranged by district.
==Shū and Chō (1920–1952)==

Under a &quot;Dōka policy&quot; () in which the Japanese considered the Taiwanese to be separate but equal, the political divisions in Taiwan became similar to the system used in mainland Japan in 1920.

===Structural hierarchy===

* &quot;Chō&quot; () and &quot;chōme&quot; () are used in the city centers. 
* &quot;Sha&quot; () is used to name the tribes of the indigenous peoples.

===Prefectures===

* Hōko Prefecture was divided from Takao Prefecture in 1926

===Cities===
There were 11 cities in Taiwan in 1945. Most of them are still the most populous municipalities in the country today. The ōaza (大字) in the city center may be named chō (町).
===Demographics===

The 1941 (Showa 16) census of Taiwan was 6,249,468. 93.33% of the population were Taiwanese which consisted of both Han Taiwanese and &quot;civilized&quot; Taiwanese aborigines. Tainan had the largest population followed by Taichū and Taihoku. The largest concentration of ethnic Japanese were in Taihoku followed by Takao and Tainan.
==Changes in 1945==
When the Republic of China began to rule Taiwan in 1945, the government simply changed the names of the divisions, and named the Aboriginal areas. Those changes were not recognized by the Allies after the surrender of Japan.
* Most of the cities in Taiwan became provincial cities, but Yilan (宜蘭市 Giran) and Hualien (花蓮市 Karen) became the first two county-administered cities in the ROC.
* The more basic or are merged to the districts in provincial cities, and/or reformed to villages ( &quot;or&quot; ).

<text>Shan is the native language of the Shan people and is mostly spoken in Shan State, Myanmar. It is also spoken in pockets in other parts of Myanmar, in Northern Thailand, in Yunnan, in Laos, in Cambodia, in Vietnam and decreasingly in Assam and Meghalaya. Shan is a member of the Kra–Dai language family and is related to Thai. It has five tones, which do not correspond exactly to Thai tones, plus a sixth tone used for emphasis. The term Shan is also used for related Northwestern Tai languages, and it is called Tai Yai or Tai Long in other Tai languages. Standard Shan, which is also known as Tachileik Shan, is based on the dialect of the city of Tachileik.

In 2019, Ethnologue estimated there were 3.3 million Shan speakers, including 3.2 million in Myanmar. The Mahidol University Institute for Language and Culture estimates there are gave the number of Shan speakers in Thailand as 95,000 in 2006. Many Shan speak local dialects as well as the language of their trading partners.

== History ==

Historically, the dominance of Shan as a regional lingua franca made it the source of many loanwords in other regional languages, especially Jingpo and Palaung. Shan has also served as an intermediary of loanwords from Burmese into these languages.

=== Influence from Burmese ===
By the same token, Shan has been significantly influenced by Burmese, mediated by centuries of historical and ongoing contact and exchange between Burmese and Shan speakers, especially between the Burmese royal court and Shan principalities. For instance, the lack of a sound in most Shan dialects is attributed to Burmese influence; this sound is present in the closely-related Khün and Northern Thai languages. Shan vocabulary has been significantly enriched by Burmese contact, with Burmese loan words appearing throughout the Shan lexicon, including loanwords borrowed from Pali via Burmese. Burmese appears to have also influenced Shan grammar, with respect to the use of complex prepositions and certain word patterns that do not exist in closely related Tai languages.

=== Influence from Thai ===
Due to labour migration in recent decades, one million ethnic Shan now live in Thailand. As a result of ongoing language contact, Thai has increasingly become a competing source of loanwords into Shan, especially for scientific and political concepts. These Thai loanwords are often more difficult to detect, because of phonetic and structural similarities between Shan and Thai. Some recent phonological developments, like the reversal of the historical &gt; shift especially among younger Shan speakers, is attributed to contact with Thai.

== Names ==
The Shan language has a number of names in different Tai languages and Burmese. 
* In Shan, the spoken language is commonly called &quot;kwam tai&quot; (, , ). The written language is called &quot;lik tai&quot; (, ).
* In Burmese, it is called &quot;hram: bhasa&quot; (, ), whence the English word &quot;Shan&quot;. The term &quot;Shan,&quot; which was formerly spelt &quot;hsyam:&quot; () in Burmese, is an exonym believed to be a Burmese derivative of &quot;Siam&quot; (an old term for Thailand).
* In Thai and Southern Thai, it is called &quot;phasa thai yai&quot; (, , ) or more informally or even vulgarly by some &quot;phasa ngiao&quot; (, , an outdated term that now sounds like the word for &quot;snake&quot;).
* In Northern Thai, it is called &quot;kam tai&quot; (, , literally &quot;Tai language&quot;) or more informally or even vulgarly by some &quot;kam ngiao&quot; (, ), ).
* In Lao, it is called &quot;phasa tai yai&quot; (, , ) or more informally or even vulgarly by some &quot;phasa ngiao&quot; (, ).
* In Tai Lü, it is called &quot;kam ngio&quot; (, ).

==Dialects==
The Shan dialects spoken in Shan State can be divided into three groups, roughly coinciding with geographical and modern administrative boundaries, namely the northern, southern, and eastern dialects. Dialects differ to a certain extent in vocabulary and pronunciation, but are generally mutually intelligible.

While the southern dialect has borrowed more Burmese words, eastern Shan is somewhat closer to Northern Thai language and Lao in vocabulary and pronunciation, and the northern so-called &quot;Chinese Shan&quot; is much influenced by the Yunnan-Chinese dialect.

A number of words differ in initial consonants. In the north, initial and , when combined with certain vowels and final consonants, are pronounced (written &quot;ky&quot;), (written &quot;khy&quot;) and (written &quot;my&quot;). In Chinese Shan, initial becomes . In southwestern regions is often pronounced as . Initial only appears in the east, while in the other two dialects it merges with .

J. Marvin Brown divides the three dialects of Shan State as follows:
#Northern — Lashio, Burma; contains more Chinese influences
#Southern — Taunggyi, Burma (capital of Shan State); contains more Burmese influences
#Eastern — Kengtung, Burma (in the Golden Triangle); closer to Northern Thai and Lao

Prominent divergent dialects are considered separate languages, such as Khün (called Kon Shan by the Burmese), which is spoken in Kengtung valley. Chinese Shan is also called Tai Mao, referring to the old Shan State of Mong Mao. Tai Long is used to refer to the Southern Shan State dialect spoken in southern and central regions west of the Salween River, the Northern Shan State dialect, and the dialect spoken in Laos. There are also dialects still spoken by a small number of people in Kachin State, such as Tai Laing, and Khamti spoken in northern Sagaing Region.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Shan has 19 consonants. Unlike Thai and Lao (Isan) there are no voiced plosives /d/ and /b/.


=== Vowels and diphthongs ===
Shan has ten vowels and 13 diphthongs:

Shan has less vowel complexity than Thai, and Shan people learning Thai have difficulties with sounds such as &quot;ia,&quot; &quot;ua,&quot; and &quot;uea&quot; . Triphthongs are absent. Shan has no systematic distinction between long and short vowels characteristic of Thai.

=== Tones ===
Shan has phonemic contrasts among the tones of syllables. There are five to six tonemes in Shan, depending on the dialect. The sixth tone is only spoken in the north; in other parts it is only used for emphasis.

==== Contrastive tones in unchecked syllables ====
The table below presents six phonemic tones in unchecked syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in sonorant sounds such as [m], [n], [ŋ], [w], and [j] and open syllables.
:* The symbol in the first transcription column corresponds to conventions used for other tonal languages; the second is derived from the Shan orthography.

The following table shows an example of the phonemic tones:

The Shan tones correspond to Thai tones as follows:
# The Shan rising tone is close to the Thai rising tone.
# The Shan low tone is equivalent to the Thai low tone.
# The Shan mid-tone is different from the Thai mid-tone. It falls in the end.
# The Shan high tone is close to the Thai high tone. But it is not rising.
# The Shan falling tone is different from the Thai falling tone. It is short, creaky and ends with a glottal stop.

==== Contrastive tones in checked syllables ====
The table below presents four phonemic tones in checked syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in a glottal stop [ʔ] and obstruent sounds such as [p], [t], and [k].

===Syllable structure===
The syllable structure of Shan is C(G)V((V)/(C)), which is to say the onset consists of a consonant optionally followed by a glide, and the rhyme consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong alone. (Only in some dialects, a diphthong may also be followed by a consonant.) 
The glides are: -w-, -y- and -r-.
There are seven possible final consonants: , , , , , , and .

Some representative words are:
*CV &quot;also&quot;
*CVC &quot;market&quot;
*CGV &quot;to go&quot;
*CGVC &quot;broad&quot;
*CVV &quot;far&quot;
*CGVV &quot;water buffalo&quot;

Typical Shan words are monosyllabic. Multisyllabic words are mostly Pali loanwords, or Burmese words with the initial weak syllable .

==Pronouns==
==Resources==
Given the present instabilities in Burma, one choice for scholars is to study the Shan people and their language in Thailand, where estimates of Shan refugees run as high as two million, and Mae Hong Son Province is home to a Shan majority. The major source for information about the Shan language in English is Dunwoody Press&#x27;s &quot;Shan for English Speakers&quot;. They also publish a Shan-English dictionary. Aside from this, the language is almost completely undescribed in English.

<text>Fair Haven is a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city of New Haven, Connecticut, between the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers. The northeast section of the neighborhood is also known as Chatham Square.

Fair Haven is located about two miles east of the New Haven Green comprising New Haven wards 14, 15, 16, and a portion of 8. It is bounded on the east and south by the Quinnipiac River, on the west by the Mill River, on the northwest by Amtrak railroad tracks, and on the north by I-91 (in the vicinity of Exit 7). The main through routes of the area are Grand Avenue, Blatchley Avenue, and Ferry Street.

In its early days, the area was called by a succession of names including Farmes, East Farmes, The Neck, Dragon, and Clamtown. Herman Hotchkiss is credited as founder due to his investments and development.

Fair Haven is not to be confused with the adjacent Fair Haven Heights neighborhood.

==History==
===17th century===
Prior to its founding by European settlers, Fair Haven was used by the Momauguin group of Quinnipiack Native Americans for farming.

It is said that in 1639, when Captain Richard Russell first viewed the harbor, &quot;The sight of the harbor did so please the Captain of the ship, that they called it a Fayre Haven.&quot; In 1640, the area currently called Fair Haven was named &#x27;The Neck&#x27;. Fair Haven was originally a village formed in 1679 to house industrial workers, as the area was a source of oysters and other products of the rivers and nearby harbor. It is said to have produced almost 5,000 gallons of oysters per day in season when at its peak. Besides oyster houses, manufacturing plants and a brewery were established. In the beginning, Fair Haven could only be reached by boat, on foot, or on horseback. In time, dirt roads were laid, for use by horse-drawn vehicles.

===18th century===

In 1784 Fair Haven became a part of the city of New Haven. The Pardee Family of East Haven began a ferry service across the Quinnipiac in 1785. The service was discontinued in 1791 with the construction of the Dragon Bridge.

===19th century===
In 1806, land was donated for Fair Haven Union Cemetery.

By 1808, Fair Haven had 50 houses.

In 1820, the first apartment building for multiple residences was built.

In 1824, residents changed the name of their home from &#x27;Dragon&#x27; to &#x27;Fair Haven&#x27;.

By 1830, the oyster beds were dried up.

In 1835, importation of oysters began, with the supply being replenished by 1900.

In 1837 Fair Haven withdrew from the jurisdiction of New Haven.

A number of homes in Fair Haven were used to hide slaves in the Underground Railroad.

By the time of the Civil War, some streets had been paved. There was an influx of immigrants after the war, notably Irish, German, Polish, Italian and Russian. One area with a large number of Irish was nicknamed &#x27;little Dublin&#x27;.

In 1860, a group of local businessmen drew up a charter to build and operate a horsecar line of one or two tracks between Fair Haven and Westville.

In 1866, Samuel L. Blatchley developed Blatchley Ave., building moderately-priced homes for local workers.

St. Francis Church held its first service in 1867.

In 1870 Fair Haven rejoined New Haven.

In 1881 Ferry Street School was opened.

In 1885, Nathaniel Graniss donated land for the construction of the First Quinnipiac School.

In 1888, Lancraft Fife and Drum Corps organized, practiced in Ed Lancraft&#x27;s Oyster house.

===20th century===

By the 1930s, Fair Haven was home to more immigrants than &#x27;natives&#x27;. Many black and Puerto Rican families migrated into Fair Haven by the 1960s. Redevelopment occurred along the Quinnipiac River.

As part of Mayor Richard C. Lee&#x27;s urban renewal program, 107 Fair Haven households were displaced in the 1960s.

In 1978, a local historic district was created.

In the early 1980s, many buildings on Grand Avenue were renovated.

===21st century===
The waterfront area (Front Street and adjacent streets) have been redeveloped in the last decade, including construction of luxury condominiums, renovation of the Fair Haven marina, demolition of the Quinnipiac Terrace public housing project and replacement with a Cape Cod style village with both subsidized and market rate units, and the renovation of many of the old oyster houses. This part of Fair Haven has attracted a culturally diverse mix of young professionals, students, artists, and families with children. Other parts of Fair Haven continue to struggle with poverty related problems such as crime and homelessness.

In 2010, a 100 kW windmill was erected near Criscuolo Park, which can be seen from much of New Haven.

<doc id="960277" wikidata="Q2451972" url="?curid=960277" title="Loyalty oath">
<text>A loyalty oath is a pledge of allegiance to an organization, institution, or state of which an individual is a member. Historically, loyalty oaths have been used across cultures and civilizations as tools to ensure fidelity, maintain order, and consolidate power. From ancient empires like Rome, where soldiers and officials swore oaths to the emperor, to medieval Europe, where vassals pledged fealty to their lords, these oaths have played a significant role in shaping political and social structures. While they can foster unity and trust, loyalty oaths have also been criticized for suppressing dissent and enforcing conformity, reflecting the complex interplay between authority and individual freedom throughout global history.

==In the United States==

In the United States, such an oath has often indicated that the affiant has not been a member of a particular organization or organizations mentioned in the oath. The U.S. Supreme Court allows the oath to be a form of legal document.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
 

During the American Civil War, political prisoners and Confederate prisoners of war were often released upon taking an &quot;oath of allegiance&quot;. Lincoln&#x27;s ten percent plan featured an oath to &quot;faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the union of the States thereunder&quot; as a condition for a Presidential pardon. During Reconstruction, retroactive loyalty oaths were proposed by Radical Republicans, which would have barred former Confederates and Confederate sympathizers from federal, state, or local offices. Beginning in 1862, all U.S. Naval shipyard employees were required to sign a loyalty oath as a condition of employment.

===1930s to 1950s===

In support of Roosevelt&#x27;s National Recovery Administration, 100,000 school children marched to Boston Common and swore a loyalty oath administered by the mayor, &quot;I promise as a good American citizen to do my part for the NRA. I will buy only where the Blue Eagle flies.&quot;

Loyalty oaths were common during World War II.

Another use of loyalty oaths in the United States was during the 1950s and 1960s. The Red Scare during the 1950s and the Congressional hearings chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy helped to sustain a national mood of concern about communist agents and a fear such agents may injure the U.S. government through espionage, outright violence, or speech.

==== Executive Order 9835 &quot;Loyalty Order&quot; (1947)====

On March 21, 1947, concerned with Soviet subversive penetration and infiltration into the United States government by American citizens who held oaths of allegiance to a foreign power during wartime, President Harry S Truman instituted a Loyalty Program by signing Executive Order 9835, also known as the &quot;Loyalty Order.&quot; It required loyalty oaths and background investigations on persons deemed suspect of holding party membership in organizations that advocated violent and anti-democratic programs.

====The University of California loyalty oath (1950)====

The Levering Act was a law enacted by the U.S. state of California in 1950. It required state employees to subscribe to a loyalty oath that specifically disavowed radical beliefs. It was aimed in particular at employees of the University of California. In January 1950, 750 faculty members had approved a resolution to oppose the university&#x27;s regents and create a committee to coordinate legal action against the university should an oath be required. Several teachers resigned in protest or lost their positions when they refused to sign the loyalty oath. Among those who left were the psychologist Erik Erikson and the classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein, both of them Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. In August 1950, the regents fired 31 faculty members who refused to sign the oath. Those who were terminated sued, and by 1952 had been rehired when the university declined to pursue its case against them in court. One of the fired faculty members, the physics professor David Saxon, went on with his career and was appointed president of the entire University of California system in 1975, a job he held until 1983.

====&quot;Garner v. Board of Public Works&quot; (1951)====

Typically, a loyalty oath has wording similar to that mentioned in the U.S Supreme Court decision of &quot;Garner v. Board of Public Works&quot;:

I further swear (or affirm) that I do not advise, advocate or teach, and have not within the period beginning five (5) years prior to the effective date of the ordinance requiring the making of this oath or affirmation, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the Government of the United States of America or of the State of California and that I am not now and have not, within said period, been or become a member of or affiliated with any group, society, association, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches, or has, within said period, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means of the Government of the United States of America, or of the State of California. I further swear (or affirm) that I will not, while I am in the service of the City of Los Angeles, advise, advocate or teach, or be or become a member of or affiliated with any group, association, society, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches, or has within said period, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the Government of the United States of America or of the State of California . . . .

====&quot;Speiser v. Randall&quot; (1958)====

In &quot;Speiser v. Randall&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the State of California&#x27;s loyalty oath, as required by a California law enacted in 1954, as a condition of exemption from property tax. In applying for property tax exemption as a veteran of World War II, ACLU lawyer Lawrence Speiser had refused to sign the loyalty oath. The court ruled that because the state required the claimant to show they are not advocating state overthrow and hence are not criminals within the applicable laws, the loyalty oath requirement to obtain the tax exemption is unconstitutional. The burden of proof for a criminal action rest on the state and not on the individual private citizen.

===1960s===

The oaths were repeatedly challenged on grounds that they violated the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of association. The United States Supreme Court avoided addressing these problems during the McCarthy Era. During the 1960s, it began striking down such oaths on the basis of vagueness and undue breadth. October 16, 1961, Tobias Simon and Howard Dixon argued &quot;Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction&quot; before the Supreme Court. In 1962 the Court struck down the Florida requirement that teachers swear &quot;I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist party&quot;. This decision was followed in 1964 by its lack of support for two oaths, one of which required teachers to promote respect for the flag, reverence for law and order, and loyalty to the institutions of the United States and the State of Washington. Arizona and New York teacher oaths affirming lack of association with subversive organizations were struck down in 1966 and 1967.

New York Education Law Section 3002 requires that any &quot;teacher, instructor or professor in any [state] school or institution in the public school system ... or in any school, college, university or other educational institution&quot; sign an oath pledging support for the federal and state constitutions. The law does not apply to foreign nationals, but only to United States citizens. The law was enacted in 1934 in response to a nationwide campaign by the American Legion. The law was challenged by a group of 27 faculty members from Adelphi University in 1966 because the oath constrained free speech, and because it selectively applied to faculty members but not staff. For unknown reasons, Adelphi faculty had never been required to sign the oath until 1966 when a staff member in the New York State Education Department discovered the oversight. On January 22, 1968, after moving through the judicial system, the United States Supreme Court affirmed an earlier District Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the law. This was the first occasion on which the Supreme Court evaluated the constitutionality of oaths of this type.

===1970s–1990s===

==== Last major loyalty oath case (1972) ====
The last major loyalty oath case heard by the court was decided in 1972, when it upheld a requirement that State of Massachusetts employees swear to uphold and defend the Constitution and to &quot;oppose the overthrow of the [government] by force, violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method&quot;.

During a case in 1972, &quot;Cole v. Richardson&quot;, the court declared four requirements needed for an oath to clear First Amendment muster:

# It cannot go against the First or Fourteenth Amendment rights. 
# The oath cannot keep an employee from participating in protected public speaking. 
# Freedom of association cannot be used in oath as protected by the Constitution. 
# The oath should be direct and clear, so no question comes to what is meant.

===2000s===

====2004 Bush presidential campaign====
During the 2004 presidential campaign, the campaign of George W. Bush sometimes required all attendants at its rallies to take an oath. Those who refused to take the oath were not allowed to attend the rally. The &quot;loyalty oath&quot; was actually a pledge of endorsement. These endorsements were used during some of the campaign rallies in 2004. The Bush campaign asserted that the oath was valid because the president was conducting a partisan campaign event. Opponents countered that the oath was intrusive to individual conscience and denied general public access to the president.

====California====
The California state constitution requires all state workers who are US citizens to sign a loyalty oath as a term of employment. On February 28, 2008, the California State University, East Bay fired Marianne Kearney-Brown, a Quaker, for refusing to do so without inserting a reservation that her defense of the state and country would be done &quot;nonviolently.&quot; She was reinstated a week later, when she agreed to sign the oath when accompanied by a document prepared by the university that included the clarification &quot;Signing the oath does not carry with it any obligation or requirement that public employees bear arms or otherwise engage in violence.&quot;

The text of that oath begins:
&quot;STATE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.&quot;

====Arizona====
Arizona requires all employees of the state, its counties and localities to sign an oath of loyalty to the country and the state. The oath requirement predates statehood; it was successfully challenged in the 1960s over wording banning Communist Party membership and was rewritten in 2003.

====Ohio====
In the March 2008 State of Ohio presidential primary, some people might have been required to sign a loyalty oath in order to vote. Voters who wish to switch their party affiliation on Primary Election Day and who are challenged are supposed to sign a statement &quot;stating that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose ballot the person desires to vote.&quot; The statement is signed under penalty of &quot;election falsification.&quot; If the challenged person refuses to sign the statement under penalty of election falsification, he is given a provisional ballot.

&quot;The Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, among others, thus describes the nature of the statement and effect of &quot;election falsification&quot;: Anyone who signs this loyalty oath, but does not intend to honor it, can be prosecuted for &quot;election falsification&quot;, a fifth-degree felony.

The statute, however, describes the offense differently: &quot;No person, either orally or in writing, on oath lawfully administered or in a statement made under penalty of election falsification, shall knowingly state a falsehood as to a material matter relating to an election in a proceeding before a court, tribunal, or election official, or in a matter in relation to which an oath or statement under penalty of election falsification is authorized by law...&quot; Thus the requirement is, arguably, more a statement of current intent than a loyalty oath&#x27;s promise of future support.

====Washington====

Efforts to repeal the Washington&#x27;s anti-communist loyalty oath legislation failed in 2013.
===2010s===

====2016 Trump presidential campaign====
During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, the campaign of Donald Trump sometimes required all attendants at its rallies to take an oath. Fellow candidate Ted Cruz likened it pledging to a king.

== Israel ==

Israeli politician Avigdor Lieberman proposed in 2009 that Israeli citizens should be required to sign a loyalty oath, vowing allegiance to Israel as a Jewish, democratic state, to accept its symbols, flag and anthem, and to commit to military service or some alternative service. Those who refused would lose their citizenship and right to vote. In the &quot;Jewish Week&quot;, Lieberman justified his &quot;no loyalty – no citizenship&quot; by stating that he had heard &quot;Israeli Arab leaders&quot; calling for &quot;the destruction of the State of Israel&quot; and suicide bombings at pro-Hamas rallies.

Lieberman compared his &quot;responsible citizenship&quot; platform with the U.S. naturalization process: &quot;In the U.S., those requesting a Green Card must take an oath that they will fulfill the rights and duties of citizenship.&quot; Ethan Bronner noted in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the American practice only applies to naturalized citizens while Lieberman&#x27;s oath would apply to all Israeli citizens.

On 10 October 2010 the Israeli cabinet approved a loyalty oath bill changing oath of citizenship for non-Jews from &quot;I declare that I will be a loyal national of the State of Israel&quot; to &quot;I swear that I will be a loyal citizen to the state of Israel, as a Jewish and democratic state, and will uphold its laws&quot; (no oath is required of Jews seeking citizenship). Far-right Knesset member Michael Ben-Ari felt that the vote vindicated Meir Kahane:

However, on October 18, prime minister Netanyahu ordered Justice minister Ya&#x27;akov Ne&#x27;eman to extend Cabinet-level debate on the bill in order to add amendments which make the loyalty oath universal to both Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants who seek citizenship. This inclusion of Jewish immigrants was supported by the Anti-Defamation League. The bill didn&#x27;t pass and the oath remained unchanged.

<text>Lawrence David Kusche (November 1, 1940 — July 22, 2024) was an American author, research librarian, and pilot. He investigated unexplained disappearances and other unusual events related to the Bermuda Triangle to answer queries he was getting as a research librarian. He eventually wrote a book debunking most of the mysteries touted by other writers about that location.

==Early life and education==
Kusche was born in Wisconsin, and his family moved to the Arizona area when he was six. 
Interested in aviation, Kusche qualified for a commercial pilot&#x27;s license at age 19, was a commercial pilot by age 21, a flight instructor by age 24, and an instrument instructor.

==Career==
In 1964, Kusche graduated from Arizona State University (ASU). He completed a training course to become a commercial flight engineer, but, as he told the Tucson Daily Citizen in 1975, &quot;I decided I didn&#x27;t like it, so the day I was supposed to report for work, I resigned and came back to Arizona. I just didn&#x27;t like being an engineer, the guy with hundreds and hundreds of instruments and controls. You really can&#x27;t see out of the airplane.&quot;
He returned to Arizona to become a high school math teacher and librarian. Later, he acquired a master&#x27;s degree in library science and began working at ASU&#x27;s Hayden Library in June, 1969.

Kusche took a leave-of-absence from ASU to finish his first book. After the success of the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; book, Kusche left his career as a librarian to become a writer. He has worked as a technical writer in the Phoenix area. After the publication of his investigative books, Kusche became a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI).

==Books==

===Bermuda Triangle===
As a research librarian at Arizona State University, Kusche got queries for all types of information from students writing term papers. 
In the early 1970s, he became interested in the Bermuda Triangle mystery, as he was confronted by numerous queries related to the Triangle. This prompted Kusche and fellow librarian Debbie Blouin to start gathering information, mostly by writing hundreds of letters to request information from official sources. Initially, the two librarians began selling (for $2) a bibliography of the information about the Bermuda Triangle that they had acquired.
Later, it occurred to Kusche that somebody should put down all of the information they had gathered into a book. When the publishing company Harper and Row ordered a copy of the bibliography, Kusche sent them a copy with a note scribbled on it asking if they were interested in a book about the subject that he was writing – and they were.

Initially intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the Triangle, Kusche&#x27;s research convinced him that virtually all the incidents had been caused by storms or accidents, or they happened outside the Triangle, or no proof could be found that they ever occurred at all. His conclusion was that the Triangle was a &quot;manufactured mystery,&quot; the result of poor research and reporting, and the occasional deliberate falsification of facts.

===The Disappearance of Flight 19===
Kusche originally included a long chapter in his Bermuda Triangle book about Flight 19, five Navy Avenger torpedo airplanes on a training mission out of Fort Lauderdale Naval Air Station that disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean on December 5, 1945. Kusche later expanded this chapter into a book, &quot;The Disappearance of Flight 19&quot;. He studied the Navy&#x27;s report of the investigation, interviewed many of the Navy personnel who were involved at the time, and flew the likely route of the missing aircraft himself. At the time, the lost flight of five torpedo bombers was said to be a victim of the mysterious forces in the Triangle. Kusche explained why the flight leader erroneously thought he was in the Florida Keys, why he said his compass had failed, and why no wreckage has yet been found.

===Other books===

Kusche is the author of &quot;Larry Kusche&#x27;s Popcorn Cookery&quot;, a 1977 cookbook detailing recipes involving popcorn, including baked goods made from ground-up popcorn &quot;flour&quot;, and &quot;Shape Up Your Hips and Thighs&quot;.
