<text>Susan Saint James (born 1946) is an American former actress and activist, most widely known for her work in television during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, especially the detective series &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; (1971–1976) and the sitcom &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; (1984–1989).

==Early life==
Saint James was born to a Connecticut family, the daughter of Constance (Geiger) Miller, a teacher, and Charles Daniel Miller, who worked for Mitchell Camera and later became the president of the Testor Corporation. Saint James was raised in Rockford, Illinois, where she began modeling as a teenager. In her younger school years she attended the Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart in Lake Forest, Illinois. She later attended Connecticut College.

==Career==
Saint James&#x27;s first screen role was in the TV movie &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot; (1966) with Tony Franciosa, launching her career when it became a series two years later. Among her other early television appearances were two episodes of the first season of &quot;Ironside&quot; (&quot;Girl in the Night&quot;, December 1967 and two months later, playing a different role in the episode &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;). She also had a supporting role in &quot;Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows&quot; (1968), the sequel to &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot;.

From 1968 to 1971, as a result of her first role in &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot;, Saint James had a regular part in the series &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, winning an Emmy Award for her role as research assistant Peggy Maxwell in 1969 and establishing her as a popular young actress. The series format, set at a large media company, featured rotating lead characters played by Tony Franciosa, Gene Barry, and Robert Stack—generally only one of their characters seen each week. Saint James provided a measure of series continuity by appearing as a research assistant at various times to all three. She appeared in approximately half the episodes, usually in a supporting role, although her Peggy Maxwell was the primary character in the second-season episode &quot;The King of Denmark,&quot; alongside Franciosa&#x27;s &quot;Jeff Dillon&quot;. As well, in the first-season story &quot;Pineapple Rose&quot; (a Gene Barry segment), Saint James was prominently featured when her character was kidnapped in a case of mistaken identity.

In 1967, Saint James had a small part in the pilot episode of the Robert Wagner crime-caper series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. This led to a recurring role playing a new character, Charlene &quot;Chuck&quot; Brown, Alexander Mundy&#x27;s fellow thief and &quot;casual&quot; love interest. She was featured in four episodes of the series from 1968 to 1970. She went on to appear in the pilot episode of the western series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; (1971).

Then came her first starring role as Rock Hudson&#x27;s younger supportive wife, Sally McMillan, in the popular, lighthearted crime series, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; (1971–1976), for which she received four Emmy Award nominations.

Saint James left the show due to a contract dispute but went on to further her career as an actress in feature films, such as co-starring with Peter Fonda in the film &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot; (1977). She achieved significant success in the vampire comedy &quot;Love at First Bite&quot; (1979) and followed up with a role in the comedy &quot;How to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot; (1980), co-starring Jessica Lange and Jane Curtin. Between films, she made a guest appearance in the March 3, 1980, episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (episode 192: &quot;War Co-Respondent&quot;). After other film ventures failed to establish her, she returned to television, starring in the comedy series &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; opposite Jane Curtin from 1984 until 1989. She received three more Emmy Award nominations for this role.

Saint James was a celebrity guest commentator for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;WrestleMania 2&quot; event in 1986 along with Vince McMahon.

In her mid-40s, Saint James retired after &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; ended. In addition to motherhood (her second-youngest son was born during the fourth season of &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;), she has been an active volunteer with the Special Olympics (an organization she began actively supporting in 1972). She has served on the Special Olympics board and was Civitan International&#x27;s celebrity chairperson for their Special Olympics involvement. She also is a board member of the Telluride Foundation.

In 1998, Saint James, her sister Mercedes Dewey and friend Barrie Johnson founded &quot;Seedling and Pip&quot;, a baby gift basket business. Saint James occasionally has emerged from retirement to appear in television series guest roles, such as the mother of (her real-life niece) Christa Miller in the first season of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and ten years later, as a defense attorney on the February 28, 2006, episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. She also starred in a Warner Theatre (Torrington, Connecticut) 1999 production of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. On June 11, 2008, Saint James was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
In the late 1970s, during an interview, she stated: &quot;About eight and a half years ago, my husband and I decided to stop eating meat and then about six months later we stopped eating fish. … I had two beautiful births as a vegetarian; they were great labors—no bleeding, no complications, no problems. The diet worked perfectly for me.&quot;

While guest-hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1981, Saint James met the &quot;SNL&quot; executive producer Dick Ebersol. They married within the year and had three sons: Charles, William, and Edward (Teddy). In March 2002, Saint James filed for divorce from Ebersol, but the couple reconciled later that summer.

On November 28, 2004, a private plane carrying Dick, Charles, and Teddy crashed during an attempted takeoff from Montrose Regional Airport in Colorado. Dick and son Charles survived, but son Teddy, age 14, died, as did pilot Luis Alberto Polanco Espaillet and flight attendant Warren T. Richardson III.

Saint James is the aunt of actress Christa Miller. 

She holds honorary degrees from six Connecticut institutions: the University of Connecticut, the University of Bridgeport, Southern Connecticut State University, Albertus Magnus College, the University of New Haven, and Goodwin College. She was a featured speaker at The Women&#x27;s Conference in 2007, at a session called &quot;Beyond Courage: Overcoming the Unimaginable.&quot;

<doc id="937637" wikidata="Q1349385" url="?curid=937637" title="The Corries">
<text>The Corries were a Scottish folk group that emerged from the Scottish folk revival of the early 1960s. The group was a trio from their formation until 1966 when founder Bill Smith left the band but Roy Williamson and Ronnie Browne continued as a duo until Williamson&#x27;s death in 1990.

They are particularly known for the song &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, written by Williamson, which has become an unofficial national anthem of Scotland.

==History==
===Early years===
In the early 1960s, Bill Smith (born in 1936 in Edinburgh), Ron Cruikshank and Andy Turner had formed a trio called The Corrie Voices. The trio was named after Smith&#x27;s daughter, Corrie Smith, but because a corrie is a deep bowl in a mountain, the name was particularly appropriate as it evokes imagery of the Scottish landscape. After Turner dropped out in 1962, Roy Williamson teamed up with Smith and Cruikshank to form the Corrie Folk Trio. Their first performance was in the Waverley Bar in St Mary&#x27;s Street, Edinburgh. After a few weeks, Cruikshank left due to illness. They had already accepted an engagement at the Edinburgh Festival so Williamson suggested that Ronnie Browne should be brought in to make up the numbers.

The band added female Irish singer Paddie Bell to become the Corrie Folk Trio and Paddie Bell. The audience was only eight people for the debut of this line-up but by the end of the festival there was a full house at every performance.

===Television===
Within a year of formation, they appeared on television. The BBC began a television series set in a folk club. The resident group on the &quot;Hoot&#x27;nanny Show&quot; was the Corrie Folk Trio. Another BBC series, &quot;The White Heather Club&quot;, began in 1958. It featured Andy Stewart, Jimmy Shand and his Band, Robin Hall and Jimmie Macgregor, and the Corries. While the rest of the show was set in a studio, the Corries were filmed in location: sea songs were sung in a harbour, and &quot;The Braes o&#x27; Killiecrankie&quot; was sung at the Pass of Killiecrankie.

===As The Corries===
In 1965 Paddie Bell departed, followed by Bill Smith in 1966. In the duo left behind, Williamson was a multi-instrumentalist while Browne handled lead vocals. They cancelled all engagements for a few months to practise intensely and, emerging under the new name, The Corries, they performed at the Jubilee Arms Hotel in Cortachy, Angus.

===1970s===
In 1969, &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; featured on the Fontana release, &quot;The Corries in Concert&quot;. The song was quickly adopted by world lightweight boxing champion Ken Buchanan, whose fans sang it on his entering the ring. It was then taken up by supporters of rugby union as the unofficial national anthem and is still used at Scotland&#x27;s rugby internationals. &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; has since been adopted as the national anthem at international football matches. 1974 saw the first release of a series of &quot;Live from Scotland&quot; albums on their own Pan-Audio / DARA label, all featuring live recordings from the group&#x27;s famed tours of concert halls around Scotland, extending to a total of four volumes. The Flower of Scotland live performance from &quot;Live from Scotland Volume 1&quot; was released as a single backed by Browne&#x27;s song, &quot;Roses of Prince Charlie&quot;, in several versions including one with special cover artwork for the 1974 FIFA World Cup campaign. The 1977 album, &quot;Peat Fire Flame&quot;, saw the group return to the studio album format, with a move towards love songs and celebrations of the landscape. By the 1980s however, the group would return to live albums for the rest of their recording career.

===1980–present===
Roy Williamson suffered from asthma and before a series of concerts he would deliberately cease treatment to provoke attacks and gain temporary immunity. During the Corries&#x27; 1989 tour, Williamson&#x27;s health went into decline and he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He spent his last years living in Forres, close to where he spent his school years. He died on 12 August 1990.

Ronnie Browne continued recording and moved into acting, as well as expanding his painting career. He toured as a soloist for a few years after Williamson&#x27;s death, and even released a solo album, but never reached the same level of success that he achieved as part of the duo. He has now retired from performing, but occasionally sings &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; along with the crowd at Scottish rugby or shinty matches.

Paddie Bell continued to make solo albums following her departure from the trio, most notably with Irish musicians Finbar and Eddie Furey, but withdrew from the folk scene followed by a period of dependency on alcohol and anti-depressant medication. In the 1990s Bell, with the help of several friends and fans on the folk scene in Edinburgh, revived her singing career with new recordings and became something of a celebrity again. She died in 2005, aged 74.

In December 2007, The Corries were inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame at the Scottish Trad Music Awards in Fort William, promoted by concertina virtuoso Simon Thoumire&#x27;s Hands Up for Trad organisation.

==The Combolins==
In 1969, Williamson invented the &quot;combolins&quot;, two complementary instruments that combined several into one single instrument. One combined a mandolin and a guitar (along with four bass strings operated with slides), the other combining guitar and the Spanish bandurria. The latter was an instrument Williamson had played since the early days of the Corrie Folk Trio.

Originally conceived as a way to combine several of the many instruments they carried around on tour the combolins in fact became an additional two instruments for the tour van. Most often, Browne played the guitar/mandolin instrument with bass strings, and Williamson the other, which also had 13 sympathetic strings designed to resonate like the Indian sitar. The wood for the instruments was obtained from antique hardwood furniture as well as premium grade Tyrolean spruce, and featured Williamson&#x27;s embellishments in silver and mother of pearl.

The Corries&#x27; album, &quot;Strings and Things&quot; (1970), was specifically designed to showcase these instruments and featured detailed descriptions of them on the rear sleeve. Usually the combolins were played to accompany long ballads such as &quot;The Silkie of Sule Skerry&quot; and &quot;The Gartan Mother&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, as well as a number of the compositions of Peebles baker George Weir, including &quot;Lord Yester&quot; and &quot;Weep ye Weel by Atholl&quot;.

==Legacy==
Gotye cites The Corries as the inspiration behind his music.

The Scottish Traditional Hall of Music describes the Corries as “the godfathers of the modern folk-music scene in Scotland.” 

==Discography==
Many of The Corries recordings have now been re-issued on CD by Moidart Music, a company set up originally to release Williamson&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Long Journey South&quot; solo album. The recordings are now overseen by Browne&#x27;s son Gavin, who runs the official Corries website along with original recording engineer, Allan Spence, and David Sinton.

<text>Leo Yankevich (30 October 1961 – 11 December 2018) was an American poet and the editor of &quot;The New Formalist&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Leo Yankevich grew up and attended high school in Farrell, Pennsylvania, a small steel town in western Pennsylvania. He studied History and Polish Studies at Alliance College, Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, receiving a BA in 1984. Later that year he traveled to Poland on a fellowship from the Kosciuszko Foundation to attend Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University.

After the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, he decided to settle permanently in Poland. Thereafter, he lived in Gliwice, an industrial city in Upper Silesia.

==Writing activities==
Yankevich wrote poems in both traditional metre and in syllabics, and only occasionally in free verse. He was a prolific translator, having rendered into English poems by Mikhail Lermontov, Georg Trakl, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stanisław Grochowiak, Czesław Miłosz, Alexander Blok, Leopold Staff, Nikolay Gumilev, Bolesław Leśmian, and many others. He has a large internet presence with work published in scores of online publications, ranging from the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; to &quot;Poets Against War&quot;.

==Personal life==
Yankevich was married and had three sons.

<text>Richard Peter Gaughan (born 17 May 1948) is a Scottish musician, singer and songwriter, particularly of folk and social protest songs. He is regarded as one of Scotland&#x27;s leading singer-songwriters.

==Early years==
Gaughan was born in Glasgow&#x27;s Royal Maternity Hospital while his father was working in Glasgow as an engine driver. He spent the first year-and-a-half of his life in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, after which the whole family moved to Leith, a port on the outskirts of Edinburgh.

The eldest of three children, Gaughan grew up surrounded by the music of both Scotland and Ireland. His mother, a Highland Scot from Lochaber who spoke Gaelic, had as a child won a silver medal for singing at a Gaelic Mòd. His father, a native of Leith, played guitar. His Irish-born paternal grandfather (a native of Erris, County Mayo) played the fiddle and his paternal grandmother, a Glaswegian born to Irish parents, played button accordion and sang. The family experienced considerable poverty, but the area they lived in possessed a strong community spirit and many of Gaughan&#x27;s songs celebrate his working-class roots. In his teens Gaughan served an apprenticeship at a local paper mill, but had wanted to be a musician since he first started playing guitar at the age of seven. He got involved with the local folk music scene and, with two others, started a club called the Edinburgh Folk Centre. He turned professional in early 1970 and moved to London.

==1970s==
Gaughan&#x27;s first album, &quot;No More Forever&quot;, was recorded in 1971. On it he sings and plays acoustic guitar, joined on some tracks by fiddler Aly Bain. All the songs except one are traditional, the exception being Hamish Henderson&#x27;s &quot;The John Maclean March&quot;, a tribute to the Glasgow socialist John Maclean and a foretaste of the many politically committed songs that Gaughan would later record. In 1972, before his album was released, Gaughan joined Bain, Cathal McConnell and Robin Morton, all of whom he had known from his Edinburgh Folk Centre days, in their group The Boys of the Lough. He stayed with the group for about a year, during which he played and sang on their eponymous debut album. He gave his reason for leaving the group as fear of flying, which was incompatible with the group&#x27;s travelling commitments.

Gaughan resumed his solo career and on his next album, &quot;Kist O Gold&quot; (recorded in 1975), he sang mainly traditional songs, using only his guitar as accompaniment. In that year he also recorded two tracks with The High Level Ranters on their album &quot;The Bonnie Pit Laddie&quot;. He was, however, becoming frustrated with the folk club scene and keen to work with other musicians, so he joined the Celtic rock band Five Hand Reel. Between 1976 and 1978 the pace of Gaughan&#x27;s life was hectic. He recorded four albums with Five Hand Reel (three under their own name and one in collaboration with the Danish folksinger Alan Klitgaard), as well as two solo ones: the all-instrumental &quot;Coppers and Brass&quot; (1975), and &quot;Gaughan&quot; (1978), on which he played both acoustic and electric guitars. He also collaborated with Tony Capstick and Dave Burland in an album of songs by Ewan MacColl.

Gaughan loved playing with Five Hand Reel and is proud of its music, but as time went on he felt that the band was being pressurised into becoming more commercial. Five Hand Reel was more popular in northern Europe than in the UK, so he had to spend a lot of time on the road away from his family, and an excessive consumption of alcohol and generally unhealthy lifestyle began to take their toll, both physically and mentally. In November 1978 Gaughan&#x27;s daughter was knocked down by a car and seriously injured while he was away. This event precipitated a major crisis in Gaughan&#x27;s life. He left the band but found it difficult to get solo gigs and by the end of the decade he was only playing occasionally, supplementing his income by writing articles for the magazine &quot;Folk Review&quot;.

==1980s==

Gaughan resumed playing in 1980, collaborating with several other performers on the album &quot;Folk Friends 2&quot; and with Andy Irvine on &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; (1982).

His next solo album, &quot;Handful of Earth&quot; (1981) became, he said, his most successful in terms of acclaim and sales. It was &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s folk album of the year in 1981, and in 1989 was voted album of the decade by &quot;Folk Roots&quot; magazine (now &quot;fRoots&quot;) in both readers&#x27; and critics&#x27; polls. The album contained a strong set of traditional and contemporary songs, including several which have remained part of Gaughan&#x27;s core repertoire, such as Robert Burns&#x27;s lyrical &quot;Now Westlin Winds&quot;, the feisty &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot;, Phil &amp; June Colclough&#x27;s evocative &quot;Song For Ireland&quot; and his own reworking of the traditional &quot;Both Sides The Tweed&quot;, which calls for Scottish independence without sacrificing friendship with the rest of the UK.

The Thatcher government of the 1980s galvanised Gaughan politically. He had never hidden his strong socialist beliefs and all his albums had included songs by such writers as Hamish Henderson, Ewan MacColl, Dominic Behan, Ed Pickford and Leon Rosselson. Now, however, he felt that &quot;It was quite clearly time to stop reporting and start participating&quot; and his next album, &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song&quot; (1983) was, he said, &quot;a full-frontal onslaught, basically an anti Cold War polemic&quot;. All of its songs, which were performed in a variety of styles ranging from acoustic folk to electric rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, exuded political commitment. Gaughan also extended his political activism to areas other than singing. He instigated the setting up of &quot;Perform&quot;, an organisation which aimed to facilitate co-operation across the folk music world, he joined the agitprop theatre group 7:84 and during the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85) he was Chair of the Leith Miners&#x27; Support Group.

Gaughan recorded three solo albums over the next few years: &quot;Live in Edinburgh&quot; (1985) (his first solo gig following a 6-month lay-off due to losing his voice), &quot;True and Bold&quot; (1986), a collection of songs about mining and &quot;Call It Freedom&quot; (1988), which was similar in style and content to &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song&quot;. He also collaborated with the jazz percussionist Ken Hyder on an album of free improvisation, &quot;Fanfare for Tomorrow&quot; (1985), and sang and played with other artists on a tribute to Woody Guthrie, &quot;Woody Lives!&quot; (1987).

==1990s==
By the early 90s Gaughan was again feeling the need to work regularly with others, so he invited seven other well-established Scots musicians to form a group called Clan Alba. The original line-up consisted of Gaughan, singer-guitarist Davy Steel, harpists Mary Macmaster and Patsy Seddon, multi-instrumentalist Brian McNeill, piper Gary West and percussionists Mike Travis and Dave Tulloch. The group made its debut at the 1992 Edinburgh Folk Festival and performed at other festivals across the UK and Europe over the next two years, during which time Gary West left and was replaced by Fred Morrison. In 1994 Clan Alba recorded an eponymous double CD, which Gaughan produced at Redesdale Studios, but the group disbanded the following year after problems with the marketing of the record.

Resuming his solo career, Gaughan recorded two further albums during the decade. On &quot;Sail On&quot; (1996) he was accompanied by several Clan Alba alumni. Along with political anthems such as Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Waist Deep In The Big Muddy&quot; and Brian McNeill&#x27;s &quot;No Gods and Precious Few Heroes&quot;, the record also featured Gaughan&#x27;s interpretations of more mainstream songs, including Jagger/Richards&#x27;s &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; and Richard Thompson&#x27;s &quot;1952 Vincent Black Lightning. He described his next, &quot;Redwood Cathedral&quot; (1998), as &quot;primarily a homage by a song interpreter to the craft of the songwriter.&quot; It featured stripped-down arrangements of reflective songs, including the old Everly Brothers hit, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot; and Lal Waterson&#x27;s &quot;Fine Horseman&quot;.

During this period Gaughan also became actively involved in Usenet. He had studied computer programming during the 1980s, started building websites in 1994 and set up his own web design company in 1998.

==2000 to present day==
In the early 2000s Gaughan turned his hand to larger-scale composition and received two orchestral commissions from the Celtic Connections festival. The first, &quot;Timewaves (Love Song to a People&#x27;s Music)&quot;, mixed orchestral playing with folk singing and was performed at the 2004 festival by the Orchestra of Scottish Opera together with Gaughan and other folk singers and players. The second was a symphony, &quot;Treaty 300&quot;, composed for the inaugural concert of the Celtic Connections Youth Orchestra in 2007. Between 2001 and 2008 five Gaughan albums were released. On &quot;Outlaws and Dreamers&quot; (2001), he used only his acoustic guitar and Brian McNeill&#x27;s fiddle to accompany his voice. &quot;Prentice Piece&quot; (2002) was a self-selected thirty-year retrospective of his career (although some material could not be included owing to copyright disputes). &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; (2006) was another compilation. &quot;Lucky For Some&quot; (2006) consisted almost entirely of self-written songs and &quot;Gaughan Live! at the Trades Club&quot; (2008) was a live gig, recorded at one of his favourite venues, the Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire.

Gaughan continued to regularly play solo gigs and for a while presented a weekly music programme, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, for the Scottish radio station Black Diamond FM.

In September 2016, believing he had had a stroke some time previously which was affecting his ability to perform, Gaughan announced that he was cancelling all public performances until further notice. An MRI scan the next month confirmed the stroke, and in November of that year a benefit concert, featuring Aly Bain, Phil Cunningham, Billy Bragg, Karine Polwart and Eddi Reader, was held for him in Edinburgh. According to his booking agent, Gaughan entered a course of physiotherapy in February 2017 and will remain in physio and not performing &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;.

==Vocal and guitar styles==
Gaughan sings in Scots (his first language), English and, occasionally, Gaelic. His voice has been described by some as &quot;capable of turning from aching tenderness to the high dudgeon of political rage within the space of a line, or, on occasion, even in the turn of a single word&quot;.

He plays guitar in a variety of tunings, using both flatpicking and fingerpicking styles and has acknowledged Doc Watson and Hank Snow (flatpickers), Davey Graham, Bert Jansch and Martin Carthy (fingerpickers) as his prime influences. He has recorded extensively as a session musician and has been called &quot;one of the finest and most original guitarists in the British Isles&quot;.

Gaughan&#x27;s live performances are noted for their passion and intensity. According to &quot;The Rough Guide to World Music&quot; &quot;[his] passionate artistry towers like a colossus above three decades&quot;; while another reviewer has commented that &quot;in live performance he generates the sort of voodoo intensity you expect from the rawest blues, but hardly from the cosily insular world of British folk&quot;.

==Accolades==
Gaughan has been the subject of three television documentaries in the UK: BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Spectrum&quot; (1982), Scottish Television&#x27;s &quot;NB&quot; (1989) and BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Sessions&quot; (2008) (featuring a live performance and documentary footage).

In December 2009 he was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame and in February 2010 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at BBC Radio Two&#x27;s annual Folk Awards ceremony.

<doc id="937649" wikidata="Q4912004" url="?curid=937649" title="Billionaires for Bush">
<text>Billionaires for Bush was a culture jamming political street theater organization that satirically purported to support George W. Bush, drawing attention to policies which were perceived to benefit corporations and the super-wealthy. The group would typically dress as parodies of wealthy &quot;establishment&quot; figures in tuxedos while proclaiming slogans such as &quot;Two Million Jobs Lost—It&#x27;s a Start&quot;.

A secret New York City Police Department intelligence report, based on undercover surveillance of the group in 2003 and 2004 in advance of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, described the Billionaires as &quot;an activist group forged as a mockery of the current president and political policies&quot;.

==History==
===Forbes 1999===
The organization had first been founded by Andrew Boyd as &quot;Billionaires for Forbes&quot;, but Forbes left the 2000 race for the Republican Presidential nomination early due to a lack of adequate voter support. In 1999, Billionaires were present as Steve Forbes announced his candidacy for President and jeered him as he signed a flat tax pledge in New Hampshire. The Billionaire Manual describes the action:

They wore conservative jackets and ties (but no bowler hats, etc.) and carried innocuous signs such as &quot;Run, Steve, Run.&quot; Happy to have grass-roots support, the Forbes handlers (who believed the Billionaires were students from a nearby business school) placed them in front of the cameras, very near to the podium from which Forbes was speaking. However, each of their signs had another sign behind it. And behind their banner (which read &quot;Forbes 2000: He wants YOU to win&quot;) was another banner, waiting. At the most dramatic moment of his announcement, the Billionaires flipped their signs, and pulled away the large banner to reveal one which read: &quot;Billionaires for Forbes: Because Inequality isn&#x27;t Growing Fast Enough.&quot; The Billionaires started chanting &quot;Let workers pay the tax so investors can relax!&quot; and other slogans. Forbes and his handlers were completely thrown off, a little tussle ensued, and the Billionaires were pushed off to the side away from the cameras. Not wanting to miss the action, half the TV crews left the Forbes speech to cover the Billionaires. The action got lots of coverage.

===Bush (or Gore) 2000===
During the 2000 U.S. presidential election the organization was led by Andrew Boyd and Jenny Levison as &quot;Billionaires for Bush (or Gore),&quot; with the message that whichever candidate became president, corporations and the wealthy were guaranteed to benefit. The group spoke out under the motto &quot;Because Economic Inequality Is Not Growing Fast Enough&quot;.

The group appeared at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California, satirically praising major corporations for their financial support of the convention by attempting to deliver thank you cards to Fleet Bank, Fidelity Investments and Verizon Communications.

The Billionaires planned a &quot;Million Billionaires March&quot; at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia held the day before the convention. Other activities included a &quot;Vigil for corporate welfare&quot; and an auction of corporate advertising rights for the Liberty Bell.

===Bush 2004===
At a March 2004 fundraiser on Long Island attended by President Bush, Billionaires for Bush came to show their &quot;support&quot;, with men dressed in tuxedos with top hats and women in evening gowns and long gloves. The group&#x27;s laminated posters featured such slogans as &quot;Leave No Billionaire Behind&quot; and &quot;Corporations Are People Too&quot;.

Their largest events to date took place as part of the 2004 Republican National Convention protest activity. A separate group, however, continued on in the plague-on-both-your-houses style as &quot;Billionaires For Bush Or Kerry&quot;.

A &quot;Million Billionaires March&quot; on July 27, 2004, in conjunction with the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts, attracted 150 marchers who presented a faux check made out for the amount of &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to the local offices of the Republican Party, as part of an effort to &quot;defeat&quot; Kerry.

Lawsuits filed against the New York City Police Department after the 2004 Republican Convention uncovered the fact that Billionaires for Bush had been among groups infiltrated by the NYPD by its undercover officers gathering intelligence in advance of the convention.

===2005 and beyond===

The group remained active after 2004, but was less prominent. It used its established meme to raise awareness to a myriad of economic issues including Social Security privatization, the Iraq War, the Estate Tax and gentrification.

The group was led by a triumvirate of co-chairs Elissa Jiji, Marco Ceglie, and Melody Bates.

==Attire==
Members typically dressed in stereotypically wealthy attire, such as tuxedos and top hats or evening gowns and pearls and adopt names like &quot;Mo Bludfer Oyle&quot; (more blood for oil, a reference to the Iraq war) and &quot;Phil T. Rich&quot; (filthy rich).

Members also dressed in less stereotypical attire to perform more subtle pranks, as described in the Forbes example, above.

==Events==
Examples of Billionaire events include:
* Musical entertainment at anti-Bush events
* Thanking George W. Bush on his birthday for their tax cuts
* Protesting protests of the Bush administration
* Taking a pro-war stance at peace rallies
* Cross-country limousine tours 
* A petition to allow oil drilling and logging of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco
* Bush League baseball

These events and message were designed to attract media coverage.

==Slogans==
Some of their political slogans include &quot;Small Government, Big Wars,&quot; &quot;Because We&#x27;re All In This Together, Sort Of,&quot; &quot;Two Million Jobs Lost—It&#x27;s a Start,&quot; &quot;Leave No Billionaire Behind,&quot; &quot;Make Social Security Neither,&quot; and &quot;Corporations are People Too.&quot;

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and centrism in [[Estonia]]. It is limited to liberal and centrist parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that the party has labeled itself as a liberal party.

==History==
At the beginning of the twentieth century liberal parties emerged and played an important role in Estonia. They lost influence in the 1930s.

After the restoration of independence in 1990, both pragmatic centrist and liberal forces arose. The Estonian Reform Party (&quot;Eesti Reformierakond&quot;) is a free market liberal party. Despite its liberal international affiliations the Estonian Centre Party (&quot;Eesti Keskerakond&quot;) is generally not considered a liberal party, so therefore it is not included.

*1932: This is followed by the merger with the ⇒ Estonian Labour Party (&quot;Tööerakond&quot;) and the Union of Landlords (&quot;Üleriikline Majaomanikkude Seltside Liit&quot;) into the National Centre Party
*1934: The party is banned

===Radical Democratic Party===
*1917: Konstantin Päts, the later conservative leader, founded the Radical Democratic Party (&quot;Radikaal-Demokraatlik Erakond&quot;).

<doc id="937656" wikidata="Q17075910" url="?curid=937656" title="Liberalism in Colombia">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Colombia]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary for the parties to have labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
Liberalism in Colombia is organized as the opposition to conservatism. The Colombian Liberal Party, founded in 1849, still exists as a dominant party, usually achieving the largest voter turnouts and electoral victories in congress and regional elections. It has also been a strong contender in recent presidential elections. It joined the Socialist International, despite historically being considered a party relatively left of center and somewhat prone to populism, according to some critics.

Its traditional position can be considered to be somewhere in the middle between liberalism and social democracy. Several current leaders of the party in the late 20th and early 21st centuries claim to be seeking to move the party closer to the social democratic left.

==The timeline==
===Colombian Liberal Party===
* 1849: The Colombian Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Colombiano&quot;) is founded
* 1960: Dissident liberals formed the ⇒ Revolutionary Liberal Movement
* 1967/1968: Most of the movement returned to the party
* 1979: Dissident liberals formed ⇒ New Liberalism. Nuevo liberalismo
* 1981: Dissident liberals formed ⇒ People&#x27;s Power.

===Liberal Revolutionary Movement===
* 1960: A dissident faction of the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party formed the Liberal Revolutionary Movement (&quot;Movimiento Revolucionario Liberal&quot;) (MRL)
* 1967: Most of the party returned to the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party
* 1968: The party disappeared.

===People&#x27;s Power===
* 1981: A dissident faction of the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party formed People&#x27;s Power (&quot;Poder Popular&quot;).
* 1990s: The party returns to the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party.

===New Liberalism===
* 1979: A dissident faction of the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party formed New Liberalism (&quot;Nuevo Liberalismo&quot;).
* 1987: Most of the party and its leaders returned to the ⇒ Colombian Liberal Party.
* 1989: Luis Carlos Galán assassinated.
* 1990s: The party disappeared.
* 2021: The party was refounded.

===Uribism===
*1990s: Many small liberal regional movements are formed as dissidents factions of the main Liberal Party (Independent Civic Movement, LIDER Movement, New Colombia Movement, Liberal Movement, Civic Popular Convergence, Let&#x27;s Go Colombia, 98 Movement, Colombia My Country, Democratic Reconstruction Movement, Colombian Popular Party, Citizen&#x27;s Movement)
*2002: Some regional dissident factions return to the main Liberal Party. Other factions regroup in new political movements, most of them associated with the dissidential liberal president Álvaro Uribe (ALAS, United Popular Movement, National Progressist Movement, MORAL, MIPOL, Citizen&#x27;s Convergence, Let&#x27;s Go Colombia, Civic Popular Convergence, Radical Change Party, We are Colombia, Colombia Always, New Liberalism, Popular Will, Independent Civic Movement and Social Security Movement)
*2003: The political reform allows parliamentarists to regroup themselves. The main Liberal Party becomes oppositor to Uribe&#x27;s government, while all pro-Uribe members of the liberal party join other parties. The New Party (Nuevo Partido) is formed to unite all pro-Uribe liberals, however, not all of them join this group, as some of them joined Radical Change Party. Most of the previous factions unite in only three parties: Democratic Colombia Party, Living Colombia Movement and Citizen&#x27;s Convergence Party.
*2006: The New Party, along with some members of the liberal party, some of Radical Change, minor liberal and independent movements, plus a small group of conservatives, form the Social National Unity Party, most known as Party of the U, which is currently the biggest party of Colombia. Radical Change Party grows with the fusion with independent liberal and Christian movements. Other three liberal small parties had representation: Democratic Colombia Party, Living Colombia Movement and Citizen&#x27;s Convergence Party.
*2010: Half of the parliamentaries from Radical Change Party switch to Party of the U. The three small liberal movements (Democratic Colombia Party, Living Colombia Movement and Citizen&#x27;s Convergence Party) unite to become the National Integration Party (PIN).

<doc id="937662" wikidata="Q960189" url="?curid=937662" title="Keynote">
<text>A keynote in public speaking is a talk that establishes a main underlying theme. In corporate or commercial settings, greater importance is attached to the delivery of a keynote speech or keynote address. The keynote establishes the framework for the following programme of events or convention agenda; frequently the role of keynote speaker will include that of convention moderator. It will also flag up a larger idea—a literary story, an individual musical piece, or event.

At political or industrial conventions and expositions and at academic conferences, the keynote address or keynote speech is delivered to set the underlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of the event. Keynote speeches are also given at the graduation and commencement ceremonies of colleges, universities, and major high schools, usually by accomplished academics or celebrities invited by the student body. These speeches are often called a commencement speech.

Keynote speakers are often selected to raise interest in a particular event, such as a conference or large meeting sponsored by a corporation or association, and draw attendees to attend that program. Selecting a keynote speaker who is well known for their expertise in a particular field, or who has wide name recognition due to other accomplishments, will probably raise enthusiasm among prospective attendees for a meeting or conference. Increasingly the word &quot;keynote&quot; is being used as a synonym for plenary session or &quot;invited talk&quot;, with some conferences having an &quot;opening keynote,&quot; a &quot;closing keynote,&quot; and many other keynotes.

A keynote speaker may work independently or be represented by a speakers bureau. In the event that a speaker is represented by a traditional speakers bureau, a commission, typically 25%–30%, is due; however, this is traditionally and ethically absorbed by the speaker rather than the client so that the fee remains flat and transparently priced to the client.

The term &quot;keynote&quot; comes from the practice of a cappella, such as doo-wop or barbershop singers, playing a note before singing. The note played determines the key in which the song will be performed.

== In the United States ==
Some of the more famous keynote speeches in the United States are those made at the party conventions during Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Keynote speakers at these events have often gained nationwide fame (or notoriety); for example, Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and have occasionally influenced the course of the election. In the commercial arena, Steve Jobs delivered influential keynote speeches at Apple product, system and service launches, and former presidential candidate Al Gore delivered a keynote address which was edited into the documentary film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, Chebyshev&#x27;s sum inequality, named after Pafnuty Chebyshev, states that if
:formula_1 and formula_2
then
:formula_3

Similarly, if
:formula_4 and formula_2
then
:formula_6

==Proof==
Consider the sum

:formula_7

The two sequences are non-increasing, therefore and have the same sign for any . Hence .

Opening the brackets, we deduce:

:formula_8

hence

:formula_9

An alternative proof is simply obtained with the rearrangement inequality, writing that
:formula_10

==Continuous version==
There is also a continuous version of Chebyshev&#x27;s sum inequality:

If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are real-valued, integrable functions over [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], both non-increasing or both non-decreasing, then

:formula_11

with the inequality reversed if one is non-increasing and the other is non-decreasing.

<text>Maria Viktoria Mena (born 19 February 1986) is a Norwegian pop singer, best known for her singles such as &quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot;, &quot;Just Hold Me&quot;, &quot;All This Time&quot; which charted in multiple countries.

== Early life ==
Maria Viktoria Mena was born to a Norwegian mother and Charles Mena, a Nicaraguan-American drummer of Afro-Nicaraguan descent. There was a common misconception that her mother is a playwright, but Mena debunked this in an interview. Both Maria and her brother, Tony, are named after characters from Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Her father was born in Bluefields, Nicaragua where he lived until he was 10, at which point he and his mother, Mena&#x27;s paternal grandmother, moved to New York. After moving to Norway in 1986, he played in several bands in Oslo, which influenced Mena to write and record her own music. When Mena was nine years old, her parents divorced. As a teenager, she began to battle depression and various eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as spoken of in her lyrics, interviews, concerts, and social media. Mena has spoken of battling depression and PTSD as an adult, and seeking help.

Mena cared for her younger brother Tony for many years.
When Mena was 13 years old, she moved to live with her father. She sang and wrote lyrics as a form of self-soothing. &quot;My Lullaby&quot;, a song from Mena&#x27;s diary, expresses her pain from her parents&#x27; divorce. Mena&#x27;s father contacted acquaintances in the music industry to record a demo. Presenting his daughter&#x27;s demo to several record companies, Sony Music signed Mena to their label aged 16.

== Career ==
=== 2002–2007: Early beginnings ===
In 2002, she released her debut single &quot;Fragile (Free)&quot; in Norway; however, it did not chart there. &quot;My Lullaby&quot; was released as the second single and the song reached number 5 on the Norwegian Singles Chart. It received heavy rotation on NRK P1, P3, P4, Radio 1, and Radio Oslo. The young singer quickly gained fans and soon earned her first platinum record. After the success of &quot;My Lullaby&quot;, she released her debut album &quot;Another Phase&quot; in Norway which reached number 6 on the Norwegian Albums Chart.
Mena made an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote her first international album, &quot;White Turns Blue&quot;, which debuted at the top position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart a week later and at number 102 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She made a breakthrough into the worldwide singles charts that year with &quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot;, a single successful in multiple countries. The song was her only single to appear on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, making No. 25 on the U.S. Top 40 Mainstream. &quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot; peaked at No. 30 on the Dutch Top 40 and No. 19 on the Dutch Mega Single Top 100. Two months earlier, in March 2004, Mena had released her second album in Norway. &quot;Mellow&quot;. Less successful than her 2002 debut, it still managed to peak at No. 7 in Norway. The second single from both albums was &quot;Just a Little Bit&quot;, which did not chart anywhere.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Apparently Unaffected&quot; in Norway and several other European countries, fronted by singles &quot;Miss You Love&quot; and &quot;Just Hold Me&quot;. A significant success in Norway, the album has earned her three Spellemann nominations: Best Female Artist, Best Hit, and Best Music Video. In the Netherlands, the album was released in June 2006 and charted at No. 82. It slowly climbed the chart to reach its peak position in its 27th week at No. 11, as &quot;Just Hold Me&quot; was getting airplay again. &quot;Just Hold Me&quot; was released in May 2006, but then did not chart in the official Dutch Top 40, but did chart in the country&#x27;s physical singles chart, the Mega Single Top 100, at No. 27. In October 2006, the song started getting heavy airplay again and this time it reached the official Dutch Top 40 and peaked at No. 26. In the Mega Single Top 100, it peaked at No. 7 in the beginning of November 2006. Mena performed at sold-out concerts in Utrecht and Amsterdam, following the success of &quot;Just Hold Me&quot;. The album was at No. 48 at the Dutch year-end chart, outselling major artists such as Pink&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot;, Nelly Furtado&#x27;s &quot;Loose&quot;, and Beyoncé Knowles&#x27; &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;. &quot;Miss You Love&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in the Netherlands and reached No. 61 on the Mega Singles Top 100.
On 7 July 2007, she performed at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg.

=== 2008–2014: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;, &quot;Viktoria&quot;, and &quot;Weapon in Mind&quot; ===
Having worked on her three first studio albums with Norwegian producer Arvid Solvang, Mena started collaborating with Martin Sjølie in early 2008 on what would become her fourth studio album, &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;.
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Belly Up&quot; had its radio premiere mid-June 2008 on Norwegian radio. &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; was released on 17 September in Norway. The first international single was &quot;All This Time&quot;. The album was internationally released on 26 September 2008. This album garnered her a Spellemann for Best Female Artist.

Mena&#x27;s song &quot;Sorry&quot; was featured on the third season of US &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Another Day&quot; was featured during the fourth season. She released &quot;All This Time&quot; in the UK on 11 April 2010.

In 2011 Mena recorded her version of &quot;Mitt lille land&quot; (My Little Country) by Ole Paus as part of a project by the Norwegian TV channel TV2. On 23 July, the day after the Norway terrorist attacks and after requests from her Norwegian audience, Mena uploaded her version of the song to the streaming site SoundCloud. It quickly became an anthem in memory of the victims of the attacks. She contributed to the album &quot;Mitt lille land&quot;, performing one of two versions of the title track (the other was performed by Ole Paus). As of 2011 Mena had sold a total of 700,000 copies of her albums, and half of those copies had been sold in Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://dagbladet.no&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Her fifth studio album &quot;Viktoria&quot; was released on 23 September 2011 and was produced by Martin Sjølie.

Her sixth album &quot;Weapon in Mind&quot; was released in 2013, becoming her first album to reach number one in Norway. Even though all three singles of the album failed to chart inside top 20 Norway Singles Chart, &quot;Fuck You&quot; and &quot;I Always Liked That&quot; became two of her best selling singles in Norway, both certified 2× Platinum.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://ifpi.no/component/rstrophybridge/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015–present: &quot;Growing Pains&quot; and &quot;They Never Leave Their Wives&quot; ===
Mena released the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna See You with Her&quot; on 6 November 2015. Her seventh studio album &quot;Growing Pains&quot; was released on 4 December 2015.

In March 2020, Mena announced a new album (sometimes recognized as an EP), &quot;They Never Leave Their Wives&quot;. The album was released on 23 October 2020. Mena released three singles from the album, &quot;Not OK&quot;, &quot;Lies (They Never Leave Their Wives)&quot;, and &quot;You Live and You Learn&quot;.

In October 2020, Mena announced that she will release a new album in March 2021. In April 2021 Mena made a new announcement, saying she will postpone the release of her new material until she can play concerts again. The concert venues in Norway have been closed for longer periods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
She described the upcoming album as a sequel to &quot;They Never Leave Their Wives&quot;, containing songs about a woman who is on her own and then finds love.

In August 2022, Mena was cast in the second season of the Viaplay series &quot;Furia&quot;. Mena also auditioned for a role in the Norwegian TV series &quot;Etterglød&quot; (&quot;Afterglow&quot;), where she was not cast but offered to make a song for the soundtrack. That song is &quot;It Was Love&quot;, which was released on 23 September 2022.

<text>Fernand Auberjonois (25 September 1910 – 27 August 2004) was a Swiss-American journalist who worked as the foreign correspondent of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot;. Throughout most of the Cold War, Auberjonois was one of the most admired American reporters based in London. From 1956 until his formal retirement in 1983 and after, he covered many of the world&#x27;s biggest news stories. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. and served on secret assignments, including setting up radio transmissions for the Allies to divert the German&#x27;s attention from the real invasion site on D-Day. From World War II through the Cold War, he worked for many print organizations, and also for NBC and Voice of America.
Auberjonois was born in Valeyres-sous-Montagny, near Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, the son of Augusta Grenier and René Auberjonois (1872–1957), one of Switzerland&#x27;s best-known post-Impressionist painters. He married into European (Napoleonic) royalty, his first wife being Princess Laure Louise Napoléone Eugénie Caroline Murat (13 November 1913 – 10 May 1986), a descendant of Napoleon&#x27;s sister Caroline and her husband Joachim Murat, who was King of Naples and King of Sicily. They married in November 1939 and had a son, actor René Auberjonois, born in 1940.

In his 1980s, he lived in Enniskeane, County Cork, Ireland, where he owned a cottage. He died on 27 August 2004, at the age of 93, of a heart attack in County Cork.

<text>Side Out is a 1990 American comedy-drama sports film about a beach volleyball competition, featuring C. Thomas Howell, Peter Horton, Harley Jane Kozak and Courtney Thorne-Smith. It was the last film from Aurora Productions due to many flops. The film was directed by Peter Israelson.

Many professional beach volleyball players appeared in the movie, such as 5-time world champion Randy Stoklos (who had the main speaking role of all the players as Rollo Vincent); Sinjin Smith (as Stoklos&#x27; playing partner/character Billy Cross) who won 5 world championships with Stoklos and was the 1st player to reach 100 wins; Olympic gold medalist Kent Steffes; Steve Timmons, who won 2 Olympic gold medals in indoor volleyball; Mike Dodd, 5-time Manhattan Beach Open champion, 75 pro wins and an Olympic silver medal; Tim Hovland, 3-time All-American at USC and won $1 million in pro prize money; also Steve Obradovich (who also had a generous speaking part), Craig Moothart, Brent Frohoff, Ricci Luyties, Roger Clark, Pono Ma&#x27;a, Wally Goodrich, and Rudy Dvorak.

The term “side-out” used to refer to an obsolete scoring rule in volleyball called &quot;side-out scoring&quot; under which the winning point could only be scored by the serving team. A side-out is now simply defined as when the receiving team earns the right to serve by winning a point. Rally scoring became the dominant scoring method as of 1999, which gives a point to whichever team wins a rally, whether serving or not. This method allowed for a more predictable match length and increased fan interest and shorter games.

==Plot==
Monroe Clark moves to California to pursue a law career. At the airport, he meets Wiley Hunter, who offers him a ride to the home of Monroe&#x27;s uncle Max, who assigns Monroe the job of handing homeowners a &quot;pay or quit&quot; notice to either to vacate the premises or pay past rent due and to be back by 6 o&#x27;clock.

Monroe handles some of the evictions until, attempting to serve Zack Barnes with his eviction notice, he meets a British flight attendant who Zack has just had a sexual fling with. Monroe is then led to Zack&#x27;s gambling bookmaker, who throws Monroe&#x27;s suitcase into the ocean. Monroe then meets Samantha, who recovered his suitcase from the ocean. He also runs into Wiley, who shows Monroe the joys of living a carefree lifestyle and the popularity of beach volleyball.

Wiley asks a volleyball team of Moothart and O&#x27;Bradovich to challenge the duo to a quick game. Monroe forgets his deadline for the evictions. Uncle Max sees through Monroe&#x27;s lie and tells Monroe he would pardon his mistake if he successfully evicts Zack Barnes out of his home. In a bar, Monroe reunites with Samantha and (with the help of Wiley) finds Zack and tries to hand him the eviction notice, but Zack&#x27;s former volleyball partner Rollo Vincent teases Zack and a bar fight ensues.

Samantha, watching the fight, is invited by Monroe to a date at a &quot;friend&#x27;s&quot; house (without telling Samantha that it is actually his uncle&#x27;s). The two share a romantic date until Max reveals he is Monroe&#x27;s uncle and angers Samantha because Monroe lied to her. Monroe and Wiley hang out at the beaches and try to get better at volleyball by practicing routines and exercising while Monroe tries to apologize to Samantha, who is avoiding him.

Wiley tells Monroe that he entered them in a volleyball tournament, where they lose in the first round. Zack, a spectator, offers to coach the two to teach techniques Zack used when he was the &quot;king of the beach&quot; (the title now belongs to Rollo). Each day until the Gold Cuervo Classic, the team trains. Zack fails to show up (because he was having sex with his ex-wife Kate Jacobs). The duo challenge Rollo and his partner Billy Cross to a quick match. During the match Monroe and Wiley fail to use teamwork in the game and results in Wiley having a broken arm. Monroe becomes angered at Zack for not being there for coaching and vows to evict Zack in court (after attempting to dump his records).

In court, Monroe at first testifies against Zack and pleading judgment for his side, but then supports Zack after Monroe decided to pursue his own dreams rather than law school. In doing so Max&#x27;s boss threatens him with negligence and kicks Monroe out for defending Zack. After Monroe leaves Max&#x27;s house, Zack offers him a place while training him for the Gold Cuervo Classic volleyball tournament. While doing so, Monroe apologizes to Wiley for his selfishness and they reconcile as well as Samantha for lying to her.

Monroe asks why Zack lost his title to Rollo and Zack explains that in the days when they were a team, the duo reached the championship. Zack&#x27;s agents told him to lose to earn more money but Zack feared his involvement and when the championship arrived, he never came. Each day they trained until the big day finally came for the Gold Cuervo Classic tournament. Monroe and Zack are first up against Moothart and Obradovich, and they near their loss until Zack tells Monroe to use a technique Zack taught Monroe to win the first round. They beat the team and the duo advance to the championship after multiple victories.

Before the championship Zack gets into an argument with Kate telling him to lose to Rollo. As Monroe watches he fears Zack will make the same mistake he made with Rollo many years ago. As they announce the names of the contestants Zack fails to show up and Monroe is scared Zack abandoned him. In a few minutes Zack appears and the game begins but Monroe and Zack lose many points because of Zack not focusing and the team argue. Monroe then gets Zack back in the game and they win the championship thus making Zack and Monroe rich and Rollo and Billy lose. The film ends with a freeze-frame of Monroe and Zack in their victory pose.

<doc id="937704" wikidata="Q1807219" url="?curid=937704" title="Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon">
<text>Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor, released in April 1971 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was recorded between early January and late February of the same year.

== Release and promotion ==
Released in April 1971, the album contains Taylor&#x27;s biggest hit single in the US, a cover version of the Carole King standard &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, which hit #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on July 31, 1971, his only song to do so. The week before, the album itself reached its peak position of #2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. It was held off the top spot by King, then ruling the charts with the blockbuster &quot;Tapestry&quot; album, which contained her version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. The song earned Grammy Awards both for Taylor (Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male) and King (Song of the Year). &quot;Mud Slide Slim&quot; managed to generate another Top 40 hit, &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot;, which reached #31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other songs became standards in concert, particularly &quot;You Can Close Your Eyes&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1971, Ben Gerson found the album to be a &quot;dull listening&quot; the first few times: &quot;Once the melodies begin to sink in, and the LP&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; is discovered, the album&#x27;s subtle tensions begin to appear. And while the album at this point makes for pleasant, absorbing listening, there is a terrible weariness to it which is part of its artistic statement.&quot;

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was more critical of Taylor&#x27;s songwriting. &quot;Having squandered most of the songs on his big success, he&#x27;s concentrating on the intricate music&quot;, Christgau wrote, finding the lyrics &quot;more onanistic than ever, escapist as a matter of conscious thematic decision. From what? you well may wonder. From success, poor fella. Blues singers lived on the road out of economic necessity, although they often got into it; Taylor is an addict, pure and simple. A born-rich nouveau star who veers between a &#x27;homestead on the farm&#x27; (what does he raise there, hopes?) and the Holiday Inn his mean old existential dilemma compels him to call home deserves the conniving, self-pitying voice that is his curse. Interesting, intricate, unlistenable.&quot;

In 2000 it was voted number 858 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<doc id="937710" wikidata="Q529045" url="?curid=937710" title="Prince Nicholas of Romania">
<text>Prince Nicholas of Romania (; 5 August 1903 – 9 June 1978), later known as Prince Nicholas of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was the fourth child and second son of King Ferdinand I of Romania and his wife Queen Marie.

In 1927 after the death of his father, Nicholas was appointed as one of the three regents for his minor nephew King Michael I. His position as regent ended in 1930 with the return of his older brother Prince Carol to Romania to take over as King of Romania.

In later 1930, he was stripped of his titles and privileges and exiled from the Royal Court, due to King Carol II&#x27;s disapproval of his marriage. On 10 July 1942, after the removal of King Carol II from the throne, during King Michael&#x27;s second reign, Nicholas was given by the king the title of &quot;Nicholas of Hohenzollern&quot; — of the house to which he belonged.

He died in exile on 9 July 1978 in Madrid, Spain.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born on 5 August 1903 in Peleș Castle, Sinaia as the second son of Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania and his wife Princess Marie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Edinburgh. His siblings were Carol II of Romania, Elisabeth of Romania, Queen Maria of Yugoslavia, Princess Ileana of Romania and Prince Mircea of Romania. Nicholas was named after his mother’s first cousin, Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia.

In her memoirs, his mother wrote: &quot;He was exceedingly independent, and always funny. He never could be still for a second ; he was for ever “up and doing.” Although far from good or obedient, he had a way of getting people to do what he wanted. Wherever Nicky went, he went to rule and order about, not because he was imperious and aggressive, but because he was funny. His funniness was of the good-humoured, irresistible kind which amuses even the dullest. Even as a tiny tot, his repartees were so comic that, instead of receiving the scolding he deserved he roused instead fun and laughter. Comically sly, he always had his own way, breaking down every defence or restriction.&quot; He had a long nose, piercing blue eyes and silvery hair. His mother recalled him often tugging his sister Mignon&#x27;s hair. 
== Biography ==

Nicholas was the younger brother of Carol, heir apparent, who renounced his rights of succession on 12 December 1925. When Ferdinand died in 1927, he was succeeded as King by Carol&#x27;s five-year-old son, Michael; Nicholas himself had been proposed as heir-apparent when Carol married the commoner Zizi Lambrino in 1918 (a marriage later annulled). Given Michael&#x27;s youth, a regency council had to be formed (20 July), and Prince Nicholas was forced to abandon his career in the British Royal Navy—in which he held the honorary rank of sub-lieutenant—in order to return home to serve on the council, alongside Gheorghe Buzdugan and Patriarch Miron Cristea.

Although unofficially referred to as &quot;the first-ranking regent&quot;, Nicholas resented having to abandon his naval career and had no interest in politics. He tried to continue his father&#x27;s cooperation with the National Liberals (PNL), and to contain the opposition of the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNŢ) to the regency by appointing a national government under Ion I. C. Brătianu. Refused by Brătianu, he witnessed a change in Carol&#x27;s stance in mid-1927, when the latter argued that he had been forced to give up his throne. The cooperation between Carol and the PNŢ was successfully neutralized by the PNL, but Brătianu&#x27;s death in 1927 restored contacts and increased the appeal of the PNŢ. By then, the regency was widely perceived as consisting of figureheads, and, after Constantin Sărăţeanu (an appointee of PNŢ leader Iuliu Maniu) succeeded the deceased Buzdugan in 1929, it was believed to be torn apart by contrasting political ambitions. According to Nicolae Iorga, Miron Cristea himself had said:
&quot;The Regency does not work because it has no head. The Prince smokes his cigarettes, Sărăţeanu looks through his books, and I, as a priest, can only try to reconcile.&quot;

Nicholas was at first delighted when Carol returned home to Romania on 8 June 1930 (becoming &quot;King Carol II&quot; and thus putting an end to the regency arrangement). He welcomed the Parliament session that voted to repeal the 1926 legislation, and accompanied his newly arrived brother from Băneasa Airfield to Cotroceni Palace.

However, the cordial relations between Nicholas and Carol were short-lived. Nicholas wanted to marry Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti, a divorced woman belonging to a Tohani landowning family, but was aware it might prove embarrassing for the king to authorize such a marriage. Carol himself suggested that the couple should marry without first seeking his consent (even though members of the royal family were required to obtain the king&#x27;s consent before marrying). Carol had intimated that under these circumstances he would accept the marriage as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, but after the wedding Carol promptly used it as an excuse to deprive Nicholas of his royal privileges and titles and to exile him from Romania. He left for Spain, and ultimately settled in Switzerland.

Nicholas was married twice. His first marriage took place in Tohani, Romania, on 7 November 1931, the bride being Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti (24 September 1910 in Bucharest – 19 February 1963 in Lausanne). Dumitrescu-Doletti&#x27;s first husband had been Romanian politician Radu Săveanu (son of Nicolae Săveanu), whom she married on 11 December 1924. Nicholas&#x27; second marriage took place on 13 July 1967 in Lausanne to Brazilian Maria Thereza Lisboa Figueira de Mello (10 June 1913 in Rome – 30 March 1997 in Madrid), daughter of Col. Jerónimo de Ávila Figueira de Melo and his wife, Cândida Ribeiro Lisboa, and the sister of Francisco Lisboa Figueira de Melo, former ambassador of Portugal to Germany (born 12 March 1912 in Vienna). Figueira de Mello&#x27;s first husband was Venezuelian heir Andrés Boulton Pietri (1910 in Caracas – 1998), whom she married in Caracas on 2 July 1936, a union that produced four children: Roger (born 1937), Maria Thereza (born 1939), Andres (born 1943) and William (born 1945).

The Prince also took an interest in motor racing, competing in the 1933 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1935 24 Hours of Le Mans driving his own Duesenberg Model SJ.

<doc id="937711" wikidata="Q943316" url="?curid=937711" title="Puttin' On the Ritz">
<text>&quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; is a song written by Irving Berlin. He wrote it in May 1927 and first published it on December 2, 1929. It was registered as an unpublished song on August 24, 1927 and again on July 27, 1928. It was introduced by Harry Richman and chorus in the musical film &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; (1930). According to &quot;The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin&quot;, this was the first song in film to be sung by an interracial ensemble. The title derives from the slang expression &quot;to put on the Ritz&quot;, meaning to dress very fashionably. This expression was inspired by the opulent Ritz Hotel in London.

Hit phonograph records of the tune in its original period of popularity of 1929–1930 were recorded by Harry Richman and by Fred Astaire, with whom the song is particularly associated. Every other record label had their own version of this popular song (Columbia, Brunswick, Victor, and all of the dime store labels). Richman&#x27;s Brunswick version of the song became the number-one selling record in America.

The song received renewed popularity in 1974 when it was performed by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle in the film &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. Their version of &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; was ranked 84th in the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2004 list, 100 Years...100 Songs. In 1982, Taco, a Dutch musician, recorded and released a modernized version of the song. Accompanied by a music video that aired on MTV and other music video networks, Taco&#x27;s cover became a Top 10 hit in the United States, Canada, and much of Europe. Kenny Yarbrough also recorded a cover of the song; this version was used as theme music for the short-lived 1991 sitcom &quot;Top of the Heap&quot;.

==Musical structure==
The song is in AABA form, with a verse. According to John Mueller, the central device in the A section is the &quot;use of delayed rhythmic resolution: a staggering, off-balance passage, emphasized by the unorthodox stresses in the lyric, suddenly resolves satisfyingly on a held note, followed by the forceful assertion of the title phrase.&quot; The marchlike B section, which is only barely syncopated, acts as a contrast to the previous rhythmic complexities. Alec Wilder, in his study of American popular song, stated that the song&#x27;s rhythmic pattern is &quot;the most complex and provocative I have ever come upon.&quot;

==Lyrics==
The original version of Berlin&#x27;s song included references to the then-popular fad of flashily dressed but poor black Harlemites parading up and down Lenox Avenue, &quot;Spending ev&#x27;ry dime / For a wonderful time&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the song was popularized through the BBC&#x27;s radio broadcasts of Joe Kaye&#x27;s Band performing it at The Ritz Hotel, London restaurant in the 1930s. 

===Original lyrics===
The song was featured with the original lyrics in the 1939 film &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;, where it was performed by Clark Gable and chorus, and this routine was selected for inclusion in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1974). Columbia released a 78 recording of Fred Astaire singing the original lyrics in May 1930 (B-side – &quot;Crazy Feet&quot;, both recorded on March 26, 1930). For the film &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1946), where it was performed by Fred Astaire, Berlin revised the lyrics to apply to affluent whites strutting &quot;up and down Park Avenue&quot;. This second version was published after being registered for copyright on August 28, 1946.

==Taco version==
In 1982, singer Taco released a synth-pop cover version of &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; as a single from his album &quot;After Eight&quot;, released in Europe on Polydor and by RCA in the US. The single was accompanied by a music video, the original version of which contains characters in blackface and has since been banned from many networks. An alternative version eliminates many shots of the blackface characters, though some remain.

The cover features interpolations of Berlin-penned songs &quot;Always,&quot; &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, as well as &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot; from the film &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, which was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.

The single was a global hit, reaching No. 1 on &quot;Cash Box&quot; as well as No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, making Irving Berlin, then 95, the oldest ever living songwriter to have one of his compositions enter the top ten. It was certified gold by the RIAA for selling over one million copies. It was Taco&#x27;s only hit in the United States. This version of the song was ranked No. 53 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s&quot; special.

The song topped the charts in Sweden and New Zealand, and entered the top 5 in numerous countries including Australia, Norway, Austria, and Canada.

<text>Sutton Courtenay is a village and civil parish in the Vale of White Horse district of Oxfordshire, England. It is situated on the south bank of the River Thames south of Abingdon-on-Thames and northwest of Didcot. The 2021 census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 3,055, a rise from 2,421 in 2011.

Historically part of Berkshire until 1974 boundary changes, Sutton Courtenay is home to some important structures, such as the Abbey, the Manor House, All Saints&#x27; Church, a twelfth-century Norman hall, the Sutton Bridge, and Didcot power station.

==Archaeology and history==
A Neolithic stone hand axe was found at Sutton Courtenay. Petrological analysis in 1940 identified the stone as epidotised tuff from Stake Pass in the Lake District, to the north. Stone axes from the same source have been found at Abingdon, Alvescot, Kencot and Minster Lovell. Excavations have revealed rough Saxon huts from the early stages of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, but their most important enduring monument in Sutton was the massive causeway and weirs that separate the millstream from Sutton Pools. The causeway was probably built by Saxon labour. In 2010 the Channel 4 &quot;Time Team&quot; programme excavated a field in the village and discovered what they then thought was a major Anglo-Saxon royal centre with perhaps the largest great hall ever discovered in Britain.

Written records of Sutton&#x27;s history began in 688 when King Ine of Wessex endowed the new monastery at Abingdon with the manor of Sutton. In 801 Sutton was made a royal vill, with the monastery at Abingdon retaining the church and priest&#x27;s house. It is believed that this was on the site of the Manor in Sutton Courtenay and where Alfred the Great was married in 868. The Domesday Book of 1086 shows that the manor of &quot;Sudtone&quot; (&quot;south&quot; of Abingdon) was owned half by William I and farmed mainly by tenants who owed him tribute. There were three mills, of river meadow (probably used for dairy farming) and extensive woodlands where pigs were kept.

Most historians believe that Matilda, the elder of the two legitimate children of Henry I of England, was born in Winchester; however John M. Fletcher argues for the possibility of the royal palace at Sutton (now Sutton Courtenay) in Berkshire; the queen had been delivered of a child that died, and it seems likely that she stayed for the birth of Matilda the following year. Sutton became known as Sutton Courtenay after the Courtenay family took residence at the Manor in the 1170s. Reginald Courtenay became the first Lord of Sutton after he had helped negotiate the path of the future king, Henry II, to the throne.

Sutton Courtenay was involved in the marriage of Maud Holland in the 1360s. Edward the Black Prince agreed with Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon that Maud would marry Devon&#x27;s grandson Hugh Courtenay. Devon promised to award Maud an annuity of 200 marks and the manors of Sutton Courtenay and Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire. In return Edward promised to pay Devon four lots of 1,000 marks at 6-monthly intervals. The arrangements received papal dispensation from Pope Urban V and the approval of the English king, the Black Prince&#x27;s father, Edward III. The wedding had taken place by February 1365, when the manors were granted to Maud.

==Industry and economy==
In the past agriculture, a local paper mill (employing 25 people in 1840) and domestic service were major sources of employment in the village. The Didcot power stations are in Sutton Courtenay parish. Didcot A power station closed and the de-commissioning process began on 22 March 2013. Also in the parish are several large quarries that have been used for gravel extraction and then used for landfill taking domestic refuse from London via a rail terminal. Now the main employers include local scientific establishments and Didcot Power Station. There are many commuters using Didcot railway station, London being 45 minutes away. At one time Amey plc had its head office in Sutton Courtenay. In 2003 Amey had been in financial trouble and was bought by Spain&#x27;s largest construction firm, Ferrovial Servicios. At the time it employed about 400 people at Sutton Courtenay.

==Recent events==
In August 1998 the Tudor Revival mansion Lady Place, former home of nutritionist Hugh Macdonald Sinclair, was destroyed by fire. On 30 January 2008 there was an explosion and fire at Sutton Courtenay Tyres and petrol station, which led to about 100 nearby houses being evacuated for fears that acetylene cylinders might explode. On 23 February 2016 a large section of the former boiler house at Didcot A power station collapsed while the building was being prepared for demolition. Four demolition workers were killed and five others were hospitalised.

==Buildings==
===Manor houses===
In the Norman era, the oldest surviving buildings of the village were built. The Norman Hall is one of the oldest buildings in the village, being built in about 1192 in the reign of Richard I. Across the road from the Norman Hall is The Abbey, actually the former rectory. Its 14th-century Great Hall has an arched oak roof. The Manor House was formerly known as Brunce&#x27;s Court when it was the home of the Brunce family, one of whom, Thomas Brunce, became Bishop of Norwich. It is a five-gabled, two-winged house which has had many additions over the centuries but originated as the great medieval royal hall, frequented by King Henry I and then taken over by the Courtenay family, who gave their name to the village. All Saints&#x27; parish church was also built at this time (see below), and is a fine example of local Norman and Medieval architecture.
===The Abbey===
The Abbey is a medieval courtyard house, across the road from the Norman Hall and the Manor House, which has been recognised by Historic England as a building of outstanding historic and architectural interest. It is considered to be a &#x27;textbook&#x27; example of the English medieval manor house, and is a Grade I-listed building. The Abbey has its origins in the 13th century as a rectory of Abingdon Abbey. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like Solomon of Rochester, Thomas Beckington and William Say, but it wasn&#x27;t until the 17th century that the current plan was completed. It was probably during the Victorian era that the house acquired the name &#x27;The Abbey&#x27;. From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle, who leased the estate among others to John Fettiplace.

After being inhabited by Evelyn St. Croix Fleming, the estate was bought by David Astor in 1958, who leased it to the Ockenden Venture which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop Colin Winter to house the Namibia International Peace Centre. In 1978, the Astor family sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a charity which use it as a spiritual retreat and conference centre.

===Prime Minister&#x27;s home===
In 1912 the then Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, chose The Wharf (which he built in 1913) and the adjoining Walton House for his country residence. Asquith and his large family spent weekends at The Wharf where his wife Margot held court over bridge and tennis. She converted the old barn directly on the river which served for accommodation for the overflow of her many weekend parties. A painting of the period by Sir John Lavery (now in the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin) shows Elizabeth Asquith and her young friends lounging in boats by the riverside. Asquith signed the declaration that took Britain into the First World War here. The house has a blue plaque in honour of Asquith. He and his family remained in the village after he resigned as Prime Minister. He is buried in All Saints&#x27; parish churchyard (see below).

===All Saints&#x27; parish church===
The earliest parts of All Saints&#x27; parish church include the 12th-century Norman west tower and responds of the chancel arch. The most easterly arch of the south arcade is pointed but has zig-zag ornament. On the tower door are crusader crosses inscribed by soldiers either hoping for or giving thanks for a safe return from the Crusades. The main south door has a brick south porch and parvise built with money left to the poor of the parish by Thomas Bekynton. Other fittings include a 17th-century wineglass pulpit, a carved mid-12th century font with fleur-de-lys pattern and three late 14th-century misericords. The church was nearly destroyed during the Civil War when munitions stored by the Parliamentarian vicar exploded in the church.
The churchyard is the burial place of Eric Arthur Blair (1903–50), better known by his pen name George Orwell. As a child he fished in a local stream. He requested to be buried in an English country churchyard of the nearest church to where he died. However, he died in London, and none of the local churches had any space in their graveyards. Thinking that he might have to be cremated against his wishes, his widow asked her friends whether they knew of a church that had space for him. David Astor was a friend of Orwell and was able to arrange his burial in Sutton Courtenay, a &quot;classic English country village&quot; as Orwell had specifically requested, as the Astor family owned the manor of Sutton Courtenay. With approval from the local vicar and encouragement from Malcolm Muggeridge, arrangements were made. The churchyard also contains the graves of David Astor, Horace Freeland Judson and H. H. Asquith, Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Asquith so much loved the simplicity of the village that he chose to be buried there rather than in Westminster Abbey.

<text>Speculum Vitae (&#x27;Mirror of Life&#x27;) is an anonymous Middle English poem, written in the third quarter of the fourteenth century. The poem consists of a commentary on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer primarily derived from a prose Old French work, the &quot;Somme le roi&quot; of Laurent d&#x27;Orléans, dated 1279.

==Date and authorship==

Ralph Hanna, the modern editor of &quot;Speculum Vitae&quot;, dates it to &quot;broadly the third quarter of the fourteenth century&quot;, on the basis that it contains a versification of material from Richard Rolle&#x27;s &quot;Form of Living&quot; (lines 5595–834) and so must postdate that work&#x27;s initial circulation in 1348 or 1349 at the earliest, and that the poem must pre-date its earliest surviving manuscript copy, that in British Library, MS Additional 33995, which was produced around 1375.

The poem&#x27;s original text says nothing about its author in its brief first-person passages (lines 19–34, 16077–84). The poem is attributed in three manuscripts to Richard Rolle, and in an interpolated passage in two other manuscripts to William of Nassyngton. Both attributions have been judged implausible by Hope Emily Allen and by Hanna.

==Language and verse-form==

&quot;Speculum Vitae&quot; was written in Northern Middle English, probably in a Yorkshire variety. This can be determined by studying the poem&#x27;s rhyme-words, which were more likely to remain stable in transmission, to see which sounds the poet regarded as equivalent.

The poem is written throughout in rhyming couplets. According to the work of Christine Robinson, the metre of the poem revolves around four stresses in each line, permitting both anacrusis and the presence of more than one unstressed syllable between stresses.

==Reception==

Some measure of the poem&#x27;s initial success can be grasped from the substantial number of forty-five surviving manuscript copies, in a geographically dispersed variety of scribal dialects, suggesting widespread circulation. More manuscripts, no longer extant, are recorded in many wills from the period, further indicating the poem&#x27;s popularity.

William Langland borrowed some phrasings from &quot;Speculum Vitae&quot; in his long alliterative verse poem &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, and it has been suggested that &quot;Speculum Vitae&quot; might also have influenced some of Langland&#x27;s structural choices.

<text>William of Nassyngton (died 1354) was an English clerical administrator and translator from Nassington in Northamptonshire.

==Poet==
William of Nassyngton is the author of the Middle English poem &quot;Speculum Vitae&quot; (The Mirror of Life), which was written in the middle to late 14th century.

The poem consists of a commentary on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, 16,000 lines long. It covers analysis of the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the divine and cardinal virtues, the gifts of the Holy Ghost, the seven deadly sins, the Beatitudes, and the heavenly rewards. It derives in part from a French work in prose: &quot;Somme le roi&quot;, dated 1279.

==Life==
William of Nassyngton came from a family of ecclesiastical administrators from Nassington, Northamptonshire. He was a master of law by 1327 or 1328. He held several church appointments in the Diocese of Exeter in the 1330s, under Bishop John Grandisson, and later in the Diocese of York in the 1340s, under Archbishop William Zouche. He died in 1354, probably of plague.

<text>Les Chiens (The Dogs) is a Canadian indie rock band from Quebec. The lead singer and guitarist is Éric Goulet. The bass player is Nicolas Jouannaut. Olivier Rénaldin and Marc Chartrain have both played drums with the group..

==History==
Goulet, Jouannaut and Rénaldin came together in 1997 to form Les Chiens. The band&#x27;s album, &quot;Nuit Dérobée&quot;, was released in late 2000, to positive reviews.

Les Chiens was signed briefly to the labels La Tribu and C4, but most of their recordings were released independently.

In 2008, Les Chiens released an album, &quot;Le Long Sentier&quot;, on AudioGram. By this time Marc Chartrain was contributing the percussion.

In February, 2015, after a long hiatus, Les Chiens released a five-song EP, &quot;Les Chiens&quot;. In 2016, the group continues to perform and record.

<doc id="937739" wikidata="Q1156744" url="?curid=937739" title="Time evolution">
<text>Time evolution is the change of state brought about by the passage of time, applicable to systems with internal state (also called &quot;stateful systems&quot;). In this formulation, &quot;time&quot; is not required to be a continuous parameter, but may be discrete or even . In classical physics, time evolution of a collection of rigid bodies is governed by the principles of classical mechanics. In their most rudimentary form, these principles express the relationship between forces acting on the bodies and their acceleration given by Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. These principles can be equivalently expressed more abstractly by Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian mechanics.

The concept of time evolution may be applicable to other stateful systems as well. For instance, the operation of a Turing machine can be regarded as the time evolution of the machine&#x27;s control state together with the state of the tape (or possibly multiple tapes) including the position of the machine&#x27;s read-write head (or heads). In this case, time is considered to be discrete steps.

Stateful systems often have dual descriptions in terms of states or in terms of observable values. In such systems, time evolution can also refer to the change in observable values. This is particularly relevant in quantum mechanics where the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture are (mostly) equivalent descriptions of time evolution.

== Time evolution operators ==
Consider a system with state space &quot;X&quot; for which evolution is deterministic and reversible. For concreteness let us also suppose time is a parameter that ranges over the set of real numbers R. Then time evolution is given by a family of bijective state transformations

:formula_1.

F&quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the state of the system at time &quot;t&quot;, whose state at time &quot;s&quot; is &quot;x&quot;. The following identity holds

:formula_2

To see why this is true, suppose &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; is the state at time &quot;s&quot;. Then by the definition of F, F&quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the state of the system at time &quot;t&quot; and consequently applying the definition once more, F&quot;u&quot;, &quot;t&quot;(F&quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is the state at time &quot;u&quot;. But this is also F&quot;u&quot;, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

In some contexts in mathematical physics, the mappings F&quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot; are called &quot;propagation operators&quot; or simply propagators. In classical mechanics, the propagators are functions that operate on the phase space of a physical system. In quantum mechanics, the propagators are usually unitary operators on a Hilbert space. The propagators can be expressed as time-ordered exponentials of the integrated Hamiltonian. The asymptotic properties of time evolution are given by the scattering matrix.

A state space with a distinguished propagator is also called a dynamical system.

To say time evolution is homogeneous means that

:formula_3 for all formula_4.

In the case of a homogeneous system, the mappings G&quot;t&quot; = F&quot;t&quot;,0 form a one-parameter group of transformations of &quot;X&quot;, that is

:formula_5

For non-reversible systems, the propagation operators F&quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot; are defined whenever &quot;t&quot; ≥ &quot;s&quot; and satisfy the propagation identity

:formula_6 for any formula_7.

In the homogeneous case the propagators are exponentials of the Hamiltonian.

=== In quantum mechanics ===

In the Schrödinger picture, the Hamiltonian operator generates the time evolution of quantum states. If formula_8 is the state of the system at time formula_9, then

:formula_10

This is the Schrödinger equation. Given the state at some initial time (formula_11), if formula_12 is independent of time, then the unitary time evolution operator formula_13 is the exponential operator as shown in the equation

:formula_14

<text>The Northern Homily Cycle is a Middle English poem written c. 1315. The poem consists of approximately 20,000 rhyming, octosyllabic lines. It features a Middle English retelling of the Gospel in verse form, alongside stories to illustrate the points of the verses and messages. Many of these illustrative stories use familiar, agricultural examples, calling to mind Chaucer&#x27;s tales.

The work is anonymous, however the text suggests that the author &quot;wrote in his native dialect and was well versed in the lore of the north country.&quot;

A good copy of it can be found in Oxford Bodleian Eng. Poet. a.1, a 14th-century manuscript.

A Cambridge manuscript of the poem has been edited by Saara Nevanlinna.

Players may also interact with each other through player versus player competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, organize their characters into clans, work together to complete clan dungeons, and speak to each other in many different chat channels.

The game is also particularly notable for managing to be financially successful purely from donations and the purchase of merchandise rather than from advertising or subscription fees, which are used by many online games. In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players. These players form an active community which frequently organizes fan meet-ups and runs an internet radio station. The game has been generally well received by critics. In 2012, &quot;Mr. Card Game&quot;, a tabletop game based on &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;, was launched on Kickstarter.
On 10 August 2017, Asymmetric launched &quot;West of Loathing&quot;, a &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; spin-off single-player role-playing video game for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

==Gameplay and features==

Gameplay involves fighting monsters, completing quests, gaining skills and stats, and accumulating items and meat.

In &quot;KoL&quot;&#x27;s turn-based gameplay, a player&#x27;s character is supplied with a number of adventures each day, at a base of 40, although this can be increased. The game day resets at a time called &quot;rollover&quot;. Characters are allotted forty adventures every rollover, though they can increase that number with various equipment and items. Additional adventures can be acquired by consuming food and booze. However, only a limited amount of each can be consumed each day, and drinking too much booze puts the character into a drunken stupor for the remainder of the day. During rollover, drunkenness and fullness levels are reset, and minor amounts of health points and magic points are restored. Although a character can accumulate a large number of adventures, the number is reduced to 200 at rollover.

Most actions in the game use up adventures, including crafting items and exploring the game world (adventuring). When exploring, players experience combat encounters, in which they fight monsters, as well as non-combat encounters. Combat is turn-based, meaning that the player and the monster take turns attacking one another using weapons, skills and items. Players who successfully defeat a monster receive experience points, pieces of meat (the game&#x27;s currency), and various items. Non-combat encounters simply present the reader with a text description of an event, occasionally allowing the player to choose how to respond to that event.

After gaining enough experience points, players will gain levels, allowing them to access new areas and quests. Characters can combine items by using &quot;meat paste&quot; (a substance analogous to glue), and can also cook food, mix cocktails and smith weapons and armor. Characters may also earn trophies or tattoos for various in-game achievements. Puzzle-solving is an important part of the game, with the solutions often involving a certain item combination or the completion of tasks in different zones.

===Player interaction===
While &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;″s player versus environment content is largely single-player, some features allow multiplayer interaction.

Player versus player (PvP) combat is voluntary, features a randomized selection of non-interactive minigames, and is subdivided into seasons. The winner of the PvP battle can take fame or items from the loser.

The game features an integrated chat system which is available only after completing a basic test of English grammar and spelling. There are many chat channels, including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku. Most of the chat channels are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; forums are another active venue for discussion among players.

Upon reaching level 3, characters may join a clan, a band of cooperating characters. A clan has a clan hall which can be furnished with beneficial equipment as well as a clan stash for sharing useful items. Clan members can chat with each other in a private chat channel. In 2008, a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of hobos. Eurogamer likened Hobopolis to World of Warcraft instances. Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.

Players can buy a store in The Mall of Loathing and sell their character&#x27;s items to other players. Direct trading between two players is also possible, and in the trade chat channel users can auction items and advertise shops. This functionality has created a complex in-game economy which author Ted Friedman, in his book &quot;Electric Dreams: Computers in American Culture&quot;, described as &quot;vibrant&quot;. The &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; economy was the subject of an academic study, &quot;Economics in the Kingdom of Loathing: Analysis of Virtual Market Data&quot; in 2011.

===Character classes===
Players choose from six classes when they create a character. Each class has various items that characters obtain by completing class-specific quests. Characters also receive non-tradable class-dependent items as a reward for completing harder ascensions. The classes can be split into groups based on the primary character attribute associated with them.

*Muscle classes: The two muscle classes are Seal Clubber and Turtle Tamer. Muscle classes depend on strength and fighting ability. A character&#x27;s Max HP is determined by his/her muscle, and Muscle classes gain an innate +50% boost to their Max HP.
*Mysticality classes: The mysticality classes are Pastamancer and Sauceror. Gameplay for mysticality classes is focused on spellcasting and the use of magic. A character&#x27;s Max MP is determined by his/her Mysticality, and Mysticality classes gain an innate +50% to their Max MP.
*Moxie classes: The moxie classes, Disco Bandit and Accordion Thief, use charm and dexterity to achieve success.

===Familiars===
Familiars are creatures that can accompany players in combat, performing (usually) helpful actions. Familiars are often instrumental in the completion of quests. Familiars possess many abilities; for example, a Sabre-Toothed Lime attacks monsters, a Leprechaun grants extra meat after combat, and a Hovering Sombrero increases stat gains from combat. Some familiars, such as the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot, are very difficult to acquire.

===Ascension===
Ascension is a feature that allows characters to start the game over and play through it again from the beginning, similar to a New Game Plus feature. This feature becomes available after the game&#x27;s final quest is completed. Ascending will allow the player to receive Karma for their actions, which can be used to purchase special items before choosing a new path/lifestyle. Players who embark on a new path have their character&#x27;s experience levels reset to one, but they retain their currency and items. Ascending players can also choose to make their ascension more difficult by taking on various restrictions, such as not being able to eat or drink, in exchange for special rewards. There are special paths which could have the player play as a special class or have a unique gimmick (such as every zone is on fire, damaging you). In addition, the game features a leaderboard system which allows players to see one another&#x27;s ascension speeds and compete for the fastest ascensions.

==Plot==

=== Setting ===
&quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; takes place in Asymmetric Publication&#x27;s &quot;Loathing&quot; universe; however, the specific time is unknown. It was inspired by Asymmetric Publication&#x27;s earlier game &quot;Krakrox the Barbarian&quot; and even included into the game&#x27;s lore as the forefather of adventurers and banisher of the monsters of the dark continent that would later become the Kingdom of Loathing. The game is humorous in nature, and most quests, battles and individual item descriptions include jokes, witticisms, or references to popular culture. Many quests parody the tropes found in other role-playing games. The player takes on the role of an adventurer who is tasked with solving problems and killing monsters in this fantasy-based kingdom.

=== Story ===
Thanks to the three mighty architectural elders before the days of Yore (which includes Boris the Warrior, Jarlsberg the Wizard, and Sneaky Pete the Cool Guy), the Kingdom of Loathing used to be a peaceful place to loath one another under the Kingdom&#x27;s ruler, King Ralph XI. 

However, one day, the Naughty Sorceress arrived and &quot;imprismed&quot; (imprisoned in a prism) King Ralph XI. Afterwards, the monsters that hid away reemerged, and under the control of the Naughty Sorceress, caused chaos in the kingdom. 

In King Ralph&#x27;s absence, most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing, but not much has been able to get done, so adventurers (such as the player) were called into action. There are two storylines that the player is encouraged to participate. These storylines are &quot;Me and My Nemesis&quot;, and &quot;Naughty Sorceress Quest&quot; (main campaign). Players can also unlock quests from other sources, some of which are available only after ascending.

In &quot;Me and My Nemesis&quot;, when the player first arrives to the kingdom and finishes the tutorial, they are advised to join their class&#x27;s Guild Hall. 

Once the player nearly reaches level 4, they will be informed that their guild&#x27;s mystical artifact has been stolen by their nemesis, a person that opposes the player&#x27;s class and has been assigned to the player, as nobody else wanted to deal with them. The player will be sent to retrieve the power-drained legendary artifact from the Misspelled Cemetary and its power source from the Clownloard Beelzebozo. 

Later, after increasing experience, the character will be informed of their nemesis&#x27;s location in The Dark and Sinister Cave, only for them to escape before defeat. After dealing with increasingly tough assassins sent by the character&#x27;s nemesis, the player will eventually be able to reach their nemesis&#x27;s Secret Tropical Island Volcano Lair. 

Once they find the way to enter, deal with their body guards, and defeat their nemesis a second time, the nemesis will retreat to the volcano to absorb the power from the player&#x27;s class statue. After defeating their nemesis a third time, the nemesis will pray to a demonic entity that will transform them into their ultimate form, but also power up your legendary weapon. 

After defeating them for the fourth and final time, the nemesis will destroy the statue, burying themself as well as their lair, but no mystical artifact to be found. Upon returning to the player&#x27;s class Guild Hall, they will be told that the artifact was never taken, but was sent out to be cleaned by the new guy Larry.

Prior to the &quot;Naughty Sorceress Quest&quot;, the Council of Loathing will gives quests to the character as they increase in level, from finding a mosquito larvae to starting (and finishing) a war between the Hippies and the Frat Boys, all in hopes to either fixing issues around the kingdom, finding possible ways to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, or for profitable gain. The final quest is given when the character has reached level 13 and finished the other quests. 

By then, the Council will declare the character ready to take on the Naughty Sorceress, as she is holding a contest of some sorts. 

After thinning out the competition by beating them up, the character is declared the winner, only for the Naughty Sorceress herself to thank the character for dealing with the last adventurers that served as a threat to her before knocking out the player by pink gas. 

When the character wakes up, it is revealed from the skull of a barely alive adventurer named Frank that, due to the screwy nature of time at the Kingdom, the Naughty Sorceress has been terrorizing the kingdom for four thousand years, and the Council&#x27;s corrupted nature prevented anyone from actually succeeding. With Frank&#x27;s help through a maze, the character will come across 6 locks to the entrance. 6 different keys are required to enter (such as the keys of the three mighty architectural elders). After finding the keys and the many trials to the top of the Sorceress&#x27;s tower, the player comes face to face with the sorceress herself, only to be beaten in her third form: a sausage powerful enough to cause any damage in capital letters. Frank will notice this and will tell the player to go back to find the Wand of Nagamar, the wand of the necromancer Nagamar who was responsible for misspelling the Misspelled Cemetary. After finding the wand, the character will fight the Naughty Sorceress once more and rearrange the spelling of her all-caps attack to counterattack, eventually leading to her sausage defeat. 

Once the Naughty Sorceress has been defeated, her chamber will have been mostly destroyed, and King Ralph&#x27;s Prism will appear. The player can then free King Ralph, thereby reinstating power to the King and causing the Council of Loathing to become obsolete, much to the dismay of the council members. The destruction of the prism will cause an astral gash to appear in the middle of the sky where the King was once imprismed. Upon returning to the council, they will tell the character that they have just discovered that the monsters are still running amok, and that the Naughty Sorceress wasn&#x27;t the main culprit: it turns out that the monsters really hate the character. However, they also reveal that jumping into the Astral Gash will allow the character to ascend to Valhalla, afterlife hub of reincarnations and new routes, and only then will the monsters stop attacking the kingdom. It is up to the player to either continue playing side quests and leveling up or to ascend to play a new game whenever they decide to.

==Development==

Zack Johnson, the game&#x27;s creator, developed several games before &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; but did not feel that they were good enough to release online. Deciding that he was taking the games he created too seriously, Johnson then set himself the challenge of creating one within a week and publishing the result online. The result was more of a joke than a game, and the initial content including classes and even the name of the game were stream of consciousness. The game was released in early 2003, and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer. Within a year, 300,000 player accounts had been created, far exceeding Johnson and Nite&#x27;s expectations; Johnson has referred to the game&#x27;s success as &quot;a never ending series of astonishments&quot;. In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players.

In the game&#x27;s early days, Johnson worked on the game during breaks while at work; however, 18 months or so after launch, the game was bringing in enough money for Johnson to quit his day job as a programmer and develop the game full-time. He then began to pay Nite for his work and after approximately two years hired two more developers. There are currently eight full-time employees working on &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;, as well as three other employees who are working on a separate game.
The game&#x27;s creative process is fluid and loosely structured. According to Johnson, &quot;At this point, I provide the overall direction. I do about a quarter of the writing, a quarter of the coding, and almost all of the artwork.&quot; The bulk of the writing was done by Nite, who also contributed design ideas, while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.

According to Nite, the game&#x27;s writing style owes itself to a humorous email exchange between himself and Johnson that began when the two separated after high school. These emails &quot;helped us develop the shared comedic voice that &quot;KoL&quot; written in&quot;. The game&#x27;s developers cite text-based games such as Zork and Legend of the Red Dragon as creative influences, and Nite has compared the game to the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children&#x27;s books.

The game has been in open beta since its initial release, and is continuously being worked on. New content is released weekly or monthly, and there is also unique holiday-themed content every Christmas, known as Crimbo. Occasionally, the developers stage world events such as the Gray Plague, which was similar to the Corrupted Blood incident in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

In November 2014, Nite left Asymmetric Publications.

==Business model==
&quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; is advertising-free and does not charge subscription fees.

Maintenance and development of the game is supported primarily through donations and players who donate US$10 to the game receive a powerful item known as a Mr. Accessory. Mr. Accessories can be equipped to give stat boosts or spent in the &quot;Mr. Store&quot; to buy powerful items (including special monthly items). Mr. Accessories and Mr. Store items may be traded freely between players. According to an interview with Zack Johnson from 2010, Johnson originally established the Mr. Accessory revenue model as &quot;kind of an afterthought&quot;, but it became lucrative enough to allow him to work on the game full-time and eventually to hire several permanent employees.

==Community==
&quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; has been praised for its welcoming and active player community. One of the most unusual aspects of the community is the large number of female players: according to Johnson, approximately 40% of players are female. Fans often gather at both official conventions, run by Asymmetric, and unofficial player-organized meet-ups, including the annual KoLumbus event. Players support the game by writing scripts to perform various in-game functions, using Greasemonkey, Java, Perl, and Lua, and have also developed a player-run wiki which offers puzzle solutions and walkthroughs. Longtime player and nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot is active in the community and included a &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;-themed song on his 2010 album &quot;Zero Day&quot;.

Brett Bixler, founder of the Educational Gaming Commons at Pennsylvania State University, has hypothesized that the &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; community is successful because it accounts for Richard Bartle&#x27;s model of player personality types in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games, creating a balanced gameplay system that appeals to a wide variety of players. Researcher Martin Oliver addressed similar issues in a 2009 study of the &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; player community, &quot;Playing Roles in the MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing&quot;.

A Web-based SHOUTcast radio station, &quot;Radio KoL&quot;, was the &quot;official unofficial&quot; radio station of &quot;KoL&quot;. It was a 24/7 DJ-hosted station, with volunteer DJs drawn from the &quot;KoL&quot; user base. As well as the player-hosted music shows, development team members hosted shows on Radio KoL in which they discussed the state of the game and answered questions from players. Radio KoL was shut down in late 2019.

==Reception==

Critical response for &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; has been generally positive, with consistent praise for the game&#x27;s humor and surrealism. The gameplay and content have been praised as &quot;well designed&quot; and having a &quot;huge amount of content&quot;. Matt Gallant of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; said that the game is &quot;actually very full-featured&quot; with &quot;a lot of content&quot;, and according to &quot;Worlds in Motion&quot;, &quot;&quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; isn&#x27;t just a great game, but a really unique and interesting MMO.&quot; &quot;Jay Is Games&quot; called it &quot;a &#x27;must play&#x27; game for RPG fans who want something different&quot;. &quot;Gamezebo&quot; criticized the interface, calling it &quot;clunky&quot;, and several reviewers expressed concern that the game might be confusing to new players.

=== Controversy ===
In 2019, Johnson was accused of &quot;physical and emotional&quot; abuse by his ex-wife, U.C. Santa Cruz professor A.M. Darke, towards her and &quot;West of Loathing&quot; designer Kevin Simmons. She also alleged that he had removed part of the game to avoid crediting her for its development. Johnson denied the allegations of physical abuse, although admitting to &quot;emotional immaturity and anger and cruelty&quot; in a written apology. He later added Darke to the game&#x27;s credits, claiming she had only provided feedback to the game and did not work on it in a design capacity. An ex-girlfriend of Johnson&#x27;s, Bonnie Mattson, similarly alleged abusive behavior during a 2005 relationship.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism () and its related history in South Korea. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support and representation in the National Assembly.

Historically, liberals in South Korea began as a movement against the military dictatorship, but in the current political system of the South Korea, it has become a movement against the conservatives. The Democratic Party of Korea is a reformist party and is considered a centrist party in the international context. However, in the Korean domestic context, it is classified as a center-left party, and there are studies by several experts that it is a conservative liberal party, promoting social and fiscal conservative policies that are considered more right-wing than center-right parties in Western Europe. The Justice Party is considered a &quot;centre-left to left-wing&quot; party and is considered to be radical progressive or leftist in South Korea, but takes a more moderate stance than the far-left parties of Western Europe.

There are various political positions within South Korean liberals, but they tend to coalesce on certain stances: promoting harmony with North Korea, justice against Japan, and, wherever possible, autonomy from great power interference, including the United States. South Korean liberalism is also based on a national liberalist independence movement against Japan. South Korean liberals support the Sunshine Policy toward North Korea.

==Introduction==

The word &quot;liberal&quot; in South Korea is often used in its traditional sense. In South Korea, conservatives also call themselves &quot;liberal&quot; () and &quot;liberal democracy&quot; () in a similar sense to economic liberalism and anti-communism. &quot;Liberals&quot; in the general sense often refer to themselves as &quot;Democrats&quot;, &quot;Ribeoreol&quot; (, the Korean pronunciation of the English &quot;liberal&quot;) or &quot;Democratic Camps&quot; (). In South Korea, &quot;liberal&quot; () and &quot;progressive&quot; () are political forces with individual traditions, but when translating &quot;liberal&quot; in the United States into Korean language, it is often translated into &quot;progressive&quot;. The Justice Party officially supports social democracy, but since it is a party that inherited the political stake of the Uri Party, it is regarded as part of the South Korean progressive political party tradition and at the same time as part of the liberal political party tradition.

In South Korea, the terms &quot;liberal,&quot; &quot;liberty,&quot; &quot;libertarian,&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; all tend to be translated into &quot;Jayu&quot; (). For example, in South Korea, both Canada&#x27;s &quot;Liberal Party&quot;, Netherlands&#x27; &quot;Party for Freedom&quot; and the United States&#x27; &quot;Libertarian Party&quot; are read as &quot;Jayudang&quot; () in Korean. Also, right-wing socially conservative media in South Korea regard the American tradition of right-libertarianism as progressive because it is culturally liberal.

The main diplomatic point that defines liberalism in South Korea is &quot;independence&quot; (독립). Modern South Korean liberals tend to be more negative on immigration than the conservatives. South Korean liberals have a more nationalistic nature based on anti-imperialism in matters related to neighboring powers such as Japan. The anti-China Gaehwa Party / Independence Club at the end of the 19th century, and the anti-Japan Korean independence movement during the Japanese colonial era, formed Korea&#x27;s early liberalism. On the other hand, Korea&#x27;s conservative elites cooperated with neighboring powers such as Qing China and Japan for practical reasons. In modern South Korean politics, where socialism and anti-Americanism were thoroughly suppressed by conservatives with the support of the United States, liberals resent domestic interference by foreign powers. Thus, while they maintain cordial relations with the United States, they also seek to exercise strategic autonomy in its foreign policy.

South Korean liberals tends to take a nuanced and pragmatic stance towards China and Russia, preferring cooperation to promote peace on the peninsula. Thus, they tend to be more reluctant to take a strong stance on controversial issues such as the issue of Taiwan and disputes in the South China Sea. On the campaign trail, Lee Jae-myung questioned South Korean relevance in the Taiwan Strait issue. President Moon Jae-in stated that South Korea will not take sides in US-China rivalry. Historically, the Korean provisional government in exile was supported by Nationalist China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party, then a guerilla movement, support Korean partisans against the Japanese occupation. 

South Korean liberals have represented Korean victims of Japanese war crimes since the 1990s. They oppose any agreement or cooperation with Japan until the Japanese government issues formal apologies to Korean victims and demonstrate sincere reflections on the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Korea. President Moon Jae-in stated the human rights of victims are more important than relations between countries. They also pursue an assertive stance on the sovereignty of the disputed islands of Liancourt Rocks, known in Korea as Dokdo, straining relations with Japan as a result.

South Korean liberals have a contradictory standard on international human rights violations. South Korean liberals are less critical of North Korea than conservatives and oppose the &#x27;North Korean Human Rights Law&#x27; (북한인권법). However, South Korean liberals are more strongly opposed than conservatives to human rights violations in other authoritarian states (e.g., China, Myanmar, etc.) with the exception of North Korea. In 2021, Moon Jae-in government opposed Myanmar&#x27;s military dictatorship and supported strong sanctions against Myanmar&#x27;s military, but deliberately ignored North Korea&#x27;s human rights violations. (This is related to the resistance-nationalist sentiment of South Korean liberals.) In 2022, the liberal Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper criticized President Yoon Suk-yeol for ignoring the human rights issue of Xinjiang.

South Korean major liberals mainly criticize mainstream conservatives, distancing themselves from any heritage and relationship with the military dictatorship, insist on political reform and the rule of law, supporting the foreign policy of reconciliation with North Korea. They are distinguished from progressives and cultural liberals. South Korea liberals tend to be socially conservative in LGBT rights, Disability rights, abortion and minority rights issues. (The socially conservative tendency of South Korean liberals is not traditional conservatism based on Confucianism, but is more influenced by Christianity.) They also tend to distance themselves from the (Including social democracy) &quot;socialism&quot; or fundamental &quot;left-wing&quot;. Modern South Korean liberals tend to be more negative on immigration than the conservatives. 

Domestically, they advocated the reform of the monopoly of the large industrial conglomerates known as chaebols. They also proposed the curtailing of investigative powers of the prosecutor&#x27;s office, with such powers transferred to the police, as they viewed them as powerful political tools.

== History ==
During the colonial period, Marxist historian Paek Nam-un evaluated &quot;Silhak&quot; as &quot;pioneer of early modern period liberalism,&quot; while Ahn Jae-hong, a liberal nationalist, evaluated Silhak and Silhak scholar Jeong Yak-yong as &quot;the origin of late modern period liberalism by presenting elimination of (feudal) class and support for equality&quot;. &quot;Silhak&quot; criticized the existing Confucian conservatism and &quot;Sadaejuui&quot;, aiming for political reform and pragmatism, and also argued for the superiority of Western science and technology. Some &quot;Silhak&quot; scholar also believed in Christianity. Other nationalist elements are alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and turns towards Donghak neo-Confucianist movements to counter Western influence.

Korea&#x27;s first classical liberal and Enlightenmentists party was the Gaehwa Party, which appeared in 1874. They aimed for radical political and social reform, cut off unequal relations with the powerful Qing Dynasty and tried to create a completely independent Joseon Dynasty, and led by Seo Jae-pil in 1896 was a practical successor to the Gaehwa Party. Influenced by Japanese liberalism, they showed pro-Japanese tendencies, but at the same time insisted on independent and independent Korea. In the 1900s, classical liberals and Enlightenmentists in Korea were largely divided into two groups. Some became &quot;Chinilpa&quot; who cooperated with Japan, and others who devoted themselves to the Korean independence movement.

During the colonial era, Korean liberalism is closely related to the Korean independence movement. South Korean historians say that the March 1st Movement, which took place in 1919, affected democracy and liberalism in South Korea as a movement involving many Koreans regardless of gender, religion, or occupation. The Republic of Korean Provisional Government, established thanks to the value of the March 1st Movement, has established a modern national system in name and reality by introducing the separation of powers of government, parliament, and judiciary based on freedom and equality, and common elections including women. (However, since it was located in Shanghai, China, it was more of a Korean independence movement organization than a korean government.)

After the end of Japanese colonial rule, with the inauguration of the Republic of Korea government, the word &quot;liberal&quot; has been used in South Korea for a while in a similar sense to anti-communism and anti-socialism. That is why not only ideological liberals but also hard-line conservatives and far-right anti-communists called themselves &quot;liberal.&quot; A case in point was the &quot;Liberal Party&quot;, a South Korean far-right national-conservative party influenced by Shōwa Statism, German and Italian fascism. In particular, Syngman Rhee, the first president of the Liberal Party, committed authoritarian rule and election fraud based on Ilminism, an anti-liberal individual worship ideology from 1948 to 1960, and liberals and students who opposed it caused April Revolution. This was the first successful liberal revolution in South Korea.

Due to the April Revolution (1960), Syngman Rhee stepped down from his presidency, the first liberal democratic government in South Korea was established, and the presidential system was converted to a parliamentary cabinet system. However, South Korean liberal democracy collapses in less than a year in a 1961 military coup caused by Major Park Chung Hee. Since then, South Korea has suffered from more than 20 years of military dictatorship. Until South Korea was fully democratized in 1988, there have been several democratization movements, including Bu-Ma Democratic Protests and Gwangju Uprising.

South Korea was democratized in 1987, but it was in 1998 that liberals changed their regime. Since the Kim Dae-jung administration in 1998, South Korean liberals are actively supporting the Sunshine Policy, to promote peace and reconciliation through economic aid and co-operation, or “South-North economic co-operation” (남북경협).

<text>Robert Manning (22 October 1816 – 9 December 1897) was an Irish hydraulic engineer best known for creation of the Manning formula.

Manning was born in Normandy, France, the son of a soldier who had fought the previous year at the Battle of Waterloo. In 1826 he moved to Waterford, Ireland and in time worked as an accountant.

In 1846, during the year of the great famine, Manning was recruited into the Arterial Drainage Division of the Irish Office of Public Works. After working as a draughtsman for a while, he was appointed an assistant engineer to Samuel Roberts later that year. In 1848, he became district engineer, a position he held until 1855. As a district engineer, he read &quot;&quot;Traité d&#x27;Hydraulique&quot; by d&#x27;Aubisson des Voissons, after which he developed a great interest in hydraulics.

From 1855 to 1869, Manning was employed by the Marquis of Downshire, while he supervised the construction of the Dundrum Bay Harbour in Ireland and designed a water supply system for Belfast. After the Marquis’ death in 1869, Manning returned to the Irish Office of Public Works as assistant to the chief engineer. He became chief engineer himself in 1874, a position he held it until his retirement in 1891. In 1866 he was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers for his paper &quot;On… the flow of water off the ground in the Woodburn District near Carrickfergus&quot;&quot;.

He died at his Dublin home on 9 December 1897 and was buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery. He had married his second cousin Susanna Gibson in 1848, by whom he had seven surviving children, one of whom, William Manning, was also an engineer. His second daughter was the painter Mary Ruth Manning (1853-1930).

==Manning Formula==
Manning did not receive any education or formal training in fluid mechanics or engineering. His accounting background and pragmatism influenced his work and drove him to reduce problems to their simplest form. He compared and evaluated seven best known formulae of the time for the flow of water in a channel: Du Buat (1786), Eyelwein (1814), Weisbach (1845), St. Venant (1851), Neville (1860), Darcy and Bazin (1865), and Ganguillet and Kutter (1869). He calculated the velocity obtained from each formula for a given slope and for hydraulic radii varying from 0.25 m to 30 m. Then, for each condition, he found the mean value of the seven velocities and developed a formula that best fitted the data.

The first best-fit formula was the following:

formula_1

He then simplified this formula to:

formula_2

In 1885, Manning gave formula_3 the value of 2/3 and wrote his formula as follows:

formula_4

In a letter to Flamant, Manning stated: &quot;The reciprocal of C corresponds closely with that of n, as determined by Ganguillet and Kutter; both C and n being constant for the same channel.&quot;

On 4 December 1889, at the age of 73, Manning first proposed his formula to the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ireland). This formula saw the light in 1891, in a paper written by him entitled &quot;On the flow of water in open channels and pipes,&quot; published in the Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ireland).

Manning did not like his own equation for two reasons: First, it was difficult in those days to determine the cube root of a number and then square it to arrive at a number to the 2/3 power. In addition, the equation was dimensionally incorrect, and so to obtain dimensional correctness he developed the following equation:

formula_5

where formula_6 = &quot;height of a column of mercury which balances the atmosphere,&quot; and formula_7 was a dimensionless number &quot;which varies with the nature of the surface.&quot;

However, in some late 19th century textbooks, the Manning formula was written as follows:

formula_8

Through his &quot;Handbook of Hydraulics,&quot; King (1918) led to the widespread use of the Manning formula as we know it today, as well as to the acceptance that the Manning&#x27;s coefficient formula_7 should be the reciprocal of Kutter&#x27;s formula_10.

In the United States, formula_10 is referred to as Manning&#x27;s friction factor, or Manning&#x27;s constant. In Europe, the Strickler formula_12 is the same as Manning&#x27;s formula_7, i.e., the reciprocal of formula_10.

<text>Mannyng&#x27;s Chronicle is a chronicle written in Middle English by Robert Mannyng in about 1338. He came from Bourne in Lincolnshire and though not himself in full orders was connected with the priory at Sempringham and later with Sixhill. He also rhymed Story of England.

Mannyng began writing his chronicle at the beginning of Edward III&#x27;s reign in 1327 and probably finished it in 1338, dated at the end of the second part. The chronicle consists of two parts. The first, describing British history up to King Cadwaldre and a translation of Wace’s Roman de Brut, is 15,946 lines long. The second part, describing history from Cadwaldre up to the death of Edward I and a translation of the Anglo-French verse by Peter of Langtoft, is 8358 lines long. The chronicle survives in two manuscripts: The P manuscript and the L manuscript. The former is the most complete, since the latter ends somewhere in the middle of part II.

<text>The United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (SFTI program), more popularly known as Top Gun (stylized as TOPGUN), is a United States Navy training program that teaches air combat maneuvering tactics and techniques to selected naval aviators and naval flight officers, who return to their operating units as surrogate instructors.

The program began as the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, established on 3 March 1969, at the former Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. In 1996, the school was merged into the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada.

==History==

===Origins===

An earlier U.S. Navy air-to-air combat training program, the U.S. Navy Fleet Air Gunnery Units, or FAGU, had provided air combat training for Naval Aviators from the early 1950s until 1960. In June 1956, Fleet Air Gunnery Unit Pacific held the &quot;Navy Fleet Air Gunnery Meet&quot; at NAAS El Centro. In April 1957, &quot;Naval Air Weapons Meet 1957&quot; was held at NAAS El Centro. In April 1958, &quot;Naval Air Weapons Meet&quot; was held at NAAS El Centro. From 30 November to 4 December 1959, the last &quot;Naval Air Weapons Meet&quot; was held at MCAAS Yuma.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=DeAwAAAACAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Signage called it &quot;Top Gun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=D2RGAQAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Fleet Air Gunnery Unit Pacific&quot; and &quot;Marine Training Groups&quot; were closed, as an economy,&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=A8_V2OxM-b0C&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a doctrinal shift, brought on by advances in missile, radar, and fire control technology, contributing to the belief that the era of the classic dogfight was over, leading to their disestablishment and a serious decline in U.S. air-to-air combat proficiency that became apparent during the Vietnam War. The pilots who were part of the initial cadre of instructors at Top Gun had experience as students from FAGU.

In 1968, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer ordered Captain Frank Ault to research the failings of the U.S. air-to-air missiles used against the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force during the then-ongoing Vietnam War. Operation Rolling Thunder, which lasted from 2 March 1965 to 1 November 1968, ultimately saw almost 1,000 U.S. aircraft losses in about one million sorties.

Royal Navy and South African Brigadier General Dick Lord along with others were sent to assist the US Military. He wrote the USN Air Combat Manoeuvring Manual (ACM) and his training methods were instrumental in the creation of Top Gun.

===Fighter Weapons School===

The United States Navy Fighter Weapons School was established on 3 March 1969, at Naval Air Station Miramar, California. Placed under the control of the VF-121 &quot;Pacemakers,&quot; an F-4 Phantom–equipped Replacement Air Group (RAG) unit, the new school received relatively scant funding and resources. Its staff consisted of eight F-4 Phantom II instructors from VF-121 and one intelligence officer hand-picked by the school&#x27;s first officer-in-charge, Lieutenant Commander Dan Pedersen, USN. Together, F-4 aviators Darrell Gary, Mel Holmes, Jim Laing, John Nash, Jim Ruliffson, Jerry Sawatzky, J. C. Smith, Steve Smith, as well as Wayne Hildebrand, a naval intelligence officer, built the Naval Fighter Weapons School syllabus from scratch. To support their operations, they borrowed aircraft from its parent unit and other Miramar-based units, such as composite squadron VC-7 and Fighter Squadron VF-126. The school&#x27;s first headquarters at Miramar was in a stolen modular trailer.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy.mil/dn-sn-84-09583&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the 1973 command history of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, the unit&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;train fighter air crews at the graduate level in all aspects of fighter weapons systems including tactics, techniques, procedures and doctrine. It serves to build a nucleus of eminently knowledgeable fighter crews to construct, guide, and enhance weapons training cycles and subsequent aircrew performance. This select group acts as the F-4 community’s most operationally orientated weapons specialists. Top Gun&#x27;s efforts are dedicated to the Navy’s professional fighter crews, past, present and future.&quot;

Highly qualified instructors were an essential element of Top Gun&#x27;s success. Mediocre instructors are unable to hold the attention of talented students. Top Gun instructors were knowledgeable fighter tacticians assigned to one or more specific fields of expertise, such as a particular weapon, threat, or tactic. Every instructor was required to become an expert in effective training techniques. All lectures were given without notes after being screened by a notorious &quot;murder board&quot; of evaluators who would point out ambiguities or flawed concepts in the draft presentation. The curriculum was in a constant state of flux based upon class critiques and integration of developing tactics to use new systems to combat emerging threats. Instructors often spent their first year on the staff learning to be an effective part of the training environment.

Top Gun initially operated the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and borrowed USAF Northrop T-38 Talons to simulate the flying characteristics of the MiG-17 and MiG-21, respectively. The school also used Marine-crewed Grumman A-6 Intruders and USAF Convair F-106 Delta Dart aircraft when available. Later adversary aircraft included the IAI Kfir and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon; and the T-38 was replaced by the Northrop F-5E and F-5F Tiger II.

In addition to maneuvering skill, knowledge of weapons systems was recognized as important. Weapons system knowledge was determined as a common thread among the 4 percent of World War II pilots who accounted for 40 percent of the enemy aircraft destroyed. The complexity of modern weapons systems requires careful study to achieve design potential.

The British writer Rowland White claimed that the early school was influenced by a group of a dozen flying instructors from the British Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, who were assigned to Miramar as exchange pilots and served as instructors in VF-121. A British newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, declared in a 2009 headline, &quot;American Top Gun Fighter Pilot Academy Set Up by British.&quot; However, the British naval pilots mentioned in the article confirmed that the claim was false and that they had no role in creating the curriculum and no access to the classified programs that the Top Gun instructors participated in to refine it.

During the halt in the bombing campaign against North Vietnam (in force from 1968 until the early 1970s), Top Gun established itself as a center of excellence in fighter doctrine, tactics, and training. By the time aerial activity over the North resumed, most Navy squadrons had a Top Gun graduate. According to the Navy, the results were dramatic: the Navy kill-to-loss ratio against the North Vietnamese Air Force (NVAF) MiGs soared from 2.42:1 to 12.5:1. In contrast, the Air Force, which had not implemented a similar training program, saw its kill ratio worsen for a time after the resumption of bombing, according to Benjamin Lambeth&#x27;s &quot;The Transformation of American Airpower.&quot; On 28 March 1970, Lieutenant Jerry Beaulier, a graduate of Top Gun&#x27;s first class, scored the first kill of a North Vietnamese MiG since September 1968.

===Transfer to NSAWC===
In 1996, the transfer of NAS Miramar to the U.S. Marine Corps was coupled with the incorporation of Top Gun into the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) at NAS Fallon, Nevada. In 2016, NSAWC was rebranded as the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), where Top Gun remains a department alongside graduate-level weapons schools for other naval aviation platforms.

In 2011, the Top Gun program was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

==In popular culture==
The school was made famous by the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot; and its 2022 sequel &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, starring Tom Cruise. Quoting &quot;Top Gun&quot; while at the school incurs an immediate $5 fine, as it is seen as conflicting with the institute&#x27;s atmosphere of professionalism.

<text>Bruce Nuclear Generating Station is a nuclear power station located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada. It occupies 932 ha (2300 acres) of land. The facility derives its name from Bruce Township, the local municipality when the plant was constructed, now Kincardine due to amalgamation. With eight CANDU pressurized heavy-water reactors, it was the world&#x27;s largest fully operational nuclear generating station by total reactor count and the number of currently operational reactors until 2016, when it was exceeded in nameplate capacity by South Korea&#x27;s Kori Nuclear Power Plant.
The station is the largest employer in Bruce County, with over 4000 workers.

Formerly known as the Bruce Nuclear Power Development (BNPD), the facility was constructed in stages between 1970 and 1987 by the provincial Crown corporation, Ontario Hydro. In April 1999 Ontario Hydro was split into 5 component Crown corporations with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) taking over all electrical generating stations. In June 2000, OPG entered into a long-term lease agreement with private sector consortium Bruce Power to take over operation. In May 2001, Bruce Power began operations. The lease was for 18 years until 2019 with an option to extend another 25 years to 2044.

In November 2009, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) renewed Bruce Power&#x27;s operating licences for 5 years until 2014 and gave permission to refuel units 1 and 2. In May 2014, the CNSC extended the licence to May 2015 and public hearings were scheduled for early 2015 in Ottawa and Kincardine. A new operating licence was granted for 1 June 2015, until 31 May 2020 and was renewed again from 1 October 2018 until 30 September 2028.

In 2023, it was announced that the site could potentially open a third nuclear power station. Bruce C was first proposed in the late 2000s, however it was not proceeded with at the time.

In 2023, the Bruce generating station produced more than 45 billion kWh, about 7% of the total Canadian electricity consumption.

==Description==

The power plant comprises eight CANDU pressurized heavy-water reactors arranged into two plants (A and B) with four reactors each. Each reactor stands within a reinforced concrete containment. The steam generators are 12 m tall, and weigh 100 tonnes each. Each plant uses three fueling machines, shared between the four reactors, which travel in a duct cut through solid rock beneath the reactors, traversing the entire plant. The duct doubles as part of the pressure relief system, connected to the vacuum building. Each reactor has its own turbine generator set, with one high-pressure turbine and three low-pressure turbines driving one generator. The turbine hall is about 400 m long at each plant and houses the four turbine generator sets. Cooling water is taken from Lake Huron. There is (originally) one control room per 4 reactors.

===Bruce A===
Construction of Bruce A began in 1969, making it the successor to the Pickering A plant. Bruce A units were originally rated at 750 MWe net / 805 MWe gross, which was later increased to 769 MWe net / 825 MWe gross. the Bruce A units were capable of producing up to 779 MWe net according to IESO generator data. Each reactor requires 6240 fuel bundles that weigh 22.5 kg each, or about 140 tonnes of fuel. There are 480 fuel channels per reactor, containing 13 bundles each. There is storage capacity for about 23,000 bundles. Approximately 18 bundles are discharged per reactor per day.

The original Bruce A steam generators utilized a separate large horizontal shared steam drum (with one steam drum common to four steam generators), a design dropped in most other plants at the time. Issues related to the AECL requested design of the tube supports caused repair and delay costs, which exceeded the net worth of the builder Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada.

Until they were removed in 1998, Bruce A reactors used unique booster rods to control reactivity. Booster rods contained 93% uranium-235, and were inserted to overcome reactor poisoning. Bruce B and all other Ontario Hydro reactors instead use absorber rods called &quot;adjusters&quot; which are normally inserted and are removed to overcome xenon poisoning.

Bruce A demonstrated an &quot;excellent&quot; early operating history. Together with Pickering A, the eight units achieved an overall average capability factor of 83% over the initial five-year period. However, by 2001, when Bruce Power took the lease, all Bruce A units were laid-up.

In 1981, Unit 1 was ranked the top reactor in the world with a 97% availability factor.
In December 1997, after about 20 years of operation, it was out of service. In 2005 (after 7 years of being idle) refurbishment started. In September 2012 (15 years out of service) it resumed operation.

In 1982, Unit 2 was temporarily shut down due to a pressure-tube leak. In 1986, a fuel channel failed while the reactor was shut down; some of the fuel elements were swept into the moderator (calandria) and were difficult to remove.

In 1986, maintenance workers accidentally left a protective lead blanket in the steam generator of Unit 2. By the time the mistake was discovered six years later, the blanket had melted, severely damaging the boiler.
In October 1995, after about 18 years of operation, unit 2 was taken out of service.
In 2005 (after 9 years of being idle) refurbishment started.
In October 2012, it resumed operation.

In 1982, Unit 3 set a then world record of 494 days of continuous operation and Bruce A was the most reliable multi-unit station in the world.
From April 1998 onward, Bruce A3 remained idle for 6 years, returning to service in January 2004 (at which time the unit was 32 years old).
Refurbishment in unit 3 began in March 2023, with the plan being to return to service in 2026. 

In 1990, a software error in unit 4 caused a fueling-machine error, damaging a fuel channel.
In 1993, reactor power was reduced to 60% until various loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) scenarios could be addressed. Subsequently, Bruce A units returned to 89% of rated power.
In March 1998, after about 19 years of operation, unit 4 was taken out of service. It returned to service in October 2003, after 6 years of being idle (at which time the unit was 31 years old).
Planned refurbishment of unit 4 to begin in 2025 (when the unit will be 53 years old).

===Bruce B===
Bruce B units, located to the south of Bruce A, are of a slightly larger capacity: 817 MW net, 840 MW gross. which is attributed to an improved steam generator design, where the steam drum is integral to each steam generator in a &quot;light bulb&quot; arrangement, eliminating the horizontal cross-drum.
In 1990, a nine-week &quot;impairment&quot; of Bruce B was created when a technician incorrectly set the calibration on radioactivity monitors. In 2007, Bruce B 7 was the top performing nuclear reactor in Ontario with 97.2% performance. and in 2009, Bruce B 5 was first with 95.4% performance.

===Electrical output===
The graph represents the annual electricity generation at the site (A and B combined) in GWh.
In 2013, it was about 30% of Ontario&#x27;s production.

As of the end of 2023, the total lifetime output of the facility was 1,606,926 GWh.
====Notable Achievements====
In 2009 total site output hit 1,002 TWh, making it the first nuclear power plant in the world to produce 1 PWh (1,000 TWh). Gravelines in France achieved the same in 2010.

As of the end of 2020, the 8 Bruce units had produced a combined total of 1,479.59 TWh.

After Units 1–2 completed refurbishment activities and were brought back online in 2012, Bruce became the largest operating nuclear generation facility in the world by both the number of currently operational reactors and total net output capacity, having a total of 8 operational CANDU nuclear reactors with a combined output of 6,384 MWe net (7,276 MWe gross) when all units are online, surpassed now by two South-Korean plants: Kori NPP since 2019 and Hanul NPP since 2022. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Japan had a larger total output capacity, but it has been out of service since 2011.

===Transmission Lines===
As of 2008, the Bruce station had three double-circuit 500 kV transmission lines to feed the major load centres in southern Ontario, in addition to three double-circuit 230 kV lines serving the local area.
These circuits are connected via two high voltage switchyards owned and operated by Hydro One.

In 2006, OPA had proposed increasing transmission line capacity, at a cost of between $200–600 million, described as &quot;the largest electricity transmission investment in Ontario in the last 20 years&quot;. The line was completed in June 2012, several months ahead of schedule, with over 700 towers built for the 180 kilometre line to Milton. The project ranked 45th in Renew Canada&#x27;s annual list.

===Comparison with Pickering===
Compared to the other major Canadian nuclear power plant built earlier, Pickering station, the Bruce reactors have higher power output, achieved by: increasing the number of fuel channels, increasing the number of bundles per channel, and a change in the fuel bundle itself.

At Bruce, the fuelling equipment is shared by the four reactors of each plant, while at Pickering each reactor had a fuelling machine. 
The Bruce fuelling machine and fuel channel end fitting design (mostly by Canadian General Electric) is based on the Nuclear Power Demonstration design. The Pickering design by AECL was based on Douglas Point.

The building design of the reactor differs: Bruce uses a squarish &quot;close-in&quot; design, in which as much of the equipment as possible is arranged outside the main containment envelope for easier access during maintenance and emergencies. The steam generators penetrate the containment. The primary coolant pumps and primary piping systems are inside the containment enclosure, but the pump motors are outside containment and the drive shaft seals form the containment boundary. Pickering has round domes which enclose much of the secondary cooling equipment.
* The Pickering A system did not originally have a second independent shutdown system. The Bruce containment concept differs: the reactor&#x27;s reactivity mechanism deck serves as a part of the containment boundary, is closer to the reactor, and more prone to damage in the event of an accident (&quot;accidental physical disassembly&quot;). The designers therefore foresaw the need for a second safety system to reduce the risk of an accident. Bruce received a second, fully independent Safety Shutdown System (SDS2) which uses a liquid neutron poison injection method.
*The Bruce system also has a high-pressure Emergency Coolant Injection System (ECIS).
*Each Bruce &quot;4 pack&quot; has its own Vacuum Building, while Pickering has one per eight reactors.
*At Pickering, the vacuum duct was closed by nonreturn valves, to prevent flow of the steam/air mixture from the duct to a non-accident reactor unit following a LOCA. In the Bruce concept, there is no such non-return valve; the reactor buildings are all interconnected during normal operation.
*Bruce uses single-circuit heat transport system, while Pickering had two circuits.
*The first two reactor units of Pickering A originally used Zircaloy-2 pressure tubes. All subsequent CANDU units use a zirconium – 2.5% niobium alloy.
*Bruce uses a pressurizer to maintain coolant pressure, Pickering a different system.
*The Pickering design utilized 12 small steam generators operated in groups of three which can be individually valved out of the heat transport loop, as can the 16 pumps per reactor, with 4 being spare. At Bruce, the number of steam generators and coolant pumps was reduced to 8 and 4 respectively, without any spare pumps, thereby simplifying the piping. The Bruce system permits reactor power level to be adjusted more quickly and easily.

===Construction costs===
Bruce A was projected to cost billion in 1969. Actual cost was $1.8 billion (in 1979 dollars). Adjusted for inflation, the $930 million estimate in 1979 dollars is $1.88 billion, putting Bruce A under budget. 

Bruce B was projected to cost $3.929 billion in 1976. Actual cost was $5.994 billion (in 1987 dollars). Adjusted for inflation, the $3.929 billion estimate in 1987 dollars is $8.667 billion, putting Bruce B under budget.

===Cost of generated electricity===
In 2010, Bruce Power was paid approximately $60 million for contracted, but unused power.

On 1 January 2016, Bruce Power began receiving a single contracted price for all output from the site of per megawatt-hour (MWh). This price is partially adjusted annually to account for inflation and wage growth, with additional monthly fuel cost adjustments, and it includes a small payment for Bruce&#x27;s unique ability to curtail up to 2400 MW of generation (total across all eight units – up to 300 MW per individual unit) via steam bypass operation during periods of surplus generation.

During the course of the refurbishment of Units 3–6, the price will be raised in steps to cover individual reactor refurbishment costs, with each increase starting 12 months prior to the start of each individual refurbishment. Each increase will last only until that unit&#x27;s refurbishment costs, which are fixed prior to refurbishment start, have been recovered. The average price per MWh that will be paid to Bruce Power for all electricity generated from 2016 to 2064 (covering the entire refurbishment period for Units 3–6 plus the entire expected remaining post-refurbishment lifetimes of all eight Bruce Power reactors (including the two that were already refurbished) was estimated to be approximately /MWh in 2017 dollars by the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario. In contrast, the estimated average price of nuclear electricity from all three Ontario nuclear plants during that same 2016–2064 period was estimated to be /MWh in 2017 dollars, the 2017–2018 unit cost of Ontario nuclear power was /MWh, and the current price of electricity for &quot;most residential and small business customers&quot; was /MWh (prior to the Fair Hydro Plan) or (after the Fair Hydro Plan).

===Blackout of 2003===
During the Northeast Blackout of 2003 three Bruce B units continued running at 60% reactor power and 0% grid electrical power. They were able to do so for hours, because they had steam bypass systems designed to de-couple the reactor output from the generator electrical output. The three units were reconnected to the grid within 5 hours. Bruce A and B stations were designed to operate indefinitely while disconnected from the grid.

&quot;Contrary to popular belief, the electrical generators of nuclear plants can follow the load demands of the electrical grid provided specific engineered systems to permit this mode of operation are included in the plant design.&quot;

===Cobalt-60 production===
Cobalt-60 (60Co) can be produced in a CANDU reactor by using adjuster rods made primarily out of 59Co (instead of the normal stainless steel), which is slowly transmuted into 60Co via neutron activation (59Co + n → 60Co). These now-intensely-radioactive cobalt-60 adjuster rods are then &quot;harvested&quot; (removed and replaced with fresh 59Co adjuster rods) after one to three years of use in the reactor during a routine reactor shutdown, and are later processed into sealed 60Co sources of varying intensities by Nordion. The Bruce nuclear power plant has been producing 60Co since the 1980s, and almost all of the world&#x27;s supply of 60Co comes from various CANDU nuclear reactors, with Bruce being the single largest supplier. , Bruce supplied over 40% of the world&#x27;s 60Co. This rose to over 50% by 2016, with Pickering supplying approximately another 20% of global demand. In 2016, Bruce extended their contract with Nordion for the continued supply of 60Co to cover the entire projected post-refurbishment life of the Bruce reactors, which are expected to operate until 2064.

Bruce also began producing High Specific Activity (HSA) 60Co in 2016, which is designed for highly specialized medical uses such as cancer treatment and had been primarily produced at the NRU reactor for the past 60+ years (which was originally scheduled to be shut down in 2016, but will be kept online until 31 March 2018 due to the general worldwide lack of sufficient replacement medical isotope production capacity for several critical isotopes such as molybdenum-99). As the NRU produces over two-thirds of the world&#x27;s HSA 60Co, Bruce&#x27;s ability to supply HSA 60Co will become critical to help fill the immense production gap left by the NRU once it is decommissioned in 2018. OPG and Bruce Power are collaborating on an effort to expand 60Co production to the Bruce A and Darlington reactors in order to fully cover Pickering&#x27;s production (which will end when the plant is decommissioned in 2024) in addition to the inevitable gaps in 60Co production capacity that will be caused by the upcoming refurbishments of six of Bruce&#x27;s reactors (Units A 3–4 &amp; Units B 5–8), as well as all four of Darlington&#x27;s reactors. They are also working on expanding the production of HSA 60Co to more reactors.

In 2017, Bruce Power became the first Canadian recipient of a Top Innovative Practice (TIP) award from the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) for its ongoing work with Nordion to produce cobalt-60.

====Radioisotope production project====
Bruce Power is working with Framatome to develop the capability to &quot;produce shorter half-life radioisotopes (such as molybdenum-99, lutetium-177 and iridium-192)&quot; using Areva&#x27;s proprietary technology for the on-line production of radioisotopes in heavy water reactors. Areva will design and supply the system for installation in the existing Bruce units.

In June 2018, Bruce Power and ITG (a subsidiary of Isotopen Technologien München (ITM)) announced the start of a joint effort to explore producing lutetium-177 in Bruce&#x27;s reactors, with ITG planned to manage the development, processing, and distribution of lutetium-177. The initial Isotope Production System (IPS), producing Lu-177, came online in January 2022.

==Refurbishment of Units 1–2, 1995–2012==

Retubing of Bruce A units was planned in 1992, but deferred, as Ontario Hydro had a surplus of generation at the time.

In late 2005, Bruce Power and the Government of Ontario committed to return units 1 and 2 to service, to help meet increasing energy demand in the province of Ontario. The project was originally estimated to cost $4.25 billion. It was determined that while units 1 &amp; 2 could have been restarted without refurbishment, it was economically advantageous to do so, since refurbishment would have been soon required. The goal is to keep units 1 &amp; 2 in service until 2043, 66 years after original commissioning.

The refurbishment required pressure tube and calandria tube replacement, steam generator replacement, shutdown System 2 (SDS2) enhancement, an upgrade of turbine control systems, replacing original analog controls with a DCS and significant other work and maintenance (for example, replacement of 30 transformers containing PCBs).

A new fuel bundle design (Low Void Reactivity Fuel, LVRF) was considered, using slightly enriched 1% U-235 fuel pellets, within a CANFLEX 43-element bundle compared to the existing 37-element bundle.

In 2006 and 2007, the restart project was judged to be the largest infrastructure project in Canada by &quot;ReNew Canada&quot; magazine. In April 2007, the auditor general reviewed the refurbishment deal In August 2007, estimated cost for the project had grown to $5.25 billion when Bruce Power decided to replace all 480 fuel channels in Unit 4, which will extend its working life to 2036, in line with the other 3 units of Bruce A. In 2008, due to difficulties developing the necessary robotics, the estimated cost of restarting Units 1 and 2 rose between $400 and $700 million. As of 2008, the project remained on schedule.

In January 2010, up to 217 workers were potentially exposed to radiation during the refurbishment. 27 workers may have received 5 mSv, a level well below the level that can affect human health. Only one lab in Canada (at Chalk River) was qualified to do the testing. Bruce Power had to seek permission to use alternative labs.

In 2010, a plan to transport decommissioned, low-level radioactive steam generators to Sweden via the Great Lakes caused controversy. The CNSC approved the plan in February 2011.

As of January 2011, fuel channel installation in Unit 2 was complete. The CNSC gave the operator the green light to restart Unit 2 on 16 March 2012. However, the reactor was shut down the next day after a leak was discovered in the moderator system.

In 2011, refurbishment of Unit 1 and 2, scheduled to be complete 2009, was predicted for 2012. In 2011, the cost had totaled $3.8 billion; the final cost was expected to be $4.8 billion. The original 2005 estimate was $2.75 billion.

In September 2012, Unit 1 began generating power again.

On 16 October 2012, Unit 2 was connected to the provincial electricity grid for the first time in 17 years.
In 2013, final costs were estimated at $4.8 billion, up from an original estimate of $2.75 billion, and the project ran &quot;far behind&quot; schedule.

== Refurbishment of Units 3–8, 2016–present ==
In October 2013, under the Ontario Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP) 2013, Ontario announced plans to refurbish six reactors at the Bruce plant beginning with Bruce A4 in 2016. Other units would follow at intervals. Bruce Power estimated the cost at about $2 billion per unit, or $12 billion for six. The price of the power from these units was expected to be in the range of ~$60–$70 per MWh.

In 2016, Bruce Power started a $13 billion refurbishment program for &quot;major component replacement on Units 3–8 in 2020, starting in Unit 6&quot;. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan &quot;will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually – and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly – while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario&#x27;s economy&quot;.

Renew Canada rated the project as the biggest infrastructure upgrade in Canada for 2017.

* In January of 2020, Unit 6 went down for refurbishment. It returned to service on 8 September 2023 when it re-synchronized to the Ontario power grid. It was announced that Bruce 6 had completed its refurbishment ahead of schedule and on-budget. 
* In March of 2023, Unit 3 went down for refurbishment.

==Waste storage==
The Bruce station area is the site of OPG&#x27;s Western Waste Management Facility (WWMF). The WWMF stores the low-level waste and intermediate level nuclear waste from operating its 20 nuclear reactors, including those leased to Bruce Power. As of 2009, there were 11 low level storage buildings.

The WWMF provides dry nuclear fuel storage for the Bruce reactors. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization was mandated in 2002 by the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act to submit a proposal for the long-term management, which was submitted to the Minister of Natural Resources in November 2005 and approved by the government in June 2007. it is seeking a separate site in Canada for a permanent repository for the used fuel from all of Canada&#x27;s nuclear reactors.

In 2013, OPG proposed to construct a Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for long-term storage of low-and-intermediate level waste on lands adjacent to WWMF. The proposed DGR would be about 680 metres below surface.

==Future development==

In 2007, the Ontario Power Authority had recommended in a plan submitted to the Ontario Energy Board, to build a new nuclear power station consisting of at least two reactors. The leading candidate was AECL&#x27;s Advanced CANDU Reactor. Since 2008, environmental assessments have been underway both at Bruce and at Ontario Power Generation&#x27;s Darlington Nuclear Generating Station. In 2009, Bruce Power withdrew its application to the CNSC for the Bruce C plant.

===New station ===

In July 2023, Ontario Minister of Energy Todd Smith announced an intent to build 4.8 GW of new nuclear on the Bruce site, effectively re-starting the plans for Bruce C. It would be the first large-scale nuclear build in Canada for more than three decades, to prepare for increasing electricity demand in the long term.

===Uprates===

* On 26 October 2016 Bruce Power announced an uprate from 6,384 MWe to 6,400 MWe.
* On 11 July 2019 Bruce Power announced another uprate to the facility, adding 22 MW of output to Unit 3, bringing overall site output to 6,430 MWe.
* The March 2019 Bruce Power Major Component Replacement Project: Economic Impact Analysis indicates a target capacity of 7,000 MWe by mid-2033.
* On 14 October 2021, Bruce Power announced an uprate to 6,550 MWe.
* On 23 March 2022, Bruce Power announced an uprate to Unit 1 to 821 MWe 
* On 6 May 2022, Bruce Power announced an uprate to Unit 2 to 823MWe, adding 39MW of capacity to the 784MWe it was producing previously.

==Other features on site==

There are more than 56 kilometres of roads on site, and at least 25 major structures. The site has its own fire department, laundry and medical centre.

===Douglas Point, 1960–1984===

Encompassed by the Bruce site is the shut-down Douglas Point reactor, an earlier version of the CANDU design. Construction began in 1960; was operational in 1967; and was shut down in 1984. The present Bruce reactors &quot;each&quot; are roughly 4 times the capacity of the 200 MW Douglas Point unit.

===Bruce Heavy Water Plant, 1973–1997===

The Bruce Heavy Water Plant (BHWP) also occupied the site. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited contracted the Lummus Company of Canada Limited in 1969 to design and construct the first phase of the plant, while Ontario Hydro was responsible for commissioning and operating.

It was planned to consist of four sub-plants, A through D:
*A was in production in 1973, shutdown in 1984, and demolished in 1993;
*B was in production in 1979, partially shutdown in 1993, completely closed in 1997, and subsequently demolished;
*C was cancelled, and never built;
*D was 70% completed when cancelled, and subsequently demolished in 1995.

During its lifetime, BHWP produced 16,000 tonnes of reactor grade heavy water. Capacity of each sub-plant was planned to be 800 tonnes/annum. The plant size was approximately 960 m by 750 m. The heavy water was 99.75% pure.
The production of a single kilogram of heavy water required 340 tonnes of feed water.

===Bruce Bulk Steam System, 1972–2006===

Steam from Bruce A could be diverted to the Bruce Bulk Steam System (BBSS) to provide energy for the production of heavy water (750 MW thermal), to heat buildings within the development (15 MW th), or to provide energy (72 MW th) for the adjacent Bruce Energy Centre (BEC). The BEC supported industries such as greenhouses and plastic manufacturers. As one of the largest bulk steam systems in the world, this system could produce 5,350 MW of medium-pressure process steam, and had over 6 km of piping. It was demolished by the end of 2006. Because of the requirement to provide steam, the Bruce A turbines were undersized relative to the reactor power.

===Inverhuron Provincial Park, 1950–present===

OPG owns the nearby 288 ha Inverhuron Provincial Park on Lake Huron, bordering Inverhuron, 14 km north-east of Kincardine, which is not part of the Bruce site proper, and leases it to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. As a condition of the operating licence for Bruce Nuclear, OPG retained a 914 m radius exclusion zone in the northwest corner of the park. After operating over 25 years the park campground was phased out in 1976, because of safety concerns related to the heavy water production. When heavy water was no longer produced, the park campground was allowed to re-open in 2000 on the same spot.

The heated water released back into Lake Huron by the plant prevents the surrounding shoreline from freezing over during winter and attracts an inordinate concentration of lake fish, which in turn attracts droves of bald eagles wintering in the area. Numbers peak around late February to early March and it is not uncommon for visitors to observe several dozen eagles in and around the general vicinity of the plant at any given time during these months.

==Security and safety==

In 1977, three Greenpeace activists canoed into the site to demonstrate the lack of security.
On 23 September 2001, the plant suffered another PR blow when a man whose boat capsized on Lake Huron near the Bruce complex squeezed through a gate, entered an office building and phoned for help—all undetected.

Before the 2001 September 11 attacks, mandate of the security team was to delay attackers for 17 minutes, until local police could respond. Reliance was on passive measures such as fencing and locks.
The &quot;transformed&quot; post-9/11 security team is described as being larger than the police force of the city of Kingston, i.e. equivalent to the force of a city of 100,000. Force members are permitted to carry firearms, and have powers of arrest. The force possesses armoured vehicles, water craft, and the plant is now triple-fenced.
In May 2008, the Bruce Nuclear Response Team (NRT) won the U.S. National SWAT Championship (USNSC), defeating 29 other teams from 4 countries, the first time a Canadian team won an international SWAT event. They won again in 2009, 2010, and 2011.
After 9/11, tours of the plant area were discontinued, although there is a visitor centre outside of the site.

According to the Bruce County emergency plan, &quot;The Municipality of Kincardine will coordinate the emergency response concerns of a nuclear emergency situation resulting from an accident at the Bruce Power Site in the Municipality of Kincardine&quot;. Kincardine is required to maintain a warning system within 3 km of the plant, and has a network of 10 warning stations equipped with sirens and strobes.

A variety of radiation monitoring measures are in place. Milk samples from local farms are collected weekly. Drinking water at treatment plants in Kincardine and Southampton is sampled twice daily, and tested weekly. Ground water is sampled from several surface water, shallow and deep well locations. Aquatic sediment and fish are analysed, as well as livestock feed, honey, eggs, fruits and vegetables.

==Reactor data==
The Bruce Generating Station consist of 8 operational reactors.

<doc id="937766" wikidata="Q75771164" url="?curid=937766" title="Gliese 570">
<text>Gliese 570 (or 33 G. Librae) is a quaternary star system approximately 19 light-years away. The primary star is an orange dwarf star (much dimmer and smaller than the Sun). The other secondary stars are themselves a binary system, two red dwarfs that orbit the primary star. A brown dwarf has been confirmed to be orbiting in the system. In 1998, an extrasolar planet was thought to orbit the primary star, but it was discounted in 2000.

==Distance and visibility==
In the night sky, the Gliese 570 system lies in the southwestern part of Libra. The system is southwest of Alpha Librae and northwest of Sigma Librae. In the early 1990s, the European Hipparcos mission measured the parallax of components B and C, suggesting that the system was at a distance of 24.4 light-years from the Sun. This, however, was a relatively large error as Earth-based parallax and orbit observations suggest that the two stars are actually part of a system with Gliese 570 A, and must actually lie at the same distance.

==Star system==
The primary star of the system (component A) is an orange dwarf star that may just have over three fourths the mass of the Sun, about 77 percent of its radius, and only 15.6 percent of its visual luminosity. It has a separation of 190 astronomical units from the binary components B and C, moving in an eccentric orbit that takes at least 2130 years to complete. Gliese 570 A is spectral type K4V and emits X-rays. Radial velocities of the primary obtained in the course of an extrasolar planet search at Lick Observatory show a linear trend probably due to the orbital motion of the Gliese 570 BC system around the primary.

A binary system in their own right, components B and C are both rather dim red dwarf stars that have less mass, radius, and luminosity than the Sun. Component B is spectral type M1V, component C is spectral type M3V, and both emit X-rays.
On January 15, 2000, astronomers announced that they had found one of the coolest brown dwarfs then known. Catalogued as Gliese 570 D, it was observed at a wide separation of more than 1,500 astronomical unit from the triple star system. It has an estimated mass of 50 times that of Jupiter.

The status of Gliese 570 D as a brown dwarf was confirmed by Doppler spectroscopy at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile. The surface temperature of this substellar object was found to be a relatively cool 500 degrees Celsius, making it cooler and less luminous than any other then-known brown dwarf (including the prototype &quot;T&quot; dwarf), and classifying the object as a T7-8V brown dwarf. No X-rays have been reported from this brown dwarf.

==Search for planets==
In 1998, an extrasolar planet was announced to orbit the primary star within the Gliese 570 system. The planet, identified as &quot;Gliese 570 Ab&quot;, was considered doubtful and the claim was retracted in 2000. No extrasolar planets have been confirmed to exist in this multiple star system thus far.

<text>Geebung is a suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Geebung had a population of 4,850 people.

== Geography ==
The suburb is centred on its railway station on the Caboolture railway line.

== History ==
The suburb takes its name from its railway station, which in turn was named after the fruit of the plant Persoonia media, known as &quot;jibung&quot; in the Dharuk language.

The Geebung Baptist church was initiated with a stump capping ceremony on Saturday 7 February 1925, prior to this services had been held in the war memorial hall. On Saturday 14 February 1925, the church was opened in a ceremony attended by 150 people. It was made of weatherboard and could seat about 100 people. The church (including fencing, the organ, the seating etc.) cost having spent for the land. A new church was built in 1969. In May 2012 the Geebung Baptist congregation merged with the Sandgate Baptist congregation, selling their existing churches and establishing a new church, Connect Baptist Church at Deagon. In August 2013, the Geebung Baptist church was purchased by the Tonga Houʻeiki Church for $1.5 million, although the decision to purchase was controversial within the Tongan congregation.

During World War II, the southern piece of Geebung was host to the Chermside Army Camp, which occupied land that includes part of the present day Marchant Park. Two years after the war, ISAS (Industrial Sales and Service) assembled war surplus Nissen huts for their business on Robinson Road in north Geebung. In 1949, the Brisbane City Council zoned that territory for general industry.

Geebung State School opened on 27 January 1953.

Geebung Methodist Church opened in 1955 at 38 Railway Parade (corner of Bayview Terrace, ). In 1977, it became part of the Uniting Church in Australia, following the amalgamation of many Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches. A new Geebung Uniting Church was opened in Simla Avenue on 1 October 1983 by the Moderator of the Queensland Uniting Church, Lewis Born. The 1955 church building is still extant and, as at 2021, is occupied by the Endeavour Foundation which provides disability support services.

St Kevin&#x27;s Catholic Church opened at 251 Newman Road opened on 6 May 1962.

On Saturday 28 September 1963, Archbishop Philip Strong laid the foundation stone for St Mary the Virgin Anglican Church at 44-46 Innes Street (). The church was officially opened and dedicated on 16 November 1963 by Archbishop Strong and consecrated on 24 March 1974 by Archbishop Felix Arnott. Its closure on 23 July 2000 was approved by Assistant Bishop Appleby. As at September 2020, it is used as a residence.

St Kevin&#x27;s Catholic Primary School opened in January 1964.

The R H Kirkley Education Centre opened on 21 May 1979 was opened as a school for students requiring significant educational support due to intellectual and other disabilities. It was later renamed R H. Kirkley Special School and then Geebung Special School on 1 January 1986.

In 2013, there was a significant fossil discovery. The fossils were the remains of a rare 50-million-year-old crocodile-like species and several other animals.

Geebung railway station underwent a significant upgrade in 2014, with the construction of a new road bridge replacing the previous level crossing.

<text>Eta Cassiopeiae (η Cassiopeiae, abbreviated Eta Cas, η Cas) is a binary star system in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia. Its binary nature was first discovered by William Herschel in August 1779. Based upon parallax measurements, the distance to this system is from the Sun. The two components are designated Eta Cassiopeiae A (officially named Achird ) and B.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;η Cassiopeiae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Eta Cassiopeiae&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as &quot;Eta Cassiopeiae A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The proper name &quot;Achird&quot; was apparently first applied to Eta Cassiopeiae in the Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens published in 1950, but is not known prior to that. Richard Hinckley Allen gives no historical names for the star in his book &quot;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning&quot;. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name &quot;Achird&quot; for the component Eta Cassiopeiae A on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In Chinese astronomy, Eta Cassiopeiae is within the Legs mansion, and is part of the () asterism named for a famous charioteer during the Spring and Autumn period. The other components are Beta Cassiopeiae (Caph), Kappa Cassiopeiae, Alpha Cassiopeiae (Schedar) and Lambda Cassiopeiae. Consequently, the Chinese name for Eta Cassiopeiae itself is (, ).

== Properties ==

Eta Cassiopeiae&#x27;s two components are orbiting around each other over a period of 480 years. Based on an estimated semi-major axis of 12″ and a parallax of 0.168″, the two stars are separated by an average distance of , where an AU is the average distance between the Sun and the Earth. However, the large orbital eccentricity of 0.497 means that their periapsis, or closest approach, is as small as 36 AU, with an apoapsis of about 106 AU. For comparison, the semi-major axis of Neptune is 30 AU.

There are six dimmer optical components listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog. However, none of them are related to the Eta Cassiopeiae system and are in reality more distant stars. The primary has been reported to be a spectroscopic binary, but this has never been confirmed.

Eta Cassiopeiae A has a stellar classification of G0 V, which makes it a G-type main-sequence star like the Sun. It therefore resembles what the Sun might look like were humans to observe it from Eta Cassiopeiae. The star has 97% of the mass of the Sun and 100% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. It is of apparent magnitude 3.44, radiating 129% of the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of . It appears to be rotating at a leisurely rate, with a projected rotational velocity of .

The cooler and dimmer (magnitude 7.51) Eta Cassiopeiae B is of stellar classification K7 V; a K-type main-sequence star. It has only 57% of the mass of the Sun and 66% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. Smaller stars generate energy more slowly, so this component radiates only 6% of the luminosity of the Sun. Its outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 4,036 K.

Compared to the Sun, both components show only half the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium—what astronomers term their metallicity.

A necessary condition for the existence of a planet in this system are stable zones where the object can remain in orbit for long intervals. For hypothetical planets in a circular orbit around the individual members of this star system, this maximum orbital radius is computed to be 9.5 AU for the primary and 7.1 AU for the secondary. (Note that the orbit of Mars is 1.5 AU from the Sun.) A planet orbiting outside of both stars would need to be at least 235 AU distant.

<text>Losenstein is a small village in the south of Upper Austria, Austria. About 1,700 inhabitants call Losenstein their home.
It lies in the southernmost quarter of Upper Austria called &quot;Traunviertel&quot;. Its spatial dimension from North to South is 8,1 km, from West to East 4,5 km. 45,9% of its area are covered by forests, another 39,7% are used for agricultural purposes. The closest city of administrative importance is Steyr, which is 20 km to North. It can be accessed via the &quot;B-109 Eisenbundesstrasse&quot; or by train.

Losenstein is the birthplace of the famous dialect poet Anton Schosser (1801–1849). One of his most known songs is the Erzherzog-Johann-Jodler &quot;Wo i geh und steh&quot;.

The village is sometimes referred to as the gem of the Enns-valley (&quot;Die Perle des Ennstales&quot;). The river Enns divides the village and can be crossed on a bridge, connecting the village centre with the residential areas. The highest mountain is called &quot;Schieferstein&quot; and is located in the south-east of the village.

==Ruins of Losenstein==

The ruins of the former castle of Losenstein originate in the 12th century. They used to be one of the biggest and oldest castles of Upper Austria. The rock on which the ruins sit lies at the very core of the village center.

The former ski resort &quot;Hohe Dirn&quot;, which is located at the border of Losenstein and &quot;Reichraming&quot; at the south-west of the village, is easily accessible by a well-maintained road (10min from the village centre). It is well known for its variety of leisure activities in the summer and winter.

The recent development policies were focused on attracting highly-technical industrial and chemical firms, providing sophisticated job opportunities for inhabitants and commuters from nearby villages.

<text>André Hubert Dumont (15 February 180928 February 1857) was a Belgian geologist.
Dumont was born in Liège, Belgium. His first work was a masterly &quot;Mémoire&quot; on the geology of the province of Liège published in 1832. A few years later he became a professor of mineralogy and geology and afterwards Rector of the University of Liège. He subsequently turned his attention to the mineralogical and stratigraphical description of the geological formations in Belgium. The names given by him to many subdivisions of the Cretaceous and Tertiary have been adopted.

His &quot;Mémoire sur les terrains ardennais et rhénan de l&#x27;Ardenne, du Brabant et du Condroz&quot; (1847–1848) is notable for the care with which the mineralogy of the strata was described, but the palaeontological characterization was insufficient, and neither did he adopt the terms Silurian or Devonian.
During twenty years he laboured on a geological map of Belgium (1849). He spared no pains to make his work as complete as possible, examining—on foot—almost every area of importance in the country. Journeying to the more southern parts of Europe, he investigated the shores of the Bosphorus, the mountains of Spain and other regions, thereby collecting material for his geological map of Europe. This latter work of outstanding scholarship was one of the first serious attempts to establish the regional-scale geological correlation between the various countries of Europe. After his death, his geological map was updated by Gustave Dewalque, the successor to his professorial chair.

The Geological Society of London awarded Dumont in 1840 the Wollaston medal. He died in Liège.

His son, also André Dumont (1847–1920), discovered coal in the Campine basin on 1 August 1901.

<text>Juan Croucier (born August 22, 1959) is a Cuban-born American musician. He is best known as the bassist for the hard rock/glam metal band Ratt.

== Career ==
Croucier attended Torrance High School in Torrance, California, and played in various bands. He began playing original songs in his bands, and joined a band called Spike by age 16 that was strictly playing originals. In 1977 he started a new band called FireFoxx along with Ron Abrams on guitar and Bobby Blotzer on drums (who likewise attended Torrance High School and would later also become a key member of Ratt). Croucier played with Quiet Riot shortly before Randy Rhoads left to play with Ozzy Osbourne, and played with DuBrow in 1981, although he did not record with either. Before he left DuBrow, Croucier introduced band leader Kevin DuBrow to Frankie Banali. They went on to form a new version of Quiet Riot, resulting in the debut record &quot;Metal Health&quot;.

Croucier played with Dokken for about four years (ca. 1979-1983) and toured Germany with the band several times. He played and sang backup on Dokken&#x27;s 1979 EP &quot;Back in the Streets&quot; and their 1981 LP, &quot;Breaking the Chains&quot;, for which he co-wrote two songs. His replacement, Jeff Pilson, appears in the title track video from the album.

For approximately 18 months, Croucier was a member of both Ratt and Dokken simultaneously, before leaving Dokken.

Croucier played in Ratt for the remainder of the decade, and the four LPs they released in the 1980s all went platinum. Croucier wrote many of Ratt&#x27;s biggest hits such as &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re in Love,&quot; and his backing vocals became a trademark part of the band&#x27;s sound. 

Croucier formed a new band Liquid Sunday in 1997, a project based on his solo album of the same name. Croucier sings and plays bass and guitar on the album; his brother Rick plays drums on the album as well. &quot;Liquid Sunday&quot; played on the same bill for one show with Pearcy during the summer of 2006 and later formed a new band called Dirty Rats, consisting of Croucier on bass and lead vocals, Carlos Cavazo on guitar, and John Medina on drums.

<doc id="937796" wikidata="Q1064415" url="?curid=937796" title="Charles Fox Parham">
<text>Charles Fox Parham (June 4, 1873 – January 29, 1929) was an American preacher and evangelist. Together with William J. Seymour, Parham was one of the two central figures in the development and initial spread of early Pentecostalism, known as Holiness Pentecostalism. It was Parham who associated glossolalia with the baptism in the Holy Spirit, a theological connection crucial to the emergence of Pentecostalism as a distinct movement. Parham was the first preacher to articulate Pentecostalism&#x27;s distinctive doctrine of evidential tongues, and to expand the movement.

==Personal life==
Parham, one of five sons of William and Ann Parham, was born in Muscatine, Iowa, on June 4, 1873, and moved with his family to Cheney, Kansas, by covered wagon in 1878. William Parham owned land, raised cattle, and eventually purchased a business in town. Parham&#x27;s mother died in 1885. The next year his father married Harriet Miller, the daughter of a Methodist circuit rider. Harriet was a devout Christian, and the Parhams opened their home for &quot;religious activities&quot;. Charles married Sarah Thistlewaite, the daughter of a Quaker. Their engagement was in summer of 1896, and they were married December 31, 1896, in a Friends&#x27; ceremony.

==Ministry==

===Early ministry===
Parham began conducting his first religious services at the age of 15. In 1890, he enrolled at Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas, a Methodist affiliated school. He attended until 1893 when he came to believe education would prevent him from ministering effectively. He then worked in the Methodist Episcopal Church as a supply pastor (he was never ordained). Parham left the Methodist church in 1895 because he disagreed with its hierarchy. He complained that Methodist preachers &quot;were not left to preach by direct inspiration&quot;. Rejecting denominations, he established his own itinerant evangelistic ministry, which preached the ideas of the Holiness movement and was well received by the people of Kansas.

===Topeka, Kansas===
Sometime after the birth of his son, Claude, in September 1897, both Parham and Claude fell ill. Attributing their subsequent recovery to divine intervention, Parham renounced all medical help and committed to preach divine healing and prayer for the sick. In 1898, Parham moved his headquarters to Topeka, Kansas, where he operated a mission and an office. It was also in Topeka that he established the Bethel Healing Home and published the &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; magazine. Parham operated on a &quot;faith&quot; basis. He did not receive offerings during services, preferring to pray for God to provide for the ministry.

Parham, &quot;deciding to know more fully the latest truths restored by the later day movements&quot;, took a sabbatical from his work at Topeka in 1900 and &quot;visited various movements&quot;. While he saw and looked at other teachings and models as he visited the other works, most of his time was spent at Shiloh, the ministry of Frank Sandford in Maine, and in an Ontario religious campaign of Sandford&#x27;s. From Parham&#x27;s later writings, it appears he incorporated some, but not all, of the ideas he observed into his view of Bible truths (which he later taught at his Bible schools). In addition to having an impact on what he taught, it appears he picked up his Bible school model, and other approaches, from Sandford&#x27;s work.

When he returned from this sabbatical, those left in charge of his healing home had taken over and, rather than fighting for control, Parham started Bethel Bible College at Topeka in October 1900. The school was modeled on Sandford&#x27;s &quot;Holy Ghost and Us Bible School&quot;, and Parham continued to operate on a faith basis, charging no tuition. He invited &quot;all ministers and Christians who were willing to forsake all, sell what they had, give it away, and enter the school for study and prayer&quot;. About 40 people (including dependents) responded. The only text book was the Bible, and the teacher was the Holy Spirit (with Parham as mouthpiece).

Prior to starting his Bible school, Parham had heard of at least one individual in Sandford&#x27;s work who spoke in tongues and had reprinted the incident in his paper. He had also come to the conclusion that there was more to a full baptism than others acknowledged at the time. By the end of 1900, Parham had led his students at Bethel Bible School through his understanding that there had to be a further experience with God, but had not specifically pointed them to speaking in tongues. While Parham&#x27;s account indicates that when classes were finished at the end of December, he left his students for a few days, asking them to study the Bible to determine what evidence was present when the early church received the Holy Spirit, this is not clear from the other accounts. The students had several days of prayer and worship, and held a New Year&#x27;s Eve watchnight service at Bethel (December 31, 1900). The next evening (January 1, 1901) they also held a worship service, and it was that evening that Agnes Ozman felt impressed to ask to be prayed for to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit. Immediately after being prayed for, she began to speak in what they referred to as &quot;in tongues&quot;, speaking in what was believed to be a known language.

===Christian Faith Movement===
Parham&#x27;s controversial beliefs and aggressive style made finding support for his school difficult; the local press ridiculed Parham&#x27;s Bible school calling it &quot;the Tower of Babel&quot;, and many of his former students called him a fake. By April 1901, Parham&#x27;s ministry had dissolved. It was not until 1903 that his fortunes improved when he preached on Christ&#x27;s healing power at El Dorado Springs, Missouri, a popular health resort. Mary Arthur, wife of a prominent citizen of Galena, Kansas, claimed she had been healed under Parham&#x27;s ministry. She and her husband invited Parham to preach his message in Galena, which he did through the winter of 1903–1904 in a warehouse seating hundreds. In January, the Joplin, Missouri, &quot;News Herald&quot; reported that 1,000 had been healed and 800 had claimed conversion. In the small mining towns of southwest Missouri and southeastern Kansas, Parham developed a strong following that would form the backbone of his movement for the rest of his life.

Out of the Galena meetings, Parham gathered a group of young coworkers who would travel from town to town in &quot;bands&quot; proclaiming the &quot;apostolic faith&quot;. Unlike other preachers with a holiness-oriented message, Parham encouraged his followers to dress stylishly so as to show the attractiveness of the Christian life. It was at this time in 1904 that the first frame church built specifically as a Pentecostal assembly was constructed in Keelville, Kansas. Other &quot;apostolic faith assemblies&quot; (Parham disliked designating local Christian bodies as &quot;churches&quot;) were begun in the Galena area. Parham&#x27;s movement soon spread throughout Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

During 1906 Parham began working on a number of fronts. In Houston, Parham&#x27;s ministry included conducting a Bible school around 1906. Several African Americans were influenced heavily by Parham&#x27;s ministry there, including William J. Seymour. Both Parham and Seymour preached to Houston&#x27;s African Americans, and Parham had planned to send Seymour out to preach to the black communities throughout Texas. In September he also ventured to Zion, IL, in an effort to win over the adherents of the discredited John Alexander Dowie, although he left for good after the municipal water tower collapsed and destroyed his preaching tent. For about a year he had a following of several hundred &quot;Parhamites&quot;, eventually led by John G Lake. In 1906, Parham sent Lucy Farrow (a black woman who was cook at his Houston school, who had received &quot;the Spirit&#x27;s Baptism&quot; and felt &quot;a burden for Los Angeles&quot;), to Los Angeles, California, along with funds, and a few months later sent Seymour to join Farrow in the work in Los Angeles, California, with funds from the school. Seymour&#x27;s work in Los Angeles would eventually develop into the Azusa Street Revival, which is considered by many as the birthplace of the Pentecostal movement. Seymour requested and received a license as a minister of Parham&#x27;s Apostolic Faith Movement, and he initially considered his work in Los Angeles under Parham&#x27;s authority. However, Seymour soon broke with Parham over his harsh criticism of the emotional worship at Azusa Street and the intermingling of whites and blacks in the services.

His commitment to racial segregation and his support of British Israelism have often led people to consider him as a racist. However, some have noted that Parham was the first to reach across racial lines to African Americans and Mexican Americans and included them in the young Pentecostal movement. He preached in black churches and invited Lucy Farrow, the black woman he sent to Los Angeles, to preach at the Houston &quot;Apostolic Faith Movement&quot; Camp Meeting in August 1906, at which he and W. Fay Carrothers were in charge. This incident is recounted by eyewitness Howard A. Goss in his wife&#x27;s book, &quot;The Winds of God,&quot; in which he states: &quot;Fresh from the revival in Los Angeles, Sister Lucy Farrow returned to attend this Camp Meeting. Although a Negro, she was received as a messenger from the Lord to us, even in the deep south of Texas.&quot; Nonetheless, Parham was a sympathizer for the Ku Klux Klan and even preached for them.

===Scandal and decline of influence===

Another blow to his influence in the young Pentecostal movement were allegations of sexual misconduct in fall 1906. This was followed by his arrest in 1907 in San Antonio, Texas on a charge of &quot;the commission of an unnatural offense,&quot; along with a 22-year-old co-defendant, J.J. Jourdan. Parham repeatedly denied being a practicing homosexual, but coverage was picked up by the press. Finally, the District Attorney decided to drop the case. Parham and his supporters insisted that the charges had been false, and were part of an attempt by Wilbur Voliva to frame him. Parham had previously stopped preaching at Voliva&#x27;s &quot;Zion City&quot; church in order to set up his &quot;Apostolic Faith Movement&quot;. However, Parham&#x27;s opponents used the episode to discredit both Parham and his religious movement. Posters with a supposed confession by Parham of sodomy were distributed to towns where he was preaching, years after the case against him was dropped. Parham was never able to recover from the stigma that had attached itself to his ministry, and his influence waned.

In addition there were allegations of financial irregularity and of doctrinal aberrations. In the aftermath of these events his large support base in Zion descended into a Salem-like frenzy of insanity, eventually killing three of their members in brutal exorcisms. Members of the group, who included John G Lake and Fred Bosworth, were forced to flee from Illinois, and scattered across America. As the focus of the movement moved from Parham to Seymour, Parham became resentful. His attacks on emerging leaders coupled with the allegations alienated him from much of the movement that he began. He became &quot;an embarrassment&quot; to a new movement which was trying to establish its credibility.

==Death==
As a boy, Parham had contracted a severe rheumatic fever which damaged his heart and contributed to his poor health. At one time he almost died. Parham recovered to an active preaching life, strongly believing that God was his healer. While he recovered from the rheumatic fever, it appears the disease probably weakened his heart muscles and was a contributing factor to his later heart problems and early death. By 1927 early symptoms of heart problems were beginning to appear, and by the fall and summer of 1928, after returning from a trip to British Mandate Palestine (which had been a lifetime desire), Parham&#x27;s health began to further deteriorate.

In early January 1929, Parham took a long car ride with two friends to Temple, Texas, where he was to be presenting his pictures of the Holy Land. On January 5, he collapsed while showing his slides. When his wife arrived, she found out that his heart was bad, and he was unable to eat. Against his wishes (he wanted to continue his preaching tour), his family brought him home to Baxter Springs, Kansas, where he died on the afternoon of January 29, 1929.

==Beliefs==
Parham&#x27;s beliefs developed over time. Several factors influenced his theological ideas. He preferred to work out doctrinal ideas in private meditation, he believed the Holy Spirit communicated with him directly, and he rejected established religious authority. He focused on &quot;salvation by faith; healing by faith; laying on of hands and prayer; sanctification by faith; coming (premillennial) of Christ; the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, which seals the bride and bestows the gifts&quot;.

===Initial evidence===
His most important theological contributions were his beliefs about the baptism with the Holy Spirit. There were Christians groups speaking in tongues and teaching an experience of Spirit baptism before 1901, like for example, in 17th century, the Camisards and the Quakers.

However, Parham was the first to identify tongues as the &quot;Bible evidence&quot; of Spirit baptism. It is not clear when he began to preach the need for such an experience, but it is clear that he did by 1900.

Initially, he understood the experience to have eschatological significance—it &quot;sealed the bride&quot; for the &quot;marriage supper of the Lamb&quot;. The bride of Christ consisted of 144,000 people taken from the church who would escape the horrors of the tribulation. It was Parham&#x27;s desire for assurance that he would be included in the rapture that led him to search for uniform evidence of Spirit baptism.

Later, Parham would emphasize speaking in tongues and evangelism, defining the purpose of Spirit baptism as an &quot;enduement with power for service&quot;. Parham believed that the tongues spoken by the baptized were actual human languages, eliminating the need for missionaries to learn foreign languages and thus aiding in the spread of the gospel. Some of Parham&#x27;s followers even traveled to foreign countries in hopes of using glossolalia to communicate with the locals without learning the local languages. But after consistent failed attempts at xenoglossia &quot;many of Parham&#x27;s followers became disillusioned and left the movement.&quot;

===Other beliefs===
Parham believed in annihilationism—that the wicked are not eternally tormented in hell but are destroyed. According to this belief, immortality is conditional, and only those who receive Christ as Lord and Savior will live eternally. He stated in 1902, &quot;Orthodoxy would cast this entire company into an eternal burning hell; but our God is a God of love and justice, and the flames will reach those only who are utterly reprobate&quot;. He also believed in British Israelism, an ideology maintaining that the Anglo-Saxon peoples were among the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. In addition, Parham subscribed to rather unorthodox views on creation. He believed God took two days to create humans—non-whites on the sixth day and whites on the eighth. Parham also supported Theodor Herzl and the struggle for a Jewish homeland, lecturing on the subject often.

Oneness Pentecostals would agree with Parham&#x27;s belief that Spirit baptized (with the evidence of an unknown tongue) Christians would be taken in the rapture. But his teachings on British Israelism and the annihilation of the wicked were vehemently rejected.

==Legacy==
Parham originated the doctrine of initial evidence—that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is evidenced by speaking in tongues. It was this doctrine that made Pentecostalism distinct from other holiness Christian groups that spoke in tongues or believed in an experience subsequent to salvation and sanctification. In a move criticized by Parham, his Apostolic Faith Movement merged with other Pentecostal groups in 1914 to form the General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America. Today, the worldwide Assemblies of God is the largest Pentecostal denomination. In 1916, the fourth general council of Assemblies of God met in St. Louis, MO to decide on the mode of baptism they would use. After a vote, out of approximately 430 ministers, 133 were asked to leave because the majority ruled they would maintain the Trinitarian formula of baptism as the official baptism of the Assemblies of God. This move formally sparked the creation of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, which would eventually create the United Pentecostal Church International and the Assemblies of the Lord Jesus Christ.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Latvia]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in the Saeima. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labelled themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
Latvia was one of the early post World War I nations which adopted some ideas from the 1919 Weimar Constitution. German liberal lawyer Hugo Preuß (Preuss) is often attributed as the author of the draft version of the constitution that was passed by the Weimar National Assembly, which historian William L. Shirer in a book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich regards as &quot;the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen ... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy.&quot;

In Latvia some early law experts such as Kārlis Dišlers, Fēlikss Cielēns and modern day jurists agree that Weimar Constitution was underlying the wording of the Constitution of Latvia (&quot;Satversme&quot;), and in some way is a synthesis between the Weimar Constitution and Westminster system used in the United Kingdom.

==History==
Liberalism in Latvia was a small but important force since 1922 in Latvia. The current regained position after the re-independence of 1990. The current major liberal party is the centre-right Unity, which is also a member of the alliance New Unity.

===German Baltic Democratic Party===
*1918: Moderate German liberals in Latvia formed the German-Baltic Democratic Party (&quot;Deutsch-Baltische Demokratische Partei/Vācbaltu demokrātiskā partija&quot;)

<text>Nyota (pronounced &quot;en-Yo-ta&quot;; born 1998), also known by the lexigram , is a bonobo. Nyota was born at the Language Research Center at Georgia State University. His mother was Panbanisha and his father was P-suke. With Panbanisha&#x27;s death on November 6, 2012, Nyota became the sole surviving member of his immediate family.

Nyota&#x27;s name means &#x27;star&#x27; in Lingala, a language from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa.
Nyota was reared by Panbanisha and Kanzi with primatologists Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and William M. Fields.

As a precocious youngster in 2004, Nyota is instrumental to researchers investigating the cross-generational effects of language and culture in a second-generation bonobo reared in a bi-cultural environment. On April 25, 2005, he, his brother Nathan (died May 15, 2009) and mother Panbanisha (died November 6, 2012) moved to the Great Ape Trust in Iowa. His father, P-suke (died July 7, 2006 in Iowa), uncle Kanzi, grandmother Matata, and other relatives were also moved to the Trust.

<text>Chobham is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Surrey Heath in Surrey, England.

The village has a small high street area, specialising in traditional trades and motor trades. The River Bourne and its northern tributary, the Hale, Mill Bourne or Windle Brook run through the village.

Chobham lost a large minority of its land to West End, in 1968, which has a larger population and was long associated with another parish. Chobham has a wide range of outlying businesses, particularly plant growing and selling businesses, science/technology and restaurants.

Chobham has no railway line; it is approximately midway between London-terminating services at Woking and Sunningdale, just under away. The village sits to the south of Chobham Common, a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==History==
Neolithic flints have been found and there are several round barrows on the heaths; such as the Bee Garden in rolling Albury Bottom, a scheduled monument and the &quot;Herestraet or Via Militaris&quot; of the Chertsey Charters ran through Chobham parish. In 1772 Roman silver coins of Gratian and of the time of a Valentinian, and copper coins of a Theodosius, Honorius, and another Valentinian, a spear-head and a gold ring, were found near Chobham Park in the parish.

The village lay within the Godley hundred, a Saxon administrative area.

Chobham appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Cebeham&quot; held by Chertsey Abbey, as it was at the time of the conquest, with interests also acquired by the time of its survey, 1086, by two minor Norman figures, possibly bishops, Corbelin and Odin. Its Domesday assets were: 10 hides; 1 church, 1 chapel, 16 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 130 hogs. It rendered £15 10s 0d per year. &quot;Chabbeham&quot; is the version written in Chertsey Charter, and &quot;Chabham&quot; was the version recorded in the 13th century Patent Rolls.

St Lawrence Church is on the High Street. Its earliest parts date from about 1080 although there may have been an earlier church on the site. It is dedicated to St Lawrence, who was martyred in Rome in 258.

Until the 19th century almost entirely surrounded by Chobham Common, which was heathland of little agricultural value compared to its central fertile belt, the village was isolated. During mediaeval times, Chobham remained part of the Chertsey Abbey estates. As across the whole hundred which he dominated, the power of the Abbot of Chertsey was considerable.

When the railways were built in the 19th century, lines running east–west went north and south of the village, passing through the neighbouring and at the time smaller villages of Sunningdale and Woking. Thus Chobham remained largely undeveloped during the Industrial Revolution and 20th century meanwhile Woking has grown into a large town on the South West Main Line. In the 19th century peat was cut from the soil all around the village, which provided a cheap and reliable fuel source for heat, smelting and cooking.

===Landmarks===
;Chobham Place or Manor
No property in the parish possessed as much land as a medieval manor would have had, since the dues of the whole parish before the English Reformation belonged to ecclesiastical landowners. However, some expansion in building and a modest amount of farming resulted from the presence of two lines of baronets: the Abdy baronets and Le Marchant baronets. The buildings and estate no longer survive.

John Cordrey, the last Abbot of Chertsey, surrendered the possessions of the Abbey to the crown in the reign of Henry VIII, and in July 1558, under Queen Mary I of England, the crown sold a parcel of land for £3,000 to Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor. The land was inclosed by a pale, whence it was called a park, and is marked as such in Norden and Speed&#x27;s map of 1610. This grant was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth, but as Heath was later deprived for refusing the statutory oaths, the nominal ownership was conveyed to his brother William in 1564. The former archbishop continued, however, to reside when his nephew Thomas forfeited his new lands in 1588. Later they were restored, and in 1606 sold to Francis Leigh. The Cope, Hale and Henn families held the lands until 1681. The Martin and Crawley families held them until the time when Mr Revel, M.P. 1734–52, is said to have been the owner. In 1758, his daughter and heiress married Sir George Warren, and in 1777 their daughter married Thomas Bulkeley, 7th Viscount Bulkeley. The latter died in 1822, leaving the land to Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet, after which now reduced in area, it was acquired by the Le Marchant baronets.

;Chobham House, Aden, or Ardern Manor
By 1911, Chobham House, which built in the 16th century as the home of minor local gentry, was only represented by a small farm-house. John Ardern held land in Chobham in 1331 and in 1540 this was held by John Danaster &#x27;seized of the manor&#x27;, baron of the Exchequer, his heiress daughter married a son of the wealthy Sir Edward Bray of Shere, a name later significant in local events and architecture.

;Vicarage

It was built in the Artisan Mannerist style and was mentioned as fine architecture in the &quot;History of Surrey&quot; in 1809 by Manning and Bray. In 1648 this house&#x27;s predecessor was the property of Edward Bray, a descendant of the Shiere family, who paid composition for his estate as a Royalist. It belonged to the manor of Aden (locally always pronounced Ardern) linked to Worplesdon but was not the manor house.

===Chobham armour===

Chobham became known for the development represented by its tank factory and testing ground, producing Chobham armour. The terrain was carved out of Chobham Common.

The largest sectors of employment were &quot;Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor Cycles&quot; and &quot;Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities&quot; at 15% and 11% of the population respectively. Construction, manufacturing, education and health or social work, closely compete for 8% of the labour force.

==Amenities==
The array of shops, repair garages, motor outlets and leisure services is diverse, however most international branded clothes shops and larger supermarkets are further afield. The following types of outlets are well-represented:

==Geography==

===Soil and elevation===
;Soil
The village and hamlets are chiefly on the gravel and alluvium of the stream beds, but the rest of the pre-1968 drawn parish of is on the Bagshot Sands (&#x27;Formation&#x27;), with extensive peat beds.

;Elevation
The Chobham Ridges rise to the west of West End to a long ridge which bounds Camberley, at , and Staple Hill to the north rises to .

The River Bourne and its northern tributary, the Hale, Mill Bourne or Windle Brook run through the village. These can flood small but well-developed parts of the village in extreme localised rainfall.

The rolling basin below reaches lowest elevations of between in the centre of the west and where the rivers join in the centre of the east. The rivers at the western point are less than apart; to the east end of the parish where the parish adjoins the landscape of the McLaren Technology Centre the rivers are finally merged along that boundary.

==Demography==
It is not accurate to compare pre 1961 and post-1971 sets of statistics due to different borders, excluding principally West End, Surrey but also other minor neighbourhoods, smaller than villages, which left the civil parish during that period.

In 2011 the population lived in 1,616 households compared to 20 fewer in 2001, however the population had declined by one, which contrasts with the increase in the historic, more heavily populated part of the parish which seceded in 1968 from Chobham. This involved , leaving Chobham with, in 2001, for example .

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Localities==

===Burrowhill===

Burrowhill the neighbourhood of the north of the village broken up from the village centre by Wishmore Cross School but is linked to it by two residential roads, one of which is a local through road from Chobham to Sunningdale. There is a Farrier at Chobham Forge, two pubs and two restaurants.

===Coxhill Green or Mimbridge===
This south-eastern semi-rural village has a network of single carriageway roads with many farms, and fewer homes than Burrowhill many of which amount to smallholdings. It is separated by a wider green buffer than the other localities and adjoins Horsell Common, which is a wooded and open space separating it from the well-developed and former village and suburb of Woking, Horsell which has a longer and wider parade of shops than Chobham. The southern boundary is the Bourne which rises in Bisley a few kilometres to the west well before it has merged with the larger Mill Bourne flowing from the north of the village and rising in Berkshire.

===Penny Pot, Broadford and Castle Green===
These south-western and southern lightly populated linear settlements are narrowly separated from the village centre by a farmed field.
Castle Green has overflowed along Guildford Road, which splits off from the old road to the Fellow Green part of West End, in the Borough of Woking.

===Valley End===
Most of the land of this northernmost hamlet lies north of the M3 motorway which bisects it and its church and main cluster of buildings is on the opposite side. Its church is currently described by the Church of England as &#x27;the church off the beaten track&#x27;. This is Grade II listed, built in 1867 from designs by G.F. Bodley and built in red and brown brick with stone dressed windows.

<text>Bowmanville is a town of approximately 40,000 people located in the Municipality of Clarington, Durham Region, Ontario, Canada. It is approximately east of Toronto, and east of Oshawa along Highway 2. Bowmanville was first incorporated as a town in 1858, but later incorporated with the neighbouring townships of Clarke and Darlington in 1974 forming the Town of Newcastle, which was renamed in 1994 to the Municipality of Clarington. Bowmanville is part of the Greater Toronto Area.

==History==
Settlers were attracted to the area by the farmland, and creeks for water mills. The lands which would later become Bowmanville were first purchased by John Burk, who began to clear the forest.

Mills were built first on Barber&#x27;s Creek (now called Bowmanville Creek), including one still standing, now called Vanstone&#x27;s Mill, at the present-day intersection of King Street and Scugog St. More mills were built on nearby Soper Creek, including another mill still standing as the municipality&#x27;s Visual Arts Centre which has been designated as an architecturally protected historical building.

Burke later sold his land to Lewis Lewis. Lewis opened the first store in what was then called Darlington Mills. The store was purchased in about 1824 by Charles Bowman (for whom the town was eventually named) who then established the first post office. Its first postmaster was Robert Fairbairn, who ran the post office from 1828 to 1857. Bowmanville incorporated as a town in 1858.

By 1866, Bowmanville was a town with a population of about 3,500 in the township of Darlington, County Durham. It was a station of the Grand Trunk Railway. It was established on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It possessed a good harbour and there was extensive water power in the vicinity. The surrounding country was fertile.

The success of the Vanstone Mill, fueled by the machinery of the Crown&#x27;s land grant program, led to the rapid expansion of the Bowmanville settlement in the early years of the 19th century. Under the generous yet discriminate eyes of wealthy local merchants such as John Simpson and Charles Bowman, small properties would often be sold to promote settlement and small business. The town soon developed a balanced economy; all the while gradually establishing itself as a moderate player in shipping, rail transport, metal works and common minor business (including tanneries, liveries, stables and everyday mercantile commodity exchange).

By the time of Confederation, Bowmanville was a vital, prosperous and growing town, home to a largely Scots-Presbyterian community with all manner of farmers, working, and professional class making the town their home. With local economic stability and accessible, abundant land available for the construction of housing, the town soon sported several new churches, each designated to house both Free and Auld Kirk, Anglican and Nonconformist congregations, including the Bible Christian Church, later to be a major stream of Canadian Methodism.

At present, St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church. St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, St. Paul&#x27;s United Church and the impressively ornate Trinity United Church (site of an old Auld Kirk church) still serve the community. All of these edifices, appropriately, lie on or are in close proximity to present-day Church Street.
In the 19th century, in 1857, the Ontario Bank was founded in Bowmanville, with local resident John Simpson as its first president. The bank, while appearing to be a local enterprise, was primarily controlled by 16 Montreal businessmen. The Ontario bank eventually opened local branches including locations in Whitby, Oshawa, and Port Hope. In 1874, it was moved to Toronto, and would later become insolvent as a result of investing in speculative stocks in 1906. The historic Ontario Bank building at the intersection of King and Temperance was demolished in 1971 

In 1884, Scottish immigrant John McKay opened the Cream of Barley Mill next to Soper Creek to manufacture a cereal of his own creation. &quot;Cream of Barley&quot; was shipped throughout the British Empire.

Local business organized and modernized in the 20th century, with the Dominion Organ and Piano factory, Specialty Paper Company, the Bowmanville Foundry, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (1910) all providing steady work for Bowmanville&#x27;s ever-growing working populations. Goodyear even went so far as to provide affordable housing for its employees, and present day Carlisle Ave. (built by Goodyear president W.C. Carlisle) in the 1910s still stands as one of Ontario&#x27;s best preserved examples of industrial housing. The land on which the Bowmanville Hospital was built was donated by J.W. Alexander, the owner of the then-prospering Dominion Organ and Piano factory.

Formal education evolved in-step with Ryersonian philosophies of the day, and the advent of the Central Public School (1889) and the Bowmanville High School (1890), (both designed by Whitby architect A.A. Post) were the finishing touches to the town that was a model of then-Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat&#x27;s philosophy of education, expansion and innovation for the citizens of the province.

The 20th century saw a steady rise in the construction of area schools, with Vincent Massey P.S. (1955); St. Joseph Catholic Elementary (1962, 2000 at present site); Waverly P.S. (1978); Dr. Ross Tilley P.S. (1993); St. Elizabeth Catholic Elementary (1998); John M. James P.S. (1999); Harold Longworth P.S. (2003); and Holy Family Catholic Elementary School (2007), all accommodating gradual population increases and building developments in specific demographic areas of the town. The local school board was amalgamated with neighboring jurisdictions to form the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board in 1997. The Catholic schools are part of the Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board which had already merged four counties in 1969 (at that time it was named the Peterborough, Victoria, Northumberland and Durham Separate School Board).

As the town grew and prospered, so arrived Bowmanville&#x27;s grand era of architectural building and refinement. Many excellently maintained specimens of Italianate, Gothic Revival, Colonial Brick and Queen Anne architecture remain in Bowmanville&#x27;s older central neighborhoods. Much of Bowmanville&#x27;s residential and commercial architectural heritage was either lost or threatened by demolition and modern development from 1950 to 1980, but a 25-year renaissance in appreciation and awareness (led largely by local historians and LACAC members) helped to preserve the precious remnants of days gone by.

Bowmanville was incorporated as a village in 1852 and as a town in 1858. In 1974, the town was amalgamated with neighbouring Clarke Township and Darlington Township to form the Town of Newcastle which in turn was renamed the Municipality of Clarington in 1994.

Subdivided housing developments first arrived in the 1950s, with a significant increase in housing development through the 1980s and 1990s. The population rose to about 10,000 in the 1970s, about 20,000 in the 1980s, about 25,000 in the 1990s and today is about 35,000. Transportation improvements in the 1980s included a widening of Highway 401 (first built through Bowmanville in 1952) to six lanes and of Highway 2 to 4/5 lanes. Many have referred to this as the &quot;Lane Era&quot; of Bowmanville.

===Prisoner of war camp===

Camp 30, the Lake Ontario Officers&#x27; Camp-Bowmanville, held captive German army officers from the Afrika Korps, Luftwaffe aircrew and naval officers from the Kriegsmarine. Farms surrounded the camp that had been a delinquent boys&#x27; school prior to the war. In several accounts by former prisoners of war (POWs), the prison was represented as very humane, in that the prisoners were well treated and well fed.

Among the German officers transferred from England to Bowmanville was Korvettenkapitän Otto Kretschmer, who was the top U-boat ace of World War II. Kretschmer assumed the duties of the senior naval officer, sharing the command with the senior Luftwaffe officer Oberstleutnant Hans Hefele and the senior army officer General Leutnant Hans von Ravenstein.

The Bowmanville boys&#x27; school had been quickly turned into a POW camp by surrounding the existing school buildings with a barbed wire fence. The facility, which had been designed to house 300 boys, was cramped and undersized for grown men. Two fences with electric lights every twelve feet and nine guard towers surrounded the site. The fence had sixty miles of barbed wire looped around the small perimeter. Lieutenant Colonel R.O. Bull M.C. had a support staff plus the Veterans Guard of Canada, consisting of nine officers and 239 other ranks under his command to guard the prisoners.

When the naval prisoners arrived at Bowmanville, there were no recreational facilities. The naval officers quickly transformed the camp. Flower and vegetable gardens were planted, sports fields, tennis courts and a swimming pool were built. The quarters were expanded, giving the prisoners better living conditions. The prisoners received money from home or earned extra money by manufacturing wooden furniture. They were able to purchase beer, cigarettes and dry goods from Eaton&#x27;s mail order catalogue. It was an ideal life except that there were no women and no freedom. For some there was the urge to get back to the war and defend their country, and for others a desire to remain POWs for the duration of the war.

A daily routine of exercise, sporting events and work assignments was established. As well as English being taught, professors from the nearby University of Toronto gave lectures for university credit classes. A school was also formed, which taught midshipmen seamanship and navigation courses.

Current movies were shown each week. National and religious holidays were observed, and music concerts were given regularly. Elaborate stage plays were produced. Extraordinary puppets were designed and fabricated for puppet shows. Although the conditions were good in the Canadian POW camps, there was very little to do, and the routine was always the same.

===Battle of Bowmanville===

In October 1942, in a prisoner of war uprising known as the Battle of Bowmanville, between 150 and 400 mostly German prisoners revolted against the guards at Camp 30 after they were shackled as retribution as part of the escalation of Germany&#x27;s new Commando Order. 

Lt.Col. James Taylor had asked German senior officer Georg Friemel to supply 100 prisoners to volunteer to be shackled as part of the ongoing international dispute. When he refused, Otto Kretschmer and Hans Hefele were also asked to provide volunteers, but refused.

Taylor ordered the guards to find 100 officers to be shackled by force, and Horst Elfe, Kretschmer and others barricaded themselves in the mess hall, arming themselves with sticks, iron bars and other makeshift weapons. Approximately 100 Canadian soldiers requisitioned from another base arrived, and together stormed the mess hall using only baseball bats, so the two sides remained evenly matched. After several hours of brawling, the Canadians brought high pressure water hoses and soaked the cabin thoroughly until the prisoners agreed to come out peacefully.

During later incidents in the battle which spanned several days, Volkmar König was wounded by gunfire and another bayoneted, and a Canadian soldier suffered a skull fracture from a thrown jar of jam. After calm had returned, 126 of the prisoners were transferred to other camps.

==Geography==
Bowmanville is surrounded by rural areas on three sides, and Lake Ontario to the south. Farmland formerly covered central Bowmanville until the population increased, thus establishing a nascent downtown core by the early 19th century. There is a harbour to the south of Bowmanville in Port Darlington.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification Bowmanville has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. Unlike many other locations on similar latitudes on the eastern half of the North American continent the winters are relatively mild, with cold extremes being moderated by the proximity to Lake Ontario. In spite of this the average low is around in January. Summers are normally moderately warm with averages of around during the day but with nights cooling off rapidly to fall below on many occasions.

==Economy==
Starting in the 19th century, Bowmanville has served as the home of many diverse manufacturers including the historic Bowmanville Foundry, the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police regional office, Goodyear conveyor belt factory (recently sold). There is a marina on Lake Ontario at Port Darlington, south of town. Bowmanville was a finalist for the ITER project. Southern Ontario&#x27;s GO Train commuter rail service is to be expanded to Bowmanville by 2024. This will increase the efficiency of public transportation to nearby cities such as Oshawa, and beyond. Currently, Darlington Nuclear Generating Station is the largest employer in Bowmanville.

In 2017, Toyota Canada Inc., announced plans to open a new parts distribution site, known as &quot;Eastern Canada Parts Distribution Centre&quot;, to replace the current plant in Toronto, Ontario, at the intersection of Lambs Road and Baseline Road. Toyota also plans to add a new nature trail known as the &quot;Toyota Trail&quot; that will connect the Soper Creek Trail to the new plant. The facility is planned to open in 2019.

An outlet mall was planned to be built in Bowmanville near the Highway 401/Waverley Road interchange, but the company abandoned the project shortly thereafter due to &quot;cost prohibitive complexities&quot;.

On June 10, 2019 it was announced that Ontario Power Generation would have its corporate headquarters relocated next to the Darlington Energy Complex.

The Bowmanville Eagles were the most recent local hockey team to play in Bowmanville, but were merged with the nearby Cobourg Cougars in early 2010 by the CCHL and OJHL.

The Bowmanville Eagles were reborn in 2011. The hockey team was admitted as a Junior C Hockey Club playing in the Central Ontario Junior C League. The Eagles were a Junior C team in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Eagles applied and were accepted to the Junior A level in 1995. The Eagles were a powerhouse team in the 1980s winning the Charles Schmalz Cup (Provincial Jr C Championship) in 1982. They won the Central Ontario Championships in 1981, 82, 84, 85, 92, 93 and 94.

In their final season as a Jr. C team before moving to Jr. A, the Eagles went to the Schmalz Cup Final. The Eagles did not have success at the Jr A level until approximately 2004. They had moderate success from there until 2010. The Jr. A league decided it needed to contract some clubs and unfortunately the Eagles were one of the clubs on the contraction list.

In their inaugural season back as a Junior C club, the Eagles won the Central Ontario League Championship. The Eagles won playoff rounds over Uxbridge, Little Britain and Lakefield. In the Provincial round of the playoffs the Eagles went up against the Campbellford Rebels of the Empire Jr C league where they lost out in seven games.

<text>Heavy is a 1995 American independent drama film written and directed by James Mangold, in his directorial debut. It stars Liv Tyler, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Shelley Winters, and Deborah Harry. The plot focuses on an unhappy overweight cook (Vince) whose life is changed after an enchanting college drop-out (Tyler) begins working as a waitress at his and his mother&#x27;s roadside tavern. The film explores themes of loneliness, false hope, unrequited love, and self-worth.

Mangold wrote the screenplay for &quot;Heavy&quot; while attending filmmaking seminars at Columbia University and partly based it on real people he knew while growing up in Upstate New York. Filming took place on location in and around Barryville and Hyde Park in 1993; some scenes were filmed at the Culinary Institute of America&#x27;s campus there. The film features an original soundtrack by Thurston Moore, as well as songs by Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, who also has a minor role in the film.

&quot;Heavy&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize and was later screened at Cannes where it competed for the Caméra d&#x27;Or. The film received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on December 29, 1995, and later had a limited release in the United States on June 5, 1996.

==Plot==
In rural Upstate New York, 30-something Victor Modino works as a cook at Pete and Dolly&#x27;s, a small roadhouse founded by and named after his now-deceased father and elderly mother. Dolly, who is in poor health, spends her days sitting in a chair in the back of the kitchen, reminiscing about her late husband Pete and antagonizing Delores, a cynical longtime employee who once had an affair with him. The daily rhythm of the restaurant is disrupted when Dolly hires a new waitress, Callie, a soft-spoken young woman who has just dropped out of college in Syracuse. Callie immediately catches the eye of the painfully shy, overweight Victor. Delores takes Dolly&#x27;s hiring of the beautiful but inexperienced Callie as a personal slight to herself and treats Callie coldly.

During working hours, Callie is impervious to Victor&#x27;s debilitating shyness and attempts to get to know him better. Impressed by Victor&#x27;s cooking skills, Callie suggests he attend the nearby Culinary Institute of America, which is considered by Victor but swiftly dismissed by both Dolly and Delores. Victor quickly becomes enamored of Callie and begins dieting and subtly trying to gain her attention, despite learning she has a steady boyfriend.

Dolly suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. Victor tells Delores and Callie that Dolly is having minor surgery. Several days later, Dolly dies while Victor is eating lunch in the hospital cafeteria. The grieving Victor does not tell anyone of her death, but runs the restaurant as usual, and deals with his grief by binge eating. Delores soon becomes suspicious about Dolly&#x27;s extended absence and also makes sexual advances towards Victor, which he rejects.

One night at the restaurant, Callie argues with her boyfriend Jeff and then in her anger tells off Delores in front of the customers. Delores&#x27; alcoholic friend Leo later assaults Victor for not taking Delores&#x27; side. Callie is left stranded at the restaurant and Victor drives her home, stopping en route so they can watch airplanes descend at an airfield. As they watch the airplanes, Callie becomes emotional over her lack of direction in life, and she and Victor end up kissing, but Callie quickly ends the encounter.

Callie asks Victor to take her to visit Dolly in the hospital, and unable to confess that Dolly is dead, he agrees. The next morning, Callie arrives at Victor&#x27;s house to accompany him to the hospital, but instead Victor drives her to the local cemetery and shows her Dolly&#x27;s fresh grave. Callie becomes hysterical and later fails to turn up for her restaurant shifts. Leo and Delores find out, via a hospital employee, that Dolly died weeks ago and berate Victor for not telling them, then depart together, leaving Victor alone in the restaurant. In his rage and grief, Victor smashes items behind the counter. Later that evening, Callie arrives with Jeff to tell Victor she&#x27;s quitting and to collect her final paycheck. She spends a few minutes alone with Victor, explaining that she plans to go back to college, but promising to come back and visit him sometime.

In the final scenes, Victor begins to emerge from his grief over Dolly&#x27;s death. He stops binge eating, starts cleaning up the kitchen which he has neglected, and even musters the confidence to chat with Darlene, an attractive cashier at the local grocery market who also shows an interest in him.

==Production==
===Conception===
&quot;Heavy&quot; was director James Mangold&#x27;s directorial debut, as well as his first solo screenplay. According to Mangold, who grew up in the Hudson River Valley, he was inspired by a real-life classmate of his who was overweight and whose mother owned a local diner; like in the film, the father had died, leaving the mother and son to run the restaurant themselves. In directing his first feature, Mangold aspired to make a film stripped of &quot;a certain Hollywood aesthetic,&quot; that followed a character who seemed a &quot;most unlikely centerpiece of a motion picture.&quot;

Mangold wrote the script for the film in 1991 while attending filmmaking seminars at Columbia University under the instruction of director Miloš Forman. In making the movie, Mangold was very focused on expression versus dialogue, especially in the character of Victor; Mangold stated that he was striving to create a &quot;silent film, with sound.&quot; Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971) and Martin Ritt&#x27;s &quot;Hud&quot; (1963) served as specific influences.

===Casting===
Mangold met Liv Tyler when she was sixteen years old; Tyler had little to no acting history but expressed great interest in it. She had been doing modeling work at the time and was cast in the film &quot;without hesitation&quot; after a brief video audition with Mangold. Through Tyler, Mangold got in touch with Deborah Harry, who was well acquainted with young Tyler through the &quot;rock and roll&quot; scene in New York (Tyler being the daughter of Aerosmith front man Steven Tyler); this resulted in Harry&#x27;s casting as the part of the weathered, bad-mouthing Delores. Evan Dando of The Lemonheads was cast as Tyler&#x27;s guitarist boyfriend because of Mangold&#x27;s admiration for his music and in hopes of bringing some star attention to the low-budget production.

Pixies frontman Black Francis was originally meant to be cast in the role of Victor but did not feel it was right for a debut acting role. In casting the part of Dolly, Mangold sought golden age Hollywood actress Shelley Winters, who was in her mid-70s at the time. Mangold tracked down the address to her Manhattan apartment and sent her the film script along with a letter stating his admiration of her work. Within two days, Winters replied to Mangold and was subsequently cast.

The last person to be cast was Pruitt Taylor Vince, as Mangold had been having trouble finding an actor to portray the &quot;centerpiece&quot; character. An associate producer/friend of Mangold, who had been shooting &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1994) with Vince alongside Paul Newman, suggested him. After Vince was cast, Mangold and the crew began feeding Vince doughnuts and Kentucky Fried Chicken in order for the actor, who was not remarkably overweight at the time, to rapidly gain weight before filming commenced.

==Release==
&quot;Heavy&quot; premiered in January 1995 at the Sundance Film Festival, where Mangold won the Special Jury Prize for directing. It subsequently screened at the Cannes Film Festival Directors Fortnight, where it was nominated for the Caméra d&#x27;Or award.

===Box office===
Distributor Cinépix Film Properties released &quot;Heavy&quot; theatrically in the United States after Liv Tyler had received recognition for her starring role in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot; (1996). The film opened in the United States in the summer of 1996, premiering it in New York City on June 5, earning $14,425 during its opening weekend. It premiered in Los Angeles on June 28, 1996. The release was limited, expanding to only 22 screens nationwide. The film concluded its domestic theatrical run on November 28, 1996, with a total box office gross of $941,414.

===Critical response===
Following the film&#x27;s success at Sundance, it garnered generally positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and remarked about its sense of realism: &quot;You&#x27;ve been in places like this. You linger over a second cup of coffee and people-watch, trying to guess the secrets of the sad-eyed waitress and the drunk at the bar and the pizza cook who looks like he&#x27;s serving a sentence. You don&#x27;t guess the true horror of the place, which is that there are no secrets, because everyone here knows all about everyone else, inside and out, top to bottom, and has for years.&quot; A decade later, Ebert — reviewing Mangold&#x27;s 2007 remake of &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; — called &quot;Heavy&quot; &quot;extraordinary.&quot;

Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised the film as a &quot;small gem [that] specifies a world and populates it with unerring authority and a sure instinct for character.&quot; The &quot;Statesman Journal&quot;″s Ron Cowan similarly lauded the film for its deliberate lack of dialogue, stating that Mangold &quot;often eschews&quot; it, &quot;detailing his story with gestures, glances, and touches. There is no sex, violence, or clichéd action or plot twists, just a sense that you&#x27;re listening in on real life.&quot; The &quot;New York Daily News&quot;″s Jami Bernard described the film as a &quot;slice of life&quot; mood piece, praising Tyler&#x27;s performance as &quot;forceful,&quot; adding that &quot;the film moves as carefully as Vincent &quot;[sic]&quot; himself, as if afraid to displace too many molecules at once. It&#x27;s a welcome respite from the crash-bang movies of summer.&quot; Barbara Creed of the Australian publication &quot;The Age&quot; noted the film as a &quot;delicate and remarkable debut&quot; and likened elements of it to the Carson McCullers novel &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Café&quot;.

Critic James Berardinelli wrote that &quot;Mangold captures the nuances of life perfectly, and, by never cheapening his vision through facile resolutions, he fashions a memorable cinematic portrait.&quot; Berardinelli subsequently included the film in his book, &quot;Reel Views: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies&quot; in 2005. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a small, quiet miracle of a movie in which tenderness, compassion, and insight combine to create a tension that yields a quality of perception that&#x27;s almost painful to experience&quot;, comparing its cinematography to the work of R.W. Fassbinder and remarking the effectiveness of Thurston Moore&#x27;s score for the film. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot; called the film &quot;an act of faith in itself — an argument for the kind of subtle, humanistic traces that used to be familiar on screen but somehow became all too scarce,&quot; while Barbara Shulgasser of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted: &quot;There is nothing cutesy or gimmicky about &quot;Heavy&quot;, which may be why something in its grimness recalls the work of Ingmar Bergman.&quot;

Other critics were less laudatory of the film, including Jeff Millar of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; who wrote: &quot;Even at 80 minutes, &quot;Heavy&quot; would have been weighted with redundancies. So you can imagine what happened on the way to making it 105 minutes long.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt its portrayal of its characters was exploitative, noting: &quot;Instead of the poetry of common people, &quot;Heavy&quot; romanticizes the mundane or grotesque. Mangold seems to be trying to revive some of the emotional quality of the late &#x27;40s-early &#x27;50s work of Southern Gothic writers like Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, and Tennessee Williams. But presenting Victor as an exemplary sufferer – a wounded soul trapped in the body of a lovelorn pizza cook, with Farrah Fawcett posters in his bedroom – makes him a little ridiculous, without quite making him funny. In &quot;Heavy&quot;, the sensitivity is so thick, the characters can hardly breathe.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With Pruitt Taylor Vince&#x27;s naturalistic performance and sympathetic direction from James Mangold, &quot;Heavy&quot; soars as an affecting exploration of loneliness.&quot;

<text>Searles Valentine Wood (February 14, 1798 – October 26, 1880) was an English palaeontologist.

==Life==
Wood went to sea in 1811 as a midshipman in the British East India Company&#x27;s service, which he left in 1826. He then settled at Hasketon near Woodbridge, Suffolk.

Wood devoted himself to a study of the mollusca of the Newer or Upper Tertiary (now Neogene) of Suffolk and Norfolk, and the Older Tertiary (Eocene) of the Hampshire Basin. His work in East Anglia focussed on the Crag deposits, &quot;crag&quot; being a local term for shelly sand that has been adopted by geologists. Opportunities for fossil-gathering were then plentiful, as these deposits were quarried to be used for fertiliser. These studies led to his chief work, &quot;A Monograph of the Crag Mollusca&quot; (1848–1856), published by the Palaeontographical Society. He was awarded the Wollaston medal for this work in 1860 by the Geological Society of London. A supplement was issued by him in 1872–1874, a second in 1879, and a third (edited by his son) in 1882.

He worked on the older deposits with his friend Frederick Edwards, Edwards describing the univalves and Wood the bivalves. This resulted in the publication of &quot;A Monograph of the Eocene Bivalves of England&quot; (1861–1871), also issued by the Palaeontographical Society.

He died at Martlesham, near Woodbridge.

His son, Searles Valentine Wood (1830-1884), was for some years a solicitor at Woodbridge, but gave up the profession and devoted his energies to geology, studying especially the structure of the deposits of the crag and glacial drifts.

<text>Darlington Nuclear Generating Station is a Canadian nuclear power station located on the north shore of Lake Ontario in Bowmanville, Ontario. It is a large nuclear facility comprising four CANDU nuclear reactors with a total output of 3,512 MWe when all units are online, providing about 20 percent of Ontario&#x27;s electricity needs, enough to serve a city of two million people. The reactor design is significantly more powerful than those used in previous CANDU sites at Pickering and Bruce, making its 4-unit plant the second-largest in Canada behind the 8-unit Bruce. It is named for the Township of Darlington, the name of the municipality in which it is located, which is now part of the amalgamated Municipality of Clarington.

The plant began construction in September 1981 and planned to start initial operations in 1985. Several delays ensued, and the construction start on Units 3 and 4 was put off until 1984 and 1985. Unit 2 entered operation in 1990, followed by Unit 1 in 1992, and Units 3 and 4 in 1993. The delays and resulting cost overruns have made Darlington a primary case study for the anti-nuclear movement in Canada, and was one of the main reasons Ontario Hydro was broken up in 1999 and its debts paid off by special billings. After initial operations and shakeout, it is often among the most reliable plants in the world in terms of capacity factor. , the plant is undergoing a mid-life upgrade, with two units completed and the second two expected to complete in 2026.

Room for a second four-reactor unit had been in place since the original site selection, with a large area to the east of the current plant set aside for what was known as Darlington B. In 2006, Ontario Power Generation began the process of applying to build a two-unit plant on the B site. This project was cancelled in 2013 when the estimated cost was far beyond initial projections. In 2020 plans started to install a much smaller BWRX-300 small modular reactor on the B site, which are ongoing .

==History==
===Planning, controversy and delays===
Darlington was part of a large nuclear buildout planned by Ontario Hydro based on their predictions of almost linear growth in power demand at 7% per year essentially forever. Based on this predicted growth, the company stated that nuclear would account for 60 to 70% of the province&#x27;s supply by 1990, and for that to occur, a large number of new reactors would have to be built. Land at the Darlington Provincial Park was identified as a potential site in the late 1960s, and Hydro purchased the plot in 1971 as an &quot;energy centre&quot;. The first official plans to develop the site for nuclear were approved in 1973, apparently at the personal direction of Conservative Ontario premier Bill Davis without discussion by cabinet. At the time, the construction cost of the four-unit plant was estimated at $4.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), and construction would start in 1979. Public hearings began in 1974 and the general plans were finalized in 1976. The official go-ahead from the government was given on 18 April 1977, and the first contracts for construction let on 8 June 1978.

Through the rest of the 1970s, Hydro&#x27;s future demand estimates were repeatedly attacked as unrealistic. The 1973 oil crisis and subsequent 1973–1975 recession led to greatly reduced growth rates, which reached zero in the province in 1977. As these concerns became more public, in 1975 Davis formed two independent committees, the Porter Commission and the Select Committee, both of whom concluded the predictions were far too high. Shortly after, the recently formed Ministry of Energy and the public Energy Probe foundation both released reports stating that the company&#x27;s predictions for power use in 2000 were some 12 gigawatts too high, about three four-reactor plants worth. In 1980, the Porter Commission delivered its final report, which stated the growth rate would be closer to 4% and suggested Hydro should abandon its plans for further nuclear plants and should instead develop smaller plants and implement demand management. This advice was pointedly ignored.

===Construction starts, and pauses===
The ongoing expansion plan was paid for by debt financing primarily through the sale of commercial bonds. Given the public scrutiny and generally negative reports, in 1976 Energy Minister Darcy McKeough told Hydro to slow down its demands and spread out the budget or the province would not guarantee the company&#x27;s bonds. Darlington was one of several major programs for that time frame, including major expansions at Pickering and Bruce. Hydro responded by pushing back the construction start to 1981, with the first reactor coming online in 1985 and then the other three after that, one every 12 months. This pushed the budget up only slightly to $3.9 billion in construction and another $1 billion for heavy water. A more detailed budget, this time accounting for inflation during the expected construction period through 1988 put the final figure at $7.4 billion, . The time-frame was deferred and advanced several times over the next few years.

In 1981, Hydro finally responded to the concerns about overbuilding with a new prediction of 38 gigawatts demand in 2000, a full 52 gigawatts less than their predictions made in 1978. A 1984 report puts the future growth at 3% at least until 1992, which, along with high interest rates of the era, led the company to cancel any future buildout for this period. Even the post-1992 demand seemed uncertain and no new reactors were scheduled. The company turned its attention to grid improvements.

Construction began on schedule, with the &quot;first pour&quot; in June 1981. In 1982, the construction starts for Units 3 and 4 were pushed back several years to 1985. In 1983, suffering from overcommitment and understaffing, Hydro management ordered the project be delayed. The engineering staff on Darlington were assigned to other projects, including the expansions at Pickering and Bruce that were now about to come online. At the time, Hydro calculated the budget to have risen to $10.9 billion. The pause ended in early 1985, but not all of the original staff were assigned back to the project, and new staff had to be hired and trained. Additionally, during the pause a number of issues in the design were found, this being the first plant of the ~900 MW size to be built, introducing further delay in getting construction started again. At this time, the company had already spent the original $7 billion budget, and was now predicting another $4 billion would be needed to complete it. Completion of Unit 2 was now predicted to be in 1988.

===Reexamination, go-ahead===
On 2 May 1985, the 1985 Ontario general election resulted in the ruling Conservatives receiving a minority government, but a vote of no confidence in June ended their 42-year rule and brought David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals to power with support by Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP. Peterson had previously voiced his support for an immediate stop to Darlington. In contrast, Rae relied on the support of the Hydro worker&#x27;s union, CUPE Local 1000, who strongly supported the project. As part of the inter-party deal, Peterson promised to not stop construction while a new commission considered the issue.

The Select Committee was reformed and produced a new report in 1986. By this time the Chernobyl disaster had cast a further pall over the field, and Hydro had further reduced its predictions to 30 GW in 2000. The committee provisionally accepted the continuing construction of Darlington Units 1 and 2, but suggested a wait-and-see period before allowing completion of Units 3 and 4. It was during this period that the labour force at the site reached its peak of 7,000, making it the largest construction program in North America at that time. Cabinet approved the continued construction in 1987, before the next election.

Now seven years into a four-year building schedule, during a period of high interest rates, the budget continued to balloon. An additional $3.3 billion can be attributed to the interest during these delays. An additional $1.2 billion had to be added to the bill as Hydro changed their accounting procedures and moved several items, including training the operators, from operational costs to capital. Design changes due to changing safety requirements after the Three Mile Island accident and Chernobyl added a further $0.9 billion, and other unforeseen changes to construction, including site works, added another $1 billion. As a result, the final cost was put at $13.8 billion, a full $6.8 billion, or 86%, over the 1981 estimate.

===Commissioning and initial operations===
Unit 2 was the first to start construction, ahead of Unit 1, on 1 September 1981. Unit 1 followed on 1 April 1982. Construction started on Unit 3 on 1 September 1984, and Unit 4 on 1 July 1985. Construction on 1 and 2 continued with the pauses noted above, but 3 and 4 were significantly scaled back. Unit 2 entered commercial service on 9 October 1990, and Unit 1 on 14 November 1992. The final two units were much closer to competition by this point, with Unit 3 entering service on 14 February 1993, and Unit 4 shortly after on 14 June.

Almost immediately on entering service, the power shafts on Unit 2 connecting the steam turbines to the alternators were found to suffer from cracking, which led to lengthy shutdowns in 1990 and 1991. This was addressed with a new shaft design installed in May 1992. The other three units had already received the original design, but for initial operations they were modified to avoid the problem while awaiting the new shafts, expected in May 1993 for Unit 1 and in March and August 1994 for Units 3 and 4. In early 1991 it was found that vibrations in the fuel assemblies in Unit 2 was causing them to become damaged. This was ultimately traced to a problem in the pumping system that injected a 150 Hz pressure fluctuation. Changing the impellers to increase the rate to 210 Hz solved the problem.

As a result of these issues, the initial availability, or capacity factor was low. During its first three and a half years of operation, Unit 2 achieved a lifetime load factor of only 29.9% while Unit 1, between July 1992 and the end of June 1993, achieved a load factor of 56.8%. The changes, especially the new power shafts, also added another $600 million to the final bill.

===Breakup of Hydro===
The Peterson government fell in 1990, resulting in Rae&#x27;s NDP taking the province in the midst of a recession. The Darlington plant was still under construction, and still as politically radioactive as it had been through the 1980s. Rae made the decision to complete the plant, but to ensure that these sorts of overruns did not occur again, he appointed Maurice Strong, former CEO of Petro-Canada, to become CEO of Hydro and shake up the company. Strong asked Bill Farlinger, a laissez-faire market-economy advocate, to suggest ways to reform the company. As a result of Farlinger&#x27;s suggestions, Strong began the process of breaking up the company into five divisions, each with a separate area of responsibility. As part of these plans, any future nuclear expansion was ended. When Mike Harris&#x27; Conservatives regained power in 1995, Harris appointed Farlinger as CEO of Hydro and the plans were amended to sell off the various divisions once the split was complete.

By this time, Hydro had $34 billion in debt, almost half of that due to Darlington and a significant portion of the rest from construction and expansions on Pickering and Bruce. Additional charges were due to cost overruns on the boilers at these plants, which ran to $850 million. More was added due to the take-or-pay contracts with Rio Algom and Denison Mines for supply of uranium that were set at market rates prior to the collapse of worldwide uranium prices in the late 1980s. This led Hydro to break the contracts in 1991 at another $717 million charge.

After much debate, the decision was made to isolate the debts into a separate crown corporation, the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation. Ontario Hydro officially ended operations on 31 March 1999. Their final financial statements listed long-term debts of $26.2 billion and assets totalling $39.6 billion, but the government concluded the fair value of the assets was far below the claimed price. Their valuations calculated a resulting $19.5 billion of stranded debt, which was then paid off as a separate Debt Retirement Charge on customer bills from 2003 until 31 March 2018.

==Commercial operations==
In April 1999 Ontario Hydro was split into 5 component Crown corporations with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) taking over all electrical generating stations. The Darlington reactors have been among the best performing in OPG&#x27;s CANDU fleet, including a top year in 2008 in which the plant achieved a combined 94.5% capacity factor. In June 2016, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) named Darlington one of the safest and top-performing nuclear stations in the world - for the third time in a row.

In March 2017, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and its venture arm, Canadian Nuclear Partners, announced plans to produce Plutonium-238 as a second source for NASA. Rods containing Np-237 would be fabricated by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State and shipped to OPG&#x27;s Darlington Nuclear Generating Station where they would be irradiated with neutrons inside the reactor&#x27;s core to produce Pu-238.

==Electrical Output==
The graph represents the annual electricity generation at the site in GWh.

As of the end of 2023, the total lifetime output of the facility was 764,192 GWh.

==Cost overruns==
The Darlington station incurred massive cost overruns during its construction.

The initial cost estimate for the station was $3.9 billion CAD in the late 1970s, which increased to $7.4 billion in 1981 when construction was started. A year-long period of public hearings and study by an Ontario government all-party committee finished in 1986 with the decision to proceed with the project, which had then risen to $7 billion in actual and committed costs. The final cost was $14.4 billion CAD, almost double the initial construction budget, even adjusted for inflation.

Hydro was not allowed to charge for the cost of construction until the plant was actually delivering power to customers. As such, all of the cost overruns in the project until 1990 had to be taken on as debt, during a period of historically high interest rates. In 1989, Hydro filed its latest 25-year Demand Supply Plan, &quot;Providing the Balance of Power&quot;, calling for another 10 reactors and 32 fossil plants. In 1993, this plan was withdrawn, after Darlington entered service and the province now had a surplus of generation and was forced to sell at very low and sometimes negative prices. This, combined with the enormous debt the company had taken on to finance the plant, led to the decision to break up the company into several smaller ones.

The project was adversely affected by declining electricity demand forecasts, mounting debt of Ontario Hydro, and the Chernobyl disaster, which necessitated safety reviews in mid-construction. Each delay incurred interest charges on debt, which ultimately accounted for 70% of the cost overruns. Inflation during 1977 to 1981 was 46 percent, according to Canada&#x27;s Consumer Price index. In addition interest rates were running at 20 percent. Improper choice of equipment and a six-month labour stoppage of electrical workers also yielded some of these costs and delays. Discussion of who is to blame for the costs and subsequent debts associated with Darlington often arise during provincial election campaigns, and are often mentioned in anti-nuclear literature.

== Refurbishment project ==
After public hearings, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission announced in December 2015 the renewal of Darlington’s power reactor operating licence, for 10 years from Jan. 1, 2016, until Nov. 30, 2025, to allow for the refurbishment of the Darlington station, which began in October 2016.

On October 14, 2016, OPG began Canada’s largest clean infrastructure project – the refurbishment of all four of Darlington’s reactors. According to the Conference Board of Canada, the $12.8 billion investment will generate $14.9 billion in economic benefits to Ontario, including thousands of construction jobs at Darlington and at some 60 Ontario companies supplying components for the work. The project is scheduled for completion by 2028 and will ensure safe plant operation through 2055.

*The first reactor to be refurbished was Unit 2. In March 2020, it was announced that the refurbishment of Unit 2 was complete, and in April 2020, the reactor achieved criticality for the first time since being reassembled. The reactor was reconnected to the grid in June.
*The second reactor to be refurbished was Unit 3. On July 8, 2023, the CNSC removed the 35% full power hold limited from Unit 3, allowing the unit to operate at 100% full power.

==Darlington B==
In 2006, OPG started the federal approvals process to build new nuclear units at the site of its Darlington Nuclear Station. The project proposal involved the construction and operation of up to four nuclear units, with capacity of up to 4,800 MW.

A request for proposals (RFP) process for design and construction resulted in bids from Areva NP, Westinghouse, and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). In June 2009, the Government of Ontario put the RFP process on hold, citing unexpectedly high bids, and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the only compliant bidder (AECL).

In August 2011, the three-member Joint Review Panel (mandated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission) released a report finding that the Darlington new build project would not result in any significant adverse environmental impacts (after taking into account mitigation measures). Following the report, the federal government approved the Environmental Assessment.

In October 2013, the Ontario government declared that the Darlington new build project would not be a part of Ontario&#x27;s long term energy plan, citing the high capital cost estimates and energy surplus in the province at the time of the announcement.

==Darlington New Nuclear==

In November 2020, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) announced plans to build a small modular reactor (SMR) at Darlington Nuclear Generating Station. It is expected to be operational by 2028 at the earliest. OPG will work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Canada to build the SMR.

On December 2, 2022, Ontario Power Generation officially broke ground on the new build Darlington SMR (Darlington B) project. The first unit to be constructed is a GE BWRX-300 unit, expected to produce power by late 2029.

==Waste==
Low and intermediate level waste from Darlington is stored at the Western Waste Management Facility (WWMF) at the Bruce nuclear site near Kincardine, Ontario. OPG has proposed the construction and operation of a deep geologic repository for the long-term storage of this low and intermediate level waste on lands adjacent to WWMF.

On May 6, 2015 the Joint Review Panel issued the Environmental Assessment (EA) Report recommending the approval of the Deep Geologic Repository for Ontario’s low and intermediate level waste to the federal government.

In February 2016, the Federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change delayed a decision on OPG’s DGR, causing a pause in the timeline for the environmental assessment decision to be issued. OPG has since committed to completing further DGR studies by the end of 2016.

The Darlington Waste Management Facility provides dry storage for the used fuel from Darlington, after an initial period in a water-filled storage bay. The facility was opened in 2007, reportedly on schedule and on budget. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is seeking a site in Canada for a permanent repository for used fuel from all of Canada&#x27;s nuclear reactors.

==Records==
2020: On Tuesday, September 15 Darlington Unit 1 broke the world record for continuous generation at 963 days, a record previous held by Pickering Unit 7 at 894 days for 22 years until it was broken in 2016 by Heysham 2 in the UK. As of September 28, 2020, Unit 1 was at 976 days.
2021: On Thursday, February 4 at sometime after 11PM Darlington Unit 1 finally went down for maintenance after 1,106 continuous days of generation, setting the world nuclear operation record and world thermal plant generation record.

==Spill==
In 2009, more than 200,000 litres of water containing trace amounts of tritium and hydrazine spilled into Lake Ontario after workers accidentally filled the wrong tank with tritiated water. However the level of the isotope in the lake was less than 1 percent of the regulatory limit and consistent with normal operational activities.

<text>Heinrich Georg Bronn (3 March 1800 – 5 July 1862) was a German geologist and paleontologist. He was the first to translate Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; into German in 1860, although not without introducing his own interpretations, as also a chapter critiquing the work.

== Biography ==
Bronn was born at Ziegelhausen (now part of Heidelberg) in the electoral Palatinate. Studying at the university of Heidelberg he took his doctor&#x27;s degree in the faculty of medicine in 1821, and in the following year was appointed professor of natural history. He now devoted himself to palaeontological studies, and to field-work in various parts of Germany, Italy and France.

From its commencement in 1830 to 1862 he assisted in editing the &quot;Jahrbuch für Mineralogie&quot; continued as &quot;Neues Jahrbuch&quot;. His principal work, &quot;Lethaea geognostica&quot; (2 vols., Stuttgart, 1834–1838; 3rd ed. with F. Romer, 3 vols., 1851–1856), has been regarded as one of the foundations of German stratigraphical geology.

His &quot;Handbuch einer Geschichte der Natur&quot;, of which the first part was issued in 1841, gave a general account of the physical history of the earth, while the second part dealt with the life-history, species being regarded as direct acts of creation. The third part included his &quot;Index Palaeontologicus&quot;, and was issued in 3 vols., 1848–1849, with the assistance of Hermann von Meyer and Heinrich Göppert. This record of fossils has proved of inestimable value to all palaeontologists. Bronn&#x27;s quantitative analysis of the appearance of specific fossils revealed that particular species, such as the ammonites, appeared and disappeared at different times in the fossil record.

An important work on recent and fossil zoology, &quot;&quot;, was commenced by Bronn. He wrote the volumes dealing with Amorphozoa, Actinozoa, and Malacozoa, published 1859–1862; the work was continued by other naturalists. Bronn was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1860. In 1861 Bronn was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He died at Heidelberg.

He speculated on evolutionary ideas of adaptation and selective breeding before Charles Darwin in the 1850s but did not fully embrace the transmutation of species. He translated &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Darwin into the German language. In 1858, Bronn proposed a &quot;tree of life&quot; as a means of depicting the genealogical relationships among organisms.

<text>Paul-Albert Besnard (2 June 1849 – 4 December 1934) was a French painter and printmaker.

==Biography==
Besnard was born in Paris and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, studied with Jean Bremond and was influenced by Alexandre Cabanel. He won the Prix de Rome in 1874 with the painting &quot;Death of Timophanes&quot;.

On 19 November 1879 he married the sculptor Charlotte Dubray (1854–1931). They had four children, of whom three were artists.

Until about 1880 he followed the academic tradition, but then broke away completely, and devoted himself to the study of colour and light as conceived by the Impressionists. The realism of this group never appealed to his bold imagination, but he applied their technical method to ideological and decorative works on a large scale, such as his frescoes at the Sorbonne, the Ecole de Pharmacie, the ceiling of the Comédie-Française (main theatre in Paris), the Salle des Sciences at the Hôtel de Ville, the &quot;mairie&quot; of the 1st arrondissement, and the chapel of Berck hospital, for which he painted twelve Stations of the Cross in an entirely modern spirit.

A great virtuoso, he achieved brilliant successes alike in watercolour, pastel, oil and etching, both in portraiture, in landscape and in decoration. His close analysis of light can be studied in his picture &quot;La femme qui se chauffe&quot; at the Luxembourg in Paris, one of a large group of nude studies of which a later example is &quot;Une Nymphe au bord de la mer&quot;; and in the work produced during and after a visit to India in 1911. A large panel, &quot;Peace by Arbitration&quot;, was completed seven days before the outbreak of war in 1914.

Partly under the influence of Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, whom he studied during a three-years stay in England, he applied his methods to a brilliant series of portraits, especially of women. Notable among these are the &quot;Portrait de Théâtre&quot; (Madame Réjane), and &quot;Mme. Roger Jourdain&quot;. The former is a good example of his daring unconventionality. A later work is &quot;The King and Queen of Belgium&quot; (1919). His landscape work is represented by &quot;L&#x27;ile heureuse&quot;, and &quot;Un Ruisseau dans la Montagne&quot; (1920). A symbolist in his decorative work, Besnard&#x27;s frank delight in the external world and his “chic” luminous technique bring him close to the 18th-century French painters.

A foundation member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890, in 1913 he became a member of the Institute. He succeeded Carolus Duran as director of the Académie française in Rome. In 1912, he became a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts and became director of the École des Beaux Arts in 1922. In 1923 he co-founded the Salon des Tuileries.

He was represented in the official exhibition of French art held in the United States in 1919-20 by a symbolic 1917 portrait of Cardinal Mercier. An important exhibition of his works was shown in different cities of the United States in 1924.

<text>Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station is a nuclear power station located 2 km northeast of Point Lepreau, New Brunswick, Canada. The facility was constructed between 1975 and 1983 by NB Power, the provincially owned public utility.

The facility is located on the northern shore of the Bay of Fundy and derives its name from the nearby headland situated at the easternmost part of Charlotte County, although the generating station itself is located within Saint John County. The generating station is administratively part of the local service district of Musquash, west of the city of Saint John.

The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station is the only nuclear generating facility located in Atlantic Canada and the only operating Canadian nuclear power station located outside of Ontario. The facility consists of a single CANDU nuclear reactor, having a net capacity of 660 MW (705 MW gross).

== History ==

=== Construction ===
The construction of a nuclear powered electrical generating station in New Brunswick had been discussed since the late 1950s. For over fifteen years, engineers from the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission visited AECL&#x27;s Chalk River Laboratories to keep abreast of the latest trends in the field. Formal talks between the Government of New Brunswick and the Government of Canada began in 1972. Discussions accelerated the next year, in the midst of the 1973 oil crisis, as the provincial government began to seriously consider options for diversifying New Brunswick&#x27;s electrical generation and reduce its reliance on oil. However, financing the venture was a problem since the province had a limited borrowing capacity.

The borrowing capacity was solved by the federal government in January 1974 with the announcement of a loan program covering half the costs of a first nuclear plant in any province in Canada. Premier Richard Hatfield announced his intention to build a nuclear generating station in New Brunswick on 5 February 1974. Hatfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party was reelected in that fall&#x27;s general election, despite misgivings of the nuclear generation plan by part of the population. In March 1975, Hatfield declared on television that the decision was final, and that the reactor would be built regardless of the ongoing environmental assessment process, in a move described by New Brunswick sociologist Ronald Babin as the &quot;nuclear &quot;fait accompli&quot; policy&quot;.

On 2 May 1975, the Atomic Energy Control Board authorized the construction of two 635-MW reactors on a site designed to host four in Point Lepreau, 20 km west of Saint John, New Brunswick&#x27;s largest city at the time. The New Brunswick Electric Power Commission began the construction of one reactor, with an option for a second one.

At its peak in 1979, the construction project employed 3,500 workers; 108 individual contracts out of 139 were granted to local businesses. Point Lepreau was licensed for operation on 21 July 1982, achieved criticality four days later and began commercial operations on 1 February 1983.

The high rate of inflation over the life of the construction project, tense labour relations on the worksite and skyrocketing construction costs - all common traits of large public infrastructure projects of that period - tripled the early cost forecast in nominal terms. The estimated cost of C$466 million in 1974 increased to C$684 two years later and to C$895 in 1978. At the time of its commissioning in 1983, the total cost was estimated at C$1.4 billion, excluding interest charges.

Point Lepreau was finished in 1981. It operated until 2008, when it closed for a refurbishment until 23 October 2012, when it was first re-connected to the grid. This is the only operating nuclear reactor in Canada outside Ontario.

This was the only CANDU reactor built on the east coast of Canada; other CANDUs are in Argentina, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Romania and China.

=== Expansion plans considered ===
In 2007, Team CANDU, a consortium of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., Hitachi Canada Ltd and SNC-Lavalin Nuclear Limited began a $2.5 million feasibility study regarding the installation of a new 1,100 MWe Advanced CANDU Reactor at Point Lepreau, to supply power to New England.
In July 2010, the Government of New Brunswick, led at that time by the Liberal Party, signed an agreement with French nuclear manufacturer Areva to study the feasibility of a new light water nuclear plant on the Point Lepreau property. In September 2010 the Progressive Conservative Party gained power and the plan was shelved by the incoming premier shortly after the election.

=== 2008-2012 refurbishment project ===

==== Public debate ====
Point Lepreau&#x27;s CANDU-6 reactor was designed to last 25 years and was scheduled to be mothballed by 2008. Public debate on the future of the plant began as early as 2000. At the time, NB Power estimated the refurbishment cost at C$750 million.

In 2002, NB Power, with support from the Government and opposition, pushed for refurbishment. However, the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board ruled that &quot;there is no significant economic advantage to the proposed refurbishment&quot; of Point Lepreau and that &quot;it is not in the public interest&quot;.

In April 2004, a report authored by former British Energy chairman Robin Jeffrey estimated the plant&#x27;s refurbishment would cost $1.36 billion instead of the C$935 million figure quoted at the time by the provincial utility. Jeffrey&#x27;s report made no recommendations on whether to undertake the plant&#x27;s overhaul or not but advised New Brunswick decision makers to seek competitive bids for new fossil-fuel fired generation capacity.

Despite being denied a federal grant to fund the project, NB Power announced on 29 July 2005 that it was awarding Atomic Energy of Canada Limited a $1.4 billion (CAD) contract for refurbishing the generating station.

==== Refurbishment work ====
The refurbishment of the power station began on 28 March 2008 and was originally scheduled to last 18 months with AECL as the lead contractor on the project, but the operation was marred by technical glitches, delays and incidents. For instance, two 115-tonne turbine rotors, (not part of the AECL contract) worth C$10 million each, toppled a barge in Saint John Harbour while being transported to the plant on 15 October 2008. The part manufacturer, Siemens Canada Ltd., eventually sued four companies in an Ontario court, including J. D. Irving Ltd., for &quot;gross negligence&quot; in the incident.

Estimates for the reopening of the plant had been revised several times. In January 2009, a 3-month delay was announced because of problems with the robotic equipment used to remove pressure tubes. A second, 4-month delay was announced in July of the same year. In October 2009, New Brunswick minister of Energy, Jack Keir, announced a tentative reopening by February 2011 and asked for federal money to cope with the unexpected cost of purchased power to replace the power ordinarily generated by the plant. The situation is compounded by the strategic importance of the plant in NB Power supply plans, since Point Lepreau provides 4 TWh/year or between 25 and 30% of the provincial output.

A few weeks later it was announced on 29 October 2009 that the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station would be one of the assets that were to be included in the proposed sale of NB Power to Hydro-Québec. On 24 March 2010 Premier Shawn Graham announced that the proposed sale had fallen through, citing Hydro-Québec&#x27;s &quot;concerns about unanticipated costs&quot;. Graham&#x27;s announcement was contested by analysts who blamed the collapse of the deal on the difficult political situation in New Brunswick, six months before a scheduled provincial election.

According to leaked internal documents, the proposed sale of NB Power and a proposed post-refurbishment staff reorganization of the company had a negative impact on workers&#x27; morale at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station and was becoming a safety concern. Over 600 workplace injuries occurred at Point Lepreau between January 2009 and June 2010, including 7 &quot;lost time&quot;, 13 &quot;restricted work&quot; injuries and 32 incidents requiring medical aid. According to the internal reports, delays were costing NB Power C$33 million a month: &quot;C$11 million in capital costs and C$22 million for replacement power and interest&quot;.

On 9 October 2010, NB Power announced that AECL would have to remove all 380 calandria tubes from the reactor and reinstall them a second time, an operation which took a year earlier in the refurbishment program. The calandria tubes, roughly and , form the boundary to the moderator tank (calandria) through which the fuel channels are installed. According to an internal report dated 30 June 2010, the problem &quot;is likely the result of damage to the tube sheet bores caused by the cleaning operation in a previous work series&quot;. According to an October 2010 estimate, the generating station was scheduled to be back on stream in the fall of 2012, three years later than first expected.

First re-connected to the grid on 23 October 2012, on 23 November 2012 Point Lepreau restarted commercial power production with a final refurbishment cost approximately &quot;$1 billion over its original budget&quot;.

=== Advanced Small Modular Reactors ===
On 26 June 2018, the government of New Brunswick committed 10 million dollars toward the establishment of an advanced Small Modular Reactor Research Cluster. This was followed by announcements of the participation of ARC Nuclear (9 July 2018) and Moltex Energy (13 July 2018), each investing 5 million dollars to progress research and development of their advanced technologies. Since that time significant development has taken place, including discussions on establishing a supply chain within the province.

As indicated on 25 July 2019, NB Power envisions commercial demonstrations of both reactor types at the Point Lepreau site if these advanced technologies successfully complete Phase 2 of the CNSC Vendor Design review and their financial and project planning predictions continue to show promise. 

New Brunswick participated in the development of the Pan-Canadian SMR Roadmap (November 2018), and is also collaborating with the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan pertaining to the development of deployment of Small Modular Reactor technologies as part of the Interprovincial MOU announced in December 2019.

In March 2019, a consortium involving NB Power, the Government of New Brunswick, ARC Nuclear, and Moltex Energy announced plans to develop small modular reactors at the Point Lepreau site. This was furthered when, in December 2019, the governments of New Brunswick, Ontario, and Saskatchewan announced a collaboration deal on the development of small modular reactors.

==Operations==
The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station achieved record levels of availability with a 10-year average of 93.11% and generated over 5,000 GWh/year of energy on a sustained basis for its first decade of operations. However, numerous problems started to surface in the mid to late 1990s, due to poor maintenance and low investment. In mid-January 1997, a leak near the reactor core forced a third shutdown in 2 years. The 75-day stoppage was caused by a cracked feeder pipe. The human error cost C$40 million in repairs and C$450,000/day to purchase replacement power from Quebec.

==Electrical Output==
The graph represents the annual electricity generation at the site in GWh.
As of the end of 2023, the total lifetime output of the facility was 166,354 GWh.

=== Incidents ===
In 1990, assistant plant operator Daniel George Maston was charged after he took heavy water from the moderator system and added it to a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water.

In 1995, a plywood cover was left in the boiler after completion of a maintenance outage. When the heat transport pumps were restarted, the cover was sucked into the heat transport system where it caused catastrophic damage to one of the pumps. The cause of the incident was lack of control of temporary modifications, poor work management, lack of foreign material exclusion (FME) measures, and human error. There was no public safety significance to the event, since the reactor had been shut down long enough that decay heat power was below the level that required coolant flow. However, the breach of the pressure boundary at the damaged pump created a radiation hazard for workers, and debris in feeders, fuel channels and potentially other Heat Transport and Auxiliaries pipework could have created a significant safety hazard during at-power operation. The cost of pump repairs, and the production downtime caused by the incident and its cleanup, was significant. The incident also left wood and metal debris unrecoverable in the cooling system. Maintenance incidents at Lepreau in 1995 cost the facility more than $50 million in repairs and replacement power.

In 2011, a spill of heavy water in the reactor building triggered a radiation alert and evacuation. NB Power stated that the event did not pose significant impact to the public or environment. This was the first time the reactor building had ever been evacuated.

<text>HMP Low Moss is located on the outskirts of Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire; near Glasgow, Scotland. It has been operated by the Scottish Prison Service as a prison since 1968 and was for low-category prisoners who had sentences of less than 36 months to serve. The original establishment was closed in May 2007, with the entire site being cleared and redeveloped with a considerably enlarged footprint. The new prison was reopened in March 2012, and accepted its first intake in almost five years. Scott Watson is the Establishment&#x27;s acting Governor.

==History==

===RAF Bishopbriggs===
Originally a Second World War-era Royal Air Force (RAF) Barrage balloon depot, known as RAF Bishopbriggs, constructed in 1939, base of No.18 (Balloon) Squadron and No. 15 Maintenance Unit. It was also used as an overnight &#x27;transit&#x27; camp for other RAF Units being transferred from the south of England to the north of Scotland. After WW2, RAF Bishopbriggs was utilised as a training school for the Royal Military Police for a time.

====RAF 388 Mobile Radar Bomb Scoring Signals Unit====
In the 1960s the Officers Mess building on the other side of the Lenzie road, next to St Mungo&#x27;s playing fields, was later used for the Combined Messing (Officers, SNCOs and other ranks) and Unit HQ base for 388 Signals Unit (RAF), also known as 388MRBSSU or the Glasgow bomb plot. It used two AA No. 3 Mk.7 radars to score simulated bombing missions on pre-determined target ranges in the Glasgow area. The radars were installed on one of the concrete former Barrage Balloon pans, situated near the Civil defence practice house and were enclosed by a fence and locked gates. The unit closed in mid 1966 and the radars moved to RAF Ouston in Northumberland.

USAF and RAF bombers utilised the range, types included the Douglas B-66 Destroyer, Convair B-58 Hustler, the V bombers and English Electric Canberras.

===Scottish Prison Service use===
Low Moss was first used by the Scottish Prison Service as a training school between 1964 and 1970. There was a break in this use between 1966 and 1968 when training reverted to Barlinnie Prison.

===Conversion to Prison===
In September 1968, the former RAF camp was initially converted into a temporary, low security male prison. The planning permission restricted the sentence length and category of prisoner, and it set an eventual closure date of the temporary prison for December 1974. An extension of time until 1986 was sought in December 1981, to allow closure of Low Moss once Shotts Prison had been refurbished. Strathkelvin District Council agreed to that extension in January 1982.

A further year was requested in February 1988, but in July the council objected to that request and sought a public local inquiry, after which the council approved a limited 3-year period, as opposed to the originally proposed 5 years, in June 1989. In June 1992 the council received a further renewal request, and in November it agreed to the continued use of the site as a prison until November 2002. Another 10 year renewal request was lodged in June 2002, and because the council objected in August 2002, the request was referred to the Scottish Executive for a decision, with a further 10-year extension granted in June 2003.

===Accommodation===
The prison was of wooden, single-storey construction, and the accommodation comprised 11 Nissen hut dormitory-style units linked by internal corridors and Davidson House, a temporary, pre-fabricated building. The corridors linking the dormitories were narrow and did not permit good access. Some investment took place, with the partial refurbishment of seven dormitories in the mid-1980s. The accommodation was communal and offered little privacy. It housed approximately 300 prisoners at any one time.

==Closure and reconstruction==

In early January 2007, it was announced that the Scottish Executive had overruled the initial objection by East Dunbartonshire Council for the prison to be totally rebuilt to modern standards under a private finance initiative. However a review by the New Scottish Government later that year called for the original plans to be re-evaluated. As a result, the prison is the first new build publicly operated prison to be opened in Scotland for almost 30 years.

The subsequent tendering process, resulted in Carillion being selected as contractor for the new publicly funded prison in May 2009. The replacement prison on completion was to be three times the size of the old prison, capable of accommodating 700 inmates with 300 staff in a medium-security facility. Construction on the new prison began in February 2010 for completion in early 2012.

Whilst the old prison was operated for low-category prisoners serving sentences of less than 36 months the SPS said that the new HMP Low Moss, in common with all new prisons, was built to take the highest category of prisoner as standard. The prison opened its doors in March 2012 and prisoners were phased in over a 10-week period. Though the SPS had been recruiting over the months leading up to the opening, the majority of the staff were to be experienced officers transferring from existing prisons.

==Other Uses==
Part of the former RAF Bishopbriggs site has also been used as a Large goods vehicle and MOT testing centre from the late 1960s, and a Golf Driving range, which was constructed on the northeastern part of the former base. A Department of Health and Social Security Homeless Resettlement Unit, known as &quot;the Spike&quot; also used part of the former RAF Bishopbriggs site until its closure in March 1996.

<text>Gabrielle Réjane (), &quot;née&quot; Gabrielle Charlotte Réju (6 June 1856 – 14 June 1920), was a French actress of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The daughter of a former actor, Réjane studied at the Paris Conservatoire and made her stage debut in 1875. After eight seasons at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in increasingly prominent roles, she became leading lady at the Théâtre des Variétés, a position she combined with appearances in more substantial plays at other theatres. She became known chiefly for her roles in comedies, but made an impression in serious character parts from time to time. Her biggest success was as Catherine, the outspoken washerwoman who becomes a duchess in the historical comedy-drama &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; by Sardou and Moreau. She created the role in 1893 and played it frequently for much of her career. Among her other celebrated roles was Nora in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in 1894, which gave the author his first success in France.

Réjane appeared in major cities throughout Europe, and was particularly popular in London, where she played frequently between 1877 and 1915. She twice played on Broadway, but did not become popular with American audiences. She married the director of the Vaudeville, and starred there, but after their divorce in 1905 she opened her own theatre, which she ran until 1918. Between 1900 and 1920 she appeared in six silent films, including two versions of &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;. She was widely regarded as the embodiment of the Parisienne, and when she died in 1920 &quot;Le Figaro&quot; said that Paris had lost its soul.

== Life and career ==
===Early years===

Réjane was born in Paris on 6 June 1856. Her father, a former actor, was on the staff of the Théâtre de l&#x27;Ambigu-Comique. He died when Réjane was about five, leaving his widow in straitened circumstances. She obtained a post at another Parisian theatre, and the young Réjane painted fans to augment the family income. In 1870–71 her education, at the Pension Boulet, was interrupted by the Siege of Paris and the bloody events of the Commune. After the fighting ended she returned to her studies and was appointed as a paid assistant to look after the younger pupils.

Réjane had ambitions to go on the stage, and, having obtained a reluctant consent from her mother, she successfully applied to François-Joseph Regnier, a distinguished actor and teacher, for admission to his class at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1874 she won the Conservatoire&#x27;s &quot;deuxième prix&quot; (second prize) for comedy. The critic Francisque Sarcey held that she deserved the &quot;premier prix&quot;, but &quot;A first prize carries with it the right of entrance into the Comédie-Française, and the jury did not think Mademoiselle Réjane, with her little wide-awake face, suited to the vast frame of the House of Molière&quot;.

According to the official regulations, Réjane, as a winner of the &quot;deuxième prix&quot;, was required to join the company of France&#x27;s second national theatre, the Odéon, but she preferred the repertoire and better pay at the Théâtre du Vaudeville, and the Odéon management did not press the point. She made her debut at the Vaudeville in 1875 in the prologue to the &quot;Revue des deux-mondes&quot;, by Clairville, making an immediate impression. A reviewer commented, &quot;She has the arch and sprightly air of a Parisian grisette, a flexible voice of an agreeable tone, and perfect self-possession – qualities more than sufficient to succeed on the stage&quot;. Later in the year she had her first substantial success, as Niquette in the comedy &quot;Fanny Lear&quot; by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy. She remained at the Vaudeville for eight seasons, attracting good notices. The established star at the theatre, Julia Bartet, had the lion&#x27;s share of leading roles, but Réjane made her mark. The critic Dauphin Meunier later wrote:

In 1877 Réjane made the first of many appearances in London. Parisian theatres customarily closed for a few weeks during the height of summer, and in July, with Vaudeville colleagues, she played at the Gaiety Theatre in the West End in the comedies &quot;Perfide comme l&#x27;onde&quot;, &quot;Nos alliées&quot; and &quot;Aux crochets d&#x27;un gendre&quot;. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; applauded &quot;a display of vivacity and &quot;&quot; quite exceptional on the part of Mdlle Réjane&quot;, and &quot;The Morning Post&quot; found her &quot;infinitely diverting&quot;.

=== Variétés and stardom===
In 1882, the year after the retirement of Hortense Schneider, star of the Théâtre des Variétés, Réjane was engaged as leading lady there. Her contract at the Variétés allowed her to appear in more serious roles in other theatres, and in 1883 Sarah Bernhardt, who was then running the Ambigu, cast her in the central role of Jean Richepin&#x27;s &quot;La Glu&quot;; in that part, and as Adrienne de Boistulbé in Meilhac&#x27;s &quot;Ma camarade&quot; at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in the same year, Réjane attracted highly favourable critical attention.

Over the next ten years Réjane appeared at six or more Paris theatres, in an exceptionally wide variety of plays, from new works by Edmond Gondinet (&quot;Clara Soleil&quot;, 1885), Meilhac (&quot;Les demoiselles Clochart&quot;, 1886, and &quot;Ma cousine&quot;, 1890), Victorien Sardou (&quot;Marquise&quot;, 1889) and Edmond Haraucourt (&quot;Shylock&quot;, 1889), to revivals of classics by Beaumarchais (&quot;Le mariage de Figaro&quot;, 1889), Dumas (&quot;La Demi-Monde&quot;, 1890) and Aristophanes (&quot;Lysistrata&quot;, 1892). She continually showed the range of her abilities as an actress: in 1887 in &quot;Allô-Allô&quot; she played a scene grappling with the difficulties of the new-fangled telephone, which, Meunier recalled, was so funny &quot;that from the gallery to the stalls the theatre was one roar of laughter and applause&quot;. In the following year she appeared at the Odéon in a stage adaptation of &quot;Germinie Lacerteux&quot; by the Goncourt brothers. The actor and director André Antoine described her performance:

Among those who saw the performance was Marcel Proust who became a devoted admirer, and later friend; his character Berma, the great actress in &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;, is partly based on Réjane.

In 1893 Réjane married Paul Porel, director of the Vaudeville; they had two children – Germaine and Jacques. She appeared at the Vaudeville in a series of successful plays; two of the earliest productions demonstrated her range. In October 1893 she created the role with which she was most closely associated during the rest of her career: Catherine, the outspoken washerwoman-duchess in Sardou and Moreau&#x27;s historical comedy-drama &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;. The critical and public response was enthusiastic. In &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Henry Fouquier judged that Réjane had turned an artificial character into something delicious, feminine and overwhelming. Another reviewer wrote:


Six months later Réjane played Nora in the French premiere of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (&quot;Une maison de poupée&quot;). Ibsen had never succeeded with Parisian audiences until now, but to his delight the production was a triumph. &quot;Les annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot; recorded, &quot;Nora&#x27;s role is overwhelming; Mademoiselle Réjane took the opportunity of one of the greatest successes of her career. She was able to highlight the very complex character of the role, and with a rare simplicity of means she demonstrated in the famous tarantella scene an admirable dramatic power. Needless to say, it was acclaimed&quot;. Another contemporary critic wrote:
===London and New York===

In 1894 Réjane returned to the West End. Since her first appearance there, in 1877, she had been in a production of Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Le Nabab&quot; at the Gaiety in 1883. Her reviews then had been good, but her return in June 1894 in &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; prompted superlatives from the critics and drew full houses, even with the counter-attraction of a Bernhardt season at Daly&#x27;s Theatre. Réjane&#x27;s season had to be extended by a fortnight to meet demand.

In February 1895 Réjane opened at Abbey&#x27;s Theatre in New York for a season comprising &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;, &quot;Divorçons&quot;, &quot;Sapho&quot;, &quot;Ma cousine&quot; and &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Reviews for Réjane were excellent, but less so for the plays, and audiences were unresponsive: as an American commentator put it, &quot;The language was, of course, one stumbling block, for a keen understanding of the foreign tongue was more necessary for a taste for Réjane than for the broad effects, say, of a Bernhardt&quot;. Among those in the audience who understood the words there was a substantial section whose broadness of mind did not extend to the content of French plays. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later commented that Réjane was &quot;hampered by the moral bias of American audiences&quot;.

Réjane was so disgusted at the lack of appreciation that she vowed never to return. She took her company back to Paris via London, where they played a season of most of the same plays to full houses at the Garrick Theatre. &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; was once again an immense success, and Sir Henry Irving negotiated the rights to stage an English version, which he produced at the Lyceum Theatre with Ellen Terry in Réjane&#x27;s role two years later.

Réjane eventually relented and agreed to return to the US, but not until 1904, by which time she had been seen by audiences in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Austria, Romania, Italy, Spain and Portugal. In the meanwhile, at home her marriage was disintegrating, and in 1905 she and Porel were divorced. The children remained with her. The Vaudeville, under Porel&#x27;s management, being now closed to her, Réjane decided to go into management on her own account.

===Théâtre Réjane and later years===

Réjane was not long without a theatrical base. In 1906 the writer Arnold Bennett, then resident in Paris, wrote:

At the Théâtre Réjane its proprietor appeared in twenty new plays and revivals by playwrights ranging from the grandiose Catulle Mendès to the chic Sacha Guitry between 1906 and 1910 – &quot;none of them, perhaps, a new &quot;Sans-Gêne&quot; or &quot;Marquise&quot;&quot;, according to her biographer Forrest Izzard, &quot;but each serving to keep in vigorous use one of the rarest talents of the time&quot;. Réjane did not appear in every production at her theatre; she was not in the cast of the French premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;oiseau bleu&quot;), given at the Théâtre Réjane in March 1911. Nor did she confine her appearances in Paris to her own theatre; in 1911 and 1916 she appeared at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin in Henry Bataille&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfant de l&#x27;amour&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;amazone&quot;.

As well as her base in Paris, Réjane hoped to found a French repertory theatre in London. A first step was made in 1906 with a season at the Royalty Theatre, but the plan was not taken further. Réjane sold her Paris theatre in 1918, after which its name was changed to the Théâtre de Paris.

Réjane took part in six silent films. Two were versions of &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;, the first directed by Clément Maurice, 1900, and the second by André Calmettes, 1911. The others were &quot;Britannicus&quot; (Calmettes, 1908), &quot;L&#x27;Assomoir&quot; (Albert Capellani, 1909), &quot;Alsace&quot; (Henri Pouctal, 1916) and &quot;Miarka&quot; (Louis Mercanton, 1920).

During the First World War, Réjane devoted much effort to helping the Allied cause, and she appeared at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in a patriotic drama called &quot;Alsace&quot;, and at the London Coliseum in a war-play entitled &quot;The Bet&quot;. She was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, an event celebrated in February 1920 by a luncheon at the Théâtre de Paris, presided over by President-elect Paul Deschanel.

Réjane died of influenza in Paris on 14 June 1920, aged 64. The following day the front page of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; bore the words, &quot;Réjane est morte... Du silence, messieurs et mesdames du Paris de 1920, un peu de silence. Et pour nous, des larmes. Nous perdons l&#x27;âme de Paris&quot;. – Réjane is dead. ... Silence, gentlemen and ladies of Paris, 1920, a little silence. And for us, tears. We lose the soul of Paris&quot;.

<text>Robert Alfred Cloyne Godwin-Austen FRS (17 March 1808 – 25 November 1884) was an English geologist.

Godwin-Austen was the eldest son of Sir Henry E. Austen. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1830. He afterwards entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In 1833 he married the only daughter and heiress of Major General Sir Henry Godwin KCB, and in 1854 he took the additional name of Godwin by Royal licence. At Oxford as a pupil of William Buckland he became deeply interested in geology. Soon afterwards he met and was inspired by Henry De la Beche and assisted him by making a geological map of the neighbourhood of Newton Abbot in Devon, which was embodied in the Geological Survey map. He also published an elaborate memoir &quot;On the Geology of the South-East of Devonshire&quot; (Trans. Geol. Soc. ser. 2, vol. viii.).

His attention was next directed to the Cretaceous rocks of Surrey, his home county - his estates being situated at Chilworth and Shalford near Guildford. Later he dealt with the superficial deposits bordering the English Channel, and with the erratic boulders of Selsey. In 1855 he brought before the Geological Society of London his paper &quot;On the possible Extension of the Coal-Measures beneath the South-Eastern part of England&quot;, in which he pointed out on well-considered theoretical grounds the likelihood of coal measures being some day reached in that area. In this article he also advocated the freshwater origin of the Old Red Sandstone, and discussed the relations of that formation, and of the Devonian, to the Silurian and Carboniferous.

Godwin Austen was entrusted with the completion of a work intended by the naturalist Edward Forbes, F.R.S. which was entitled Natural History of the European Seas published in 1859.

He was elected F.R.S. in 1849, and in 1862 he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London, on which occasion he was styled by Roderick Murchison pre-eminently the physical geographer of bygone periods. He died at Shalford House near Guildford. His son, Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen was also a geologist.

<doc id="937852" wikidata="Q16976587" url="?curid=937852" title="Mister Smile">
<text>Mister Smile is a 1999 American animated short film directed by Fran Krause while he was attending Rhode Island School of Design. It won several awards in independent film festivals. The story follows a variety of characters who are all invited to a party at the home of Mister Smile.

==Plot==

Two men and a bear cower in their tree house home, awaiting the arrival of their newly ordered robot. Meanwhile, a bird drives home to his human wife. That night, he dreams about the childhood moment when he realized that he has fingers instead of wings - a discovery that prompted him to become a salesman. A monkey paces in the waiting room of a nearby hospital, as a chicken is called back to see the doctor. The doctor zaps the chicken with a shrinking machine, and after putting the chicken into a syringe, injects her into the monkey. Around this time, a squirrel and an old man play a game together, within their shared apartment complex. The squirrel removes the old man&#x27;s dentures and hides them from him. The old man then tries to guess where his dentures are.

In the apartment above the bird-human couple, lives Mister Smile, whose head is a yellow smiley face. Mr. Smile stamps his face onto sheets of paper, causing the features to disappear from his face completely. The features always regenerate though, as he slips the stamped sheets of paper into envelopes. Each group of characters receives one of these envelopes in the mail. They have been invited to visit Mr. Smile, who is presumably a celebrity.

Although the doctor&#x27;s procedure goes awry, leaving the now normal-sized chicken stuck inside of the monkey&#x27;s head, all three are delighted to receive their invitation. At the party, Mr. Smile hands out autographs, and the bird explains why he has the words &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Food&quot; tattooed on his hands. In the bird&#x27;s estimation, love and food must exist in harmony, for they are the only two things that anyone needs in life. He places the fingers of one of his hands in between the fingers of the other and declares &quot;Flooovde&quot;. The end credits inform the audience that the chicken and monkey got married shortly after the end of filming.

==Production==

Fran Krause made the film while attending Rhode Island School of Design. It took him two semesters to complete the film, during which time he listened to Archers of Loaf songs. Reminiscing a decade later, he remarked, &quot;I was on the 3rd floor of Market House about 20 hours a day painting cels for [the film]&quot;. There was a janitor at his school named Mel, who according to Krause, &quot;would sing in a beautiful baritone as he cleaned up around the cafeteria.&quot; Krause wanted Mel to voice the bird in his film, but Mel struggled in pronouncing a critical line. Eventually, Krause settled on voicing the character himself. His brother Will voiced the monkey and was the only other actor in the film.

==Critical reception==

Morgan Miller of &quot;Film Threat&quot; gave &quot;Mister Smile&quot; three stars and called it &quot;a very silly cartoon&quot;. His review noted the minimalist style of the animation and compared the bird&#x27;s soliloquy to Robert Mitchum&#x27;s in &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;. Dan Sarto of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; wrote that the film was a &quot;crowd favorite&quot; at the Ottawa International Student Animation Festival. He appreciated the film and felt that it was a &quot;quirky, funny tale&quot;. Both critics praised the humorous ending.

Richard Roeper also saw similarities with &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;, writing &quot;Give this animated flick credit for reaching back a bit&quot;.

==Accolades==

The film won First Prize in the Undergraduate/First Year Films category at the 1999 Ottawa International Student Animation Festival, the First Prize Animation Award at the 2000 USA Film Festival, and the Best Animated Film Award at the 24th Annual Atlanta Film &amp; Video Festival. It also screened at the 1999 Chicago International Film Festival and at a Rooftop Films festival.

<doc id="937853" wikidata="Q1111040" url="?curid=937853" title="Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station">
<text>Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station (&quot;Centrale nucléaire de Gentilly&quot; in French) is a former nuclear power station located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River in Bécancour, Quebec, 100 km north east of Montreal. The site contained two nuclear reactors; Gentilly-1, a 250 MW CANDU-BWR prototype, that was marred by technical problems and shut down in 1977, and Gentilly-2, a 675-MW CANDU-6 reactor operated commercially by the government-owned public utility Hydro-Québec between 1983 and 2012. These were the only power generating nuclear reactors in Quebec.

The Gentilly reactors were constructed in stages between 1966 and 1983 and were originally part of a plan for 30-35 nuclear reactors in Quebec. A third reactor, Gentilly-3, was scheduled to be built on the same site but was cancelled because of a drop in demand growth in the late 1970s.

In October 2012, it was decided for economic reasons not to proceed with the refurbishment of Gentilly-2, and to decommission the power plant instead. The process will take approximately 50 years to complete. That December, the remaining reactor was shut down and the decommissioning process started.

In August 2023, Hydro-Québec reported it was assessing the state of the plant to determine whether or not the Gentilly-2 CANDU reactor could be recommissioned. This came as the province of Quebec looked towards options to increase its production of clean electricity. It was decided to not proceed with recommissioning Gentilly-2 due to social acceptability issues.

==Gentilly-1==
Gentilly-1 was a prototype CANDU-BWR reactor, based on the SGHWR design. It was designed for a net output of 250MW(e). The reactor had several features unique amongst CANDU reactors, including vertically oriented pressure tubes (allowing for the use of a single fuelling machine below the core), and light-water coolant. These features were intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the unit, again to make it an attractive export unit. However, the design was not successful, and over 7 years recorded only 180 on-power days. Gentilly-1 is no longer in operation.

==Gentilly-2==
Gentilly-2 was a standard CANDU 6 reactor, similar to the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station. The plant had a net output of 675MW(e). Unlike the adjacent Gentilly-1 reactor, Gentilly-2 had a good service record since start-up in 1982, with a cumulative operating factor of 76.4%.

In an August 19, 2008 announcement, Québec planned to spend $1.9B to overhaul Gentilly-2 in order to extend its lifespan to 2040. Refurbishment of the reactor was eventually cancelled when on 3 October 2012, Hydro-Quebec&#x27;s CEO, Thierry Vandal, announced the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 generating station for economic reasons, scheduled to occur on 28 December 2012 at 10:30 p.m. At that time, a decommissioning process will proceed over a period of 50 years and is expected to cost $1.8 billion. The permanent shut down and decommissioning of the power plant followed an election pledge from Quebec premier Pauline Marois.

The Gentilly site also houses a 411MW gas turbine generation plant. The Bécancour generating station was commissioned in 1992-1993.

==Gentilly-3==
Gentilly-3 was a proposed nuclear reactor at the Gentilly site. It was cancelled by Quebec Premier René Lévesque. A white book study published by the Parti Québécois (PQ) before ascending to power found that Gentilly-3 was not needed for Quebec&#x27;s future energy needs and that it could be fulfilled with hydroelectricity. After the election of the PQ government, a moratorium on construction of nuclear plants was put into place. The reactor had been scheduled to be completed before 1990, and was the last reactor firmly committed to by Hydro-Québec and the Province of Quebec, though Quebec had committed to buy enough heavy water for four Candu style reactors, processed by the La Prade heavy water plant (near Trois-Rivières), scheduled for 1982 opening.

<text>Bayer is a lunar impact crater located in the southwest section of the moon, to the east of the crater Schiller. The rim of Bayer is slightly worn by erosion, but remains well-defined. There is an inner , but the outer wall is intruded upon by nearby impacts. The most significant of these is Schiller H, which forms a ridge attached to the northwest rim of Bayer. The floor of Bayer is relatively flat and lacks a central peak. There is a small, but notable crater on the floor near the western wall. This crater has a breach in its northern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on Lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bayer.

<text>As of 2024, the People&#x27;s Republic of China has sent three women to space: Liu Yang, Wang Yaping and Wang Haoze all of whom are taikonauts in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Astronaut Corps (PLAAC). Liu Yang, China&#x27;s first female taikonaut, first flew in 2012 aboard Shenzhou 9, and since then four additional missions have included female crew members: Shenzhou 10, 13, 14 and 19. According to the China National Space Administration, many women also hold leadership positions in the Chinese space program, and actively contribute to the Chinese space effort.

==History==
China launched its first crewed space mission, Shenzhou 5, in 2003, with a single male taikonaut (Yang Liwei) aboard. Following the mission&#x27;s success, Gu Xiulian, president of the All-China Women&#x27;s Federation (ACWF), recommended to the Chinese space program that women should be considered for spaceflight selection. This recommendation was accepted, and was publicly announced in early 2004. Women&#x27;s integration into the space program necessitated minor changes to the interior design of the Shenzhou spacecraft to accommodate both male and female taikonauts.

Although women were officially allowed to become taikonauts as of 2004, the first Chinese spaceflight with a female crewmember was not launched until 2012. This mission, Shenzhou 9, included taikonaut Liu Yang as Laboratory Assistant, making her the first Chinese woman to fly in space. Shenzhou 9 was launched on 16 June 2012, the 49th launch anniversary of Vostok 6, the first mission to put a woman (Soviet parachutist Valentina Tereshkova) into space.

On 11 June 2013, Shenzhou 10 launched with taikonaut Wang Yaping aboard as Laboratory Assistant, making her the second Chinese woman in space. Wang Yaping became the first Chinese woman to travel to space twice and the first to visit the Tiangong space station in October of 2021, when she launched aboard Shenzhou 13.

Liu Yang would return to space in 2022, flying aboard Shenzhou 14.

In 2024, Lai Ka-ying was the first Hong Kong resident selected for China’s space programme.

== Female taikonauts ==

=== Liu Yang ===

Liu Yang became the first female Chinese taikonaut in 2012. Throughout her astronautical career, Liu has been awarded the title of “Heroic Astronaut” and received the Third-class Space Service Medal for her work aboard the Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-14 missions, respectively.

Showing exemplary academic performance in her formative schooling years, Liu’s professors signed her up in 1997 to attend the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Air Force Aviation University in Changchun to become a pilot. Liu excelled in her training flying cargo planes and eventually became the Deputy Head of her flying unit. In May 2010, Yang was approached by the PLA’s taikonaut corps with an offer to join.

Liu flew her first mission aboard the Shenzhou-9 in 2012, during which the three-person crew achieved China’s first crewed docking mission by joining with the Tiangong-1 experimental space station. On this mission, Liu performed the first manual docking of the flight and was in charge of medical experiments throughout the flight’s duration. The taikonauts returned 12 days after takeoff.

After returning to Earth, Liu became a representative in the 13th National People’s Congress and the vice president of the All-China Women’s Federation.

Liu returned to space in 2022 aboard the Shenzhou-14, with the goal of staying on the Tiangong space station for six months to oversee the final portions of construction.

=== Wang Yaping ===

Wang Yaping’s space career began in 2013 aboard the Shenzhou-10 where she became the second female taikonaut. During this mission, Wang and her two colleagues successfully docked, undocked, and boarded the Tiangong-1. From the space station, she gave a live-streamed physics lesson to around 80,000 schools, reaching 60 million students and teachers. Wang returned to Earth aboard the Shenzhou-10 15 days after takeoff.

Wang returned to space on the Shenzhou-13 on 15 October 2021, becoming the first female to live onboard the Tiangong space station. On 8 November 2021, she completed a 6.5 hour spacewalk making her the 16th female astronaut and first female taikonaut to do so. Wang returned to Earth aboard the Shenzhou-13 in April 2022, 182 days after takeoff. Wang and her 2 colleagues set a record for most days in orbit by any Taikonaut.

===Wang Haoze===

Wang Haoze was the first Chinese female taikonaut from Group 3. She flew on Shenzhou 19 in October 2024 and is the only female spaceflight engineer. She was also the first female taikonaut of Manchu ethnicity on space.

== Obstacles ==
According to Jun Lu, Senior Engineer at Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology and Deputy Chief Designer of BeiDou Grounded Test and Validation System, “[women’s] qualities of being meticulous, dedicated, responsible and their ability to work under high pressure for a long time” allow them to thrive in the field due to the “high risk and long development cycle” of space technology development. However, Chinese taikonaut academies institute more stringent qualifications for female taikonauts than their male counterparts. Due to fears that childbirth and subsequent family obligations would disrupt training for two to three years, taikonaut academies favor women who are married and already have children. Additionally, women are more closely examined for scars, heavy odors, and decayed teeth, as these traits could cause “disaster” in space.

Prior to the launch of Shenzhou 9, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported a former spaceflight official as claiming that marriage was a requirement for all female Chinese astronauts due to concerns that spaceflight could potentially harm women&#x27;s fertility and also &quot;married women would be more physically and psychologically mature.&quot; However, this requirement has been officially denied by the director of the China Astronaut Centre, stating that this is a preference but not a strict limitation.

When interviewing women taikonauts, the media was more interested in their family lives and female physiology than when interviewing male taikonauts. Questions regarding menstruation are often brought up as well.

Pang Zhihao, a Chinese National Space Administration official, claims women taikonauts should also look their best at all times. He revealed that both Tiangong-1 and Tiangong were stocked with hygiene products and cosmetics during Wang Yaping’s missions. In a video broadcast by China Central Television, he declares that &quot;[f]emale astronauts may be in better condition after putting on makeup”.

== Non-taikonaut personnel ==
A study published in the National Science Review found that women make up a large portion of space engineers working on Chinese missions. The Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System has three Chinese women leading the project as sub-system chief designers, with others filling senior positions such as deputy commanders and deputy chief engineers.

One notable woman working on China’s space program is 24-year-old Zhou Chengyu, the first and youngest female space commander in China. She first began working at the Wenchang site as an operator after she graduated from university at the beginning of 2020 and, by the end of the year, had become the commander of her unit. She worked on the rocket connector system for the Chang’e-5 moon mission, which aimed to collect moon rocks for scientific testing. Chang’e-5 successfully launched in December 2020. Zhou went viral on social media for her accomplishments, with many users calling her a &quot;frontline soldier in the field of aerospace&quot; and a &quot;big sister&quot;.

<text>Chantal Renaud (born 26 August 1946) is a Canadian script writer, and a past yé-yé singer and actress. She was the wife of former Quebec Premier and Parti Québécois leader Bernard Landry.

Renaud began her career as a yé-yé singer, with a hit called &quot;Comme un garçon&quot;, originally performed by Sylvie Vartan, in France. After acting in the sitcom &quot;Moi et l&#x27;autre&quot; and films such as &quot;Here and Now (L&#x27;Initiation)&quot; and &quot;Finalement...&quot;, Renaud relocated to France, where she built a respectable career as an award-winning script writer.

On 26 June 2004, after a courtship of some years, she married the widower former Premier of Quebec and then Parti Québécois leader Bernard Landry. She figures prominently in the 2003 documentary &quot;À Hauteur d&#x27;homme&quot; about the 2003 Quebec general election, during which Landry defended his post as leader of Quebec.

She also portrayed a village woman in &quot;Je T&#x27;aimerai Toujours&quot; in 1969.

<text>Jérôme Bignon (; 1589–1656) was a French lawyer born in Paris.

==Life==
His family originated from the western part of France, and came to Paris at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
He was uncommonly precocious, and under his father&#x27;s tuition had acquired an immense mass of knowledge before he was ten years of age. A work by him entitled &quot;Choréographie, ou description de la Terre Sainte&quot; was published in 1600. The great reputation gained by this book served to introduce the author to Henry IV, who placed him for some time as a companion to the duc de Vendôme, and made him tutor to the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII.

In 1604 he wrote his &quot;Discours de la ville de Rome&quot;, and in the following year his &quot;Traité sommaire de l&#x27;élection du pape&quot;. He then devoted himself to the study of law, and wrote in 1610 a treatise on the precedency of the kings of France, which gave great satisfaction to Henry IV. In 1613, Bignon edited, with learned notes, the &quot;Formulae of Marculf&quot;.

In 1620, he was made advocate-general to the grand council, and shortly afterwards a councillor of state, and in 1626 he became advocate-general to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris. In 1641 he resigned his official dignity, and in 1642 was appointed by Richelieu to the charge of the royal library.

His grandson was intendant of the King (governor) in northern France at the end of the seventeenth century and a descendant, a solicitor also called Jérôme Bignon, is an M.P., elected in the same département of Somme in 2007.

<text>Eddington is the lava-flooded remnant of a lunar impact crater, located on the western part of Oceanus Procellarum. The western rim is attached to the wall of the walled plain Struve. To the east-southeast is the smaller but prominent crater Seleucus. South of Eddington is Krafft.

The south and southeastern rim of Eddington is almost completely gone, leaving only a few ridges and promontories in the lunar mare to trace the outline of the original crater. As a consequence, Eddington is now essentially a bay in the Oceanus Procellarum. The remainder of the rim is worn and irregular, forming a mountainous arc that is widest in the north. The floor is almost free of craters of significance, with the nearly submerged crater Eddington P lying in the southeast sector. If the crater once had a central peak, it is no longer evident.

The crater was named after the British astronomer and mathematician Sir Arthur Eddington.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Eddington.

<text>Markus Antonius Rogan (born 4 May 1982 in Vienna) is a retired Austrian swimmer, who won two silver medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece and a gold medal for 200 m backstroke at the 2008 World Short Course Championships in Manchester. He also was the world record holder in 200 metres backstroke (short course) in that year.

Rogan&#x27;s first big international success was a second-place finish in the 200 m backstroke at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan.

In the Olympics in 2004, Rogan placed second in both men&#x27;s 100 m backstroke and the men&#x27;s 200 m backstroke, both times behind Aaron Peirsol of the United States. The 200 metre race was controversial as Peirsol was first disqualified but later reinstated as gold medalist. Rogan told Peirsol on television that the result was unfair and that Peirsol should protest.

As a teenager, the 6 ft 5 in tall Rogan swam for Mount Vernon High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, where he trained with the Curl-Burke Swim Club. In July 2000, he cut short his final season of the Northern Virginia Swim League, swimming for the Mansion House Piranhas (of Mount Vernon). He flew to Australia and competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, failing to advance beyond the heats in the backstroke.

He earned a scholarship to attend Stanford University from 2000 to 2004. On 8 December 2005, in Trieste, Rogan set a new world record in the 200 m backstroke for short course swim pools, with 1:50.43. This world record was later broken by American swimmer Ryan Lochte. Back on the short course in Short Course World Championships in Manchester, Rogan broke the world record again on 13 April 2008, in a time of 1:47.84, with Lochte finishing second by seven one-hundredths of a second (also under the old world record). Both swimmers were wearing the new Speedo LZR Racer swimsuit.

At the 2008 European Championships in Eindoven, The Netherlands, in March 2008, Rogan told reporters that he was planning to retire after the Beijing Olympics in August. He won both the 100 and 200 metre backstroke events (long course) at those European Championships.

In the meantime, Rogan changed his plans on retirement. He swam at the World Championships in 2009 in Rome. He was training in Italy and wanted to enjoy the home event with his Italian training partners.

At the 2010 European championships he won silver in the 200 m IM behind Olympic Silver medalist László Cseh. Rogan competed in his last Olympic games in London in 2012.

He is now a psychologist working with athletes. He was the director of performance psychology for the Brazilian Olympic Team in Rio de Janeiro, 2016.

In 2020, Markus secretly escaped Israel, after testing positive for COVID-19, breaking the law and resulting in his immediate dismissal from his post as performance psychology coach for the Jewish state’s national soccer team, violating government regulations that prohibit confirmed COVID-19 patients from breaking quarantine, and went to Ben Gurion Airport. 

He is married to Leanne Cobb, a marketing executive who was born in South Africa. They live together in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="937877" wikidata="Q536709" url="?curid=937877" title="Angelo State University">
<text>Angelo State University is a public university in San Angelo, Texas, United States. It was founded in 1928 as San Angelo College. It gained university status and awarded its first baccalaureate degrees in 1967 and graduate degrees in 1969, the same year it took on its current name. It offers 50 undergraduate programs and 31 graduate programs. It is the second-largest campus in the Texas Tech University System.

==History==

The history of ASU can be traced to 1928, when San Angelo College was established following a municipal election held in 1926. Organized as part of the city school system, for many years, the two-year college occupied a site on North Oakes Street near the commercial center of the city. The voters of Tom Green County in 1945 created a county junior college district and elected the first board of trustees. In 1947, the first building was constructed on the present university site.

The university has experienced a rapid transition from a regional junior college to an accredited senior institution of higher learning. Pushed through the legislature by State Senator Dorsey B. Hardeman, a former mayor of San Angelo, the former San Angelo College was transformed into Angelo State College in 1965 by an act of the 58th Session of the Texas State Legislature in 1963. The transfer of authority from the board of trustees of the junior college to the Board of Regents, State Senior Colleges, became effective on September 1, 1965. In May 1967, the first baccalaureate degrees were awarded. Shortly after Hardeman retired from the Texas Senate, the name of the institution was changed to Angelo State University in May 1969.
The graduate program was initiated in 1970 with the start of the university&#x27;s College of Graduate Studies. During a major realignment of the Texas University systems, Angelo State University was designated as a member of the Texas State University System in 1975, along with Sam Houston State University, Southwest Texas State University, and Sul Ross State University, when the 64th Texas Legislature changed the name of the governing board to Board of Regents, Texas State University System.

In the fall of 2007, the Alumni Association voted to request a move to the Texas Tech University System from the Texas State University System.
The merger received widespread support in San Angelo and Lubbock, where Texas Tech University is located. The bill was approved, signed by Gov. Rick Perry, and voted into the Texas Constitution by the electorate, making Angelo State University accountable to the Texas Tech System Board of Regents in late 2007.

The first doctoral program, the doctorate of physical therapy through the College of Nursing and Allied Health, was offered in 2009.

Angelo State completed its first capital campaign in 2013, raising $35 million for facility construction, scholarships, and academic support. After reaching the original goal of $25 million in the first 15 months of the campaign, the goal was raised to $35 million, which was reached in June 2013.

==Academics==

Angelo State&#x27;s students come from all across Texas with an additional 46 states and 22 other countries also represented in the university&#x27;s total enrollment. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
Of the over 3,000 universities nationwide, Angelo State University ranked 85th in endowment funds per student. The interest earned from the endowment goes towards scholarships and academic support.

Angelo State University offers 35 minor programs, 50 bachelor&#x27;s, 31 master&#x27;s, and one doctoral degree program. The graduate school at Angelo State was authorized by the Board of Regents, State Senior Colleges, on May 15, 1970, and approved by The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board on October 19, 1970. In 2009, the university was authorized by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to offer doctoral level degrees, starting with a doctorate in physical therapy.

Angelo State University is divided into six colleges, including the Norris-Vincent College of Business, College of Education, College of Arts and Humanities, Archer College of Health and Human Services, College of Science and Engineering, and College of Graduate Studies and Research.

==Traditions==
===Ram Jam===

The official Ram Jam was started by the Alumni Association in 2003 and has grown to become the large pregame football tailgating parties they are today. During the fall semester outside the LeGrand Alumni Center, students, alumni, and community members park their cars in the parking lot and hang out around the center to grill and socialize. The events also feature local bands to provide entertainment, free food and refreshments, bounce houses and other games for kids, and alcoholic beverages for those 21 and up. The Ram Band, the ASU dance team, the Angelettes, and the ASU Cheerleaders also perform and everyone walks over to the stadium prior to the game.

===Ring ceremony===
Prior to each commencement, the ASU Alumni Association hosts a ring ceremony where the university president presents class rings to recipients. Appearing at each ceremony is ASU&#x27;s mascot, Dominic. After receiving their rings, recipients touch their rings to Dominic&#x27;s horns for strength, or rub them through his wool for luck. Though Angelo State rings have existed since the beginning of the university, a new official ASU ring was introduced by the ASU Alumni Society in 2003. The top of the Angelo State class ring presents the ASU seal. One side of the ring shows the State of Texas with a star marking San Angelo; below that is an oak branch. On the other side is an image of the mascot, Dominic.
===Mascots===

Angelo State&#x27;s ram went by a variety of names until 1963, when the student body held an election to decide on a permanent moniker, and &quot;Dominic&quot; won out. Today, Dominic is a regular fixture at ASU activities, ranging from the ring ceremony to outdoor athletic events. He is typically kept close to the end zone at Angelo State football games.

Two costumed mascots, Roscoe and Bella, appear at most athletic events and many community activities, where they lead cheers and interact with students and fans. Roscoe has appeared at many games since the 1960s courtesy of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, one of the oldest and most active fraternities on the ASU campus. Bella made her debut in October 2010, supported by the Delta Zeta she appears with Roscoe and the ASU cheerleaders at most athletic and student-body events.

==Notable people==
Angelo State University alumni have gone on to succeed in professions on the state and national levels. They include major executives at &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies, Emmy award-nominated actors, Grammy Award-winning musicians, Super Bowl winners, authors of number-one books on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list, Texas Supreme Court justices, Texas state representatives and senators, and United States congressmen.

<text>Jesús María Rojas Alou (, March 24, 1942 – March 10, 2023) was a Dominican professional baseball outfielder. During a 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played for the San Francisco Giants (1963–68), the Houston Astros (1969–73; 1978–79), the Oakland Athletics (1973–74), and the New York Mets (1975). He was the youngest of a trio of baseball-playing brothers that included Felipe and Matty.

==Playing career==
Alou was considered a better prospect than either of his brothers and received a $4,000 signing bonus from the San Francisco Giants. He made his major league debut with the Giants late in the 1963 season. In his first game, on September 10, all three Alou brothers batted in the same inning (they were retired in order). Five days later, for the first time, the three played in the outfield for the Giants at the same time. The latter achievement happened in the last two innings of a 13–5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field, with starting right fielder Felipe first moving to left in the seventh inning when Jesús entered the game in right and then to center in the eighth when Matty was inserted in left.

In 1964, his first full year in the major leagues, Alou batted .274 with little power, but on July 10, he went 6-for-6 with five singles and a home run. Alou was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 1968 MLB expansion draft and then was traded to the Houston Astros with Donn Clendenon for Rusty Staub. In the 1970 season, Alou hit .306 in 487 at-bats, with a career-best 21 walks, but little power (only 1 homerun).

With the emergence of younger players in the Astros&#x27; outfield such as Bob Watson and Cesar Cedeño, Alou was no longer a regular outfielder after the 1971 season. As a reserve outfielder and pinch-hitter, he hit .312 in 52 games in the 1972 season. On July 31, 1973, the Astros traded Alou to the Oakland Athletics for a player to be named later. He served as a bench player for the Athletics on two World Series championship teams. Alou was released by the Athletics towards the end of March 1975, before the start of the season, and he signed with the New York Mets on April 10. He batted .265 as a pinch hitter for the Mets, and they released Alou before the 1976 season. In 1976, Alou played for Córdoba of the Mexican League. Houston once again signed Alou in . He responded by hitting .324 in part-time action and became a player-coach the following year before retiring.

==Post-playing career==
Alou later served as a scout for the Expos, then moved to the Florida Marlins as the club&#x27;s director of Dominican operations. He held the same post with the Boston Red Sox from through , then moved to a part-time role as special assistant and then ambassador to the Red Sox&#x27; international scouting and player development department through 2020.

Alou was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame Pioneer Award at a pre-game ceremony at Minute Maid Park, on September 23, 2008.

==Personal life==
Alou married Angela Hanley. They had five children and lived in the Dominican Republic.

Alou died on March 10, 2023, at age 80.

He was born in Frankfurt am Main. In 1832, Meyer issued a work entitled &quot;Palaeologica&quot;, and went on to publish a series of memoirs on various fossil organic remains: molluscs, crustaceans, fishes and higher vertebrata, including the Triassic predator &quot;Teratosaurus&quot;, the earliest bird &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot; (1861), the pterosaur &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, and the prosauropod dinosaur &quot;Plateosaurus&quot;.

In &quot;Palaeologica&quot;, Meyer proposed a classification of fossil reptiles into four major groups based on their limbs:
*Saurians with Toes Similar to those of Living Species (e.g.&quot;Teleosaurus&quot;, &quot;Protorosaurus&quot;, &quot;Streptospondylus&quot;)
*Saurians with Limbs Similar to Heavy Land Mammals (&quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;)
*Saurians with Limbs for Swimming (e.g. &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;)
*Saurians with Flying Limbs (&quot;Pterodactylus&quot;)

His second group he belatedly termed &quot;Pachypodes&quot; in 1845, later revising to &quot;Pachypoda&quot;, from the Greek &quot;pachy-/παχυ-&quot; (&quot;stout&quot;) and &quot;pous/πους&quot; (&quot;foot&quot;). He postulated the relation of this group to &quot;Dinosauria&quot;, coined a few years earlier by Richard Owen.

His more elaborate researches were those on the Carboniferous amphibia, the Permian reptiles, the Triassic amphibia and reptiles, and the reptiles of the Lithographic slates; and the results were embodied in his great work &quot;Zur Fauna der Vorwelt&quot; (1845–1860), profusely illustrated with plates drawn on stone by the author.

He was associated with W Dunker and Karl Alfred von Zittel in the publication of the &quot;Palaeontographica&quot;, which began in 1851. He was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London in 1858. Two years later, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Today, Meyer is probably best known for describing and naming the prosauropod dinosaur &quot;Plateosaurus engelhardti&quot; from Central Europe.

<text>Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay (sometimes spelt Ramsey) (31 January 18149 December 1891) was a Scottish geologist.
==Biography==
Ramsay was born at Glasgow. He was for a time actually engaged in business, but from spending his holidays in Arran he became interested in the study of the rocks of that island, and was thus led to acquire the rudiments of geology. A geological model of Arran, made by him on the scale of two inches to the mile, was exhibited at the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1840, and attracted the notice of Roderick Murchison, with the result that he received, from Sir Henry De la Beche, an appointment on the Geological Survey, on which he served for forty years, from 1841 to 1881.

He was first stationed at Tenby, and to that circumstance may be attributed the fact that so much of his geological work dealt with Wales. His first book, &quot;The Geology of the Isle of Arran&quot;, was published in 1841. In 1845 he became local director for Great Britain, but he continued to carry on a certain amount of field-work until 1854. To the first volume of the &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot; (1846) he contributed a now classic essay, &quot;On the Denudation of South Wales and the Adjacent Counties of England&quot;, in which he advocated the power of the sea to form great plains of denudation, although at the time he underestimated the influence of subaerial agents in sculpturing the scenery. In 1866 he published &quot;The Geology of North Wales&quot; (vol. iii. of the Memoirs), assisted by John William Salter who contributed the palaeontological portion to this work and of which a second edition was published in 1881.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

He was chosen as a professor of geology at University College, London, in 1848, and afterwards as a lecturer in the same subject at the Royal School of Mines in 1851. Eleven years later he was elected to the presidential chair of the Geological Society of London, and in 1872 he succeeded Murchison as director-general of the Geological Survey. In 1880 he acted as president of the British Association at Swansea, and in the following year retired from the public service, receiving at the same time the honour of knighthood. In 1860 he published a book entitled &quot;The Old Glaciers of Switzerland and North Wales&quot;. The study of this subject led him to discuss the &quot;Glacial Origin of Certain Lakes in Switzerland, the Black Forest, &amp;c&quot;. He dealt also with the origin of &quot;The Red Rocks of England&quot; (1871) and &quot;The River Courses of England and Wales&quot; (1872).

He was especially interested in tracing out the causes which have determined the physical configuration of a district, and he devoted much attention to the effects produced by ice, his name being identified with the hypothesis, which, however, has never commanded general assent, that in some cases lake basins have been scooped out by glaciers. A master in the broader questions of stratigraphy and physical geology, he was a deal exponent of facts, but rather impatient of details, while his original and often bold theories, expressed both in lectures and in writings, stirred others with enthusiasm and undoubtedly exercised great influence on the progress of geology.

His lectures to working men, given in 1863 in the Museum of Practical Geology, formed the nucleus of his &quot;Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain&quot; (5th ed., 1878; 6th ed., by H. B. Woodward, 1894). He received a Royal medal in 1880 from the Royal Society, of which he became a fellow in 1862; he was also the recipient of the Neil prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1866, and of the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London in 1871. He died at Beaumaris in Anglesey and is buried at St Sadwrn&#x27;s church in Llansadwrn where his grave is marked by a glacial erratic boulder.

<text>Schiller is a lunar impact crater located in the southwestern region of the Moon&#x27;s near side. The rim of Schiller has an elongated shape that is amplified by its proximity to the lunar limb. The long axis lies along a line running northwest–southeast, with the wider girth located in the southeastern half. There is a slight bend in the elongation, with the concave side facing to the northeast. Schiller is thought to be a fusion of two or more craters.

The crater rim is well-defined, with a terraced inner wall and a slight outer rampart. At the southeastern end, a smaller crater is connected to Schiller by a wide valley. Most of the crater floor is flat, most likely due to lava flooding. There are some bright patches that are most clearly visible under a high sun angle. A double ridge lies along the center of the northwest crater floor, forming a nearly linear formation that divides the floor in half.

To the southwest of Schiller is the Schiller-Zucchius Basin, a Pre-Nectarian basin (peak ring basin). This basin has received the unofficial designation &#x27;Schiller Annular Plain&#x27; among lunar observers.

== Satellite craters ==
Satellite craters are small craters located near the main crater, receiving the same name as that crater accompanied by a complementary capital letter (even if the formation of these craters is independent of the formation of the main crater).

<doc id="937890" wikidata="Q7387095" url="?curid=937890" title="S-bot mobile robot">
<text>The s-bot is a small (15 cm) differential wheeled (with additional tracks) mobile robot developed at the LIS (Laboratory of Intelligent Systems) at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland between 2001 and 2004. Targeted to swarm robotics, a field of artificial intelligence, it was developed within the Swarm-bots project, a Future and Emerging Technologies project coordinated by Prof. Marco Dorigo. Built by a small team of engineers (Francesco Mondada, André Guignard, Michael Bonani and Stéphane Magnenat) of the group of Prof. Dario Floreano and with the help of student projects, it is considered at the time of completion as one of the most complex and featured robots ever for its size. The s-bot was ranked on position 39 in the list of “The 50 Best Robots Ever” (fiction or real) by the Wired magazine in 2006.

== Purpose and use of the s-bot ==
This is a research robot, aimed at studying teamwork and inter-robot communication. To do this, the s-bots have several special abilities:
* Using their gripper (red in the photos), they can connect. Then they can, for instance, pass over gap and steps where a single robot would have failed.
* Using their integrated force sensor, they can coordinate to retrieve an object to a certain location without the use of explicit communication. This is the way ants bring preys to the nest.
Of course, all other sensors and actuators, also found on other robots, can be used to do teamwork such as food foraging.

== Technical details ==
=== General ===
* 12 cm diameter
* 15 cm height
* 660 g
* 2 LiIon batteries
* 1 hour autonomy moving

=== Control ===
* 400 MHz custom XScale CPU board, 64 MB of RAM, 32 MB of flash memory
* 12 distributed PIC microcontroller for low-level handling
* Custom Linux port running Familiar
* Wi-Fi

=== Actuators ===
* 2 treels
* turret rotation
* rigid gripper elevation
* rigid gripper
* 3 axis side arm
* side arm gripper

=== Sensors ===
* 15 infrared sensors around the turret
* 4 infrared sensors below the robot
* position sensors on all degrees of freedom except gripper
* force and speed sensors on all major degrees of freedom
* 2 humidity sensors
* 2 temperature sensors
* 8 ambient light sensors around the turret
* 4 accelerometers, which allow three-dimensional orientation
* 1 640×480 camera sensor. Custom optic based on spherical mirror provides omnidirectional vision
* 4 microphones
* 2 axis structure deformation sensors
* optical barrier in grippers

=== LEDS ===
* 8 × RGB Light-emitting diodes around the turret
* red Light-emitting diodes in grippers

== Special abilities ==
S-bots can connect to other s-bots to create a bigger structure known as the swarm-bot. To do so, they attach together using their rigid gripper and ring. An s-bot has sufficient force to lift another one.

== Integrated software ==
The s-bot features a custom Linux port running the Familiar Linux distribution. All sensors and actuators are easily accessible through a simple C API.

<text>Karl Alfred Ritter von Zittel (25 September 1839 – 5 January 1904) was a German palaeontologist best known for his &quot;Handbuch der Palaeontologie&quot; (1876–1880).

== Biography ==
Karl Alfred von Zittel was born in Bahlingen in the Grand Duchy of Baden. His father, Karl was a leading liberal cleric in Baden. He was educated at the University of Heidelberg, the University of Paris and the University of Vienna. For a short period he served on the Geological Survey of Austria, and as assistant in the mineralogical museum at Vienna. In 1863, he became teacher of geology and mineralogy in the polytechnic at Karlsruhe, and three years later he succeeded Albert Oppel as professor of palaeontology in the University of Munich, with the charge of the state collection of fossils.

In 1873–1874, he accompanied the Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs&#x27;s expedition to the Libyan Desert, the primary results of which were published in &quot;Über den geologischen Bau der libyschen Wuste&quot; (1880), and further details in the &quot;Palaeontographica&quot; (1883). Zittel was distinguished for his palaeontological researches. From 1869 until the close of his life he was chief editor of the &quot;Palaeontographica&quot;.

In 1876, he commenced the publication of his great work, &quot;Handbuch der Palaeontologie&quot;, which was completed in 1893 in five volumes, the fifth volume on palaeobotany being prepared by W. P. Schimper and A. Schenk. To make his work as trustworthy as possible Zittel made special studies of each great group, commencing with the fossil sponges, on which he published a monograph (1877–1879). In 1895, he issued a summary of his larger work entitled &quot;Grundzuge der Palaeontologie&quot;.

In 1880, Zittel was appointed to the geological professorship, and eventually to the directorship of the natural history museum of Munich. His earlier work comprised a monograph on the &quot;Cretaceous bivalve mollusca of Gosau&quot; (1863–1866); and an essay on the Tithonian stage (1870), regarded as equivalent to the Purbeck Group and Wealden formations.

==Publications and honours==
Zittel published &quot;Aus der Urzeit&quot; and &quot;Die Sahara&quot; (1883). In 1899, he published &quot;Geschichte der Geologie und Palaeontologie bis Ende des 19 Jahrhunderts&quot;, a monumental history of the progress of geological science. Zittel was president of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences from 1899, and in 1894 he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He was elected an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1903.

<text>The national anthem of Kuwait () was written by poet Ahmad Meshari Al-Adwani with music composed by Ibrahim Al-Soula and arranged by Ahmad Ali. It was first broadcast on 25 February 1978. Prior to 1978, the &quot;Amiri Salute&quot; was used.

==History and use==
Although the anthem was chosen during the reign of Sheikh Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, it was not used in his era due to his death on 31 December 1977. As it was scheduled to start using the anthem on the day of the celebration of Kuwait’s National Day, and at that time the mourning period for the former Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah was completed.

The anthem is played every day at the beginning of the day in most Kuwaiti schools and on TV and radio stations.

<doc id="937903" wikidata="Q1025371" url="?curid=937903" title="Caedmon's Call">
<text>Caedmon&#x27;s Call is a contemporary Christian band that fused traditional folk with world music and alternative rock. They were composed of Cliff Young (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Derek Webb (lead vocals, guitar), Danielle Young (vocals), Garett Buell (percussion), Jeff Miller (bass guitar), Todd Bragg (drums), and Josh Moore (keyboard, accordion, harmonica).

After membership turnover and an 11-year hiatus, the original line-up reformed in 2022 and, with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, re-recorded their major label debut eponymous album and performed a reunion concert at the Ryman Auditorium.

==History==
Caedmon&#x27;s Call was formed in 1993 with six original members, Cliff Young (whose father and brother are highly successful pastors of megachurches), Danielle Glenn, Todd Bragg, Cari Harris, Doug Elmore, and Aaron Tate. Tate, however, never intended to tour with the band, and was included in a songwriting capacity only. Derek Webb also joined the band early on, though he did not even meet all the band members until after they had played their first show together. In June 1994, the band released their first album, &quot;My Calm // Your Storm&quot;, originally a cassette-only demo recording. Webb connected high-school friend and drummer Garett Buell with the band. &quot;My Calm // Your Storm&quot; was re-issued twice the same year with different cover art each time. In 1996 the band signed with now-defunct Christian label Warner Alliance, producing their self-titled major label debut. Around this time, Randy Holsapple joined the group.

After the collapse of Warner Alliance in 1998, the band signed to Essential Records, where they remained until May 2006. In 2000 through 2003 they were part of the four &quot;City on a Hill&quot; releases: &quot;Songs of Praise and Worship&quot; and &quot;The Gathering&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime&quot; and &quot;Sing Alleluia&quot;.

In mid-1999, both Aric Nitzberg and Randy Holsapple left the band, while Joshua Moore and Jeff Miller (high-school friend of Buell and Webb) became official members. In 2003, after the release of &quot;Back Home&quot;, Webb left the band to pursue a solo career. In early 2004, Andrew Osenga, former lead singer of the Normals joined.

Tate and Webb shared most of the songwriting duties until the album &quot;Back Home&quot;, which featured songs by a more diverse set of writers. Randall Goodgame has, in the proceeding years, become one of the band&#x27;s primary songwriters.

&quot;Share the Well&quot; was released in 2004 as a missions album. Well-received by critics but unable to find a radio audience, the album, which includes songs written by Goodgame, Osenga and Moore, was inspired by the band&#x27;s trip to India, Brazil and Ecuador. In addition to broader Christian themes, it tackles a variety of issues, such as hunger and the Dalit&#x27;s battle for freedom in India.

===Meaning behind the name===
The band&#x27;s unusual name was inspired by Cædmon, an Anglo-Saxon cow-herder and monk who lived during the 7th century. Legend has it that Caedmon was afraid to sing in public due to a lack of musical talent, and shied away from occasions where he had to sing. After leaving a feast one night because he was too embarrassed to sing, he lay down in the pasture with the cattle to sleep. An angel appeared to him in a dream, calling him to sing. After initially refusing, he eventually decided to sing and when he did, he sang beautiful verses that had never been heard before. His songs were in the local vernacular language at a time when all other Christian songs were in Latin. Founding band members Cliff, Danielle, and Aaron decided on the name &quot;Caedmon&#x27;s Call&quot; after all three heard this story during the same week and thought it was fitting.

==Musical evolution==
Over the years, Caedmon&#x27;s Call have enveloped and adapted many different musical stylings, the most obvious being their folk and alternative rock roots. On their first mainstream, self-titled release (&quot;Caedmon&#x27;s Call&quot;), the band utilized stylings that ranged from straight-up folk-rock (&quot;Lead of Love&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;), rock (&quot;Not the Land&quot;), folk (&quot;This World&quot;, &quot;Bus Driver&quot;), and simple acoustic guitar ballads (&quot;Center Aisle&quot;). 

Their second album, &quot;40 Acres&quot;, made after the dissolution of Warner Alliance, has a more settled folk-rock sound. Songs such as the Derek Webb-penned &quot;Thankful&quot;, for instance, took advantage of those folk-rock stylings, relying heavily on percussion.

&quot;Long Line of Leavers&quot;, their third wide-release album, became something of a milestone for the band, including a wider range of instrumentation and stylings. &quot;The Only One&quot; featured a brass accompaniment, something Caedmon&#x27;s Call had never experimented with before, whereas &quot;The Ballad of San Francisco&quot; was debatably the most folkish song ever included on a Caedmon&#x27;s Call album. &quot;Prove Me Wrong&quot; was a simple guitar-driven pop song, while &quot;What You Want&quot; stands in the tradition of &quot;Not the Land&quot; as upbeat rock-and-roll.

The albums &quot;In the Company of Angels: A Call to Worship&quot; and &quot;Back Home&quot; came during an interim phase in which Aaron Tate and Derek Webb were mostly inactive as song writers for the band, Aaron only contributing lyrics for the song &quot;Beautiful Mystery&quot; on &quot;Back Home&quot; and Derek&#x27;s former wife Sandra McCracken contributing music and lyrics for &quot;Awake My Soul&quot; to that record as well. A diverse array of songwriters provided material for the band. These albums, while still largely driven by the acoustic guitar, were characterized by simpler lyrics and melodies than the band&#x27;s past material, and more of an adult contemporary feel that did not sit well with most older fans. Many felt the source of the band&#x27;s relevance to be the hard-hitting, deeply introspective lyrics penned by Tate and Webb, which often included common and obscure Biblical, historical, and popular references cast in new contexts. Caedmon&#x27;s was often billed or described as &quot;a thinking Christian&#x27;s band.&quot; Lacking these kinds of lyrics, and with the band adopting a blander CCM sound, many fans began looking elsewhere.

In 2004, &quot;Share the Well&quot; proved to be a notable artistic leap for the band. Caedmon&#x27;s Call decided to incorporate world music influences into the album during mission trips with Compassion International to India, Ecuador, and Brazil. The Indian influence was most prominent on this album, with several Dalit musicians providing instruments and vocals. In addition to Randall Goodgame, Josh Moore and Andrew Osenga emerged as the new primary songwriters for the band. 

In 2006, Caedmon&#x27;s released &quot;In the Company of Angels II: The World Will Sing&quot;. This sequel to the first &quot;In the Company of Angels&quot; was recorded despite the band&#x27;s lack of desire to make the album under pressure from their record label. It was the last album that the band made for Essential Records, before parting ways with the label in May 2006. The band is now associated with INO Records, and named their fall 2006 tour &quot;The Emancipation Tour&quot;--possibly in part a reference to their split from their former label.

For most of the band&#x27;s tenure, lead vocals were split somewhat evenly between Cliff Young and Derek Webb. Cliff would usually sing lead on the Aaron Tate songs (he didn&#x27;t typically write his own songs for the group, though he played a large part in the arrangements), and Derek would sing lead on the songs that he wrote, which were often more personal in nature. Danielle typically sang lead on two to four songs per album; until 2010&#x27;s &quot;Raising Up the Dead&quot;, &quot;Piece of Glass&quot; (co-written with Webb) was the only song that she had written for the band. Once Derek Webb ceased writing songs for the band in the years leading up to his departure, Cliff emerged as the primary vocalist for the band, a role that he retained, though Danielle had been able to sing lead more frequently as a result of this. The band&#x27;s newest vocalist, Andrew Osenga, sang lead four times on the first two albums he participated in; on the song &quot;Bombay Rain&quot; and the hidden track &quot;I Miss You&quot;, both of which he wrote for &quot;Share the Well&quot;, and on &quot;The Story&quot; and &quot;We Give Thanks&quot;, from &quot;In the Company of Angels II&quot;. 

On May 22, 2007, it was announced in a press release that Caedmon&#x27;s Call&#x27;s first INO release, &quot;Overdressed&quot;, would be released in late August 2007. This same press release announced Derek Webb had returned to work on the album after a four-year absence. His replacement, Andrew Osenga, remained in the band as well. On the album &quot;Overdressed&quot;, Osenga was featured as the lead vocalist on four tracks. 

In January 2008 the band&#x27;s song Ten Thousand Angels was featured in an episode of Grey&#x27;s Anatomy (Season 4, Episode 11: Lay Your Hands On Me) while several different scenes played.

In August 2009, Andy Osenga announced that he would not be part of the next album, &quot;Raising Up the Dead&quot;. The album was released for pre-sale on August 2, 2010 in a tiered pricing structure. &quot;Raising Up the Dead&quot; was an attempt to keep most of the songwriting in-house; Derek Webb returned to contribute on the album, as well as Derek&#x27;s former wife, Sandra McCracken being the only songwriter from outside the band to contribute. Unusually, Danielle co-wrote and sang lead on six of the album&#x27;s twelve songs, with the remainder of the lead vocals being evenly split between Cliff and Derek.

Caedmon&#x27;s Call joined Brite Revolution and, for a time, released a new (or old, or rare) track. Members of Brite can help support one of Caedmon&#x27;s most passionate missions, the Dalit Freedom Network. After a smaller tour for &quot;Raising Up the Dead&quot;, the band has been largely inactive.

==2022 Reunion==
After an 11-year hiatus, the band announced via a Kickstarter campaign that they were reuniting to re-record their 1997 self-titled album, which had since fallen out of print, in commemoration of its 25-year anniversary. The album&#x27;s release date was November 3, 2022. Additionally, the band also played special performances at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville to commemorate the anniversary.

<text>The River Annan () is a river in south-west Scotland. It rises on Annanhead Hill and flows through the Devil&#x27;s Beef Tub, Moffat and Lockerbie, reaching the sea at Annan, Dumfries and Galloway after about 40 miles.

== Name==
The etymology of the River Annan is unknown, although some sources suggest it may mean simply &quot;water&quot;, from a Celtic language. It gave its name to Annandale, a former stewartry comprising a large portion of modern Dumfriesshire, and to the port town of Annan near its mouth.

==Description==
The Annan rises on Annanhead Hill, five miles north of Moffat, near the source of the Tweed ( away), and also close to the source of the Clyde ( away). It then flows through the Devil&#x27;s Beef Tub, where it is joined by a secondary source that rises on Hartfell. It then flows past the town of Moffat and Lockerbie. Two miles out of Moffat, it is joined by the Moffat Water flowing westward from Loch Skene and the Evan Water flowing eastward from the upper part of Lanarkshire. Below this, it is joined by the Kinnel Water from the west and the Dryfe Water from the east. It reaches the sea past the port of Annan. Newbie Harbour on the River Annan once served the Barony of Newbie and lay where the Old Mill Burn has its confluence with the river.

==Popular culture==
The Annan makes several appearances in folk songs from the Borders, and in most appears as a malevolent force, drowning those who try to cross it. One of the most well recorded is &quot;Annan Waters&quot; (Child 215). Versions of this song have been recorded by artists including Nic Jones and Kate Rusby.

In online comic &quot;Gunnerkrigg Court&quot;, the &quot;Annan Waters&quot; are a river separating the Court from the Gillitie Forest, and mark the separation between technology/science and magic/nature.

The Decemberists recorded a song entitled &quot;Annan Water&quot; on their 2009 folk opera concept album &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;.

<doc id="937909" wikidata="Q2484536" url="?curid=937909" title="Minnesota State Highway 36">
<text>Minnesota State Highway 36 (MN 36) is a highway in the U.S. state of Minnesota, which runs from its interchange with Interstate 35W (I-35W) in Roseville and continues east to its eastern terminus at the Wisconsin state line (near Stillwater), where it becomes Wisconsin Highway 64 (WIS 64) upon crossing the St. Croix River at the St. Croix Crossing bridge. MN 36 is a major freeway in suburban Minneapolis–Saint Paul from its western terminus to its intersection with MN 120, at which point it becomes an at-grade expressway.

Historically, MN 36 traveled on a north-south course through Minneapolis before heading east toward Stillwater. Since its terminus moved to I-35W in 1980, growth and development has seen the highway becoming more of a freeway, with controlled intersections being rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges.

Washington County is currently leading a project to replace the controlled intersection at MN 36 and County State-Aid Highway 17 (CSAH 17, Lake Elmo Avenue) in Grant and Lake Elmo. As of May 2024, three interchange designs are being considered. The county has also requested $3 million in state funding for to design an interchange at the intersection of MN 36 and MN 120.

==Route description==

MN 36 serves as an east–west highway between the cities of Roseville, Little Canada, Maplewood, North St. Paul, Oakdale, Oak Park Heights, and Stillwater. MN 36 is a controlled-access freeway from its interchange with I-35W in Roseville eastward to MN 120 in North St. Paul and Oakdale. Near Rosedale Center, MN 36 has a junction with MN 51 (Snelling Avenue). It then meets County Road 42 (CR 42, Rice Street) at an offset single-point urban interchange. The highway intersects I-35E in Little Canada. It straddles the border with and crosses into Maplewood, where it meets U.S. Highway 61 (US 61). The portion of MN 36 in North St. Paul is known as the Officer Richard Crittenden, Sr. Memorial Highway.

The freeway section ends at a signal-controlled intersection with MN 120. MN 36 then becomes an at-grade expressway. It proceeds through Oakdale before an interchange with I-694 in Pine Springs. For about outside of the I-494/I-694 loop, the expressway section of MN 36 has a speed limit of . It passes the cities of Grant and Lake Elmo before reaching Stillwater and Oak Park Heights. MN 36 crosses the St. Croix River via the St. Croix Crossing bridge and becomes WIS 64 upon crossing the state line into Wisconsin.

==History==
MN 36 was authorized in 1933. Legally, it is defined as Legislative Route 118. The route is not marked with this number. At this time, MN 36 was significantly longer, running between Richfield and a point west of Stillwater. The route was a paved road from its junction with MN 5 northward to the Minneapolis city limits. It was known as Cedar Avenue for most of its course in Minneapolis. It then turned to the east on a bituminous surface until it reached US 61, at which point it became a gravel road to its terminus with US 212 near Stillwater. By 1941, the entire highway was paved with at least bitumen. Excluding within Minneapolis and the portion between MN 49 and US 61, the entirety of the route was a four-lane divided highway.

MN 36 did not originally reach the Wisconsin state line at the St. Croix River. Part of old MN 212 in Oak Park Heights and Stillwater was renumbered as MN 36 in 1960. By 1962, MN 36 extended past MN 5 and continued through Bloomington, ending at a junction with MN 13 in Eagan. The portion of MN 36 south of MN 62 was redesignated as a part of MN 77 in 1980. The former highway between MN 62 and I-35W reverted to county control as CR 152 (Cedar Avenue).
The section of MN 36 in North St. Paul was closed in 2007 from April to September. The highway was rebuilt to freeway standards during this time between White Bear Avenue in Maplewood and MN 120 (Century Avenue) in North St. Paul. The changes included turning the intersection with CR 68 (McKnight Road) into a grade-separated interchange and building an overpass at Margaret Street, removing its access to MN 36. The full closure in 2007 allowed the project to be completed more quickly and at a lower cost than a staged reconstruction. It also increased safety for construction workers. The MN 36 reconstruction project in North St. Paul was completed in 2008. The budget of the project was $24 million.

In 2010, the existing diamond interchange at CR 49 (Rice Street) in Roseville was replaced with an offset single-point urban interchange with an estimated cost of $27 million. This was intended to reduce safety and capacity issues. The project also included the widening of Rice Street and the addition of bike lanes and sidewalks. Construction ended in late 2011. Construction of a new tight diamond interchange at English Street started in 2013 to replace an existing controlled intersection. A trail bridge was also built for the Bruce Vento Regional Trail; the total cost of the project was $17.3 million. An interchange was constructed in 2014 at MN 36 and CSAH 29 (Hilton Trail) in Pine Springs. The project also included two roundabouts on Hilton Trail on either side of the highway, one at 60th Street North and another at an extension of Viking Drive.

The Minnesota Legislature passed a bill in 2014 designating MN 36 in North St. Paul as the Officer Richard Crittenden Sr. Memorial Highway, honoring a North St. Paul officer killed in the line of duty in 2009. Prior to August 2017, upon reaching the St. Croix River, MN 36 merged with, and ran concurrently with MN 95 north into downtown Stillwater. At Chestnut St., MN 36 turned east and crossed the St. Croix River on the historic Stillwater Lift Bridge. The Stillwater Bridge had to be closed frequently for repairs, and at over 80 years old was deemed obsolete and vulnerable to failure.

On August 2, 2017, the new St. Croix Crossing bridge opened and MN 36 now uses this bridge to cross into Wisconsin, eliminating its concurrency with MN 95. The bridge was designed around concerns for the environment and scenery. For example, the interchange with MN 95 was routed around a bald eagle nest. The St. Croix Crossing bridge uses an uncommon extradosed design with shorter towers than a suspension bridge that keeps the height lower than the river bluffs. Upon completion, it was the longest extradosed bridge in the United States. Since its construction, the bridge has led to a significant uptick in the number of vehicles traveling on MN 36.

In 2019, construction began on a $22 million interchange at MN 36 and CSAH 13 (Hadley Avenue) in Oakdale, partially as a result of high crash rates. As a part of the project, one roundabout was constructed on each side of the overpass, with one more being built at 56th Street. Construction finished in 2020. A partial cloverleaf interchange was constructed in 2021 at the intersection of MN 36 and CSAH 15 north (Manning Avenue) just west of Stillwater. The project had a budget of $32 million.

==Future==
As of July 2024, Washington County is leading a redesign of the MN 36/CSAH 17 (Lake Elmo Avenue) intersection in the cities of Grant and Lake Elmo in order to increase safety, reduce congestion, and improve accessibility for active transportation. Between 2014 and 2024, 170 crashes have occurred at the intersection. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $40 million, with $25 million coming from federal and state sources. The recommended layout is an overpass with buttonhook ramps, and final design selection is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. Construction is slated to start in the following spring, ending in fall of 2027.

As a part of its legislative priorities for 2024, Washington County is requesting $3 million in state funds to design a grade-separated interchange for the existing intersection at MN 36 and MN 120. Other than the intersection with Lake Elmo Avenue, it is the only controlled intersection west of CSAH 5 north/CSAH 15 south (Stillwater Boulevard). It has also been identified by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) as having the fourth-highest crash cost of any Minnesota state highway, with an average of 25 reported crashes per year. The project would also include pedestrian and bicycle considerations, as well as connections to the Gateway State Trail.

<text>Jannetje Johanna (Jo) Schaft (16 September 1920 – 17 April 1945) was a Dutch resistance fighter during World War II. She became known as &quot;the girl with the red hair&quot; (, ). Her secret name in the resistance movement was &quot;Hannie&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Jannetje Johanna Schaft was born in Haarlem, the capital of the province of North Holland. Her mother, Aafje Talea Schaft (born Vrijer) was a Mennonite and her father, Pieter Schaft, a teacher, was attached to the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. The two were very protective of Schaft because of the death due to diphtheria of her older sister Anna in 1927.

From a young age, Schaft discussed politics and social justice with her family, which encouraged her to pursue law and become a human rights lawyer. After high school in Haarlem, Schaft started studying law in 1938 at the University of Amsterdam. She became friends with the Jewish students Sonja Frenk and Philine Polak. This made her feel strongly about actions against Jews. During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, Schaft started volunteer work with the Red Cross, where she rolled bandages, assembled first aid kits for soldiers, and assisted German refugees. In 1943, university students were required to sign a declaration of allegiance to the occupation authorities. When Schaft refused to sign the petition in support of the occupation forces, like 80% of the other students, she could not continue her studies. In the summer of 1943 she moved in with her parents again, taking Frenk and Polak with her who went into hiding and helping them get false identity cards.

== Resistance work ==

Schaft&#x27;s resistance work started with small acts. First, she would steal ID cards for Jewish residents (including her friends). Upon leaving university, she joined the Raad van Verzet (&#x27;Council of Resistance&#x27;), a resistance movement that had close ties to the Communist Party of the Netherlands. There she met two sisters, Truus and Freddie Oversteegen, who became her close friends and would survive the war. Rather than act as a courier, Schaft wanted to work with weapons. She was responsible for sabotaging and assassinating various targets. She carried out attacks on Germans, Dutch Nazis, collaborators and traitors. She learned to speak German fluently and became involved with German soldiers. Before facing her targets, Schaft put on makeup — including lipstick and mascara — and styled her hair. In one of the few direct quotations that have been attributed to Schaft, she explained to Truus Oversteegen: “I’ll die clean and beautiful.”

Schaft did not, however, accept every assignment. When asked to kidnap the children of a Nazi official she refused. If the plan had failed, the children would have to be killed, and Schaft felt that was too similar to the Nazis&#x27; acts of terror. When seen at the location of a particular assassination, Schaft was identified as &quot;the girl with the red hair&quot;. Her involvement led &quot;the girl with the red hair&quot; to be placed on the Nazis&#x27; most-wanted list.

On 21 June 1944, Schaft and Jan Bonekamp, a friend in the resistance, carried out an assassination in Zaandam on Dutch police officer and collaborator Willem Ragut. Schaft fired first and hit Ragut in the back. Bonekamp was shot in the stomach by Ragut before killing him. Mortally wounded, Bonekamp fled the scene but was arrested shortly afterwards and taken to hospital. There he inadvertently gave Schaft&#x27;s name and address to Dutch Nazi nurses feigning to be Resistance workers. To force Schaft to confess, German authorities arrested her parents and sent them to the Herzogenbusch concentration camp near the city of Den Bosch. The distress of this situation and her grief over Bonekamp&#x27;s death forced Schaft to cease resistance work temporarily. Her parents were released after nine months.
When she resumed her Resistance work, Schaft dyed her hair black and wore glasses to hide her identity. She once again contributed to assassinations and sabotage, as well as courier work, and the transportation of illegal weapons and the dissemination of illegal newspapers. Hannie Schaft and Truus Oversteegen were planning to liquidate NSB member and Haarlem policeman Fake Krist (in Dutch) on 25 October 1944, but other Haarlem resistance fighters were ahead of them.

On 1 March 1945, NSB police officer Willem Zirkzee was killed by Hannie Schaft and Truus Oversteegen, near the Krelagehuis on the Leidsevaart in Haarlem. On 15 March they wounded Ko Langendijk, a hairdresser from IJmuiden who worked for the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), a Nazi intelligence agency. He survived the attack and in 1948 he testified in Amsterdam for the benefit of his Velser girlfriend, the traitor Nelly Willy van der Meijden. In 1949 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

== Arrest and death ==
She was eventually arrested at a military checkpoint in Haarlem on 21 March 1945 while distributing the illegal communist newspaper &quot;de Waarheid&quot; (&quot;&#x27;The Truth&#x27;),&quot; which was a cover story. She was transporting secret documentation for the Resistance. She worked closely with Anna A.C. Wijnhoff. She was brought to a prison in Amsterdam. After much interrogation, torture, and solitary confinement, Schaft was identified by the roots of her red hair by her former colleague Anna Wijnhoff. Schaft admitted her Resistance activities, but there is no evidence that she gave the Nazis information about her fellow fighters.

Schaft was executed by Dutch Nazi officials on 17 April 1945. Although at the end of the war there was an agreement between the occupier and the &quot;Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten&quot; (&#x27;Dutch resistance&#x27;) to stop executions, she was shot dead three weeks before the end of the war in the dunes of Overveen, near Bloemendaal. Two men known as Mattheus Schmitz and Maarten Kuiper took her to the execution site. Schmitz shot her in the head at close range. However, the bullet only grazed Schaft. She allegedly told her executioners: &quot;Ik schiet beter&quot; &quot;I shoot better!&quot;, after which Kuiper delivered a final shot to her head. Schaft&#x27;s execution was directly ordered by Willy Lages.
Although Schaft&#x27;s supposed final words became famous, they were never confirmed. A Dutch World War II historian said a search through the Dutch archives does not ever mention Schaft saying &quot;I shoot better!&quot; During a post-war interrogation, Kuiper said he had been talking to Schaft when he suddenly heard a gunshot after which she cried out in pain and started shaking. Realizing that Schmitz had only grazed her, Kuiper took out his submachine gun and fired a burst at Schaft, after which she immediately collapsed. One of the shots hit her in the head, killing her. It was the Dutch novelist Theun de Vries who added Hannie Schaft&#x27;s last words as a poetic license in his book The Girl With the Red Hair (Het meisje met het rode haar, 1956).

On 27 November 1945, Schaft was reburied in a state funeral at the Dutch Honorary Cemetery Bloemendaal. Members of the Dutch government and royal family attended, including Queen Wilhelmina, who called Schaft &quot;the symbol of the Resistance&quot;.
== Legacy ==

It is not known if Schmitz was ever prosecuted. However, Kuiper and Lages were prosecuted for war crimes by Dutch courts. Kuiper was found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed in 1948. Lages was convicted and sentenced to death in 1949. His sentence was confirmed in 1950. However, Lages was never executed since Queen Juliana, who had become increasingly reluctant to authorize death sentences, refused to sign his death warrant. This was opposed by the Dutch Cabinet, and there were large public protests against the possibility of amnesty for Lages. With the Queen unwilling to change her mind, Lages&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1952. He eventually became one of &quot;The Breda Four&quot;, one of the last four Nazi war criminals, all of whom were on death row, but eventually reprieved due to Juliana&#x27;s hesitance, still serving time in the Netherlands. In a decision which sparked public outcry, Lages was released from prison on health grounds in 1966, on the order of Minister of Justice Ivo Samkalden. Lages returned to Germany, where he died in 1971.

After the war, the remains of 422 members of the resistance were found in the Bloemendaal dunes, 421 men and one woman, Hannie Schaft. She was reburied in section 22 at the honorary cemetery &quot;Erebegraafplaats Bloemendaal&quot; in the dunes in Overveen in the presence of Princess Juliana and her husband Prince Bernard. Later, as queen, Juliana unveiled a bronze commemorative statue in the Kenau Park in nearby Haarlem, her birthplace. Schaft was one of 95 people to receive the Dutch Cross of Resistance and General Eisenhower awarded her a decoration, possibly the Medal of Freedom. 

Because the Communist Party of the Netherlands celebrated her as an icon, her popularity decreased, to the point that the commemoration at Hannie&#x27;s grave was forbidden in 1951. The commemorators (who were estimated to number over 10,000) were stopped by several hundred police and military with the aid of four tanks. A group of seven managed to circumvent the blockade and reached the burial ground, but were arrested when they tolled the bell. From the next year on, the communists decided to prevent another such scene by holding their commemoration in Haarlem instead.

A number of schools and streets in the Netherlands are named after her. For her, and other resistance heroines, a foundation has been created: the National Hannie Schaft Foundation (). A number of books and movies have been made about her. She features in &quot;The Assault&quot; (&quot;De Aanslag&quot;, 1982) by Harry Mulisch, also released as a movie directed by Fons Rademakers. Ineke Verdoner wrote a song about her. Author Theun de Vries wrote a biography of her life, &quot;The Girl with the Red Hair,&quot; which inspired the 1981 movie of the same title by Ben Verbong featuring Renée Soutendijk as Hannie Schaft. Her life is the basis of the 2023 historical novel, &quot;To Die Beautiful&quot; by Buzzy Jackson. She is remembered each year in November during a national event held in Haarlem.

In the early 1990s, thanks to the Hannie Schaft Memorial Foundation, commemorations were once again permitted. The last Sunday of each November in the Netherlands is a day of remembrance for Schaft&#x27;s life and work.

<doc id="937912" wikidata="Q2453841" url="?curid=937912" title="Interstate 694">
<text>Interstate 694 (I-694) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway located in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area in the US state of Minnesota. The western terminus of the route is at its junction with I-94, I-494, and US Highway 52 (US 52) in Maple Grove. The eastern terminus of I-694 is at its junction with I-94 and I-494 at the Woodbury–Oakdale city line. I-694 comprises the northern and northeastern portions of a beltway around the Twin Cities, with I-494 forming the remainder of the beltway. The speed limit is . Interstate Highways outside of the loop in Minnesota may be signed as high as but can only reach inside the loop.

I-694 also interchanges with I-35W at New Brighton–Arden Hills and I-35E at Little Canada–Vadnais Heights. I-694 is also concurrent with I-94/US 52 for from Maple Grove to Brooklyn Center. I-694 is in length.

==Route description==

I-694 begins on the counterclockwise end at the junction of I-94, I-494, US 52, and I-694 in the city of Maple Grove, often referred to as the Fish Lake Interchange. From the Fish Lake Interchange, I-694 travels eastbound (clockwise) and concurrently with I-94 and US 52 through the cities of Maple Grove, Brooklyn Park, and Brooklyn Center. In Brooklyn Center, I-94/US 52 splits from I-694 and then I-94/US 52 travels south toward downtown Minneapolis, while I-694 continues its beltway function, crossing the Mississippi River on the I-694 Bridge. The route then passes through the communities of Fridley and New Brighton, where it has an interchange with I-35W. I-694 turns slightly to the southeast as it passes through the communities of Arden Hills, Shoreview, and Little Canada. I-694 turns back to near due east at its western junction with I-35E. It continues east through the communities of Vadnais Heights, White Bear Lake, and Maplewood. In Pine Springs, I-694 has a cloverleaf interchange with Minnesota State Highway 36 (MN 36). The I-694/MN 36 interchange makes out a rough corner, in which I-694 switches direction from eastbound to southbound. I-694 continues south through the city of Oakdale and finally terminates on the clockwise end at the interchange of I-94, I-494, and I-694 at the Oakdale–Woodbury city boundary line. I-694 becomes I-494 after this interchange.
Mileposts on I-694 are numbered to increase while traveling eastbound (clockwise). They are in sequence with the numbering of adjoining I-494, where the numbering begins and ends at the Minnesota River. Between Maple Grove and Brooklyn Center, the mileposts correspond to the beltway numbering, not I-94 mileage.

Legally, the route of I-694 is defined as part of unmarked legislative route 393 in the . I-694 is not marked with this legislative number along the actual highway. The entire freeway, as part of the Interstate Highway System, has been included in the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
The original beltway around the Twin Cities was MN 100. The portion of I-694 running east from the current MN 100 in Brooklyn Center through New Brighton and MN 100 was part of that original beltway. There was a two-lane bridge across the Mississippi river where the current I-694 bridge is today. That bridge was constructed as part of a defense initiative authorized in 1942 at the beginning of US involvement World War II.

The construction of I-694 to Interstate standards was authorized in 1956. The first section of I-694 completed was between US 10 at Arden Hills to I-35E at Little Canada in the early 1960s. The last section of I-694 completed was between I-35E at Little Canada to its junction with I-94 and I-494 at Oakdale–Woodbury, completed by the early 1970s.

I-694 was built as the main thoroughfare for the northern suburbs of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. These include the cities of Maple Grove, Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Fridley, New Brighton, Arden Hills, Shoreview, Little Canada, Vadnais Heights, White Bear Lake, Maplewood, Pine Springs, and Oakdale.

The original design of I-694 had problems with &quot;weave&quot; interchanges. The Unweave the Weave construction project, completed between 2004 and 2008, disentangled I-694 and I-35E at Little Canada–Vadnais Heights. The project was designed around several factors, a few of which included increasing freeway traffic capacity, increasing driver safety, and eliminating weaving and lane changes (eliminating &quot;geometric deficiencies&quot;), hence the name of the project, &quot;Unweave the Weave&quot;. This weaving was the case for most drivers prior to 2005, before most of the road reconstruction work on the interchanges was done. As a result of lane changing and constant congestion, many accidents occurred on the interchange after its completion in the early 1970s. The current layout of the two Interstates now provides for safer exits and entrances, minimal congestion, and better road surface durability. The project also realigned the two interstates to improve the infrastructure of the highway from an asphalt surface to a complete concrete surface. Numerous bridges were rebuilt, including the residential streets of Edgerton Street and Labore Road in Vadnais Heights.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) updated the overlapped section between I-694 and I-35E to increase the number of lanes from six (three in each direction) to 12 (six in each direction) and eliminated the requirement to change lanes through the area. The section was rebuilt in concrete instead of asphalt and noise walls were added.

Another construction project, the I-35W/US 10/I-694 North Central Corridor Reconstruction Project, also designed to reduce unnecessary traffic crossovers on the highway, began in September 2011. This project eliminated the weaving movements of I-694 at its interchange with US 10 and MN 51 in Arden Hills. This interchange often created one of the worst bottlenecks in the Twin Cities because drivers need to change at least one lane to continue either direction on I-694 between MN 51 (Snelling Avenue) and US 10. When the construction project was completed, the roadway of I-694 included two through lanes in each direction from I-35W at New Brighton to US 10 at Arden Hills, three through lanes in each direction from US 10 in Arden Hills to Rice Street at Shoreview–Little Canada, and five through lanes in each direction from Rice Street to the I-694/I-35E interchange, compared with the two to three lanes throughout the I-694 corridor. Construction on the North Central Corridor project began the week of September 19, 2011. Work was completed in November 2013, at an estimated cost of $185.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

<text>Interstate 394 (I-394) is a short east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in Hennepin County in the US state of Minnesota. It is also commonly referred to by its pre-1991 name, Wayzata Boulevard, and by its other designation for most of its route, US Highway 12 (US 12). It runs for from downtown Minneapolis to I-494 in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. At its western terminus, the roadway loses its Interstate designation but continues as US 12. I-394 serves as the most direct link for commuters and other drivers who are traveling between downtown Minneapolis and parts of the western Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

I-394 maintains at least three lanes in each direction except under the Minnesota State Highway 100 (MN 100) interchange and also between I-94/US 52 and its eastern terminus downtown.

==Route description==

I-394 begins on the western side of the Twin Cities in the suburb of Minnetonka, at its interchange with I-494 (exit 19). From there, I-394 takes a course toward downtown Minneapolis where the eastern terminus is at 4th Street North.

Legally, the route of I-394 is defined as unmarked legislative routes 10 and 107 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(38). I-394 is not marked with these legislative numbers along the actual highway.

===E-ZPass Minnesota toll lanes===
There are two high-occupancy toll (HOT) express lanes at the center of the road. Prior to May 16, 2005, they had been traditional high-occupancy vehicle (HOV, or carpool) lanes, allowing busses, motorcycles, and vehicles with two or more occupants to use them during rush-hour periods, while single-occupancy vehicles were not permitted. Now, drivers riding alone can use the lanes at any time but must have an E-ZPass Minnesota electronic toll collection transponder in order to pay for using the express portions.
From I-494 to MN 100, the lanes of I-394 are separated from traffic by double white lines. Between MN 100 and I-94/US 52 near downtown, the two lanes are combined into a reversible expressway in the median that is separated from the eastbound and westbound lanes by concrete barriers. This segment changes directions to accommodate the traffic flow at different times of day, so, in the morning, it is open to downtown-bound eastward flowing traffic, while it is open to westbound traffic in the evening.

An E-ZPass Minnesota electronic transponder is required in order to pay tolls because there are no tollbooths on the roadway. The price varies depending on the time of day and flow of traffic. Lone drivers were previously allowed to use the express lanes in off-peak times, but this is no longer allowed under the new system unless the sign says the cost is &quot;OPEN&quot;, meaning free. The decision to make the nonreversible lanes free on off-hours was reached due to complaints about essentially making a four-lane freeway in an area that, even on off-hours, sorely needed six. Toll rates are expected to generally fall between $1.00 and $4.00, with a potential maximum of $8.00. Off-hours are charged as $0.25 on the reversible lanes and free on the one-way lanes. The white line-separated and reversible expressway sections are priced separately. The lanes are still open free to busses, motorcycles, and cars with two or more people, no matter the time of day, and such vehicles do not require transponders to use the lanes.

Using the express lanes as a lone driver without a transponder during charged periods or crossing the double white lines will result in a large fine placed upon the driver. To enter and exit properly, vehicles must use an entry point without double white lines. The line rule is true even when the lane is free of charge.

Transponders began to be sold a few weeks before the May 16, 2005, opening date. By June 2005, about 6,500 drivers had signed up for the system.

==History==

The highway, a four lane divided highway, used to be designated as Wayzata Boulevard and US 12. The construction of I-394 was authorized in 1968. Funding became available after the canceled I-335 freeway project in 1978. I-335 had been planned to be a northern loop around downtown Minneapolis that would have passed through northeast Minneapolis. The money was substituted to the I-394 project. Wayzata Boulevard/US 12, starting in 1982, was to be redesigned as I-394. Construction of I-394 occurred mainly in the 1980s, starting at the western terminus in Minnetonka and opening in sections toward downtown Minneapolis throughout the late 1980s. The entire route of I-394 was officially opened in 1991.

A former lane drop of I-394 at the Penn Avenue exit was eliminated in 2000.

<text>Peter Seisenbacher (born 25 March 1960) is a judo coach and retired judoka from Austria.

== Judo career ==
He competed in the middleweight category (−86 kg) at the 1980, 1984 and 1988 Olympics and won two gold medals, in 1984 and 1988. He also won a world title in 1985 and European title in 1986.

After retiring from competitions, Seisenbacher worked as a judo coach, in Austria, Georgia (2010–2012), and Azerbaijan (2012–2013). Under his guidance, the Georgian team won 2 gold, 3 silver, and 4 bronze medals at European championships, one bronze medal at world championships, and an Olympic gold medal in 2012.

== Personal life ==
After years of circulating rumors, in June 2014 a number of women filed criminal complaints against Seisenbacher for alleged sexual misconduct against them when they were still minors. On 5 October 2016 Seisenbacher was formally indicted by the Vienna Prosecutor&#x27;s Office for statutory rape of two girls who at the time were less than 14 years of age, and for attempted sexual assault of one girl who at the time was 16 years old. The first indictment involved a girl who was 11 when in 1999 she allegedly was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by Seisenbacher lasting until 2001; the second indictment involved the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl in 2004. The attempted sexual assault of the 16-year-old allegedly occurred during a training camp in Croatia in 2001.

The formal indictment came after a lengthy judicial investigation following earlier police complaints filed in 2013 by several former pupils, as reported by numerous newspapers in June 2014.

However, in December 2016 Seisenbacher failed to show up for his trial in court for two days in a row and instead fled the country, after which he officially became a fugitive from justice on worldwide warrant.
 While Interpol searched for him in Europe, Kazachstan, the United States and Dubai, Seisenbacher was able to remain on the run for 200 days. Considered dangerous, he was finally arrested by a SWAT team on 2 August 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine and was handed over to Austria on 12 September 2019. The trial started on 25 November in Vienna; on 2 December Seisenbacher was found guilty and sentenced to 5 years in prison. On November 4, 2022 he was released from prison.

<doc id="937916" wikidata="Q3133102" url="?curid=937916" title="Matty Alou">
<text>Mateo &quot;Matty&quot; Rojas Alou (December 22, 1938 – November 3, 2011) was a Dominican professional baseball player and manager. He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball from 1960 to 1974. He also played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) with the Taiheiyo Club Lions from 1974 through 1976. Alou was a two-time All-Star and the 1966 National League batting champion.

==Baseball career==
Alou was the middle of a trio of baseball-playing brothers that included the older Felipe and younger Jesús. They were the first set of three siblings to all bat in the same half-inning in the majors (September 10), and play together in the same outfield (on September 15), accomplishing both with the Giants in 1963. The latter achievement happened in the last two innings of a 13–5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field, with starting right fielder Felipe first moving to left in the seventh inning when Jesús entered the game in right and then to center in the eighth when Matty was inserted in left. Matty had been teammates with Felipe during the prior three campaigns, and was likewise with Jesús for the following two. Matty and Felipe later reunited with the Yankees in 1973.

Alou&#x27;s best years as a player were spent with the Pirates, where he won the National League (NL) batting title in 1966 and was a two-time All-Star in 1968 and 1969. He was a member of a World Series Champion with the Athletics in 1972 and a NL pennant winner with the Giants in 1962.

==Playing career==
Alou was born in Haina, Dominican Republic. He was a platoon player for the Giants for several years and was mostly unremarkable. His finest moment in San Francisco came in 1962 when his pinch-hit bunt single in the final game of a three-game tie-breaking playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers began the rally that won the game and the pennant for the Giants. He batted .333 in the Giants&#x27; losing effort against the Yankees in the 1962 World Series. While he was primarily an outfielder, Alou also appeared in one game in 1965 as a pitcher, pitching two scoreless innings.

After being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1966 season Alou received instruction from expert hitting instructor Harry &quot;the Hat&quot; Walker that helped turn him into a high-average contact hitter. This earned him a starting job as an integral member of a Pirates team which included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski and Willie Stargell. The Pirates fought the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants in a tight pennant race and were in first place on September 10, before they faltered to finish the season in third place for a second consecutive year. Alou won the 1966 NL batting title with a .342 average, with his brother Felipe finishing second, and finished in the top five in hitting four more times - in –, .

His contract was sold by the St. Louis Cardinals to the San Diego Padres on October 24, 1973,

In 1969 Alou led the major leagues in at-bats (698), doubles (41), and hits (231). His 231 hits in 1969 remain the highest total by any National League player since Joe Medwick&#x27;s 237 in 1937.

After leaving the Major Leagues following the season, he played three seasons in Japan (Taiheiyo Club Lions) and managed in the Dominican Professional Baseball League.

==Death and Legacy==
On June 23, , the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame inducted Alou into their Hall of Fame during an on-field, pre-game ceremony at AT&amp;T Park before a game between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees.

Alou died in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic as the result of diabetic complications, according to his former Dominican team, Leones del Escogido. The Giants confirmed Alou had had variety of health issues for several years.

Alou was honored in New York City by the naming of Matty Alou Way in Upper Manhattan&#x27;s
Inwood Hill Park neighborhood in October 2015.

<text>Jean Albert Gaudry (16 September 1827 – 27 November 1908) was a French geologist and palaeontologist. He was born at St Germain-en-Laye, and was educated at the Catholic Collège Stanislas de Paris. He was a notable proponent of theistic evolution.

==Career==

At the age of twenty-five he made explorations in Cyprus and Greece, residing in the latter country from 1855 to 1860. He then investigated the rich deposit of fossil vertebrata at Pikermi and brought to light a remarkable mammalian fauna, Miocene in age, and intermediate in its forms between European, Asiatic and African types. He also published an account of the geology of the island of Cyprus (&quot;Mém. Soc. Géol. de France&quot;, 1862).

In 1853, while still in Cyprus, he was appointed assistant to A d&#x27;Orbigny, who was the first to hold the chair of palaeontology in the museum of natural history at Paris. In 1872 he succeeded to this important post; in 1882 he was elected member of the French Academy of Sciences. 
In 1885 Philippe Thomas was assigned to the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission at Gaudry&#x27;s recommendation.
Later Gaudry helped Thomas write the &quot;Essai d&#x27;une description géologique de la Tunisie&quot;, which reported the results of the Tunisian research.
In 1895 Gaudry was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London.

In 1900 he presided over the meetings of the eighth International Congress of Geology then held in Paris. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1900.

He is distinguished for his researches on fossil mammalia, and for the support which his studies have rendered to the theory of evolution. He has also occasionally studied other topics. Among others, he described Early Permian &quot;Haptodus baylei&quot;, whose affinities he could not determine at the time, but which is now known to be a synapsid closely related to therapsids.

==Evolution==

Gaudry was one of the first scientists to invent a phylogenetic tree for fossil forms in 1866.

Gaudry was an advocate of theistic evolution. In his book &quot;Essai de paléontologie philosophique&quot; (1896) he considered evolution to be a divine plan guided by God.

Charles Darwin cited Gaudry&#x27;s palaeontological research from his excavations at Pikermi in the second edition of &quot;On Origin of Species&quot;, 1872 and &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, 1871. His research was also positively cited by Alfred Russel Wallace. Gaudry discovered and reconstructed several new mammal species that he considered were intermediates, he believed these were evidence for evolution but differed from Darwin in believing they were the result of a plan by God.

Because of his spiritual beliefs, he rejected the idea of natural selection and struggle for existence. Paleontologist Éric Buffetaut has written that &quot;Gaudry&#x27;s strong religious feelings made it difficult for him to accept Darwin&#x27;s mechanistic vision of an evolution based on chance and natural selection. Evolution was acceptable to him because it revealed a unity in the organic world which was the mark of divine works.&quot;

==Quotes==

If we recognise that organised beings have little by little been transformed, we shall regard them as plastic substances which an artist has been pleased to knead during the immense course of ages, lengthening here, broadening or diminishing there, as the sculptor, with a piece of clay, produces a thousand forms, following the impulse of his genius. But we shall not doubt that the artist was the Creator himself, for each transformation has borne a reflection of his infinite beauty.

<text>The Canal de Bourgogne (; English: Canal of Burgundy or Burgundy Canal) is a canal in the Burgundy historical region in east-central France. It connects the Yonne at Migennes with the Saône at Saint-Jean-de-Losne. Construction began in 1775 and was completed in 1832. The canal completes the link between the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea, via the rivers Seine and the Yonne to the Saône and Rhône.

The canal is long, with 189 locks. There were originally 191 lock basins, but the double staircase locks at Migennes (114-115Y) and Germigny (106-107Y) had the uppermost set of gates removed and the lower chamber raised to form single locks, but they are twice as deep as a standard lock (5.13 m and 5.14 m instead of the usual 2.5 to 3 m).

The canal passes through the departments of Yonne and Côte-d&#x27;Or. Its summit level is at Pouilly-en-Auxois, 378 m above sea level, when the canal passes through a tunnel 3.3 km long. The lowest point is at the junction with the Yonne at above sea level.

== Description ==
The canal begins at Migennes where the former double staircase lock gives access from the Yonne to a large basin. For the next 100 km the canal follows the valley of the Armançon river. This is a centuries-old route towards the south-east, which is why the canal is closely followed by road and railway. The first lock after leaving Migennes, Cheny (113Y), is one of the few electric locks to be found on the canal. After 9 km the canal arrives in Brienon-sur-Armançon with its recently built grain silos which permit the loading of barges and trains. The canal then heads off towards Saint-Florentin with its aqueduct over the Armance river and the impressive church overlooking the lower town.

After the former double lock at Germigny (107-106Y) and Egrevin lock (105Y) the canal runs alongside the D905 (formerly N5) road. This pound suffered exceptional damage with almost all of the trees being blown down during the great storm of 26 December 1999. The canal continues through Flogny-la-Chapelle, somewhat surprisingly leaves Burgundy for a short stretch (1.5 km) as it passes through Charrey in the Aube department (Champagne-Ardenne region) and heads to the town of Tonnerre, famous for the Fosse Dionne spring and the birthplace of the Chevalier d&#x27;Eon.

Leaving Tonnerre the canal closely follows the Armançon and meanders due to hills situated between Tonnerre and Ancy-le-Franc. The canal passes through the village of Commissey before arriving in Tanlay with its impressive Renaissance château. At Lézinnes boats meet a series of six electrified locks, taking them past a cement works and more grain silos at Pacy-sur-Armançon and on to Ancy-le-Franc. Here the tourist can visit the famous 16th-century château set in its vast grounds.

Leaving Ravières there is an extremely difficult pound which suffers from intense growth of aquatic weeds and which can cause fouling of the propeller. Immediately after is situated the small village of Cry-sur-Armançon, site of the Acrobatix Adventure Park.

After passing through Aisy the canal enters the Côte-d&#x27;Or department. It then runs through Buffon past the great ironwork forge built by the Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. It is then merely a short trip until arrival in the town of Montbard. Nearby is the Abbey of Fontenay. The canal is now running through the wide, flat plain of the river Brenne. Eight locks and 13 km after Montbard the canal arrives in Venarey-les-Laumes situated close to the village of Alise-Sainte-Reine thought to be the site of the Battle of Alesia.

At this point the geography changes dramatically. The railway carries on straight towards Dijon, climbing the steep Burgundy escarpment which it crosses by means of a long tunnel at Blaisy-Bas. The canal on the other hand has to divert southwards passing through 40 locks in the space of . It then reaches more friendly ground before the final approach to the summit at Pouilly-en-Auxois. Here there is a large, fully equipped port close to the centre of town.

The canal then runs through a tree-lined cutting before entering the 3-kilometre long tunnel. Boats must be fitted with a fixed or hand-held spotlight to pass through, following a fatal accident a number of years ago inside the tunnel itself. Emerging near the village of Créancey the canal begins to drop, passing close to the A6 autoroute, past the villages of Vandenesse and Châteauneuf before meeting the river Ouche at Pont-d&#x27;Ouche where there are moorings for boats wishing to lay up for the winter. Nearby is the small town of Bligny-sur-Ouche where there is a butterfly museum and a narrow-gauge railway built on the trackbed of a line leading from the mining town of Epinac to loading staithes on the canal. The canal now changes direction from SE to NNE running through the valley of the river Ouche as it makes its way towards Dijon, the capital of the Burgundy region. On arrival in Plombières-lès-Dijon the canal turns SE passing close to Lac Kir, a man-made lake used for leisure activities, named after Canon Félix Kir, a former mayor of Dijon and after whom is named the white wine and crème de cassis drink known as Kir.

On leaving the port of Dijon and running past the SNCF depot at Perrigny and the airport at Longvic the canal enters the wide and relatively flat valley of the Saône. In the final 30 kilometres the canal is totally straight apart from a slight turn near Thorey-en-Plaine and the main activity of the area is now farming. Shortly after passing by Brazey-en-Plaine the canal reaches its end at Saint-Jean-de-Losne, the largest inland pleasure port in France, where it joins the river Saône.

== History ==

Construction of the canal was already under consideration as early as 1605, during the reign of Henry IV. Difficulties were foreseen in crossing the Morvan Massif, however. In addition to the route finally selected, studies were made for various other routes, all of them passing further to the north. In the end, however, it was decided that the canal should follow the valleys of the rivers Armançon and Ouche. Louis XV signed an edict for the canal&#x27;s construction on 7 September 1773. In 1774 it was stipulated that the crown would pay for the section running to the Yonne while the other half, towards the Saône, would be funded by the Estates of Burgundy. In 1775 the total cost was estimated at 7.18 Million French pounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hommes et cours d&#x27;eau/Le canal de Bourgogne/Ouvrages_gens_canal_versant_Yonne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began in 1777 on the Laroche-Tonnerre section. In 1781 work started from the other end, between Dijon and the Saône. During the early years of the French Revolution, between 1790 and 1795 progress on the construction slowed and then stopped. Work resumed only in 1808 after a Napoleonic degree announced the sale to private companies of four major existing canals in order to finance further canal construction.

1808 saw the opening of the section between Laroche and Dijon, thereby providing access to the Saône and so, indirectly, to the Rhône valley. At this time the challenge of how the canal should cross the Drainage divide between the Saône and the Yonne valleys was still being argued, but in 1812 the adopted solution involved a tunnel and the creation of reservoirs to feed water into the higher pounds of the canal. The tunnel was built between 1826 and 1832, and in 1832 the entire canal was opened for navigation, although work on the important feeder reservoirs was not completed till 1840.

Between 1879 and 1882 work was completed, where necessary, to increase lock sizes to conform to the Freycinet standard, after which it became possible to move barges of up to 250 tonnes displacement, and up to 38.50 metres long on the canal.

The Canal de Bourgogne was, when built, an engineering triumph. Commercial usage never quite reached the levels that its promoters had envisaged, however. Traffic grew between 1832 and 1850, by when 43.5 million tonnes were being carried annually, but thereafter growth tailed off and volumes were disappointing. There were various reasons for this:

*Even after work had been completed on enlarging the locks, in 1882, the canal&#x27;s size remained a constraint on volumes, notably at Pouilly-en-Auxois, where the tunnel&#x27;s one-way only traffic lengthened journey times and reduced flexibility for canal users (the tugboat that towed the convoys of &quot;péniches&quot; can still be seen at Pouilly-en-Auxois.)
*Competition from railways had not been foreseen when the canal was built, and was still a future threat when it was completed in 1832. However, between 1847 and 1852, the Paris–Marseille railway, its strategic and economic importance highlighted by its designation as an &quot;impériale&quot; communications artery, made it possible to transport goods much more rapidly and in very much larger volumes than could be achieved using the canal.
The canal was experimentally taken over by the Région Bourgogne in 2010, but after two years returned to VNF’s management. It carries very little traffic, and the region baulked at the rehabilitation expenditure to be committed.

== Users ==
Commercial barge traffic is restricted to the two extremities; between St Jean de Losne and Dijon in the south and from Migennes to Brienon in the north. Otherwise traffic is restricted to three types of user: privately owned boats (now the most important user group), hire craft, in decline due to the closure of several hire bases in recent years, and &quot;hotel barges,&quot; mainly centered on the Ouche valley in the south, although three hotel barges remain operating on the northern section.

<text>Chen Shou (; 233–297), courtesy name Chengzuo (), was a Chinese historian, politician, and writer who lived during the Three Kingdoms period and Jin dynasty of China. Chen Shou is best known for his most celebrated work, the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), which records the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. Chen Shou wrote the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; primarily in the form of biographies of notable persons of those eras. Today, Chen&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is part of the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; canon of Chinese history.

==Historical sources on Chen Shou&#x27;s life==
There are two biographies of Chen Shou. The first one is in the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;, which was written by Chang Qu in the fourth century during the Eastern Jin dynasty. The second one is in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, which was written by Fang Xuanling and others in the seventh century during the Tang dynasty.

== Life ==
He started his career as an official in the state of Shu during the Three Kingdoms era but was demoted and sent out of the capital for his refusal to fawn on Huang Hao, an influential court eunuch in Shu in its twilight years. After the fall of Shu in 263, Chen Shou&#x27;s career entered a period of stagnation before Zhang Hua recommended him to serve in the Jin government. He held mainly scribal and secretarial positions under the Jin government before dying from illness in 297. He had over 200 writings – about 30 of which he co-wrote with his relatives – attributed to him.

=== Early life and career in Shu Han ===
Chen Shou was from Anhan County (安漢縣), Baxi Commandery (巴西郡), which is in present-day Nanchong, Sichuan. He was known for being studious since he was young and was described as intelligent, insightful and knowledgeable. He was mentored by the Shu official Qiao Zhou, who was also from Baxi Commandery. Under Qiao Zhou&#x27;s tutelage, he read the &quot;Classic of History&quot; and &quot;Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. He was very well versed in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and &quot;Book of Han&quot;.

According to the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, Chen Shou served as a (觀閣令史; a clerk) in Shu. However, the &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; mentioned that he held the following appointments consecutively: Registrar (主簿) of the General of the Guards (衛將軍); &quot;donguan mishu lang&quot; (東觀秘書郎; an official librarian); Gentleman of Scattered Cavalry (散騎侍郎); and Gentleman of the Yellow Gate (黃門侍郎). In the final years of Shu ( 250s–263), many officials fawned on Huang Hao, an influential court eunuch, in their bid to win his favour. Chen Shou&#x27;s refusal to engage in such flattering and obsequious behaviour took a toll on his career: He was demoted on several occasions and sent out of the Shu capital, Chengdu.

=== Career in Jin dynasty ===
After the fall of Shu in 263, Chen Shou&#x27;s career entered a period of stagnation until Zhang Hua recommended him to serve in the government of the Jin dynasty. Zhang Hua appreciated Chen Shou&#x27;s talent and felt that even though Chen did not have an untarnished reputation, he did not deserve to be demoted and dismissed while he was in Shu. Chen Shou was recommended as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; (civil service candidate), and appointed as a &quot;zuo zhuzuo lang&quot; (佐著作郎; an assistant scribe) and the acting Prefect (令) of Yangping County (陽平縣). In 274, he collected and compiled the writings of Zhuge Liang, the first chancellor of Shu, and submitted them to the Jin imperial court. He was promoted to &quot;zhuzuo lang&quot; (著作郎; a scribe) and appointed as the &quot;zhongzheng&quot; (中正) of Baxi Commandery. The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; mentioned that he also served as the Chancellor (相) to the Marquis of Pingyang (平陽侯).

When Zhang Hua recommended Chen Shou to serve as a Gentleman Palace Writer (中書郎), the Ministry of Personnel appointed Chen Shou as the Administrator (太守) of Changguang Commandery (長廣郡) instead on the recommendation of Xun Xu. The &quot;Jin Shu&quot; mentioned that Xun Xu detested Zhang Hua and disliked Chen Shou for his association with Zhang Hua, so he urged the Ministry of Personnel to reassign Chen Shou to another position. Chen Shou declined the appointment on the grounds that he had to look after his elderly mother. The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; gave a different account of Chen Shou&#x27;s relationship with Xun Xu. It stated that Xun Xu and Zhang Hua were very pleased with Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; and they remarked that Chen Shou surpassed Ban Gu and Sima Qian. However, later, Xun Xu was displeased by the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; – one of the three sections in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; – and did not want Chen Shou to work in the same office as him, so he had Chen Shou reassigned to be the Administrator of Changguang.

In 278, before the general Du Yu assumed his appointment as the commander of the Jin military forces in Jing Province, he recommended Chen Shou to Emperor Wu and stated that Chen Shou was capable of serving as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate (黃門侍郎) or Gentleman of Scattered Cavalry (散騎侍郎). Emperor Wu accepted Du Yu&#x27;s suggestion and appointed Chen Shou as a &quot;yushi zhishu&quot; (御史治書; an auditor).

The &quot;Jin Shu&quot; mentioned that Chen Shou took a leave of absence when his mother died, and he fulfilled her dying wish to be buried in Luoyang. However, he ended up being castigated and demoted because his act of burying his mother in Luoyang – instead of in his hometown in Anhan County – was a violation of the proprieties of his time. The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; gave a varying account of the events: It was Chen Shou&#x27;s stepmother (not his biological mother) who died. She did not want to be buried together with his father (in Anhan County), so Chen Shou buried her in Luoyang.

===Later years===
According to the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, many years after his demotion, Chen Shou was appointed as a &quot;zhongshuzi&quot; (中庶子; an aide) to the crown prince Sima Yu, but he did not assume his role. He died of illness at the age of 65 (by East Asian age reckoning) in 297 during the reign of Emperor Hui.

The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; gave a different account of the events before Chen Shou&#x27;s death. It stated that Chen Shou was appointed as a &quot;zhongshuzi&quot; to Sima Yu, but was reassigned to be a Regular Mounted Attendant (散騎常侍) again after the crown prince was deposed in 299. Emperor Hui told Zhang Hua, &quot;(Chen) Shou possesses genuine talent. He should not remain in his current appointment for long.&quot; Zhang Hua wanted to nominate Chen Shou to take up one of the posts of the Nine Ministers, but lost his life in 300 CE during the War of the Eight Princes. Chen Shou died in Luoyang later. His talents and achievements were not reflected in his status at the time of his death and many people felt that it was an injustice to him. The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; account apparently suggests that Chen Shou died in 300 CE or after, which did not match his year of death mentioned in the &quot;Jin Shu&quot; account.

== &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; ==

Sometime in the third century after 280, Chen Shou wrote his magnum opus: the 65-volume &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; (&quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;), which records the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. The text was divided into three sections – &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (魏書), &quot;Book of Shu&quot; (蜀書) and &quot;Book of Wu&quot; (吳書) – and was composed of mainly biographies of notable persons in those eras.

Chen Shou received acclaim from his contemporaries for his work and was praised as an excellent historian. Around the time, another historian, Xiahou Zhan (夏侯湛), was writing his own &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (魏書; &quot;Wei Shu&quot;), which recorded the history of Wei in the Three Kingdoms era. He destroyed his work after reading Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. Zhang Hua was so deeply impressed with the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; that he told Chen Shou, &quot;We should entrust the responsibility of writing the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; to you.&quot; Chen Shou was highly regarded as such after he wrote the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;.

== Controversies ==
Despite his achievements, Chen Shou faced accusations and other controversies. The &quot;Jin Shu&quot; mentioned two controversies surrounding Chen Shou and his writing of the &quot;Sanguozhi,&quot; which his critics used to disparage him. Tang Geng (唐庚), a scholar from the Song dynasty, in his work called the &quot;Three Kingdoms Miscellaneous Cases&quot; (三國雜事; &quot;Sanguo Zashi&quot;) also criticised Chen Shou as a historian for two reasons.

=== Extorting grain ===
The first one was about Chen Shou attempting to extort 1,000 &quot;hu&quot; of grain from the sons of Ding Yi (丁儀) and his younger brother Ding Yi (丁廙) – two officials in Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He promised them that he would write biographies for their fathers in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; if they gave him the grain, but they refused, so he did not write the biographies. However, the &quot;Jin Shu&quot; prefaced the anecdote with the term &quot;huoyun&quot; (或云), which meant &quot;rumours&quot;.

The Qing dynasty writer Pan Mei (潘眉) rebutted the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;&#x27;s account about Chen Shou attempting to extort from the Dings and called it &quot;uninformed&quot;. He disproved the claim that the Ding brothers were very famous officials in Wei by pointing out that they had neither held important appointments nor made any significant achievements. Pan also felt that a historian was clearly justified if he decided to not write biographies for the Ding brothers, because, in his opinion, the Dings had committed grievous sins – instigating sibling rivalry and causing instability in the Wei imperial clan – which made them unworthy of having biographies in historical records. Pan further noted that there were also other notable persons in Wei (e.g. Chen Lin, Wu Zhi and Yang Xiu) who did not have biographies in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, so being notable did not mean that a person should have a biography written for him. His concluding remarks on this issue were that the &quot;Jin Shu&quot; made a malicious claim (about Chen Shou).

=== Bias ===
The second one suggested that Chen Shou held personal grudges against the Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang and his son Zhuge Zhan, hence he wrote negative comments about them in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. Chen Shou&#x27;s father was a military adviser to the Shu general Ma Su. When Ma Su was executed by Zhuge Liang after his failure at the Battle of Jieting in 228, Chen Shou&#x27;s father was implicated and sentenced to &quot;kun&quot; (髡), a punishment involving the shaving of a person&#x27;s head. Zhuge Zhan belittled Chen Shou before. When Chen Shou wrote the biographies of Zhuge Liang and Zhuge Zhan in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, he commented on them as follows: Military leadership was not Zhuge Liang&#x27;s forte, and he lacked the resourcefulness of a brilliant military leader; Zhuge Zhan excelled only in literary arts, and he had an exaggerated reputation.

The Qing dynasty writer Zhao Yi refuted the &quot;Jin Shu&quot; claim that Chen Shou was prejudiced against Zhuge Liang in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, and remarked that the claim was &quot;an uninformed statement&quot;. He commented that military leadership did not necessarily have to be regarded as Zhuge Liang&#x27;s forte because Zhuge also made outstanding achievements in other fields. Zhao also pointed out two pieces of evidence which contradict the &quot;Jin Shu&quot; claim: Chen Shou gave highly positive comments about Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ability as a politician in the &quot;Zhuge Liang Collection&quot; and in his personal commentary at the end of Zhuge&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. Zhao Yi&#x27;s concluding remarks on this issue were that Chen Shou had clearly identified Zhuge Liang&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses in his appraisal of Zhuge Liang in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;.

=== Claim that Shu Han lacked a historical bureau ===
Chen Shou in the biography of Liu Shan wrote that the state of Shu Han did not have a historical bureau or department, justifying the pitiful condition of the biography of their officials. Tang Geng cast doubt on this claim, remarking that although ancient texts advised to have one scribe write every word of his sovereign while another writes every action, those were merely hyperbolic terms. He provides past examples of people combining their role as historian alongside other function of the government. Furthermore, when the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; (pre-1st century BC) was written, even local warlords would have a historical bureau, so for Shu Han to suddenly lack one is suspect. Finally, he points out that Chen Shou contradicts the statement in the same biography when he wrote &quot;the Historical Bureau (史官) reported the sighting of a brilliant star,&quot; just three paragraphs later.

=== Referring to Liu Bei and Liu Shan&#x27;s state as Shu rather than Han ===
Tang Geng commented that since the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; until his own time, every state in official history is referred to by the name they used no matter their circumstances as it was basic decency to do so. However, Chen Shou was the sole historian who made an exception for Shu Han. Throughout its existence, Liu Bei and Liu Shan always used the name &quot;Han&quot; for their state since they were positioning themselves as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While &quot;Shu&quot; was a geographical term for where their state was based in, it was also a derisive name used by the Wei and Jin dynasties to discredit their claim of continuing the Han. Chen Shou opted to use the name &quot;Shu&quot; in his works, which in Tang Geng&#x27;s view, was a deliberate neglect of impartiality to appease his patrons and personal animosity.

To contrast, he brought up a similar situation during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, where the Southern Tang was called Wu and the Northern Han was called Jin in derogative manners. Yet, historical documents still refer to them by their respective self titles. Tang Geng then laments that recently, someone had used Chen Shou&#x27;s works as an example to convince a historian to not record the events he considered minor.

==Other works==
According to the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, Chen Shou collected and compiled the writings of Zhuge Liang during his early career under the Jin dynasty. The compiled text was called &quot;Shu Xiang Zhuge Liang Ji&quot; (蜀相諸葛亮集; &quot;Collection of the Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang&quot;). The &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot; mentioned that later on, Zhang Hua proposed to Emperor Wu to have the text reorganized and composed as a 24-volumes. At the time, Shou Liang was also doing his own research on Zhuge Liang&#x27;s works, with his outcome quite different from Chen Shou&#x27;s original version. In the end, the text was rewritten, and became the &quot;Zhuge Liang Gushi&quot; (諸葛亮故事; &quot;Memoirs of Zhuge Liang&quot;).

Since the end of the Jianwu era (25–56 CE) in the Eastern Han dynasty, writers such as Zheng Boyi (鄭伯邑), Zhao Yanxin (趙彥信), Chen Shenbo (陳申伯), Zhu Yuanling (祝元靈) and Wang Wenbiao (王文表) had co-written the &quot;Bashu Qijiu Zhuan&quot; (巴蜀耆舊傳; &quot;Biographies of Famous People from Bashu&quot;). Chen Shou felt that the &quot;Bashu Qijiu Zhuan&quot; was not comprehensive enough, so he expanded it to the 10-volume &quot;Yibu Qijiu Zhuan&quot; (益部耆舊傳; &quot;Biographies of Famous People from Yi Province&quot;). His work was presented by the official Wen Li (文立) to Emperor Wu, who praised it.

Other writings by Chen Shou include: the 50-volume &quot;Gu Guo Zhi&quot; (古國志; &quot;Records of Ancient States&quot;), which received high praise; the 7-volume &quot;Guansi Lun&quot; (官司論; &quot;Dissertation on Bureaucracy&quot;), which used historical examples to discuss reforms; &quot;Shi Yi&quot; (釋諱; &quot;Explaining Taboos&quot;); &quot;Guang Guo Lun&quot; (廣國論); &quot;Wei Mingchen Zou&quot; (魏名臣奏; &quot;Memorials by Notable Officials of Cao Wei&quot;).

==Family and relatives==
Chen Fu (陳符), whose courtesy name was Changxin (長信), was the son of Chen Shou&#x27;s elder brother. He was also known for his literary talent and he succeeded his uncle as an Assistant Gentleman of Writing. He also served as the Prefect (令) of Shanglian County (上廉縣).

Chen Fu&#x27;s younger brother, Chen Li (陳蒞), whose courtesy name was Shudu (叔度), served as an Attendant Officer (別駕) in Liang Province and later under Sima You, the Prince of Qi (齊王) and General of Agile Cavalry (驃騎將軍). He also died in Luoyang.

Chen Li had a younger relative, Chen Jie (陳階), whose courtesy name was Dazhi (達之). Chen Jie assumed the following appointments: Registrar (主簿) of the governor of Yi Province; &quot;baozhongling&quot; (褒中令); West Commandant (西部都尉) of Yongchang Commandery (永昌郡); Administrator (太守) of Jianning (建寧) and Xinggu (興古) commanderies. Chen Jie was also well known for his literary talent.

Chen Fu, Chen Li and Chen Jie each wrote more than 10 works out of the over 200 writings attributed to Chen Shou.

== Anecdotes ==
=== Filial mourning period ===
The &quot;Jin Shu&quot; mentioned that Chen Shou fell sick during the filial mourning period after his father&#x27;s death. Some guests who visited his home expressed disapproval when they saw him being served medicine by his servants, because he was expected to lead an austere life during that period. His fellow townsfolk criticised him when they heard about it.

===Conflict with Li Xiang===
According to the &quot;Huayang Guozhi&quot;, Chen Shou was a close friend of Li Xiang, courtesy name was Shulong (叔龍), from Zitong Commandery (梓潼郡). Li Xiang was famous for his talent and capacity, his reputation was similar to Chen Shou. He was recommended as a &quot;xiucai&quot; (秀才) and served as a Gentleman of Writing (尚書郎). He was reassigned to be the Administrator (太守) of Jianping Commandery (建平郡), but he declined the appointment and claimed that he was ill because he wanted to remain in his home province. He was then appointed as the Administrator of Guanghan Commandery (廣漢郡 around present-day Guanghan, Sichuan). Relations between Chen Shou and Li Xiang deteriorated and they started making false accusations against each other. Other officials scorned them for their petty quarrels.

===Qiao Zhou&#x27;s advice to Chen Shou===
According to the &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, Chen Shou&#x27;s mentor, Qiao Zhou, often told Chen, &quot;You&#x27;ll become famous for your talent. However, it might not be a misfortune if you encounter any setback. You should be more mindful about what you do.&quot; Fang Xuanling remarked that Chen Shou&#x27;s experiences – being demoted and humiliated when he was in Shu, and again while he was serving under the Jin dynasty – fitted what Qiao Zhou said about him.

==Appraisal==
Chang Qu, who wrote Chen Shou&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; (&quot;Huayang Guo Zhi&quot;), appraised Chen Shou as follows: &quot;Learn from the past, promote and consolidate those reflections.&quot;

==Legacy==
After Chen Shou&#x27;s death, the official Fan Jun (范頵) and others wrote a memorial to Emperor Hui: &quot;In the past, Emperor Wu of Han issued an imperial decree: &#x27;Sima Xiangru is critically ill. Retrieve his writings.&#x27; The emissary who collected Sima Xiangru&#x27;s writings told Emperor Wu about the &quot;fengshan&quot; ceremonies, which were mentioned in Sima&#x27;s writings. The emperor was very surprised. We, Your Majesty&#x27;s subjects, propose: The late &quot;zhishu shi yushi&quot; Chen Shou wrote the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, which contains good advice and evaluates successes and failures. It is beneficial to promoting culture. Even though its writing style is not comparable to the works of (Sima) Xiangru, its message is simpler and clearer. We hope that it can be collected and reproduced.&quot; Emperor Hui approved and issued an imperial decree ordering the Intendant of Henan (河南尹) and Prefect of Luoyang (洛陽令) to send scribes to Chen Shou&#x27;s house and copy the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;.

In the fifth century, Emperor Wen of the Liu Song dynasty felt that Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; was too short and not comprehensive enough, so he commissioned Pei Songzhi to annotate the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. Pei Songzhi completed his assignment in 429. He included new materials he collected through research, and added his personal commentary. Pei Songzhi&#x27;s annotations increased the length of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; to nearly twice its original.

===Wanjuanlou===
The Wanjuanlou () – a tourist attraction in the Xishan Scenic Spot, Shunqing District, Nanchong, Sichuan – is named the source of the culture of the Three Kingdoms period by the Sichuan provincial government. The tower was constructed in the early third century (222–237) during the Three Kingdoms era. It was also the place where Chen Shou studied in his early life. It was destroyed in the 1960s after years of neglect, but was rebuilt in 1990 by the Chinese government at a cost of four million yuan.

The present tower, which covers an area of 2,400 square metres, consists of three main attractions – the Reading Tower of Chen Shou, the Chen Shou Memorial Hall, and Collecting Books Tower. The tower has on display a collection of writings, illustrations, objects and photographs related to Chen Shou&#x27;s life, his works and his legacy.

<text>Gabriel Auguste Daubrée MIF FRS FRSE (25 June 181429 May 1896) was a French geologist, best known for applying experimental methods to structural geology. He served as the director of the École des Mines as well as the president of the French Academy of Sciences.

==Life==
Daubrée was born at Metz, and educated at the École Polytechnique in Paris.

At the age of twenty he had qualified as a mining engineer, and in 1838 he was appointed to take charge of the mines in the Bas-Rhin (Alsace), and subsequently to be professor of mineralogy and geology at the Faculty of Sciences, Strasbourg. In 1859 he became engineer in chief of mines, and in 1861, upon the death of Louis Cordier, he was appointed professor of geology at the Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris and was also elected member of the French Academy of Sciences. In the following year he became professor of mineralogy at the École des Mines, and in 1872 director of that school. In 1878 Daubrée was elected vice-president and in 1879 president of the French Academy of Sciences. In 1880 the Geological Society of London awarded to him the Wollaston medal. In 1881 he was promoted to Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour.

His published research dates from 1841, when the origin of certain tin minerals attracted his attention; he subsequently discussed the formation of bog-iron ore, and worked out in detail the geology of the Bas-Rhin (1852). From 1857 to 1861, while engaged in engineering works connected with the springs of Plombieres, he made a series of observations on thermal waters and their influence on the Roman masonry through which they made their exit. He was, however, especially distinguished for his long-continued and often dangerous experiments on the artificial production of minerals and rocks. He likewise discussed the permeability of rocks by water, and the effects of such infiltration in producing volcanic phenomena; he dealt with the subject of metamorphism, with the deformations of the Earth&#x27;s crust, with earthquakes, and with the composition and classification of meteorites.

He was elected an international Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1863, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1881, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1895.

He died in Paris on 29 May 1896.

==Legacy==

A sulfide mineral found in meteorites (Daubréelite), a bismuth oxide (Daubréeite) and a crater on the Moon (Daubrée crater) were named after him.

<text>&quot;Wedding Preparations in the Country&quot; (German: &quot;Hochzeitsvorbereitungen auf dem Lande&quot;) is an incomplete work by Franz Kafka which depicts in great detail the journey of the groom, Raban, travelling to the country to meet his future wife, Betty. Written between 1907 and 1908, three fragments with missing pages have survived, and, as with most of Kafka&#x27;s work, they were published after his death by his friend Max Brod. According to Brod, Kafka&#x27;s intention was to complete the story as a novel. An English translation of the story appears in &quot;The Complete Stories of Franz Kafka&quot;.

<text>Derek Walsh Webb (born May 27, 1974) is an American singer-songwriter of independent and formerly Christian music who first entered the music industry as a member of the band Caedmon&#x27;s Call, and later embarked on a successful solo career. As a member of the Houston, Texas-based Caedmon&#x27;s Call, Webb has seen career sales approaching 1 million records, along with 10 GMA Dove Award nominations and three Dove Award wins and six No. 1 Christian radio hits.

In 2003, Webb left Caedmon&#x27;s Call to pursue a solo career. Since his departure, he has released seven studio albums (including one instrumental), a live album, two compilation albums, two covers projects, two DVDs, and two EPs (with his then-wife, Sandra McCracken). While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon&#x27;s Call, Webb has had more of a free hand to shape his work to his vision.

==Early life==
Webb&#x27;s mother, a gifted classically trained pianist, encouraged his musical interests at a very young age. Music came naturally to him, and he began to play the guitar at six years old. Concerning his musical training, Webb explains that he got his ear for music from his mother, but not the ability to read music, and that he &quot;took one [guitar] lesson and then just taught myself out of the book.&quot; While in high school, he became known for his skill on the guitar. He toured with a band, though it broke up in his junior year following a serious car accident returning from playing a show at Baylor University. Webb graduated from Klein High School in Klein, Texas in 1992. Before joining Caedmon&#x27;s Call, he went to community college in Houston for half a semester, and shared an apartment with his older brother who was attending medical school.

==Caedmon&#x27;s Call==
Caedmon&#x27;s Call was formed in 1993 with four original members (three of whom still remain), Cliff Young, Danielle Glenn, Todd Bragg, and Aaron Tate. Aaron Tate, however, never intended to tour with the band, and was included in a songwriting capacity only, sharing those duties with Derek Webb who also played lead guitar.

Webb&#x27;s invitation to join Caedmon&#x27;s Call came from Tate, who at the time was attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. Shortly afterward, Webb made the trip to Fort Worth and met future bandmate Cliff Young. Webb says, &quot;I essentially just joined that band immediately. And as soon as I joined the band, I quit college the same day.&quot; As a result, for almost a full school year he pretended to go to class, with his family unaware he was actually pursuing the band in lieu of going to school.

In June 1994, the band released their first album, &quot;My Calm // Your Storm&quot;, originally a cassette-only demo recording. It was re-printed twice the same year with different cover art each time. In 1996 the band signed with now-defunct Christian label Warner Alliance, producing their self-titled release. Peaking at 110 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album went on to win the GMA 1998 Modern Rock Album of the Year.

After the collapse of Warner Alliance in 1998, Caedmon&#x27;s Call signed to Essential Records, where they released &quot;40 Acres&quot; (1999), &quot;Long Line of Leavers&quot; (2000), &quot;In the Company of Angels: A Call to Worship&quot; (2001), &quot;Back Home&quot; (2003). All of these albums were moderately successful, peaking at 61, 58, 72, and 66 respectively on the Billboard 200. Notably, Webb did not provide any songwriting for &quot;In the Company of Angels&quot; or &quot;Back Home&quot;, despite having been a primary songwriter for the band prior to their release. During this time period, Webb also contributed to &quot;City on a Hill: Songs of Worship and Praise&quot; (2000) and &quot;City on a Hill: Sing Alleluia&quot; (2002), both as a member of Caedmon&#x27;s Call and as a solo artist, which respectively garnered the GMA 2001 &amp; 2003 Special Event Album of the Year awards.

In 2001, Webb left the band to pursue his solo career, although he continued to contribute to their next album &quot;Back Home&quot;. Caedmon&#x27;s Call then released &quot;Chronicles 1992–2004&quot; (2004), a best-of collection of the band&#x27;s work, which included work by Webb. In 2007, Caedmon&#x27;s Call signed onto INO Records, and Webb was featured as singer and songwriter on the album, &quot;Overdressed&quot;. He continued to be involved with the band as producer on the 2011 album &quot;Raising Up the Dead&quot;.

Webb has considered himself a solo act since 2001, but admits his continued collaboration with the band can make it seem like he never left, saying &quot;Caedmon&#x27;s Call, as it turns out, is very much like hotel california: you can check out anytime you’d like, but you can never really leave.&quot;

On May 22, 2007, it was announced that Webb had again worked with Caedmon&#x27;s Call, writing and recording for their album, entitled &quot;Overdressed&quot;, and would be joining the band on their subsequent tour.

==Solo career==
His first solo album, &quot;She Must and Shall Go Free&quot; (2003) caused controversy when some Christian retailers refused to stock the album for its use of &quot;strong&quot; language. One of the songs that was the basis for controversy was &quot;Wedding Dress&quot; where Webb compares Christians who seek fulfillment in things outside of Christ to a person committing adultery. An introspective tune, Webb writes that &quot;I am a whore I do confess / I put you on just like a wedding dress&quot;. Another song that generated controversy was &quot;Saint and Sinner&quot; where Webb wrote &quot;I used to be a damned mess but now I look just fine, &#x27;Cause you dressed me up and we drank the finest wine&quot;. The word &#x27;damned&#x27; was removed from the final version of the album, at the request of two major Christian retailers. Following the release of &quot;She Must and Shall Go Free&quot;, Webb embarked on a national tour in which he played living room concerts. This provided the opportunity to have greater interaction with his listeners. He went on to release a live album in 2004 from tour: &quot;The House Show&quot;.

His second solo studio record, &quot;I See Things Upside Down&quot; (2004), generated mixed reviews. &quot;I See Things Upside Down&quot; was not marketed to the same typical Christian music radio stations that &quot;She Must and Shall Go Free&quot; and his work with Caedmon&#x27;s Call was, though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics. In comparison to Webb&#x27;s previous work, this album has what&#x27;s been referred to as an &quot;experimental&quot; style to it, and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect. Webb has stated that the album &quot;was doing away with people&#x27;s expectations to free me up to do what I wanted.&quot; Following the release of &quot;I See Things Upside Down&quot;, Webb released a live concert DVD, &quot;How to Kill and Be Killed&quot; (2005).

His third studio album, &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, was released on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in what he sees as some of the greatest problems the world is facing today. To broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered &quot;Mockingbird&quot; for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 1, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.

On January 30, 2007, Webb released two EPs, each containing the same ten songs from earlier in his solo career, including pieces from each of his three solo studio albums. &quot;One Zero (Acoustic)&quot;, contains acoustic reinterpretations of the songs, and is available in stores only. &quot;One Zero (Remix)&quot; makes use of the original recording sessions for each of the songs, but has been remixed by engineer Will Hunt. This more experimental record is available only online.

Webb&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Ringing Bell&quot; was released on May 1, 2007. Before the release date, it was available for pre-order at TheRingingBell.com in a deluxe edition which included a 96-page graphic novel inspired by the album. Those who pre-ordered the deluxe edition of the album were also able to immediately download it in its entirety.

On May 12, 2009, Webb sent a message to his email mailing list stating that his next album &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; was deemed too controversial for his record label to release. &quot;It seems I&#x27;ve finally found the line beyond which my label can support me, and apparently I&#x27;ve crossed it,&quot; Webb writes. &quot;[A]t this point we&#x27;re not sure when the record will come out and in what form. The majority of the controversy is surrounding one song, which I consider to be among the most important songs on the record …. [B]ecause of various legal/publishing issues we&#x27;re having to be rather careful with how we do what we&#x27;re going to do next.&quot;.

Webb&#x27;s solo release &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; was released on his website, derekwebb.com, on July 7, 2009, as a digital release. He has also made physical copies of both the edited and unedited versions of the CD available by September 1, 2009.

In late 2011 Derek Webb collaborated on the soundtrack for the film, &quot;Nexus&quot;.

On September 3, 2013, Webb released &quot;I Was Wrong, I&#x27;m Sorry &amp; I Love You&quot;.

On September 29, 2017, Webb released &quot;Fingers Crossed&quot; which was promoted as &quot;a deeply personal tale of two divorces,&quot; touching on themes of his marriage ending and his loss of faith.

On February 21, 2020, Webb released &quot;Targets&quot; with the tagline, &quot;the time for grief is over&quot;.

On April 7, 2023, Webb released &quot;The Jesus Hypothesis,&quot; an album about finding meaning and beauty and exploring issues of gender identity and sexuality.

==Business ventures==

While on tour, Webb noticed that attendance at his shows had increased dramatically after he had made &quot;Mockingbird&quot; available for free online. Inspired by that realization, Webb helped form NoiseTrade, a website that allows users to download music for free from independent musicians.

==Personal life==

On April 17, 2014, Webb and his then-wife, singer-songwriter Sandra McCracken, announced that they were divorcing after thirteen years of marriage due to Webb having had an extramarital affair. 

Webb later married Abbie Parker of the Christian music band I Am They.

<text>Summerland Way is a 199–kilometre state route, designated B91, in New South Wales. It runs generally north from Grafton to the state border with Queensland just west of Mount Lindesay, and continues from there into Queensland as Mount Lindesay Highway. It was named as the region in runs through is a popular tourist area for people during summer.

Summerland Way is an alternative route to Pacific Highway. It is sealed for its entire length, although some of the road north of Lions Road turn-off is narrow and winding.

==Route==
Summerland Way starts south of the Queensland border to Woodenbong, then heads in a southerly direction through Kyolge, Casino, and Whiporie to eventually reach Grafton on the Clarence River.

Summerland Way crossed the river over the original Grafton Bridge, but now does so over the Balun Bindarray Bridge since its opening in 2019.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Great Northern Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 9) from near Woodenbong to the state border with Queensland (and continuing southwest via Tenterfield, Glen Innes, Tamworth, Singleton, Newcastle, Gosford, Peat&#x27;s Ferry and Hornsby to North Sydney), Main Road No. 140 was declared from the intersection with Great Northern Highway near Woodenbong, via Kyogle to the intersection with Tenterfield-Lismore Road (today Bruxner Highway) at Casino, and Main Road No. 151 was declared from Casino via Myrtle Creek to the intersection with Gwydir Highway at South Grafton, on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highway 9 and Main Roads 140 and 151 on 8 April 1929. Great Northern Highway was renamed New England Highway through New South Wales on 14 March 1933 (continuing southwest via Tenterfield, Glen Innes, Tamworth and Singleton to Hexham). The southern end of Main Road 151 was later extended from South Grafton via Glenreagh to the jetty at Coffs Harbour on 16 March 1938. Trunk Road 83 was declared on 20 July 1949, from the intersection with New England Highway near Woodenbong, via Kyogle, Casino, Myrtle Creek and Grafton to the intersection with Gwydir Highway in South Grafton, subsuming Main Road 140 and the alignment of Main Road 151 between Casino and South Grafton; Main Road 151 was truncated at South Grafton as a result.

New England Highway was re-routed through Warwick and Cunninghams Gap in Queensland on 11 August 1954. Against the wishes of the Beaudesert Shire Council and the Woodenbong Chamber of Commerce, the former alignment of New England Highway from Tenterfield through Beaudesert to Brisbane was re-declared Mount Lindesay Highway, after Mount Lindesay, the residue of a solidified magma core, that is part of the Mount Warning volcanic area and is situated in the western extreme of Border Ranges National Park. The Department of Main Roads (which had succeeded the MRB in 1932), declared the New South Wales section as State Highway 24, from Woodenbong to the state border with Queensland (and continuing southwest via Legume to Tenterfield).

Trunk Road 83 was officially named Summerland Way on 10 April 1974.

The New South Wales section of Mount Lindesay Highway, which still included unsealed portions, was eventually de-gazetted as a highway by the Department of Main Roads on 23 December 1981 due to very low traffic volumes, it was renamed Mount Lindesay Road and re-declared as Main Road 622. Summerland Way was consequently extended north 9.4 km along the alignment of the former highway to meet the Queensland end of Mount Lindesay Highway at the state border, and the eastern end of Mount Lindesay Road was truncated at the intersection with Summerland Way just east of Woodenbong.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, when Pacific Highway&#x27;s Grafton bypass opened in May 2020, Summerland Way (as Main Road 83) was officially extended south along the old alignment of Pacific Highway on 5 July 2022, although the road is known locally and sign-posted as Big River Way. Summerland Way today, as part of Main Road 83, still retains this declaration.

In 1996, the Federal Government committed $20 million toward upgrading the Summerland Way. A $7 million contract to realign 1.2 km at Dourrigan&#x27;s Gap, approximately 16 km north of Kyogle, was awarded, with work starting in February 2002 and expected to take 12 months to complete.

Summerland Way was signed State Route 91 across its entire length in 1974. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B91.

===Grafton===
European settlement along the Clarence River had reached the area where Grafton now stands in the 1830s, with a store and shipyard being established at South Grafton in 1839. By the early 1840s there was a wharf, a store and an inn on the northern bank of the river.

Prior to 1861, when a punt service began operating on the river, the only way to cross was by rowboat. A steam-driven vehicular ferry began operating in the mid-1860s. This increased the need for a reliable road to areas north of Grafton.

By 1905 the Casino to North Grafton section of the North Coast railway line had been completed, but there was no rail connection to the south until 1915, when the North Coast railway line reached South Grafton and services were connected by a rail ferry that transported railcars across the river.

In 1932, a bridge across the Clarence River with a unique design of two storeys with the railway running underneath the road, known as Grafton Bridge, was opened. This led to a further increase in motor vehicle traffic to the north, and to a need for road improvements.

In December 2019, the New Grafton Bridge (now Balun Bindarray Bridge) opened and runs parallel to the original bridge. Summerland Way was permanently rerouted via Villers Street, Pound Street and Shirley Adams Way over the Balun Bindarray Bridge, and no longer runs along Prince, Fitzroy, Craig and Bent Streets. The new route bypasses the Grafton city centre and avoids the low 3.5m clearance rail bridge over Prince Street. When the Pacific Highway through Grafton was bypassed in May 2020, the B91 route (but not Summerland Way) was further extended along the old Pacific Highway (now Big River Way) and interchange with Pacific Highway at Glenugie.

===Mount Lindesay===
In 1928, Great Northern Highway was declared, although part of it had not yet been built. Construction of the “missing link” between Woodenbong and Mount Lindesay was completed in 1929, and a section west of Woodenbong was reconstructed by 1934.

In 1935 the Summerland Way was constructed between Casino and the recently completed highway. During World War II the road was improved as an inland, flood-free route to Brisbane which avoided the problems associated with the Clarence River and its two ferry crossings.

===Kyogle===
In the 1830s a huge property, known as “Richmond Head”, was established in the upper Richmond River valley. The area around what is now Kyogle was settled throughout the 1840s and 1850s, but the name “Kyogle” was not used before 1899. In the 1860s cedar cutters arrived and for the next thirty years tree felling and sawmilling were the district&#x27;s most important industries. These industries made roads to where they worked, substantially contributing to the road network of the district.

Road access from Casino was facilitated by the opening of the bridge at Casino in 1876. The road was the only means of travel to Casino until 1910, when the railway reached Kyogle.

===Casino===
European settlement along the Richmond River had reached the area where Casino now stands in the early 1850s, when a village known as “The Falls” was established on the northern side. In 1876 a bridge across the Richmond River to the settlement was completed, enabling road access from Grafton in the south and on to Kyogle in the north. The road was the only means of travel to Grafton until 1905, when the railway reached the town.

<doc id="937952" wikidata="Q633167" url="?curid=937952" title="Archibald Geikie">
<text>Sir Archibald Geikie (28 December 183510 November 1924) was a Scottish geologist and writer.

==Early life==
Geikie was born in Edinburgh in 1835, the eldest son of Isabella Thom and her husband James Stuart Geikie, a musician and music critic. The elder brother of James Geikie, he was educated at Edinburgh High School and University of Edinburgh.

==Career==
In 1855 Geikie was appointed an assistant with the British Geological Survey. Among his early publications for a popular audience was &quot;The Story of a Boulder; or, Gleanings from the Note-Book of a Geologist&quot; (1858). His ability at once attracted the notice of his chief, Sir Roderick Murchison, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship, and whose biographer he subsequently became.

Geikie completed some early geological mapping with Murchison on complicated regions of schists in the Scottish Highlands; and they jointly published a new geological map of Scotland in 1862. Geikie completed a larger map in 1892. In 1863 he published an important essay &quot;On the Phenomena of the Glacial Drift of Scotland&quot;, in &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgow&quot;, in which the effects of ice action in that country were for the first time clearly and connectedly delineated.

In 1865 Geikie&#x27;s &quot;Scenery of Scotland&quot; (3rd edition, 1901) was published, which was, he claimed, the first attempt to elucidate in some detail the history of the topography of a country. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At this time the Edinburgh school of geologists, prominent among them Sir Andrew Ramsay, with his &quot;Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain&quot; were maintaining the supreme importance of denudation in the configuration of land surfaces, and particularly the erosion of valleys by the action of running water. Geikie&#x27;s book, based on extensive personal knowledge of the country, was an able contribution to the doctrines of the Edinburgh school, of which he himself soon began to rank as one of the leaders. In 1880, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Geological Survey==
In 1867, when a separate branch of the Geological Survey was established for Scotland, he was appointed director. On the foundation of the Murchison professorship of geology and mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh in 1871, he became the first occupant of the chair. He continued to hold these two appointments until 1881. In that year, he was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London and he succeeded Sir Andrew Ramsay in the joint offices of Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology, London, from which he retired in February 1901. A feature of his tenure of office was the impetus given to microscopic petrography, a branch of geology to which he had devoted special study, by a splendid collection of thin sections of British rocks. Later he wrote two Survey Memoirs, &quot;The Geology of Central and Western Fife and Kinross&quot; (1900), and &quot;The Geology of Eastern Fife&quot; (1902).

From the outset of his career, when he started to investigate the geology of Skye and other of the Western Isles, he took a keen interest in volcanic geology, and in 1871 he brought before the Geological Society of London an outline of the Tertiary volcanic history of Britain. Many difficult problems, however, remained to be solved. Here he was greatly aided by his extensive travels not only throughout Europe, but in western America. While the canyons of the Colorado River confirmed his long-standing views on erosion, the volcanic regions of Wyoming, Montana and Utah supplied him with valuable data in explanation of volcanic phenomena. The results of his further research were given in an essay entitled &quot;The History of Volcanic Action during the Tertiary Period in the British Isles,&quot; in &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; (1888). His views on volcanic geology were delivered in his presidential addresses to the Geological Society of London in 1891 and 1892 and afterward embodied in his book &quot;The Ancient Volcanoes of Great Britain&quot; (1897). Other results of his travels are collected in &quot;Geological Sketches at Home and Abroad&quot; (1882).

==Writings==
Geikie wrote a biography of Edward Forbes (with G Wilson), and biographies of his predecessors Sir Roderick Impey Murchison (two volumes, 1875) and Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay (1895). His book &quot;Founders of Geology&quot; consists of the inaugural course of lectures (founded by Mrs George Huntington Williams) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, delivered in 1897.

In 1897 he issued a &quot;Geological Map of England and Wales, with Descriptive Notes&quot;. In 1898 he delivered the Romanes Lectures, which was published under the title of &quot;Types of Scenery and their Influence on Literature&quot;. The study of physical geography in Great Britain improved largely due to his efforts. Among his works on this subject is &quot;The Teaching of Geography&quot; (1887). His other books include &quot;Scottish Reminiscences&quot; (1904) and &quot;Landscape in History and other Essays&quot; (1905). His &quot;Birds of Shakespeare&quot; was published in 1916.

He was the editor of &quot;The Geological Structure of the North-West Highlands of Scotland&quot; (1907, His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office), written by B. N. Peach, John Horne, William Gunn (1837–1902), C. T. Clough, L. W. Hinxman, and J. H. H. Teall.

==Honours and awards==
Geikie was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865. Geikie was Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society from 1890 to 1894, Joint Secretary from 1903 to 1908 and elected president in 1909 and awarded their Royal Medal in 1896. He was President of the Geological Society of London in 1891 and 1892, and again in 1906 and 1907. He was also President of the British Association in 1892.

He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

He received a knighthood in 1891, the Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1907 and the Order of Merit in 1914. In 1905 he received the RSGS Livingstone Medal.

Dorsa Geikie, a wrinkle ridge system on the Moon, and the mineral geikielite, a magnesium-titanium oxide, are both named after him, as is Geikie Gorge in the Napier Range in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, Mount Geikie in the Canadian Rockies, Mount Geikie in Wyoming, Geikie Peak in the Grand Canyon, and the Geikie Slide in the Atlantic Ocean northwest of Scotland.

==Death==
He died at his home, &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Down&quot; in Haslemere, Surrey and is buried there in the village churchyard.

==Family==
In 1871, Geikie married Alice Gabrielle Anne Marie Pignatel, daughter of Eugene Pignatel of Lyons. They had a son Roderick (killed in early life) and three daughters, Lucie, Elsie and Gabrielle.

<text>Seleucus is a lunar impact crater located in the western part of Oceanus Procellarum. To the west is the lava-flooded remains of the walled plain Eddington. To the southwest is the crater Krafft and to the northwest lies Briggs.
The rim of Seleucus is well-formed, with a d inner rim and a slight . The floor is relatively flat, with a small central peak. A bright ray from Glushko crater, about 500 km to the southwest, grazes the southeastern rim of Seleucus.

The narrowness of the rim of Seleucus and the abrupt contact between its raised rim and the surrounding mare prove that the final mare flooding occurred after the crater was formed, and so the crater is older than the youngest (uppermost) mare basalts in the vicinity.

Approximately 50 kilometers to the southeast of Seleucus, on the Oceanus Procellarum, is the landing site of the Soviet landing craft Luna 13.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Seleucus.

<text>William Crawford Williamson (24 November 1816 – 23 June 1895) was an English naturalist and palaeobotanist.

==Early life==
Williamson was born at Scarborough, North Yorkshire, the son of John Williamson, and Elizabeth Crawford. His father, after beginning life as a gardener, became a well-known local naturalist, who, in conjunction with William Bean, first explored the rich fossiliferous beds of the Yorkshire coast. He was for many years first curator of the Scarborough natural history museum (Rotunda Museum). William Smith, the &quot;father of English geology,&quot; lived for two years in the Williamsons&#x27; house. Young Williamson&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a lapidary, and from him he learnt the art of cutting stones.

==Career==
Entering a medical career, he for three years acted as curator of the Natural History Society&#x27;s museum at Manchester. After completing his medical studies at University College, London, in 1841, he returned to Manchester to practise his profession.

When Owen&#x27;s College at Manchester was founded in 1851 he became professor of natural history there, with the duty of teaching geology, zoology and botany. A division of labour took place as additional professors were appointed, but he retained the chair of botany down to 1892. Williamson&#x27;s teaching work was not confined to his university classes, for he was also a successful popular lecturer, especially for the Gilchrist Trust. Shortly afterwards retiring in 1892 he moved to Clapham, where he died.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1854, winning its Royal Medal in 1874 and delivering the Bakerian Lecture in 1877.

==Works==

Williamson when little more than sixteen he published a paper on the rare birds of Yorkshire, in 1834 a monograph on the Gristhorpe Man, and still in 1834, presented to the Geological Society of London his first memoir on the Mesozoic fossils of his native district. He assisted Lindley and Hutton in the preparation of their &quot;Fossil Flora of Great Britain&quot;.

His scientific work was pursued in the midst of official and professional duties. In geology, his early work on the zones of distribution of Mesozoic fossils (begun in 1834), and on the part played by microscopic organisms in the formation of marine deposits (1845), was pioneering. In zoology, his investigations of the development of the teeth and bones of fishes (1842–1851), and on recent Foraminifera, a group on which he wrote a monograph for the Ray Society in 1857, were valuable. In botany, in addition to a memoir on the minute structure of &quot;Volvox&quot; (1852), his work on the structure of fossil plants established British palaeobotany on a scientific basis; Williamson ranks with Adolphe Theodore Brongniart as one of its founders.
== Legacy ==

The species &quot;Bathyporeia guilliamsoniana&quot; was named in his honour by Charles Spence Bate.

<text>Kiss is a British digital radio station owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Kiss Network.

Kiss broadcasts nationally to the UK via DAB Digital Radio, as well as on Bauer&#x27;s Rayo platform. 

The station started in 1985 as a pirate radio station, Kiss FM, before becoming the UK&#x27;s first legal black and dance music specialist radio station in 1990.

As of December 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 1 million listeners according to RAJAR.

==Early history==
===Pirate roots===
Kiss FM first broadcast 7 October 1985 as a pirate radio station, initially to South London then across the whole city, on 94FM. Kiss FM was founded by Gordon &quot;Mac&quot; McNamee, George Power (of London Greek Radio), and Tosca Jackson, with its engineer Pyers Easton. Transmitting seven-days from the start, it would be regularly taken off-air by the authorities and so became a weekend operation shortly afterwards.

The station developed a cult and committed following across Greater London, with figures in the press at the time stating that the station commanded some 500,000 listeners while operating as an unlicensed pirate station, and an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 1987 put Kiss second, behind Capital Radio. Gordon Mac approached a successful London club promoter, Guy Wingate, to discuss ways of improving the Kiss FM profile. As a result, Wingate launched the very successful Kiss nights at the Wag Club (which included the first ever UK acid house party – an idea put forward by Colin Faver and Danny Rampling), both DJs on the station. These nights increased the station&#x27;s credibility with its target audience and Wingate joined the Kiss team, followed shortly thereafter by Lindsay Wesker. Kiss would also run its own night at Dingwalls and adopted the slogan &quot;Radical Radio&quot;.

Mac and ten of the DJs on the station including Norman Jay, Jonathan More, Colin Faver, Trevor Nelson, and Tim Westwood would become &quot;shareholders&quot; in a company called Goodfoot Promotions, with Mac heading up the station as its majority holder. By 1988, Kiss was at its strongest with a DJ line-up which had become the cream of London&#x27;s clubland, and in that December, Mac and the other shareholders would announce that they would decide to close down in order to apply for a legal licence. This was in response to the UK Government and Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) announcement that twenty new &quot;incremental radio&quot; licences would be advertised, including one for London. Stations were told that they would have to voluntarily closedown when applying, and so on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1988, the final broadcast went out with an outside broadcast at Dingwalls.
Kiss would submit a strong application with widespread support from listeners, clubs, record labels and music magazines, however on 12 July 1989, the IBA instead awarded the licence to Jazz FM.

===Legal licence===
Despite the temptation to return to the air again illegally, Kiss held off as the IBA had said they would make more licences available, which they did in September 1989. Kiss re-prepared their application, but this time got the backing and majority investment of media group EMAP. On 17 December 1989, the IBA announced that Kiss had been awarded a licence on their second attempt.

Kiss established its new studios and office on Holloway Road, and on 1 September 1990, Kiss began legal broadcasting as Kiss 100. Gordon Mac led a countdown in the studio to the official launch at 12pm; the first tune played being &quot;Pirates Anthem&quot; by Cocoa Tea and Shabba Ranks, followed by Norman Jay hosting the very first full show.

The Channel 4 documentary &quot;Radical Radio&quot; followed Kiss as it came off air as a pirate station, gained its licence, built its new studios, and commenced legal broadcasting.

===Kiss 101 (Bristol)===

Starting out as a Bristol pirate radio station, it became part of the Galaxy Radio network broadcasting to South Wales and the West of England, playing pop, dance, hip hop, urban, R&amp;B and electronic music as Galaxy 101. It was eventually bought by EMAP and became Kiss 101 in September 2006 and part of the Kiss network.

===Kiss 102 (Manchester) and Kiss 105 (Yorkshire)===

The Faze FM group licensed the name and logo from Kiss 100 to launch Kiss 102 in Manchester in October 1994. In February 1997, it expanded into Yorkshire launching Kiss 105. The group was later sold to Chrysalis Radio, and by September 1997 both stations became part of the Galaxy Radio network.

===Kiss 105-108 (East Anglia)===

The East Anglian and Severn Estuary versions of Kiss were previously known as Vibe FM with DJs Nikki Elise and Ric Groves. EMAP bought the stations from Scottish Radio Holdings in August 2005, and rebranded them in September 2006.

In July 2023, Ofcom approved Bauer&#x27;s request to the change the format of Kiss in the East of England. This meant that from the 12th September 2023, Kiss on 105.6 (Cambridge), 106.4 (Ipswich and Suffolk) and 107.7 (Peterborough) would have its format changed and carry Greatest Hits Radio instead. Kiss would however continue to broadcast on FM to Norwich and Norfolk across 106.1 effectively becoming a small local licence instead of a regional one. The change was approved despite opposition from Nation Broadcasting and Star

===EMAP rebranding and criticism===

EMAP took full control of Kiss 100 as early as 1992, but with Mac having left the station in March 1998, EMAP would embark on a rebranding of the station and to align it with the rest of its radio operations.

In December 1998, one of the station&#x27;s most popular DJs, Steve Jackson, was dismissed resulting in a high-profile court case, whilst the changes led to criticism from both former presenters and listeners alike, concerned that Kiss 100 was losing its musical direction. DJs Coldcut, Bob Jones, and Manasseh quit the station in January 1999 in protest at the changes being implemented. Other DJs at this time were being lured away by the increasingly dance-oriented BBC Radio 1.

Mark Story (previously of Magic 105.4) was appointed as the new Director of Music Programming, along with moving the Kiss studios and office to EMAPs main premises at Mappin House, Central London, and creating a new logo. Andy Roberts became Kiss Programme Director.

In July 1999, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported: &quot;In preparation for the new ad campaign, the biggest in the station&#x27;s history, EMAP has spent twelve months changing the output of the station. Over ten DJs have parted company with the station, including Steve Jackson, who won the Sony breakfast show award this year. In the words of Mr Cox [EMAP marketing director], the music on the station has been &quot;smoothed out&quot;.&quot;

===Ofcom record fine===

In June 2006, Kiss 100 was fined £175,000 by media regulator Ofcom, a record fee for any UK commercial radio station. Ofcom punished Kiss 100 for &quot;numerous and serious breaches&quot; of broadcasting codes after receiving ten complaints from April to November 2005. They involved prank calls on the Bam Bam breakfast show where consent was not sought from the &quot;victims&quot; and controversial material aired when children were likely to be listening. Kiss 100 said it accepted the findings and apologised for any offence

===Second rebranding and Kiss network===

EMAP introduced a second major revamp of the Kiss brand on 6 September 2006. This included a new logo designed by oddlondon, a renewed focus on dance music, more specialist shows and a new website for all three Kiss stations, replacing the previous website.

The relaunch was implemented simultaneously with the rebranding of Kiss 100&#x27;s sister dance stations, Vibe 101 and Vibe 105–108 as Kiss 101 and Kiss 105-108 respectively. Changes at Kiss 100 were introduced to address falling listener figures and to keep the station competitive in the highly contested London market. Roberts became its Group Programme Director.

A year later, EMAP sold its radio division to Bauer Radio.

===DAB changes and Rodigan departure===

In December 2010, Ofcom approved the request from Bauer to drop local programming content from the three Kiss stations, creating a national service on the condition that Kiss would be available on 35 DAB multiplexes around the UK on the day local information is dropped, rising to 38 within three months of the changes.

On 27 December 2012, Kiss 100 appeared nationally on Digital One&#x27;s national DAB multiplex.

David Rodigan, who had been with Kiss since its legal launch in 1990, resigned in November 2012, citing the &quot;continued marginalisation of reggae music&quot; on the station.

Under Roberts, Kiss extended its stations, launching Kisstory in May 2013.

===Norway and Finland===
On 26 February 2016, Kiss was launched in Norway rebranded from The Voice Hiphop &amp; RnB Norway and Finland.

=== FM changes ===
In January 2023, station owners Bauer submitted plans to Ofcom to change the format of the FM frequencies held by Kiss on 105.6 MHz (Cambridge), 106.4 MHz (Suffolk) and 107.7 MHz (Peterborough). The application was approved in July 2023, with the frequencies becoming relays of Greatest Hits Radio, leaving Kiss on 100 MHz (London), 97.2 MHz (Bristol), 101 MHz (Severn Estuary) and 106.1 MHz (Norwich).

In August 2024, Bauer announced that Kiss would be replaced on FM in London, the Severn Estuary and Norwich by Hits Radio, with Kiss retaining its frequency in Bristol. Then on 20 September 2024, Bauer announced that the switch will take place on 23 September, sooner than expected as it was believed that Bauer would wait until the new Media Act became law, eliminating the need to make a format change request to Ofcom. It was also announced that the 97.2 frequency in Bristol will also carry Hits Radio. On 22 September 2024, at 10 pm, Kiss became digital only.
