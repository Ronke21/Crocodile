<text>Military miniaturism is a niche within the broader hobby of modeling focusing on military subjects. It is itself a rather broad subject, dealing with any scale model of military theme. It has an ever growing range of sub-hobbies, including scale figure modeling, armour modeling, model ship building, military aviation modeling, and historical wargaming.

==Modeling==
===Building===
Given the nature of military models, hobby practitioners for the most part lean toward realism in their creations. The way in which these creations are produced are nearly as wide as the hobby itself, ranging from building a model kit &quot;from the box&quot; to kitbashing to complete scratch building of a model. A wide range of kits are available on the market, with built results ranging from hyper-detailed representations of a subject to crude playthings. Aircraft kits tend to contain a cockpit interior, with some kits opting to include a full engine as well. Armor kit often feature workable hatches for crew figures, and a few contain fully detailed interiors. Prices also range greatly, from below $20 to over $100. Most modern kits, of all scales, are made mainly from a hard plastic (typically styrene) through injection molding. However, high end kits typically contain photoetch. Despite the general trend towards plastic, some kits are still made entirely from resin or white metal. There are even kits made entirely of photoetched metal on the market. Construction is typically carried out using plastic cement or cyanoacrylate (&quot;super glue&quot;) to attach parts. Plastic parts normally require removal from a sprue use side cutters or a hobby knife. Parts are typically cleaned of seam lines and other imperfections from the molding process before attachment. Upon completion of a model, it is common practice to paint it (see &quot;finishing&quot;).

===Workshop===
The next important step is to decide where to build. You can create a scale model almost anywhere, but here are a few tips for choosing your model kit workshop:

Bench size – Simply put, you&#x27;ll need a table or bench big enough to hold the many parts that make up your model car or model plane.

Lighting – You can&#x27;t build a scale model in a dark environment (or at least you shouldn&#x27;t try it) Lighting is so important. Make sure you have a spacious and bright environment to get started with scale modeling.

Storage containers – as mentioned above, your model kits come with many items. Avoid losing important components by storing them in organized boxes or drawers.

Making the right seat – the model car is a long-term project. Do your body a favor and choose a chair that you can sit comfortably in. 

===Aftermarket kits===
After market kits are add-ons to a main kit, meant to increase detail and correct incocities in the original kit. These kits come in many forms, but the most common materials used are white metal, resin and photoetched metal. Cast metal is typically used in replacement pats or to add small details, including main gun barrels and machine guns for armour models and wheel struts on aircraft. White metal has recently fallen out of favor on aftermarket kits in favor of resin. Resin pieces of models are typically produced either through molding or 3D printing. It is valued for its ability to hold crisp detail and be modified. Tires for vehicles, heads for figures, and assorted other details are available in resin. Photoetch is perhaps the most prevalent form of aftermarket goods, appearing in most detail kits and some full models. It consists of thin sheets of brass or nickel that have been laser etched into a firm yet bendable and highly detailed part. Given its versatility, photoetch is used in everything from seatbelts on aircraft to engine grilles on armored vehicles.

=== Finishing ===

====Painting====
Painting scale models is common practice for modelers of all skill levels. The goal is to reproduce the historical color scheme and markings to individualize and increase the realism of the model. Many painting techniques have evolved to serve scale modelers. These techniques use near limitless application processes, varying the consistency, type of paint, and application method. Three main tools are used to apply paint: brushes, spray cans, and airbrushes. Brushes are favored for detail work and general paintwork. Spray paints are used to base coat models or dioramas. Airbrushes are used in a multitude of rolls, filling the niche taken by the spray can as well as giving the modeler the ability to lay down easier soft-edged lines and highlights. Types of paint used are also varied. some modelers prefer acrylic paint, while other prefer enamel paint, and yet more prefer oil paint. However, most hobbyists use a combination of 2, or all three to paint their models. The process of painting a model commonly begins with a primer to help paint adhere to the surface of a model. From there, base colors are applied in either a monotone or a camouflage scheme, depending on the subject. Depth is than added using highlights, shadows, and washes (thinned paint that acts on capillary action). Vehicle markings, including numbers and roundels, are often reproduced with waterslide decals.

====Weathering====
Weathering is the act of distressing a model to give it a &quot;used&quot; look. This skill is crucial in Military miniaturism, as it adds a level or realism necessary to replicate a combat worn object or person. Weathering comes in many forms, as it simply refers to anything that gives the model a look of use. This can come in the form of streaking, rust, mud, and staining among other things. Oil paints are popular for these tasks, due to their long working time. Oils are also often diluted to washes to add a filter or depth to a model. Enamel streaking washes are also popular. Homemade weathering pigments (made from pastels, as well as marketed pigments, are used to create mud and rust effects. Many textured paints are also available to add body to weathering effects.

<text>Saira Shah (born 5 October 1964) is a British author, reporter and documentary filmmaker. She produces, writes and narrates current affairs films.

== Life ==

Shah was born in London and raised in Kent, England. She was educated at Bryanston School and read Arabic and Persian at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, graduating in 1986. Her father was Idries Shah, an Indian-Afghan and half-Scottish writer of books on Sufism. Part of his family was originally from Paghman, Afghanistan. Her mother is half-Indian Parsi and half-English. The author Tahir Shah is her brother and she also has a sister, Tahir&#x27;s twin, Safia Shah.

Shah currently lives between London and rural France with her partner, journalist and photographer Scott Goodfellow, and their son and daughter Hamish and Rosie Goodfellow. Ailsa Goodfellow, their first daughter, died, suddenly, of a pulmonary embolism early in 2017. Shah said: &quot;Ailsa inspired me to write a novel, &quot;The Mouse-Proof Kitchen&quot;, based on her life, which was published in 2013. By then Ailsa had become our teacher, demonstrating how to live with courage, patience and joy – and proving that the essence of humanity lies far deeper than mere development.&quot; The novel gives a vivid account of how the fictional characters Anna and her husband Tobias deal with their daughter Freya&#x27;s birth and the experiences which they must undergo before fully appreciating the miracle of her life.

== News reporter and documentary maker ==

Shah&#x27;s first trip to Afghanistan was when she was 21 years old. She worked for 3 years in Peshawar as a reporter covering the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. She has also worked as a journalist for Channel 4 News, which she left in 2001. She married and divorced (after 5 years) a Swiss reporter, whom she met in Peshawar.

Shah worked with James Miller on several projects including the films &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; (2001), &quot;Unholy War&quot; (2001), both Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; films for the UK documentary company Hardcash productions, and &quot;Death in Gaza&quot; (2004), for their own TV company Frostbite Films. Miller was killed in 2003. In 2004, Shah won a Current Affairs BAFTA Award for &quot;Death in Gaza&quot; and in 2005 the film won three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Cinematography For Nonfiction Programming (Single Or Multi-Camera), Outstanding Directing For Nonfiction Programming and Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking (Shah sharing one award as a producer and being a nominee for another as a writer). Shah also appeared on the television programme &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; on 10 August 2003.

<text>Model military vehicles are miniature versions of military vehicles. They range in size and complexity; from simplified small-scale models for wargaming, to large, super-detailed renditions of specific real-life vehicles.

==Scales==

The &#x27;scale&#x27; is the proportion of actual size the replica or model represents. Scale is usually expressed as a ratio (e.g. &#x27;1:35&#x27;) or as a fraction (e.g. &#x27;1/35&#x27;). In either case it conveys the notion that the replica or model is accurately scaled in all visible proportions from a full-size prototype object. Thus a 1:35 scale model tank is 1/35 the size of the actual vehicle upon which the model is based. Models generally make no attempt to replicate scale weight, only size.

The most popular scales, by far, are 1:35 and 1:72. Other less-commonly used scales for commercially produced kits include: 1:1, 1:6, 1:9 (&quot;Traditional&quot; scale), 1:12, 1:16 (RC tanks, scale model kits), 1:24, 1:25, 1:30, 1:32, 1:48, 1:50, 1:64, 1:87 (railroad HO scale), 1:144, 1:250, 1:285, 1:300, and 1:350. A relatively recent trend led by Tamiya is military vehicle kits in 1:48 scale – a popular scale for military aircraft models. The scale was formerly introduced by companies such as Aurora, and Bandai in the 1970s. However, the scale did not gain popularity mostly because of the accuracy and detail of the scale. Scratchbuilt models may be in any scale but tend to follow the most popular kit scales due to the ease of finding kit components which may be used in the scratchbuilt model.

Larger-scale models tend to incorporate higher levels of detail, but even smaller-scale models may be quite intricate.

==Subjects==

Military vehicle modelers build a wide variety of models. Tanks and other armored fighting vehicles are the most popular subjects at model contests. Modelers also build ordnance, military trucks, tractors, half-tracks, artillery, and lighter vehicles such as jeeps and motorcycles. Models may be displayed in stand-alone mode, that is, with no base, or on a decorative base, often with a label of some kind. More elaborate bases may include scale scenery, intended to depict the setting in which the vehicle served. This trends towards the closely related hobby of diorama building.

Modelers tend to focus on vehicles from three eras: World War I, World War II, and the &quot;modern era&quot;. The first denotes armored vehicles from their inception into combat during the first World War until approximately 1939. Many vehicles of this time period may be considered to be experimental and few made major contributions to the few battles in which they took part.

Models depicting vehicles from the World War I era and the following interwar years are not as numerous as their later world war counterparts, but this is beginning to change in recent years. As of the centenary of the start of World War I, more manufacturers have begun to release kits World War I and interwar subjects: Takom releasing a range of British tanks such as the Mark I and Whippet; Meng providing two variants of the FT-17 and the German A7V and Hobbyboss releasing an interwar Vickers Medium Mark II are all examples of this.

Vehicles used between 1939 and 1945 fall into the World War II category. Even though this era spans the shortest number of years, it is by far the most popular for armor modelers due to the enormous range of vehicles used and the vast improvements in armor technology. During the early part of the war, most armored vehicles were smaller, less heavily armored, and lightly armed. Major tank engagements early on convinced governments on all sides of the need for more survivable and deadlier vehicles. This means that there is a large variety of different subjects which were designed to fulfil different roles under different doctrines.

Any vehicle serving in a setting after 1945 is considered &quot;modern.&quot; This encompasses a longer time span and very large number of armor designs from many countries.

Models may also be categorized by place of service, for example, US or Soviet. They may also be categorized by function, for example, combat engineering vehicles, recovery vehicles, etc. In all cases, the national and unit markings on the replica determine the era and user nationality. For example, a model of a Sherman tank, a World War II design, would be considered a &#x27;modern&#x27; model if the tank were shown in Israeli markings from the Six-Day War. The same vehicle in World War II US Army markings would be considered a World War II Allied subject.

Models are generally built with historical accuracy in mind, and each model may represent many hours of research effort on the part of the modeler. Frequently, modelers display some of their research work alongside their model.

There is generally some crossover of modelers between the eras, though some focus solely on a specific era, country of origin or operation, or even on a specific vehicle and its variants.

==Models and model kits==


===Kits===
Models are usually assembled from commercial kits (for exceptions see below). Typically, a model kit consists of a set of parts, instructions for their assembly, and a small sheet of markings in decal form.

Parts are produced by injection of liquid styrene plastic under very high pressure into complex steel molds. These molds are generally composed of two-halves that sandwich the parts; however, &#x27;slide molds&#x27; may consist of many steel components to allow greater levels of detail to be incorporated into a single sprue. Once the plastic cools, it is removed from the mold. In the 1960s and 1970s, typical vehicle kits might contain 50 to 200 individual parts. Today it is common for a single vehicle kit to contain from 300 to 1200 parts. Each part must be carefully cut from the &#x27;sprue&#x27; (the plastic channels that allow the plastic to flow into the mold and which hold the parts in place), cleaned of any flaws or mold marks, and then assembled.

Instructions consist of paper booklets or sheets supplied with each kit. Usually, instructions show drawings of the parts. A recent trend has been the use of photographs rather than drawings, but these types of instructions have not proven popular and may be declining in use. For a kit with hundreds of parts, good instructions are vital. Flaws in instructions are not uncommon.

Markings for the model usually are provided as decals.

Several companies produce armor model kits, the most famous of which are Airfix, Dragon Models Limited, Tamiya, Trumpeter, Academy, Hobby Fan, Italeri, Revell-Germany/Monogram and AFV Club. The focus of many manufacturers of late has been to increase the accuracy of their kits and provide alternative types of material such as photo etch details and turned metal barrels.

===Models===
Completed models can be categorized generally into three classes: kits built &#x27;out of the box&#x27;, customized kits, and scratchbuilt models.

====&quot;Out of the box&quot; models====
Models built &#x27;out of the box&#x27; are built according to kit instructions, using no materials except those provided in the kit itself. In the past, there was some tendency to view &#x27;out of the box&#x27; builds as simpler or of a lower standard of detail than modified kits (see below). However, recent trends in which kits contain over 1,000 individual pieces including parts from plastic, etched brass, and aluminum have given new meaning to the &#x27;out of the box&#x27; build. Today, a stock kit can be very highly detailed.

====Customized models====
Customized kits are typically built by more experienced modelers who take a kit and add components, either scratchbuilt or commercial conversion or aftermarket accessories. Such models may be more highly detailed than a straight build &#x27;out of the box&#x27; though the trend to more detailed kits is decreasing the difference. The term &#x27;kitbashing&#x27; denotes models built using parts from more than one kit to make a single, more accurate or different model. Many armor modelers engage in the use of aftermarket sets and built from scratch (scratchbuilt) parts to make their models more accurate or simply unique. In extreme, master-level cases, a model with hundreds of kit components may be detailed with several hundred additional commercial and home-fabricated parts to reach a very high level of realism.

====Scratchbuilt models====
Scratchbuilt models are those for which no kit exists; highly skilled modelers create their vehicle from sheet plastic and components they fabricate themselves. Some scratchbuilt models may contain a few commercial components, but typically it is a small proportion of all the model&#x27;s parts.

Scratchbuilt models may also be made from brass and aluminum, cast in pewter (a low temp metal) and cast with 2-part resins in molds made of RTV rubber material. A scratchbuilding modeler should possess talents in the following areas: soldering, gluing, drilling, taping, grinding, sanding, cutting &amp; shaping in metals and plastics, creating RTV molds (1,2 &amp; 3 part types), painting &amp; weathering, research of prototype material, casting in low temp metals, creating sketches and diagrams of what is being made, measuring in inches or millimeters, use of calipers and other specialized tools.

===Aftermarket===
&quot;Aftermarket&quot; denotes any kit or detail set that is sold to replace existing kit parts in order to reproduce a more accurate model or simply a different version not otherwise available. The media used by aftermarket companies range from turned aluminum and brass, photo-etched steel or brass sheets, pre-bent brass wire, cast metals, and resin. Notable aftermarket companies include Formations, The Tank Workshop, Tank, Azimut, Eduard, Verlinden, Friulmodel, Legend, and Modelkasten.

Aftermarket markings are also available. Firms such as Archer Dry Transfers or Decalomaniacs produce stand-alone sheets of wet or dry transfer markings to allow the modeler to complete a different or more accurate variant.

Enthusiasts may pursue military vehicle modeling in its own right or as an adjunct to other military modeling. There is also some crossover with wargaming, diorama building, and re-enacting.

==Displays==
Models may be displayed on their own, on a base or as part of a diorama.

Many models are displayed with no base or other setting. Their wheels or track rest upon the shelf or table on which they are displayed. This display method is the easiest and cheapest, but has the disadvantage that the fragile model may be damaged when handled.

A simple wooden base adds an element of protection to the model because the model itself does not need to be handled, it can be moved by handling the base. Bases may also hold a plate with some information about the model, such as its title or designation, or some historical background. This kind of bases typically consist of a frame of wood or other material. Finishes on bases range from painted plastic to stained wood to simple landscaping. The disadvantage is that the base adds expense and time to the project.

A diorama is a more elaborate base with landscaping to provide a setting for the model, and often includes a story with figures. Dioramas have the same advantages and disadvantages of plain bases, but to a greater degree.

Models are often displayed in competition such as the AMPS annual show, or in club displays at hobby shops and other events.

==Organizations and publications==

Several organizations and publications exist to support and promote the hobby of modeling military vehicles. The Armor Modeling and Preservation Society or AMPS is an 800-plus member organization devoted to the hobby. The International Plastic Modellers&#x27; Society (or IPMS) supports modelers of all types including military vehicle modelers. The Miniature Armoured Fighting Vehicle Association (MAFVA, http://www.mafva.net/) is a UK-based association.

<doc id="944442" wikidata="Q898809" url="?curid=944442" title="Brans–Dicke theory">
<text>In physics, the Brans–Dicke theory of gravitation (sometimes called the Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory) is a competitor to Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. It is an example of a scalar–tensor theory, a gravitational theory in which the gravitational interaction is mediated by a scalar field as well as the tensor field of general relativity. The gravitational constant formula_1 is not presumed to be constant but instead formula_2 is replaced by a scalar field formula_3 which can vary from place to place and with time.

The theory was developed in 1961 by Robert H. Dicke and Carl H. Brans building upon, among others, the earlier 1959 work of Pascual Jordan. At present, both Brans–Dicke theory and general relativity are generally held to be in agreement with observation. Brans–Dicke theory represents a minority viewpoint in physics.

== Comparison with general relativity ==
Both Brans–Dicke theory and general relativity are examples of a class of relativistic classical field theories of gravitation, called &quot;metric theories&quot;. In these theories, spacetime is equipped with a metric tensor, formula_4, and the gravitational field is represented (in whole or in part) by the Riemann curvature tensor formula_5, which is determined by the metric tensor.

All metric theories satisfy the Einstein equivalence principle, which in modern geometric language states that in a very small region (too small to exhibit measurable curvature effects), all the laws of physics known in special relativity are valid in &quot;local Lorentz frames&quot;. This implies in turn that metric theories all exhibit the gravitational redshift effect.

As in general relativity, the source of the gravitational field is considered to be the stress–energy tensor or &quot;matter tensor&quot;. However, the way in which the immediate presence of mass-energy in some region affects the gravitational field in that region differs from general relativity. So does the way in which spacetime curvature affects the motion of matter. In the Brans–Dicke theory, in addition to the metric, which is a &quot;rank two tensor field&quot;, there is a &quot;scalar field&quot;, formula_3, which has the physical effect of changing the &quot;effective gravitational constant&quot; from place to place. (This feature was actually a key of Dicke and Brans; see the paper by Brans cited below, which sketches the origins of the theory.)

The field equations of Brans–Dicke theory contain a parameter, formula_7, called the &quot;Brans–Dicke coupling constant&quot;. This is a true dimensionless constant which must be chosen once and for all. However, it can be chosen to fit observations. Such parameters are often called &quot;tunable parameters&quot;. In addition, the present ambient value of the effective gravitational constant must be chosen as a boundary condition. General relativity contains no dimensionless parameters whatsoever, and therefore is easier to falsify (show whether false) than Brans–Dicke theory. Theories with tunable parameters are sometimes deprecated on the principle that, of two theories which both agree with observation, the more parsimonious is preferable. On the other hand, it seems as though they are a necessary feature of some theories, such as the weak mixing angle of the Standard Model.

Brans–Dicke theory is &quot;less stringent&quot; than general relativity in another sense: it admits more solutions. In particular, exact vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation of general relativity, augmented by the trivial scalar field formula_8, become exact vacuum solutions in Brans–Dicke theory, but some spacetimes which are &quot;not&quot; vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation become, with the appropriate choice of scalar field, vacuum solutions of Brans–Dicke theory. Similarly, an important class of spacetimes, the pp-wave metrics, are also exact null dust solutions of both general relativity and Brans–Dicke theory, but here too, Brans–Dicke theory allows additional &quot;wave solutions&quot; having geometries which are incompatible with general relativity.

Like general relativity, Brans–Dicke theory predicts light deflection and the precession of perihelia of planets orbiting the Sun. However, the precise formulas which govern these effects, according to Brans–Dicke theory, depend upon the value of the coupling constant formula_7. This means that it is possible to set an observational lower bound on the possible value of formula_7 from observations of the solar system and other gravitational systems. The value of formula_11 consistent with experiment has risen with time. In 1973 formula_12 was consistent with known data. By 1981 formula_13 was consistent with known data. In 2003 evidence – derived from the Cassini–Huygens experiment – shows that the value of formula_7 must exceed 40,000.

It is also often taught that general relativity is obtained from the Brans–Dicke theory in the limit formula_15. But Faraoni claims that this breaks down when the trace of the stress-energy momentum vanishes, i.e. formula_16, an example of which is the Campanelli-Lousto wormhole solution. Some have argued that only general relativity satisfies the strong equivalence principle.

== The field equations ==
The field equations of the Brans–Dicke theory are

:formula_17

:formula_18

where
:formula_7 is the dimensionless Dicke coupling constant;
:formula_4 is the metric tensor;
:formula_21 is the Einstein tensor, a kind of average curvature;
:formula_22 is the Ricci tensor, a kind of trace of the curvature tensor;
:formula_23 is the Ricci scalar, the trace of the Ricci tensor;
:formula_24 is the stress–energy tensor;
:formula_25 is the trace of the stress–energy tensor;
:formula_3 is the scalar field;
:formula_27 is the scalar potential;
:formula_28 is the derivative of the scalar potential with respect to formula_3;
:formula_30 is the Laplace–Beltrami operator or covariant wave operator, formula_31.

The first equation describes how the stress–energy tensor and scalar field formula_3 together affect spacetime curvature. The left-hand side, the Einstein tensor, can be thought of as a kind of average curvature. It is a matter of pure mathematics that, in any metric theory, the Riemann tensor can always be written as the sum of the Weyl curvature (or &quot;conformal curvature tensor&quot;) and a piece constructed from the Einstein tensor.

The second equation says that the trace of the stress–energy tensor acts as the source for the scalar field formula_3. Since electromagnetic fields contribute only a traceless term to the stress–energy tensor, this implies that in a region of spacetime containing only an electromagnetic field (plus the gravitational field), the right-hand side vanishes, and formula_3 obeys the (curved spacetime) wave equation. Therefore, changes in formula_3 propagate through &quot;electrovacuum&quot; regions; in this sense, we say that formula_3 is a &quot;long-range field&quot;.

For comparison, the field equation of general relativity is simply

:formula_37

This means that in general relativity, the Einstein curvature at some event is entirely determined by the stress–energy tensor at that event; the other piece, the Weyl curvature, is the part of the gravitational field which can propagate as a gravitational wave across a vacuum region. But in the Brans–Dicke theory, the Einstein tensor is determined partly by the immediate presence of mass–energy and momentum, and partly by the long-range scalar field formula_3.

The &quot;vacuum field equations&quot; of both theories are obtained when the stress–energy tensor vanishes. This models situations in which no non-gravitational fields are present.

== The action principle ==
The following Lagrangian contains the complete description of the Brans–Dicke theory:

:formula_39

where formula_40 is the determinant of the metric, formula_41 is the four-dimensional volume form, and formula_42 is the &quot;matter term&quot;, or &quot;matter Lagrangian density&quot;.

The matter term includes the contribution of ordinary matter (e.g. gaseous matter) and also electromagnetic fields. In a vacuum region, the matter term vanishes identically; the remaining term is the &quot;gravitational term&quot;. To obtain the vacuum field equations, we must vary the gravitational term in the Lagrangian with respect to the metric formula_4; this gives the first field equation above. When we vary with respect to the scalar field formula_3, we obtain the second field equation.

Note that, unlike for the General Relativity field equations, the formula_45 term does not vanish, as the result is not a total derivative. It can be shown that

:formula_46

To prove this result, use

:formula_47

By evaluating the formula_48s in Riemann normal coordinates, 6 individual terms vanish. 6 further terms combine when manipulated using Stokes&#x27; theorem to provide the desired formula_49.

For comparison, the Lagrangian defining general relativity is

:formula_50

Varying the gravitational term with respect to formula_4 gives the vacuum Einstein field equation.

In both theories, the full field equations can be obtained by variations of the full Lagrangian.

<text>Founders&#x27; Rock is a historical site located on the corner of Hearst Avenue and Gayley Road, in Berkeley, California, U.S.. The spot, according to college lore, where the 12 trustees of the College of California, the nascent University of California, Berkeley, stood on April 16, 1860, to dedicate the property they had just purchased. This is, supposedly, the same spot where Frederick H. Billings stood in 1866 when he remembered Bishop Berkeley&#x27;s verse — &quot;Westward the course of empire takes its way&quot; — and thus inspired the name of the new city. 

A plaque was put on this spot on Charter Day in 1896, by the graduating class. It is listed as one of the National Register of Historic Places since March 25, 1982; listed as a California Historical Landmark since March 25, 1982; and a Berkeley Landmark since February 25, 1991.

<text>The Democratic Unification Party (; PUD) is a centre-left political party in Honduras. PUD was founded on 29 September 1992 by the merger of four leftist clandestine or semiclandestine political parties, in the context of the changed political situation in Central America at that period, following the end of the Cold War. The PUD was legally recognised in 1993/4 and has fought various elections since 1997, gaining around 1-3% of the vote.

==Background==
PUD was founded on 29 September 1992, by the merger of four leftist clandestine or semiclandestine political parties, namely Partido para la transformación de Honduras (PTH), Partido Revolucionario Hondureño (PRH), Partido Morazanísta de Liberación Nacional (PMLN) and Partido Renovación Patriótica (PRP). The background of the formation of PUD was the changed political situation in Central America at that period, following the end of the Cold War. Matías Funes was one of the founders of the party.

In Decree No. 189-93 of the National Congress (the Honduran parliament) of 1 October 1993, the state of Honduras legally recognised the PUD. That act was a follow-up of the Esquipulas Accords, by which the Central American governments agreed to give the revolutionary groups in the region possibilities to organize legally and participate in the political process.

Decree No. 92-94 of the National Election Tribunal of 28 January 1994, gave the PUD recognition as the fifth legally recognized political party in Honduras.

==Overview==

The colours of PUD are red and yellow. Red symbolizes the blood of the martyrs of the struggle and yellow symbolizes the new dawn of Honduras. The banner of PUD is yellow with the letter &quot;UD&quot; in red. The slogan of PUD is &quot;UD marca la differencia&quot; (&quot;UD [can be interpreted as &quot;usted&quot;, you] makes a difference&quot;).

PUD defines itself as a patriotic, democratic, popular and revolutionary party. The five pillars of PUD are Ethics, Democracy, Criticism, Proposal and Struggle.

The maximum authority of PUD is the National Assembly, which elects the &quot;Junta Directiva Nacional&quot;. In the departments of the country Department Assemblies are held, which each elects a &quot;Junta Directiva Departamental&quot;, and likewise on municipal level Municipal Assemblies are held which each elects a &quot;Junta Directa Municipal&quot;. Under the JDMs are the base units of the party, &quot;Colectivos de Base&quot;.

Within PUD there are two currents recognized by the National Election Tribunal, &quot;Pueblo Unido&quot; and &quot;Convergencia Popular&quot;.

The youth of PUD is called &quot;Juventud del Partido Unificación Democrática&quot; (JUD). JUD consists of three components, &quot;Fuerza Universitaria Revolucionaria&quot; (FUR), &quot;Federación Nacional de Estudiantes de Secundaria de Honduras&quot; (FENAESH) and a movement of &quot;Barrio&quot; youths.

==Electoral record==
In the 1997, elections the PUD&#x27;s presidential candidate was Matías Funes; he polled 23,977 votes (1.21%) in the election. The party received 41,113 votes (2.16%) in the parliamentary elections, and 34,785 votes (1.77%) in the municipal elections. In total, one congressional deputy, one member of PARLACEN (the Central American parliament), one mayor and 21 municipal councillors were elected on behalf of UD.

In the 2001 elections, PUD again put forward Funes for president; he received 24,075 votes (1.11%). In the congressional election, the PUD received 92,818 votes (4.46%), and in the municipal elections, 48,951 votes (2.26%). In total, five congressional deputies, one member of PARLACEN and 26 municipal councillors were elected on behalf of UD.

The party received an unknown number of votes in the parliamentary elections and an unknown number of votes in the municipal elections. In total five congressional deputies, an unknown number of members of PARLACEN, one mayor and an unknown number of municipal councillors were elected on behalf of UD.

The PUD was supportive of President Manuel Zelaya in the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis and the &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot; reported that he was likely to back the PUD&#x27;s presidential candidate, César Ham, in the November 2009 election.

<text>Paghman (Dari/Pashto:پغمان) is a town in the hills near Afghanistan&#x27;s capital of Kabul. It is the seat of the Paghman District (in the western part of Kabul Province) which has a population of about 120,000 (2002 official UNHCR est.), mainly Pashtuns and Tajiks. The gardens of Paghman are a major tourist attraction, and the reason for the city being known as the garden capital of Afghanistan. The neighboring town of Qargha is to the southeast, which can be reached by several roads. 

==History==
===20th century===
After King Amanullah Khan and Queen Soraya Tarzi&#x27;s return from Europe in 1928, Amanullah brought in foreign experts to redesign Kabul. At that time, at the entrance of Paghman, they created a European-style monumental gate similar to but smaller than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, which was similarly called the Taq-e Zafar ( &quot;Arch of Victory&quot;). Originally a small village at the bottom of the Hindu Kush, Paghman turned into a holiday retreat with villas and chalets as well as the summer capital. Its wide avenues contained fir, poplar and nut trees which flew past the arch, villas and a golf course. It was a popular place for the wealthy and the aristocrats to visit.

The new royal gardens were opened to the public under the proviso—as a matter of reform—that western dress was adopted there, as in the royal residential areas of nearby Kabul. On September 1, 1928, King Amanullah convoked the Loya Jirga to Paghman to the puzzlement of many delegates, who found themselves at odds with the dress-code. On September 7, 1928, the Hazrat of Shor Bazaar—an influential political figure in Kabul—presented the king with a petition signed by some 400 religious leaders opposing many of Amanullah&#x27;s reforms. This action led to the arrest of the Hazrat, the execution of some of his followers and finally the rebellion of 1929 led by Ameer Habibullah Kalakani, that overthrew the king.

The gardens eventually became a popular place for local and foreign tourists. Wealthy Kabulites owned summer homes there who employed servants and maids.

During the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, Paghman was a major battleground and suffered from bombardment from both the Soviet-backed government and the mujahideen rebels. Most buildings were destroyed and residents had fled. Little remained of the prosperous Gardens, save for the remains of the Arc de Triomphe style arch, which has had its top blown off.

===21st century===
Following the formation of the Karzai administration, the Arch was reconstructed and was completed by May 2005. Other damaged parts of the former Gardens were also rebuilt. It once again became a popular touristic site, and is popular with residents of Kabul. There was further development in the 2010s.

In 2012, 1,000 families in the Paghman district received electricity. The power was distributed to families in the Pracha village of Pashaee valley after the installation of three 1,000 kilovolt transformers. The electricity was supplied to people from the Mahipar Dam in the Surobi district at the cost of 35 million AFN (US$622,443).

In 2014, a newly built palace, the Paghman Hill Castle, was opened to the public. The palace&#x27;s surroundings also consists of thousands of newly planted trees as well as a Buzkashi field, a waterfall and other attractions. The palace&#x27;s interior is decorated with traditional handmade Afghan carpets and other traditional material. It was planned to be used for major festivals.

==Geography==

The Paghman area is greener compared to many other parts of the region, and also has fruit trees. It is located at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountain range. The Afghanodon salamander is endemic to Paghman.

The Kabul River, the only large river in the Kabul province, is fed by springs and snow-melt runoffs from Paghman. There is also a canal system, in need of repair, which extends from Paghman to Tapa.

There are several villages in the district, including Khaldari, Bektoot, Adam Khel Kala, Hatam Kala, Seeno Kala, Mullah Khel Kala, Muhabbat Khan Kala, Lachi Khel Kala, and Pajakk Tappa.

===Climate===
Paghman has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dsb&quot;). The average temperature for the year in Paghman is . The warmest month on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .
==Economy==
Agriculture, labour work, animal husbandry and employment in Kabul are the major sources of income.

==Notable natives==

<text>Ko Yong-hui (; ; 26 June 1952 – 13 August 2004), also spelled Ko Young-hee, was the mistress of North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Il and the mother of his successor, Kim Jong Un. Within North Korea, she is only referred to by titles, such as &quot;The Respected Mother who is the Most Faithful and Loyal &#x27;Subject&#x27; to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander&quot;, &quot;The Mother of Pyongyang&quot;, and &quot;The Mother of Great Songun Korea&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Ikuno Korea Town of Osaka, Japan, Ko&#x27;s birth date and Japanese name in Japanese official records are 26 June 1952 and Takada Hime (高田姫), respectively. Her father, Ko Gyon-tek, worked in an Osaka sewing factory run by Japan&#x27;s ministry of war, a 16th-generation descendant of the Joseon scholar official, Go Deuk-jong. She, along with her family, moved to North Korea in May 1961 or 1962 as part of a repatriation program. In the early 1970s, she began working as a dancer for the Mansudae Art Troupe in Pyongyang. Her younger sister Ko Yong-suk sought asylum from the U.S. embassy in Bern, Switzerland, while she was living there taking care of Kim Jong Un during his school days, according to South Korea&#x27;s National Intelligence Service; U.S. officials arranged Ko Yong-suk&#x27;s departure from the country without consulting South Korean officials.

It is thought that Ko and Kim Jong Il first met in 1972. In 1981, Ko had a son named Kim Jong-chul, her first child with Kim. It was Kim&#x27;s fourth child, after daughter Kim Hye-gyong (born 1968 to Hong Il-chon), son Kim Jong-nam (born 1971 to Song Hye-rim), and daughter Kim Sol-song (born 1974 to Kim Young-sook). Kim Jong Il&#x27;s second child with Ko, the present North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un, followed one to three years after Jong-chul. Their third child, Kim Yo Jong, a daughter, was believed to be about 23 in 2012. However, the birth year of Kim Yo Jong is also given as 1987.

On 27 August 2004, various sources reported that she had died in Paris from an unspecific illness, probably of breast cancer. However, there are other reports, stating that she was treated in Paris in the spring of 2004 and flown back to Pyongyang where she fell into a coma and died in August 2004.

==Cult of personality==
Under North Korea&#x27;s &quot;songbun&quot; ascribed status system, Ko&#x27;s Korean-Japanese heritage made her part of the lowest &quot;hostile&quot; class. Furthermore, her father worked in a sewing factory for the Imperial Japanese Army, which gave her the &quot;lowest imaginable status qualities&quot; for a North Korean.

Prior to an internal propaganda film released after the ascension of Kim Jong Un, there were three attempts made to idolize Ko, in a style similar to that associated with Kang Pan Sok, mother of Kim Il Sung, and Kim Jong Suk, the first wife of Kim Il Sung and mother of Kim Jong Il. These previous attempts at idolization failed and were stopped after Kim Jong Il&#x27;s 2008 stroke.

The building of a cult of personality around Ko encounters the problem of her bad &quot;songbun&quot; due to her Japanese mother, even though it is usually passed on by the father. Making her identity public would have undermined the Kim family&#x27;s pure bloodline, and after Kim Jong Il&#x27;s death, her personal information, including her name, became state secrets. Ko&#x27;s real name and other personal details have not been publicly revealed in North Korea, and she is referred to as &quot;Mother of Great Songun Korea&quot; or &quot;Great Mother&quot;.

In 2012, Kim Jong Un built a grave for Ko on Mount Taesong.

<text>The Dassault nEUROn is an experimental unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) being developed with international cooperation, led by the French company Dassault Aviation. Countries involved in this project include France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The design goal is to create a stealthy, autonomous UAV that can function in medium-to-high threat combat zones. 

The industrial goal is to give European firms experience designing and building high-end UAVs and associated technologies, in order to keep them competitive in the global marketplace. The first flight took place on December 1, 2012.

==Description==
This flying wing stealth UCAV project is the final phase of the French Dassault LOGIDUC 3-step stealth &quot;combat drone&quot; programme. Until June 2005 it had the form of the original Dassault developed Grand Duc vehicle: supersonic two-engined long-range unmanned bomber, capable of performing attacks with nuclear weapons.

Under pressure of the international cooperation, especially from Sweden and Saab, it was transformed into a demonstrator of smaller single-engine technology. Thus it is now optimised for the testing of various technologies for the future UAVs and UCAVs, and will not enter serial production. It will, however, clear the way for a commercial product, which will use the technologies developed thanks to the nEUROn program. The full-scale replica of the current configuration was unveiled at the Paris Air Show 2005.

The nEUROn development, originally planned by Dassault as &quot;AVE Grand Duc&quot;, evolved into a European cooperation including Swedish Saab AB, Greek EAB, Swiss RUAG Aerospace, Spanish EADS CASA and Italian Alenia (today Leonardo-Finmeccanica&#x27;s Aircraft Division), with Dassault as the lead contractor. As a &quot;technology demonstrator&quot;, only one vehicle will be produced to explore new operational concepts for a future generation of autonomous stealth fighter aircraft that will be produced beyond 2020. This is advocated by the statement that the industrial partners want to invest more in technology development, rather than manufacturing of the flying hardware and weapons, despite the risk of the loss of the single prototype.

However Dassault plans to primarily use the data collected by the demonstrator to produce derived UCAVs. The French maker states the nEUROn&#x27;s Adour engine (adapted from the version used in the SEPECAT Jaguar) will be replaced in the production version by a more powerful, specific, engine based on Snecma&#x27;s M88 from the Dassault Rafale.

According to the DGA, nEUROn test flights were planned in France, Sweden and Italy in early 2010, but were delayed. Its first flight was at the end of 2012. While nEUROn was on display at the Paris Air Show 2013, it did not fly due to reluctance by European civil aviation authorities to allow UAVs to fly out of closed airspace.

==Program goals==
The program has three stated goals:
# To maintain and develop the skills of the participating European aerospace companies&#x27; design offices, which will not see any other new fighter programs before 2030 now that the Rafale, Eurofighter and Gripen projects are all complete or well underway.
# To investigate and validate technologies that will be needed by 2015 to design next-generation combat aircraft.
# To validate an innovative cooperation process by establishing a European industry team responsible for developing next-generation combat aircraft.

==Platform==
As a UCAV, nEUROn will be significantly larger and more advanced than other well-known UAV systems like the MQ-1 Predator, with ranges, payloads and capabilities that approach those of manned fighter aircraft. Although the project is not yet closely defined, illustrations and statements by the consortium partners indicate that the nEUROn is envisioned as a competitive system with the American J-UCAS program&#x27;s Boeing X-45C or Northrop-Grumman X-47B.

Indeed, Saab&#x27;s February 9, 2006 release notes that nEUROn will be a demonstrator measuring 10 m long by 12 m wide and weighing in at 5 tons. This is roughly the size of a Mirage 2000 fighter rotated 90 degrees (as the nEUROn is wider than it is long). The aircraft will have unmanned autonomous air-to-ground attack capabilities with precision guided munitions, relying on an advanced stealth airframe design to penetrate undetected. Another feature being contemplated is the ability to control squad flight in automatic mode from an advanced fighter like the Rafale or JAS 39 Gripen platform, grouping the nEUROns and controlling the group in a manner similar to many combat real-time strategy computer games.

==Project history==
In 1999, Dassault Aviation launched its LOGIDUC stealth UCAV program, which gave birth to the Dassault AVE-D Petit Duc that flew in July 2000 as the first stealth UAV in Europe, and to the Dassault AVE-C Moyen Duc (2001). Dassault changed the third phase name &quot;Grand Duc&quot; – a full-scale advanced version of the Moyen Duc – to the more European sounding nEUROn, as the French project was joined by European partners to reduce its development cost. Great Britain didn&#x27;t join because it was already involved with an American similar program, neither Germany who desisted officially because the country was unable to afford the financial participation.

During the 2003 Paris Air Show, French Minister of Defence Mme Michèle Alliot-Marie announced a major agreement signed between the French groups EADS France, Dassault Aviation and Thales. The agreement covered a joint-venture to &quot;realise a new unmanned military technology that covers all future activity in combat and strategic reconnaissance aeronautics&quot; &quot;i.e.&quot; LOGIDUC&#x27;s phase three, &quot;Grand Duc&quot;.

EADS leads a HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV project.

Meanwhile, the French defence procurement agency, DGA, acting as the program executive on behalf of the participating countries, has entrusted development of the first nEUROn UCAV demonstrator to Dassault Aviation and its European partners. Sub-contracts have been made with the French industrial firms Thales and EADS France and also with five European firms, Saab (Sweden), EAB (Greece), Alenia (Italy), RUAG Aerospace (Switzerland) and EADS CASA (Spain).

Chief project manager Thierry Prunier comes from Dassault Aviation, and the deputy project managers are Mats Ohlson of Saab and Ermanno Bertolina of Alenia. There is a single link between the executive agency (DGA) and the prime contractor (Dassault), and it will be up to the executive agency to coordinate with the government agencies of the participating countries. It will be up to the prime contractor, meanwhile, to coordinate the work with the other industries.

After Spain joined the programme in early February 2006 (Belgium could join later), work breakdown among the European industrial partners was planned as follows:
* Dassault Aviation
:Lead builder
:Overall architectures &amp; design
:Flight control system
:Final assembly
:Global testing (static &amp; flight)
Dassault claims 50% of development and is responsible for the standalone LOGIDUC programme. The nEUROn (2010) will be the third Dassault stealth UAV prototype following the AVE-D Petit Duc (2000) &amp; AVE-C Moyen Duc (2004). The nEUROn project replaces the LOGIDUC final phase AVE Grand Duc.
* Alenia Aeronautica, today Leonardo-Finmeccanica&#x27;s Aircraft Division: (joined in mid-2005)
:Weapon firing system
:Smart Integrated Weapon Bay
:Air data system
:Electrical system
:Flight testing
Thanks to the technologies developed for the UAV prototype Sky-x (2003) Alenia Aeronautica was the first industrial partner and claims a 25% share of the entire programme.
* Saab AB: (joined on December 22, 2005)
:Overall design
:Equipped fuselage
:Avionics
:Fuel system
:Flight testing
Saab claims 25% of development and is also the coordinator for the other Swedish corporations involved.
* EADS CASA: (joined on February 7, 2006)
:Wing
:Ground control station
:Data-link integration
* Hellenic Aerospace Industry: (joined on January 11, 2006)
:Rear fuselage
:Tail pipe
:Integration bench
:Engine
:Air to Air Missile
:Communication System
* RUAG: (joined in mid-2005)
:Wind tunnel tests
:Weapons carriage
* Thales: (joined on June 14, 2005)
:Data-link (STANAG 7085 compliant)
:Command interface
* EADS France: (joined in June 2003)
:Undisclosed

===Flight testing===
The nEUROn made its first flight on December 1, 2012, in France. Flight trials in France to open its flight envelope and evaluate its stealth characteristics were successfully completed in March 2015. These tests were followed by sensor evaluation trials in Italy, which were completed on August 25, 2015. The last leg of flight trials take place in Sweden and will include live fire trials.

In July 2016 extensive stealth and detection tests were conducted with the nEUROn and the Charles de Gaulle carrier group. The nEUROn was to penetrate the aircraft carrier defensive area to test its stealth and the capacity of the carrier group to detect it.

At the end of 2016 and in early 2017, the furtivity performance test have been undertaken, with more than 130 flights. Since 2019, the nEUROn has carried out test flights at the Istres Air Base, to increase the operational use scenarios and confrontation campaigns regarding threats.

==Funding==
The contract is valued at €405 million, and allows industry to begin a three-year system definition and design phase with related low-observability studies. This phase will be followed by the development and assembly phase, and by a first flight in 2011. It is planned that the 2-year flight-test program (2010–2012) will entail about 100 sorties, including the launch of a laser-guided bomb tentatively scheduled for 2012. The initial €400 million budget was increased by €5 million in 2006 due to the addition of a modular bomb bay including a designator and a laser-guided bomb.

In February 2006, DGA had announced that France will provide €202.5 million, half of the program&#x27;s €405 million ($480 million) budget, while the remaining funds will be supplied by the other participating member nations. In December 2005, the Swedish defence ministry reported the national share would be €75 million, of which €66 million would be financed by Saab AB. The cost of Spain&#x27;s participation to the program is estimated at €35.5 million, spread over the 2007–2012 period.

Derived production UCAV unit cost is estimated by Dassault to be €25 million.

The French Ministry of Armed Forces will invest 128 million euros in 2024 to develop an unmanned combat aerial vehicle, based on the Neuron demonstrator.

==Potential French-British follow-on==
In November 2014, a two-year feasibility study was announced by the French and British governments. This could lead to a program combining the experience of the BAE Systems Taranis and nEUROn programs into a Future Combat Air System.

<text>Smile.dk (sometimes written SMiLE.dk or Smile-dk, pronounced &quot;Smile D-K&quot;) or Smile is a Swedish Eurodance group with Veronica Almqvist as the only current member. The band is known for several songs featured in music video games, such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. They have regularly appeared on &quot;Dancemania&quot; since its tenth issue. Smile.dk has been one of the most featured acts in the &quot;Dancemania&quot; series, along with the likes of Captain Jack and E-Rotic.

==History==
Veronica Almqvist and Nina Boquist first formed as Smile, and released their first album &quot;Smile&quot; in 1998. All songs were written and produced by Robert Uhlmann and Robin Rex. The first single from the album, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, was licensed by Konami and featured in the first release of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, a popular dance video game. The second single from the album, &quot;Boys&quot;, pays homage to Sabrina Salerno&#x27;s hit &quot;Boys (Summertime Love)&quot;. The album was later re-released with new artwork and bonus tracks in Japan, where it was certified gold for 100,000 copies shipped to stores.

After the release of &quot;Smile&quot;, Boquist left the band to start a solo career and was replaced by Malin Kernby. During this time, the band name was changed from Smile to Smile.dk, as they were being marketed in Denmark. They released two studio albums under this line-up, &quot;Future Girls&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Golden Sky&quot; in 2002.

In 2005, according to their manager, Smile.dk had begun a hiatus due to both Almqvist and Kernby getting married; Kernby with a child on the way. However, he did not believe that Smile.dk would become defunct, which proved correct with their return, albeit without Kernby.

===Return, line-up changes and &quot;Party Around the World&quot;===

In early 2008, Smile.dk&#x27;s producers Jamie Thompson (J-Mi/DJ Slash/MC Jay) and Dick Örnå (Mr. Dee) announced at the BubblegumDancer.com Forums that Smile.dk would be returning in 2008 with a worldwide single, &quot;Doki Doki&quot;, and an album, &quot;Party Around the World&quot;. It was also announced that Kernby would be leaving the group, and Hanna Stockzell later joined. Then-new singer Stockzell performed in all of the songs on &quot;Party Around the World&quot;, except for &quot;Doki Doki&quot;, which featured only Almqvist and Kernby, despite Kernby no longer being an active member.

Smile.dk (with Almqvist and Stockzell) performed live at San Japan, an anime convention located in San Antonio, Texas, on 9 August 2008, their first performance in North America. They also performed live at Sakura-Con 2009 in Seattle, Washington on 10–12 April 2009.

===Line-up changes, &quot;Moshi Moshi&quot; and pregnancy===
In April 2010, it was announced that Stockzell would be leaving Smile.dk for personal reasons and to start a solo career under her real name Hanna Stockzell. It was also announced that Cecilia Reiskog would be joining as a member.

On 20 December 2011, they released their first single with the new line-up called &quot;Moshi Moshi&quot;, which was delayed in some countries until May 2012 due to issues with its release. An animated music video for &quot;Moshi Moshi&quot; was uploaded to Smile.dk&#x27;s official YouTube channel in early 2012. Later in 2012, they also confirmed that a song titled &quot;Baby Boom&quot; was being recorded, due to both Almqvist and Reiskog getting pregnant around the same time frame. While work for Smile.dk&#x27;s new album continued, Smile.dk&#x27;s progress slowed down so Almqvist and Reiskog could focus on their personal lives.

===Reiskog&#x27;s departure and Chinese tour===
On 6 October 2013, Cecilia Reiskog announced on Smile.dk&#x27;s official Facebook page that she would be leaving Smile.dk to focus on her personal life. Almqvist later confirmed that she had decided to continue Smile.dk by herself and would not be adding a new member.

In 2014, Almqvist confirmed that the group&#x27;s next album was almost finished and that any songs featuring Reiskog would not be re-recorded and would be released as they are, making &quot;The Make-Up Collection&quot; Reiskog&#x27;s first and only album with Smile.dk. She also confirmed on 10 March on the official Smile.dk fanpage that she was recording a different version of &quot;Dragonfly&quot; for the album.

As of 2015, Almqvist has confirmed that &quot;The Make-Up Collection&quot; is almost ready for release and that she would announce the release date when it is ready.

On 14 August 2015, Almqvist announced that Smile.dk would be going on tour in China from 30 October to 8 November. Later, on 25 October, she announced on Smile.dk&#x27;s Facebook page that the &quot;Forever&quot; album would be released in early 2016. The Chinese tour was also moved to early 2016 to coincide with the album release.

On 26 November 2015, the single &quot;Our Little Corner&quot; was released worldwide on major digital music stores.

On 9 May 2016, J-Mi and former Smile.dk member Hannah Stockzell confirmed that their team had collaborated with Smile.dk for a remix EP release called &quot;Koko Soko 2016&quot;, due for release on 25 May.

On 28 September 2016, Almqvist posted 16 samples of tracks from the album &quot;Forever&quot; on Smile.dk&#x27;s SoundCloud at smiledkmusic. The album contains eight new songs, five remakes and three remixes chosen as winners from the 2015 remix contest.

<doc id="944464" wikidata="Q7147763" url="?curid=944464" title="Hurricane Inez">
<text>Hurricane Inez was a powerful Category 5 major hurricane that affected the Caribbean, Bahamas, Florida, and Mexico, killing over 1,000 people in 1966. It was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas. It originated from a tropical wave over Africa, and became a tropical depression by September 21. It moved slowly westward, initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Inez on September 24. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French overseas region of Guadeloupe on September 27. Inez severely damaged the island&#x27;s banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000 people homeless. Damage on Guadeloupe was estimated at $50 million, and there were 40 deaths. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before restrengthening, attaining peak sustained winds of on September 28, eventually making landfall at that intensity in the Dominican Republic. That day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of , which was the highest recorded at the time.

Continuing westward, Inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800 houses. Nationwide, there were about 100 deaths and $12 million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000 people were killed, and 60,000 people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35 million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September 30. In the country, 125,000 people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20 million in damage.

The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5 million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160 homes and 190 trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5 million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45 people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11 people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000 people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500 houses. Damage was estimated at $154 million, and there were 74 deaths in Mexico.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the Sahara in central Africa on September 15 from the monsoon. It moved westward in the prevailing winds, exiting the west coast of Africa on September 18. The precursor to Inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave, which was considered a tropical depression by September 18 in the annual tropical cyclone summary. Tracked by satellites, the system moved to the west-southwest, and was officially classified a tropical depression on September 21 about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. The system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest. A Hurricane Hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Inez, located about east of Martinique. With warm water temperatures, the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center. Inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified, reaching hurricane status on September 26.

On September 27, Inez strengthened to reach winds of , making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Later that day, it moved directly over the island of Guadeloupe. At the time, Inez was a small cyclone, with hurricane-force winds extending from the center; meteorologists labeled it as a &quot;micro-hurricane... because of its characteristic small, tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind.&quot; Its structure became disrupted by the island, and the central pressure rose from , indicative of weakening. However, Inez re-intensified after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, reaching a minimum pressure of south of Puerto Rico on September 28. The Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of at a height of , the strongest winds recorded for the storm. The same flight estimated surface winds between near the center. The peak intensity listed in the HURDAT, the Atlantic hurricane database, is , making Inez a Category 5 hurricane. In 2017, a preliminary re-analysis conducted as part of the ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project raised Inez&#x27;s peak intensity from its original . This re-analysis has been officially accepted and included in HURDAT.
While near peak intensity, Inez was located about southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the eye was tracked by radar from the island. Its increasing outflow caused Tropical Storm Judith to the east over the central Atlantic to dissipate. On September 29, the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the Barahona Peninsula, and quickly weakened over land. It briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of Haiti near Jacmel. The eye emerged into the Windward Passage near Léogâne, although severely weakened. The pressure rose to , and the winds decreased to over land. However, Inez quickly re-intensified over water, reaching winds of on September 30 before striking southeastern Cuba near Guantánamo Bay. When Inez was over Cuba, forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm&#x27;s future; it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the United States due to a weakness in the ridge to the north. The hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents, weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of Cuba. While over water, the eye reorganized, and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity. Inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central Cuba and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October 2.
Shortly after exiting Cuba into the Atlantic, Inez weakened into a tropical storm, and was moving northeastward through the Bahamas about 24 hours later than forecast. At the time, the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the Bermuda high. With little outflow and a large, diffuse circulation, Inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions, potentially due to a nearby trough. The movement slowed, and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that &quot;Inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the United States mainland than any other storm.&quot; On October 3, Inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western Gulf of Mexico. Over the subsequent few days, the eye moved directly over the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West and continued through the Gulf of Mexico while slowly intensifying. On October 7, Inez brushed the northern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula with hurricane-force winds. By then, the ridge had begun to weaken, allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward. On October 8, Inez attained a secondary peak intensity of , with a pressure of . Briefly threatening the coastline of Texas, Inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened. On October 10, the hurricane made its final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. It weakened rapidly over the region&#x27;s high terrain, dissipating on October 11.

The unusual track of Inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the Lesser and Greater Antilles, Bahamas, Florida, and Mexico. The Associated Press described Inez as the &quot;first to strike the Yucatán Peninsula in many years.&quot; It was also the first to move across the Gulf of Mexico without turning to the north so late in the season, and the 65 advisories issued by the NHC was the highest number at the time. The path taken by Inez was compared to Hurricane Betsy in 1965, which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge. Forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path, as well as the inability to fly the Hurricane Hunters into Inez while it was over Cuba.

==Preparations==
In Guadeloupe, which was the first area the hurricane affected, residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters. Pan American World Airways canceled flights to the region. When Inez was near peak intensity, the NHC warned residents in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic of the danger posed by the hurricane. The agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track. In general, hurricane warnings were issued 24 hours in advance, with the exception of southeastern Florida due to the hurricane&#x27;s slowing track. Overall, 250,000 people evacuated along the path of Inez. At Guantánamo Bay, officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters. Large ships at the port there were moved to Jamaica before the storm struck. Throughout eastern Cuba, Premier Fidel Castro ordered about 125,000 people to evacuate in low-lying areas, mostly in Oriente Province. United States Air Force tracking stations in the Bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations. Residents in the Florida Keys boarded up windows and store fronts, and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in Key West. In southeastern Florida, government offices and schools closed.

Along the Yucatán peninsula, about 15,000 people were evacuated from the coastal city of Progreso, in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about south-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, in otherwise calm conditions; 11 people died, including the pilot. When Inez was approaching its final landfall, the United States Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Brownsville to Port Isabel, Texas, with gale warnings northward to Corpus Christi. At least 2,000 people evacuated from Port Isabel alone, and many shrimp boats were secured. In the Tampico area where Inez made its final landfall, over 31,000 people evacuated to higher grounds.

==Impact==

Overall, Hurricane Inez killed about 1,000 people, mostly on Hispaniola, and caused over $200 million in damage. Crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude, due to Inez&#x27;s small size and its occurrence late in the season.

===Caribbean and Bahamas===
When Inez struck Guadeloupe, a station on the island reported sustained winds of , with gusts to , before communications failed. Rain on the island reached . The high winds destroyed the roofs of thousands of houses, leaving 10,000 people homeless. There was heavy damage to both the banana and sugar crops, described as &quot;flattened&quot; by the St. Petersburg Times. The storm flooded a power plant in Pointe-à-Pitre and downed many power lines, causing power outages. The Associated Press described the hurricane as having &quot;virtually leveled a whole district of Pointe-à-Pitre&quot;. Hundreds of people were injured, although because of damaged hospitals and the power outage, most only received makeshift treatment. Inez left 40 people dead and $50 million in damage on the island. Strong winds also affected nearby Antigua, and damage was reported from that island to Dominica.

In the United States Virgin Islands, a station on St. Croix reported gusts. When Inez passed south of Puerto Rico, its rainbands produced gusty winds along the island&#x27;s southern coast, reaching in Peñuelas. On Isla de Mona, wind gusts were estimated at . Flooding occurred in southern Puerto Rico, and high winds damaged 20 houses.

Hurricane Inez struck the Dominican Republic near peak intensity. Along the Barahona Peninsula, more than 800 homes were destroyed, and nationwide about 5,000 people were left homeless. There was heavy damage to the country&#x27;s cotton industry, as well as the coffee, sugar cane, and cocoa crops along the Barahona Peninsula. In the capital city of Santo Domingo, heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the Ozama River, forcing thousands to evacuate. High seas there damaged a portion of a seawall. Many rivers along the Barahona Peninsula were also flooded. Throughout the country, Inez killed about 100 people, including 55 in Juancho, and left $12 million in damage.

In neighboring Haiti, high winds downed power lines and radio towers, which cut outside communication. High rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges, in a location nicknamed the &quot;valley of death&quot;; there, the Weather Bureau remarked that &quot;local winds... may well have exceeded &quot;. Thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof. The Haitian government reported over 1,000 deaths in the weeks after the storm. The United States government reported that the hurricane &quot;killed no more than 50&quot; in Haiti, and &quot;nor was there a real emergency,&quot; due to president François Duvalier misusing previous aid. The U.S. assessment was incorrect, as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone summary in the Monthly Weather Review indicated 750 deaths in Haiti, mostly in Jacmel. President Duvalier considered the hurricane the &quot;worst storm... since the 1920s.&quot; In the country, 1,000 people were injured and 60,000 were left homeless, and damage was estimated at $20.35 million. Throughout Hispaniola, about 1,500 people were seriously injured, and many people were still recovering from Hurricane Flora in 1963.

A station at Guantánamo Bay reported winds of when Inez moved ashore in Cuba, and rainfall reached . Tides were above normal there. The hurricane knocked down trees and power lines, and many roofs were damaged on the naval base. In the city of Guantánamo, the hurricane destroyed 500 houses. High winds heavily damaged the country&#x27;s sugar and coffee crops. When Inez re-entered the Gulf of Mexico, it threatened northwestern Cuba and produced of rainfall. High waves and strong winds affected the coastline. In La Habana Province, flooding forced 21,000 people to evacuate, mostly in low-lying areas. One building was destroyed in Havana. Nationwide, Inez injured at least 38 people, and caused five deaths, three of which occurred after Inez moved southwestward from the Florida Keys. Damage totaled $20 million.

In the Bahamas, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall over three days, reaching in Nassau. There, Inez spawned a small tornado that produced winds of over , killing one person and injuring three. High tides flooded portions of Nassau. Two waterspouts were reported in Freeport. Wind gusts in the archipelago reached at West End, Grand Bahama, and sustained winds reached in Freeport. Five people died throughout the country, and damage was estimated at $15.5 million.

===United States===

In the Straits of Florida, high waves from Inez overturned a blockade runner carrying Cuban exiles to Miami. Ten of the passengers escaped on a damaged raft, but the only survivor was the captain; 45 people died due to the boat capsizing. High waves also disabled three ships and beached a Coast Guard boat near Miami; a lifeguard and people on the beach assisted in rescuing the crew of nine Coast Guardsmen amid rough seas.

When the hurricane moved across the Florida Keys, it dropped light rainfall, reaching near Kendall. Inez was considered a &quot;dry hurricane&quot;, and about of the precipitation that fell was largely in the form of sea water spray. Light rainfall occurred in Miami, where strong winds damaged crops due to salt spray onto local vegetation. During its passage, Inez produced above normal tides, reaching above normal on Big Pine Key. Inez produced strong winds while it was intensifying, and the strongest winds occurred after the passage of the eye. The highest sustained winds were on Plantation Key, and peak gusts were in the Dry Tortugas. On Big Pine Key, sustained winds were estimated at , with gusts to . On the Florida mainland, the highest gusts were at Flamingo. The winds damaged smaller tree limbs and uprooted some trees. About 20% of the local avocado crop was blown off trees, although most was salvageable. Winds and salt spray severely damaged vegetables in southern Dade County, including up to 80% losses of tomatoes in some farms. Power outages were reported in Key West. In the Florida Keys, the hurricane damaged 160 homes and 190 trailers. Statewide, damage totaled $5 million, and there were four deaths; three were elderly people who died of heart attacks while installing shutters, and the fourth was a teenager who was swept by large surf. Inez was the last hurricane to threaten the Miami metropolitan area until Hurricane David in 1979, and the last hurricane to strike the Florida Keys until Hurricane Kate in 1985.

When Inez was making its final landfall in Mexico, its outer circulation reached southern Texas, producing winds of and trace rainfall. Tides reached above normal in Corpus Christi, and waves caused $5,000 in damage to piers.

===Mexico===
While the hurricane was off the north coast of the Yucatán peninsula, Inez produced sustained winds of , with gusts to , in Mérida. The winds cut power and knocked down trees in Progreso, as well as nearby cities. High waves destroyed a dock in Telchac Puerto. Heavy rainfall flooded streets in Mérida, although damage was not severe. Agriculture damage along the Yucatán reached US$50 million.

At the hurricane&#x27;s final landfall, a station in Tampico reported sustained winds of , with gusts to before communications were cut. Inez dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore, causing flooding. In Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, rainfall totaled . In northeastern Mexico, more than 3,000 people were stranded by flooding after dozens of rivers and streams rose above their banks, forcing some families to hold onto trees. The floods washed out roads around Tampico and cut communications and the water supply. In Tamaulipas, 15 people died while trying to deliver supplies to residents along the Tamesi River. Throughout the country, the hurricane left about 84,000 people homeless, and destroyed at least 2,500 houses. Agricultural damage totaled over $80 million, and property damage was estimated at $24 million in Tampico and Ciudad Madero alone. Overall, Inez killed 74 people in Mexico.

==Aftermath==

In the days after the storm struck Guadeloupe, there was a food shortage. Officials quickly cleared roads and worked to restore the damaged banana crop. Charles de Gaulle visited the island, and the French population unified to provide assistance to the island. In late October 1966, the French government set up a relief fund for Guadeloupe totaling $34 million (₣170 million francs). The government initiated plans to rebuild the island to withstand the winds of strong hurricanes. The United States Agency for International Development flew 20,000 pounds of blankets and clothing to the island. Due to the heavy damage in Hispaniola, VMM-365, a United States Marine Corps helicopter division, spent 454 hours and flew 740 sorties to provide 186,676 tons of relief supplies to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The division also helped evacuate 142 hospital patients. The Dominican Air Force also assisted in transporting injured people from outlying areas to Santo Domingo. The country deployed 5,000 troops to send food, medicine, and clothing to the storm-damaged areas in the interior, as well as Barahona Peninsula. The Holy See sent $2,000 to assist the residents affected by the storm in Haiti. After a nearly ten year boycott due to the actions of Haitian president François Duvalier, the United States provided a $1.3 million loan to the country to help rebuild infrastructure and provide education. Industrialist Clint Murchison gave $50,000 in flour and food from a mill he owned in the country. The United States also sent vaccines and 4,360 pounds of food.

In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) spent about 1,700 hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole survivor of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was held responsible for the 44 boat deaths and was quickly executed by the Cuban government. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez&#x27;s crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country&#x27;s military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.

As a result of the storm&#x27;s disastrous effects, the name &quot;Inez&quot; was retired, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with &quot;Isabel&quot; for the 1970 season.

<doc id="944465" wikidata="Q6888327" url="?curid=944465" title="Model figure">
<text>A model figure is a scale model representing a human, monster or other creature. Human figures may be either a generic figure of a type (such as &quot;World War II Luftwaffe pilot&quot;), a historical personage (such as &quot;King Henry VIII&quot;), or a fictional character (such as &quot;Conan&quot;).

Model figures are sold both as kits for enthusiast to construct and paint and as pre-built, pre-painted collectable figurines. Model kits may be made in plastic (usually polystyrene), polyurethane resin, or metal (including white metal); collectables are usually made of plastic, porcelain, or (rarely) bronze.

There are larger size (12-inch or 30 cm tall) that have been produced for recent movie characters (Princess Leia from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, for example). Large plastic military figures are made by some model soldier manufacturers as a sideline.

== Military models ==
Enthusiasts may pursue figure modeling in its own right or as an adjunct to military modeling.

There is also overlap with miniature figures (minis) used in wargames and role-playing games: minis are usually less than 54 mm scale, and do not necessarily represent any given personage.

Back in the early &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s military modeling figures were largely produced in 1:72 and 1:35 scales with other scales such as 1:48 and 1:32 holding a smaller market share. Typically 1:48 scale was reserved for aircraft and aircraft support vehicles with figures being maintenance and flight crews while 1:32 scale miniatures were composed largely of vehicles such as tanks and their crews.

1:35 scale miniatures were produced by many companies such as Tamiya, Testor&#x27;s, Revell, Monogram and others. Kits of soldiers, vehicles and combinations covered World War I through Vietnam with the largest portion centering on World War II. 1/72 scale miniatures covered a much wider and diverse range of time periods with Atlantic offering figures of Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Cowboys, American Indians and many more. Other company&#x27;s such as Airfix supplied not only high-quality figures in 1:72 scale but also fine planes and military vehicles and still do so today. One of the largest distinctions between 1:72 scale and 1:35 scale aside from the obvious size was the amount of ready-to-paint dioramas and sets available to small-scale modelers. Airfix, a leader in the small-scale model market offered several kits for modelers from pontoon bridges, the Atlantic wall, Waterloo, and many others. These kits came with everything a hobbyist would need to portray a given moment from buildings and trees to vehicles and men. None of these were available to the larger scale modeler.

Tamiya, a higher-end supplier of military vehicle and soldier kits, has, in the past few years, taken 1:48 scale modeling a step further offering an interesting line of German and American World War II figures and vehicles making it possible to incorporate tanks, jeeps, and foot soldiers into dioramas with aircraft, something which was only possible in 1:72 scale for quite a long time. For the serious military modeler this opens a new realm of possibilities in diorama making.

The same growth in availability is true for 1:32 scale as well. For quite a while 1:32 scale figures were more or less better versions of the army men children play with. Kits came as single-cast figures molded as a unit instead of the ready-to-assemble versions found at 1:48 and 1:35 scale where arms, helmets and gear must be cut from plastic sprues and glued together. 1:32 scale soldiers were often slightly lower quality than their 1:35 scale counterparts as they were molded from a softer plastic allowing things like rifle barrels to bend while the soldiers sat in the boxes. 1:32 scale kits were limited and this made extensive modeling difficult. Lately, 1:32 scale modeling has made a large push to expand as companies now sell these figures professionally pre-painted making them exceptional for large-scale military gaming of all sorts. In fact, the diorama industry has started supplying pre-painted diorama scenery as well making high-quality 1:32 scale diorama making much easier than ever before.

Figure model kits can be as large as 1:16 scale. These kits include motorized vehicles and stand alone figures. Kits of this size take a great deal of effort and time to paint as lengths must be taken to get the details of the paint job precise whereas with smaller kits, while details is still essential, there is less to be done.

Many model figures used for gaming are measured in millimeters ranging from 15 to 80 mm with miniature wargaming figures running on the smaller end especially where armored vehicles are used. Traditional modelers tend to stick to the more common 1:72-1:32 scales leaving the other sizes to the gamers.

As with all things, quality and price vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and the result of a model is often limited by its initial quality. Today many new model manufacturers take great lengths to make 1:72, 1:48, 1:35 and 1:32 scale models as highly detailed and realistic as possible. This, unfortunately, makes many of the older, still existing sets, less desirable for diorama making but still fun to build, especially as starter kits for a less experienced modeller. Many of these older kits can still be found online at a reasonable price and while they don&#x27;t offer as many pieces or as highly detailed molding, they can still produce a respectable product after paint and proper weathering is administered.

Model aircraft and vehicle kits in even smaller scales will also often include &quot;model figures,&quot; or can be purchased as accessories. There are also kits of the drivers and servicers of cars, and the series of figurines that stand in the streets and platforms of model railroads.

== Japanese figures ==
Model figures based on icons like Hello Kitty, as well as characters appearing in anime, manga, kaiju (monster) series, science fiction/fantasy films and video games, is a major part of otaku fandom. It&#x27;s also a large part of the global animation merchandising market from Japan which is estimated to be worth around 663 billions Japanese yen. Some hobbyists concentrate specifically on a certain type of figure, such as garage kits, gashapon (capsule toys), or PVC bishōjo (pretty girl) statues. Such figures prominently featured in work of modern artist Takashi Murakami. Through his company Kaikai Kiki, he has produced a number of limited designer toys to be sold in otaku oriented stores.

While many different companies manufacture and sell anime figures, prices for the same figure have large differences depending on the authenticity and quality of the figure. Authentic figures are normally figures of characters that are licensed by the creators, thus leading to significantly higher prices. Some of the most well known manufacturers for their consistency and quality are such as Good Smile Company, Aniplex, Hot Toys, Bandai and others. Figures are usually classified as prize figures, scale figures and others, with prize figures being lower cost options often used in Claw crane games, while scale figures can cost several hundreds to thousands USD.

===Noodle stopper===
A noodle stopper is a type of figurine based on manga, anime, or even video game characters which is ostensibly meant to secure by gravity the lid for ramen containers such that they do not boil over. Due to their ornate designs, they are often displayed as ordinary figurines. (&quot;Stopper&quot; is a misnomer, as they are not inserted into the container.)

== Garage kits ==
Garage kit figures are produced by both amateurs and professionals, and usually cast out of polyurethane resin. In Japan they often portray anime characters and in the US they are often movie monsters. Garage kits are usually produced in limited numbers and are more expensive than typical injection molded plastic figures and kits.

==US history==
In the 50s and 60s plastic model kits such as cars, planes or space ships became common in the US. There were also cheap plastic models for the popular market of movie monsters, comic book heroes, and movie and television characters in 1:8 size (about 9 inches or 23 cm in height). These included monsters like Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. One of the largest producers of monster figures were the Aurora Plastics Corporation, who produced many thousands figures from each mould. This market disappeared and no firm since has produced anything to match their quantities. Instead smaller (3¾-inch or 10 cm) action figures of have taken over the popular market.

In the 1970s, Aurora&#x27;s figure molds had been sold to Monogram and by the mid-to late 1970s, the models had been discontinued and were difficult to find in hobby stores.

In the mid-1980s some who were kids in the 1950s and 60s resumed their interest in the old Aurora monster models. An underground market developed through which enthusiasts could acquire the original plastic model kits. While the prices in the 50s and 60s had been only a few dollars, now the kits were selling for as much as $125 for some of the rarer monster models.

In the early to mid-1980s, hobbyists began creating their own garage kits of movie monsters, often without permission from copyright holders. They were usually produced in limited numbers and sold primarily by mail order and at toy and hobby conventions.

In the mid- to late 1980s, two model kit companies moved the monster model kit hobby toward the mainstream. Horizon Models in California and Screamin&#x27; Models in New York began licensing vinyl model kits of movie monsters. Horizon focused primarily on classic horror film characters (like Bride of Frankenstein, Invisible Man, The Phantom of the Opera) and comic book characters (like Captain America and Iron Man). Screamin&#x27; focused primarily on characters from more contemporary slasher movies like &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and franchises like &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;. Hobby stores began to carry these products in limited supply.

By the 1990s model kits were produced in the US, UK as well as Japan and distributed through hobby and comic stores. Large hobby companies like AMT-Ertl and Revell/Monogram (the same Monogram that bought the Aurora monster molds) began marketing vinyl model kits of movie monsters, the classic Star Trek characters, and characters from one of the Batman films. There was an unprecedented variety of licensed models figure kits.

In the late 1990s model kit sales went down. Hobby and comic stores and their distributors began carrying fewer garage kits or closed down. Producers like Horizon and Screamin&#x27; shut their doors.

As of 2009, there are two American garage kit magazines, &quot;Kitbuilders Magazine&quot; and &quot;Amazing Figure Modeler&quot;, and there are garage kit conventions held each year, like WonderFest USA in Louisville, Kentucky.

== Model figure collecting ==
Model figure collectors, like most hobby collectors, usually have a specific criterion for what they collect, such as Civil-War soldiers, or Warhammer gaming figures.

Specifically with an eye to collectors, manufacturers of collectable model figures make &quot;chase figures&quot;. This is a model figure that is released in limited amounts relative to the rest of an assortment, often something like &quot;one chase figure for every two cases of regular product&quot; or similar. This is comparable to the chase cards in the collectible card game industry. The name comes from the assumption that collectors, in their need to &quot;collect them all&quot; will put in more effort than usual to &quot;chase&quot; down these figures.

Generally speaking, chase figures are rare in toy lines aimed at youth markets, although there are occasionally &quot;shortpacked&quot; figures (shipped in lower numbers than other figures in its release cycle). Chase figures are more common in collector-oriented lines like Marvel Legends and WWE Classics.

<doc id="944469" wikidata="Q17020687" url="?curid=944469" title="Bookbreaking">
<text>Bookbreaking is the longstanding practice of removing pages (especially those containing maps or illustrations) from books, especially from rare books. 

The term is not usually used to refer to outright theft, where the bookbreaker does not own the book in question. There have been many cases of theft of illustrations—again, especially maps—from rare books in libraries.

==Financial incentives==
Bookbreaking is most often motivated by a market situation in which the maps or illustrations in a book will have more value sold separately than the value of the intact book. Often this happens because book collectors judge minor defects in an old book so harshly as to make them seemingly unsaleable. This widespread practice probably peaked in the 1970s or 1980s, because the price for old engravings and especially for old maps was outstripping that of rare books. However—in part because so many rare, illustrated books were &quot;broken&quot; in this manner—the price of the intact books has now risen the point where an old book is typically worth more intact. Book collectors have also become more sophisticated in understanding minor condition problems.

<text>Newsies is a 1992 American historical musical drama film produced by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by choreographer Kenny Ortega (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay written by the writing team of Bob Tzudiker and Noni White, it is loosely based on the New York City newsboys&#x27; strike of 1899. Featuring twelve original songs by Alan Menken with lyrics by Jack Feldman and an underscore by J. A. C. Redford, it stars Christian Bale, Bill Pullman, Ann-Margret, and Robert Duvall.

The film was a box office bomb and received mixed reviews. However, it later gained a cult following on home video, and was ultimately adapted into a stage musical on Broadway. The play was nominated for eight Tony Awards, winning two including Best Original Score for Menken and Feldman.

==Plot==
In 1899, 17-year-old Jack &quot;Cowboy&quot; Kelly lives with other struggling newspaper hawkers (&quot;newsies&quot;) in New York City, selling copies of the &quot;New York World&quot; on the Manhattan streets (&quot;Carrying the Banner&quot;). When David Jacobs and his younger brother Les join the group, Jack notices David&#x27;s intelligence and Les&#x27;s marketable cuteness, and egotistically takes them under his wing. Unlike most newsies, the brothers work to financially support their family, as their father Mayer lost his factory job after being injured. Invited to the Jacobs&#x27; home for dinner, Jack becomes enamored with their sister Sarah. He later laments his isolation due to lacking his own family and fantasizes about traveling to New Mexico (&quot;Santa Fe&quot;).

After &quot;New York World&quot; publisher Joseph Pulitzer raises the prices required for newsies to buy newspapers from taking the idea and credit from his right-hand man Bunsen from his distribution centers, Jack and David angrily galvanize the other Manhattan newsies to go on strike (&quot;The World Will Know&quot;). While the others notify newsies in New York&#x27;s other boroughs, Jack and Les confront Pulitzer, who ejects them from his office. Bryan Denton, a reporter for &quot;The Sun&quot;, takes an interest in the boys&#x27; story. Jack and David inform the Brooklyn newsies, whose leader, &quot;Spot&quot; Conlon, reluctantly opposes the strike. David motivates the dejected Manhattan newsies (&quot;Seize the Day&quot;), who consequently ambush the distribution center and destroy the newspapers. Pulitzer&#x27;s enforcers, brothers Oscar and Morris Delancey, capture disabled newsie &quot;Crutchie&quot;, who is placed in an orphanage and juvenile detention center called the Refuge, where the sketchy Warden Snyder neglects the orphans to embezzle money the city provides him for their care.

The newsies attempt deterring strikebreakers, but the violent struggle is revealed as a trap set by the Delancey brothers. Before the newsies can be arrested, Spot Conlon arrives with the Brooklyn newsies and the two groups repel the mob. After Denton puts the story on the front page of &quot;The Sun&quot;, the ecstatic newsies imagine potential fame (&quot;King of New York&quot;) before planning a rally. Snyder informs Pulitzer that Jack is an escapee from the Refuge, inspiring Pulitzer to have Jack arrested. During breakfast with Sarah atop the Jacobs&#x27; apartment building, Jack explains his desire to flee to Santa Fe, and wonders if she would miss him.

At Medda Larkson&#x27;s Bowery, Jack, David, and Spot encourage the gathered newsies from around the city to stick together for their cause. Before they all return to their own boroughs, Medda cheers them up with a song (&quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot;). The police then arrive and arrest the newsies, but Denton pays their legal fines for them. Snyder testifies against Jack, revealing his real name as Francis Sullivan; his mother is deceased and his father incarcerated. Jack is sentenced to four years of rehabilitation in the Refuge, while Denton is reassigned as a war correspondent, unable to report on the strike. Pulitzer offers to waive Jack&#x27;s sentence and pay him a salary if he works despite the strike, or he will have the other newsies thrown into the Refuge. The boys attempt to rescue Jack, who tells them to leave.

Though the newsies are shocked and dismayed to see Jack at work the next day, he rescues the Jacobs brothers when the Delanceys attack their sister, knowingly breaking his deal with Pulitzer. Denton notifies the newsies that their strike has not swayed public opinion, since the city thrives on child labor and Pulitzer has warned newspapers against reporting on the strike. Using an old printing press of Pulitzer&#x27;s, they publish a &quot;Newsie Banner&quot; which they distribute to child workers citywide (&quot;Once and For All&quot;). Denton shares the paper with Governor Theodore Roosevelt, exposing the mistreatment of children at the Refuge. Numerous child laborers join the strike, stalling the city&#x27;s workforce. Jack and David confront Pulitzer, who finally concedes.

Roosevelt has Snyder arrested, releases the children from the Refuge, and thanks Jack for alerting him to the situation. He offers Jack a ride, who asks to be taken to the train yards so he can head to Santa Fe. The newsies are disheartened by this, but Jack returns shortly, with Roosevelt having convinced him that he belongs in New York. As the newsies celebrate his return, Sarah and Jack kiss, and Roosevelt returns Spot to Brooklyn.

==Cast==
==Production==
Walt Disney Pictures tapped its film financing partner, Touchwood Pacific Partners, to fund the production of the film. The production had a $15 million budget. Alan Menken&#x27;s longtime collaborator, Howard Ashman, was too sick from AIDS to work with Menken on this film, and he would eventually die on March 14, 1991. Menken brought in lyricist Jack Feldman to help.

The street scenes were filmed at Universal Studios, on the existing backlot New York Street area; this was the first feature to be filmed on the rebuilt New York Street set after the fire of 1990.

==Music==

==Release==
&quot;Newsies&quot; was released on April 10, 1992, via distributor Buena Vista Pictures. The film did not recoup its $15 million budget, making less than a fifth of that at the box office. &quot;Newsies&quot; has since gained a measurable fan base.

In 1992, the film was released on Walt Disney Home Video, while a collector&#x27;s edition DVD was released in 2002. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film, while a 14th Anniversary Edition DVD, on May 30, 2006. on Blu-ray, as a 20th Anniversary Edition, on June 19, 2012.

== Reception ==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film&#x27;s average score is 39% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Extra! Extra! Read all about &quot;Newsies&quot; instead of suffering through its underwhelming musical interludes, although Christian Bale makes for a spirited hero.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin called it &quot;Howard the Paperboy&quot;, noting &quot;This ambitious (up to a point) project is done in by a lackluster score, and by cramped production numbers that seem cheap despite the movie&#x27;s hefty production budget -- not to mention its bloated running time.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $2,819,485 domestically. The film did not recoup its $15 million budget, making less than a fifth of that at the box office. It also ranks among the lowest-grossing live-action films produced by the Walt Disney Studios. This is due to the film being pulled from many theaters after a poor opening weekend.

===Accolades===
==Historical accuracy==

The actual newsboys&#x27; strike of 1899 lasted from July 20 to August 2. The leader of the strike was a one-eyed young man named Louis Balletti, nicknamed &quot;Kid Blink&quot;, who spoke with a heavy Brooklyn accent that was often phonetically transcribed when he was quoted by newspapers. Kid Blink is featured in the film as a minor supporting character, while the role of strike leader is given to the fictional Jack &quot;Cowboy&quot; Kelly. Kid Blink and another real-life newsie, Morris Cohen, were the inspiration for Kelly. The actual strike ended with a compromise: the &quot;World&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; agreed to buy back all unsold copies of the newspapers.

==Stage adaptation==
Disney Theatrical Productions produced a stage musical based on the film that played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, starting on September 25, 2011, through October 16, starring Jeremy Jordan as Jack. &quot;Newsies!: The Musical&quot; contains songs from the film, as well as several new numbers.

The musical opened to previews on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre for a limited engagement from March 15, 2012, to March 28, 2012, in previews and from March 29, 2012, to June 10, 2012, in its official engagement. This was later extended through August 19, 2012, after the first weekend of previews and then extended again, this time to an open-ended run. The show went on to earn eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, winning Best Choreography and Best Original Score. The show closed on August 24, 2014, having played 1,004 performances.

<text>Honduran Revolutionary Party (&quot;Partido Revolucionario Hondureño&quot;) was a small clandestine leftist party in Honduras, which was formed in 1961 by former members of the Communist Party of Honduras who sought a more &quot;scientifically Marxist&quot; platform. PRH was active in the peasants&#x27; movement. In 1993, the PRH merged with three other groups to form the Democratic Unification Party.

<text>Star Wars is a first-person rail shooter designed by Mike Hally and released as an arcade video game in 1983 by Atari, Inc. It uses 3D color vector graphics to simulate the assault on the Death Star from the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. There are three connected gameplay sequences: combat against TIE fighters in space, flying across the surface of the Death Star, and the final trench run. The sequence then repeats with added complications and the Death Star regenerating. The player&#x27;s X-Wing fighter has a shield which only protects against damage a certain number of times, then the next hit ends the game. Speech synthesis emulates actors from the film.

Developed during the golden age of arcade games, &quot;Star Wars&quot; has been included on lists of the greatest video games of all time. Home ports were published by Parker Brothers, Domark, and Broderbund. It was followed by a lesser-known arcade sequel, sold as a conversion kit for the original, in 1985: &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Assuming the role of Luke Skywalker (&quot;Red Five&quot;), the player pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. The controls consist of a yoke with four buttons — two trigger style and two in position to be pressed by the thumbs — each of which fires a laser positioned on the four leading edges of the X-Wings.

The player does not have to destroy every TIE fighter and gun turret to advance through the game. Instead, the player must survive for a set length of time by avoiding the enemies and their shots or destroying them. The player begins with six shields, one of which is lost for every collision into an enemy or projectile. If the player loses all shields and is hit again, the game ends.

Each wave consists of three attack phases, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star.

===Phase 1===
In the first phase, the &quot;Imperial March&quot; or another part of John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; score is briefly played electronically and the player engages in a dogfight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters in outer space near the Death Star. After the TIE fighter waves, when flying towards the Death Star, the yellow grid lines on the Death Star spell out either &quot;May the force be with you&quot; on odd-numbered waves or names of some of the developers on even numbered waves.

===Phase 2===
In the second phase, the player must fly across the surface of the Death Star to reach its equatorial trench. This section is omitted during the first wave of the game. During the second wave, the player is attacked by artillery bunkers. In the third and subsequent waves, laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. A bonus is awarded for destroying every turret.

===Phase 3===
In the third phase, the player must navigate the trench until finally firing a proton torpedo for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield, to a maximum of six (can be set internally for a maximum of eight). Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the trench must be attempted again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, a bonus is awarded for &quot;using the Force.&quot;

The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive wave greatly increases the difficulty; TIE fighters shoot more often, artillery bunkers and laser towers spawn in the second phase, and obstacles appear in the trench during the third. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, which give the player a chance of destroying the shots.

==Development==
Development on the game started in 1981 under the title &quot;Warp Speed&quot; and was initially headed up by Ed Rotberg (who also worked on the vector-based &quot;Battlezone&quot;). The controller was originally designed for &quot;Army Battlezone&quot;, a Bradley Fighting Vehicle training simulator Atari created for the United States Army. Rotberg left Atari in October 1981, after which Atari signed a licensing agreement with Lucasfilm and finished the game. Focus group testing was conducted on January 24, 1983, by groups of 15-19 year old men, 20-35 year old men, and 17-30 year old women.

==Ports==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; was converted first by Parker Brothers (with development by Imagic) in 1983 and 1984 to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, and Commodore 64. The ColecoVision version was programmed by Wendell Brown.

The same game was converted again, in 1987 and 1988, for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro; the game was also converted again for the Atari 8-bits and the Commodore 64. All conversions were developed by UK-based Vektor Grafix (the Atari 8-bit version by Zeppelin Games being an exception) and were published in Europe by Domark. That same year, Broderbund acquired the rights to develop Star Wars games from Lucasfilm. Broderbund published the Macintosh, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS versions of the arcade game in North America in 1988, in addition to republishing the Atari ST and Amiga versions in 1989.

The Amiga and Atari ST allow mouse control and include digitized sound effects. The Macintosh version contains sampled speech from the films, but has no in-game music other than a monophonic theme during the &quot;attract&quot; mode.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; also appears in the GameCube game &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike&quot; as a bonus minigame that can be unlocked after completing a certain level or entering a cheat code. In the United States and some European countries, anyone who pre-ordered the game received a special copy where &quot;Star Wars&quot; is immediately unlocked on startup.

==Reception==
The game was Atari&#x27;s top-selling 1983 arcade release, with Atari producing 12,695 arcade cabinets. In the United States, it topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade chart for street locations in October 1983. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Star Wars&quot; on their November 1, 1983 issue as being the most successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.

&quot;COMPUTE!&quot; praised the Atari ST version of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, calling it &quot;amazing, smoothly animated&quot;. The MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 versions by Broderbund were reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #145 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. &quot;Macworld&quot; praised the Macintosh version&#x27;s gameplay, stating it has &quot;fast-paced action&quot; and is &quot;extremely challenging in higher levels&quot;. The magazine also praised the sound effects and 3D graphics, stating that the latter &quot;enhance the game&#x27;s action and excitement&quot;. &quot;Macworld&quot; criticized the master disk-based copy protection, and the game only having three playable scenarios with &quot;limited&quot; replay value.

=== Accolades ===
In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the game 61st on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 58 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. Citing &quot;Awesome vector graphics, multiple triggers, a deluxe cabinet with powerful speakers in the back, [and] digitized voices&quot;, they ventured that it was &quot;Probably the best licensed game ever.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Star Wars&quot; as number 24 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Besides giving you the opportunity to reenact what many of us consider to be the greatest cinematic experience of our youth, &quot;Star Wars&quot; delivered fast-shooting gameplay with all the subtleties, and the combination of tight control and vector graphics make it equally fun today.&quot; In 2001, it was voted one of the top 100 arcade games of all time by the members of Killer List of Videogames.

==Legacy==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; arcade machines can be converted into &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; via a conversion kit.

As mentioned above, a complete emulation of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, along with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is included as bonus content for &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike&quot;.

In October 2019, Tastemakers LLC&#x27;s Arcade1up division released a 3/4 scale recreation of the original Atari arcade cabinet featuring emulated versions of the coin-op &quot;Star Wars&quot; arcade, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; games.

===High scores===
In 1984, Robert Mruczek scored 300 million points in 49 hours of gameplay (the world record for an individual) and in 2005, Brandon Erickson set a world endurance record of 54 hours on a single credit (with a score of 283 million). In June 1985, Flavio Tozzi, Dave Roberts and Mike Ohren played as a team in turns for five days, two hours and 26 minutes on a single credit to attain the world record score of 1,000,000,012 points. It was verified in the September 1985 edition of the &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. Their efforts raised money for a local charity. The score counter of this game &quot;turns over&quot; at 100 million points.

It was decided to put the machines on a harder setting for the annual Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard/Guinness Book Masters Tournament: initial shields and no bonus shields. In the 1986 Tournament, David Palmer scored 31,660,614 points in about 7 hours, a score which was published in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; and remains the world record to this day.

<doc id="944480" wikidata="Q5242308" url="?curid=944480" title="Dawes Commission">
<text>The American Dawes Commission, named for its first chairman Henry L. Dawes, was authorized under a rider to an Indian Office appropriation bill, March 3, 1893. Its purpose was to convince the Five Civilized Tribes to agree to cede tribal title of Indian lands, and adopt the policy of dividing tribal lands into individual allotments that was enacted for other tribes as the Dawes Act of 1887. In November 1893, President Grover Cleveland appointed Dawes as chairman, and Meridith H. Kidd and Archibald S. McKennon as members.

During this process, the Indian nations were stripped of their communally held national lands, which was divided into single lots and allotted to individual members of the nation. The Dawes Commission required that individuals claim membership in only one tribe, although many people had more than one line of ancestry. Registration in the national registry known as the Dawes Rolls has come to be critical in issues of Indian citizenship and land claims. 

Although many Indian tribes did not consider strict &#x27;blood&#x27; descent the only way to determine if a person was a member of a tribe, the Dawes Commission did. Many Freedmen (slaves of Indians who were freed after the Civil War), were kept off the rolls as members of tribes, although they were emancipated after the war and, according to peace treaties with the United States, to be given full membership in the appropriate tribes in which they were held. Even if freedmen were of mixed-race ancestry, as many were, the Dawes Commission enrolled them in separate Freedmen Rolls, rather than letting them self-identify as to membership. The same was true for members of the historical African descendant communities which developed alongside different Indian settlements in Florida (a Spanish colony for most of the colonial period until 1821 and a popular destination for both escaped slaves and indigenous Southeastern Woodlands refugees) prior to deportation, such as the Black Seminoles, who then accompanied them to Indian Territory. 

Under Article 14 of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek (1831), members of the Mississippi Choctaw had the option of not being relocated to Indian Territory. They were required to register and remain on allocated land in Mississippi or Alabama. The registration process was handled poorly and when blood descendants later emigrated to Indian Territory they had to appeal to the Dawes Commission for recognition as tribal members. The Commission denied power to amend the membership roles. 

Many Creek Freedmen are still fighting the membership battle today against the Creek Nation, as they attempt to share in contemporary benefits of citizenship. The tribe has defined as members only those who are descended from a Creek Indian listed on the Dawes Rolls. A similar controversy has embroiled Cherokee Freedmen and the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee Nation voted in a referendum (from which the Freedmen were excluded) to exclude all Freedmen except those who could prove descent from a Cherokee on the Dawes Roll.

The result of the Dawes Commission was that the five Indian nations lost most of their national land bases, as the government declared as &quot;surplus&quot; any remaining after the allotment to individual households. The US sold the surplus land, formerly Indian territory, to European-American settlers. In addition, over the next decades, settlers bought land from individual Indian households, thus reducing overall land held by tribal members. The Indians received money from the overall sale of lands, but lost most of their former territory. As tribes began to re-establish self-government after 1934, and especially since the 1970s, they have tried to end the sales of tribal lands. 

Angie Debo&#x27;s landmark work, &quot;And Still the Waters Run: The Betrayal of the Five Civilized Tribes&quot; (1940), detailed how the allotment policy of the Dawes Commission and the Curtis Act of 1898 was systematically manipulated to deprive the Native Americans of their lands and resources. In the words of historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, Debo&#x27;s book &quot;advanced a crushing analysis of the corruption, moral depravity, and criminal activity that underlay white administration and execution of the allotment policy.&quot;

<text>Girl You Know It&#x27;s True is a 1989 album that served as the North American debut of German R&amp;B duo Milli Vanilli. It is a reconfigured and repackaged version of the group&#x27;s first album &quot;All or Nothing&quot; with several of the original album tracks replaced and/or remixed for the North American market. The album was a major success in the US, producing five singles that entered the top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, three of which reached the top position. 

In January 1990, &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA after spending seven weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. Additionally, the album spent 41 weeks within the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 and 78 weeks within the charts overall. The album was also certified Diamond in Canada, denoting shipments of over one million units. The success of the album earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 22 February 1990.

On 16 November 1990, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Chuck Philips reported that the group, which consisted of reputed vocalists Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, did not sing a single note on the album. Arista Records dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, making it one of the largest-selling albums to ever be deleted. In addition to this, their Grammy Award was revoked, marking the first time a Grammy was ever rescinded from an artist.

According to producer Frank Farian, the decision to repackage &quot;All or Nothing&quot; as &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; was made by Arista Records president Clive Davis. In addition to including five of the tracks that originally appeared on &quot;All or Nothing&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Miss You&quot;, &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Forget My Number&quot;, &quot;Dreams to Remember&quot; and &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;), &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; featured several new tracks, including &quot;Blame It on the Rain&quot;, which would go on to be a worldwide hit single, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Europe, the track later appeared in an extended version on the album &quot;All or Nothing - The U.S. Remix Album&quot;.

<text>Mikal Gilmore (born February 9, 1951) is an American writer and music journalist.

==Early life and writing career==
Gilmore was born to Frank and Bessie Gilmore, and was also known for being the younger brother of convicted criminal Gary Gilmore. In the 1970s Gilmore began writing music articles and criticism for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. In 1999, his &quot;Night Beat: A Shadow History of Rock and Roll&quot; was published by Anchor. In July 2009, he released &quot;Stories Done: Writings on the 1960s and its Discontents&quot;. It was published by Free Press.

===Memoir===
His brother, Gary, (December 4, 1940 – January 17, 1977) was an American criminal who gained international attention for demanding the implementation of his death sentence for two murders he committed in Utah. After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, he became the first person in almost ten years to be executed in the United States.

In 1994, Mikal published a memoir titled &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot;, detailing his relationship with Gary and their often troubled family, starting with the original Mormon settlers and continuing through to Gary&#x27;s execution and its aftermath. &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; received positive reviews, including a comment by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani calling the book &quot;Remarkable, astonishing... &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; reads like a combination of Brothers Karamazov and a series of Johnny Cash ballads... chilling, heartbreaking, and alarming.&quot; That year, &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.

In 2001, &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; became an HBO film starring Giovanni Ribisi as Mikal, Elias Koteas as Gary, Sam Shepard as the brothers&#x27; father and Lee Tergesen as Frank Gilmore, Jr. The 1977 punk rock single &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot; by the band The Adverts was used in the soundtrack of the movie. The song is written from &quot;the point of view of a hospital patient who has received the eyes of Gary Gilmore in a transplant.&quot;

<doc id="944490" wikidata="Q1139628" url="?curid=944490" title="Ryan Cabrera">
<text>Ryan Frank Cabrera ( ; born July 18, 1982) is an American musician. He began his career as a lead singer for the Dallas band Rubix Groove before pursuing his solo career. Following the 2001 release of independent album &quot;Elm St.&quot;, he released his first major-label album, &quot;Take It All Away&quot;, on August 17, 2004, which went on to sell over two million copies. Earlier in the year, Cabrera had become known for his up-tempo pop-rock single &quot;On the Way Down&quot;. It was then followed by Cabrera&#x27;s second single, &quot;True&quot;; and his third single &quot;40 Kinds of Sadness&quot;.

==Early life==
Cabrera was born in Dallas, Texas to Francisco &quot;Frank&quot; Cabrera and Debbie Cabrera. His father is Colombian and his mother is American. He was raised in Flower Mound, Texas, a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, graduating with the Class of 2000. During this time, he was the lead singer of a self-described &quot;noisy punk band&quot; called Caine which he described as being &quot;as bad as our name suggested&quot; in a 2007 interview with Billboard. After graduation he briefly attended The University of Texas at Dallas before dropping out to pursue music.

==Career==
After leaving school, Cabrera played in the band Rubix Groove, which opened for artists like Cheap Trick and Third Eye Blind. Cabrera composed three songs that impressed a studio engineer, who then let Cabrera record a full-length album, &quot;Elm St.&quot;, for free at Deep Ellum Studios.

===&quot;Take It All Away&quot;===
Cabrera was signed to Atlantic Records in 2002. His major debut single &quot;On the Way Down&quot; debuted on American radio in May 2004. &quot;On the Way Down&quot; peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

&quot;Take It All Away&quot; was released on August 17, 2004, at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and sold over 66,000 copies in its first week and eventually was certified Platinum. John Rzeznik, lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, produced &quot;Take It All Away&quot;. The second single was &quot;True&quot;, whose music video featured Taylor Cole, an actress from the TV show &quot;Summerland&quot;. The third single was &quot;40 Kinds of Sadness&quot;. Cabrera appeared on the &quot;Son of the Mask&quot; soundtrack with the song &quot;Inside Your Mind&quot; and the Fantastic Four soundtrack with the song &quot;Always Come Back To You&quot;. Cabrera has starred in a concert film, Live at the Wiltern, with him performing songs from his album &quot;Take It All Away&quot;.

===2005–2008: &quot;You Stand Watching&quot;===
Cabrera&#x27;s second album, &quot;You Stand Watching&quot;, was released on September 20, 2005, and it included his singles &quot;Shine On&quot; and &quot;Photo&quot;. Cabrera&#x27;s relationship with Ashlee Simpson inspired &quot;Photo&quot;. Several songs were co-written with singer-songwriter Andrew Ripp. &quot;You Stand Watching&quot; debuted at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold around 37,000 in its first week.

In 2006, Cabrera released the single &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;. The song was used soon thereafter as the closing montage for the series finale of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. Soon after, the song was used to send off the female contestants on the 3rd season of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. He added a re-recorded version of the song at the end of his third album, &quot;The Moon Under Water&quot;.

&quot;The Moon Under Water&quot; was released on May 13, 2008, under Frolic Room Records/ Papa Joe Records and peaked at No. 177 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It released two singles, &quot;Say&quot; and &quot;Enemies&quot;.

===2012–present===

On July 3, 2012, Cabrera released a new song called &quot;Home&quot;. On August 2, he released another single called &quot;I See Love&quot; on iTunes, where it reached No. 83 on the top 100. In January 2013, he went on a U.S. tour with Tyler Hilton and Teddy Geiger.

In March 2013, Cabrera launched the web series &quot;Live From Ryan&#x27;s Living Room&quot;. Joining Ryan were celebrities including Colbie Caillat, Tyler Hilton, Chord Overstreet and Mark Ballas. Each month Ryan chose a charity to benefit, one being City of Hope National Medical Center. In September 2013, Ryan went on an Ireland and UK tour with Boyce Avenue.

In 2014, Cabrera was the first artist signed to Dynamite Music, which was founded by Mitchell Davis and Marco Liuzzo in partnership with Caroline Records and Universal Music Group. On October 7, 2014, Cabrera announced his single &quot;House on Fire&quot; with a video on his Facebook page. The single was released to iTunes on October 22. He released a lyric video for his single &quot;House on Fire&quot; on November 3, 2014, on Artist Direct&#x27;s website. &quot;House on Fire&quot; peaked at number one on the US dance chart. Cabrera&#x27;s EP, &quot;Wake Up Beautiful&quot;, was released on March 3, 2015.

Formed in late 2015, Beyond the Sky is a musical conglomerate consisting of players, producers and vocalists from a multitude of genres. Cabrera took lead in this collaborative project, whose first single &quot;Right on the Money&quot; was released on February 12, 2016.

==Television appearances==
In 2004, Cabrera appeared in several episodes of the first season of singer Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s reality show, &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;. Simpson appeared in Cabrera&#x27;s music video for &quot;On the Way Down&quot;. Cabrera later opened for Simpson&#x27;s older sister Jessica&#x27;s tour.

In 2005, Cabrera hosted the MTV series &quot;Score&quot;, in which contestants write and perform songs to vie for the heart of a guest on the show.

In 2010, he appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Hills&quot; during its sixth and final season. The episodes chronicled his romance and eventual break-up with Audrina Patridge. In 2010 he also appeared in the E! television show, &quot;Pretty Wild&quot;. He has appeared as himself in episodes of the USA Network television show, &quot;Miz &amp; Mrs&quot;. He also made an appearance in 2019 on &quot;The Hills: New Beginnings&quot;, again alongside Patridge.

==Personal life==
At the end of 2019, Cabrera began dating professional wrestler Alexis Kaufman, better known as Alexa Bliss. They became engaged on November 14, 2020, and married on April 9, 2022, in Palm Desert, California. On November 27, 2023, they welcomed a daughter, Hendrix Rouge Cabrera.

==Philanthropy==
Cabrera arranged and hosted the livestream Camp Fire Concert Special benefiting Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times on July 30, 2020. Nicholas Petricca, Joey Fatone, Jaret Reddick, Ryan Key, Secondhand Serenade, Jay Buchanan, Fabian Manzano, Debbie Gibson, Shawn Hook, Chris August, and Tyler Ward performed songs for the concert in addition to Cabrera himself. Cabrera&#x27;s wife Alexa Bliss, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, Michael Strahan, and The Miz also appeared to voice support. The event successfully raised over $30,000.

<doc id="944493" wikidata="Q4084921" url="?curid=944493" title="Humphry Berkeley">
<text>Humphry John Berkeley (21 February 192614 November 1994) was a British politician and author. He was noted for his three changes of parties and his early support for gay rights.

He is also remembered for a series of hoax letters he sent as fictional headmaster &quot;H. Rochester Sneath&quot; while an undergraduate, and later published as &quot;The Life and Death of Rochester Sneath&quot;.

==Background and early life==
He was born on 21 February 1926, at Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
Berkeley&#x27;s father, Reginald, was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham Central from 1922 to 1924 and a noted playwright. 
Humphry Berkeley attended Malvern College followed by Pembroke College, Cambridge, and was President of both the Cambridge Union Society and Cambridge University Conservative Association in 1948.
== H. Rochester Sneath ==
Berkeley&#x27;s studies were interrupted when he was excluded (&quot;sent down&quot;) for two years as a result of a practical joke in which he impersonated &quot;H. Rochester Sneath&quot;, the fictional headmaster of a rather odd public school, and wrote hoax letters to public figures.

Berkeley knew Rab Butler, who arranged a job for him at Conservative Central Office during this time; Butler also advised him to keep the hoax letters and their replies safely, and publish them a quarter of a century later. The &quot;Rochester Sneath letters&quot; were duly published in 1974.

==Career==
Berkeley established his own public relations company and became head of publicity and public relations for a group of civil engineering companies. As a strong supporter of European union, he was Director-General of the United Kingdom Council of the European Movement in 1956–1957. In the 1959 general election he was elected as a Conservative MP for Lancaster.

Berkeley was a strong internationalist who supported the work of the United Nations; his father had supported the League of Nations. He served on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western European Union and the Council of Europe from 1963. On the socially liberal wing of his party, Berkeley was a member of the Howard League for Penal Reform and from 1965 the honorary Treasurer. That year he also drew up the new rules for election of the Leader of the Conservative Party.

When he won second place in the ballot for Private Member&#x27;s Bills in 1965, Berkeley decided to introduce a bill to legalise male homosexual relations along the lines of the Wolfenden report. Indeed, according to a 2007 article published in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Berkeley was well known to his colleagues as a homosexual, and not much liked. His Bill was given a second reading by 164 to 107 on 11 February 1966, but fell when Parliament was dissolved soon after. Unexpectedly, Berkeley lost his seat in the 1966 general election, and ascribed his defeat to the unpopularity of his bill on homosexuality.

Out of Parliament, Berkeley took a job as chairman of the United Nations Association. In this capacity he employed Jeffrey Archer, who was establishing a reputation for raising large amounts of money for charities, to organise the UNA&#x27;s flag day collection. Despite barely increasing the previous year&#x27;s total, Archer was promoted to organise a dinner at 10 Downing Street, which raised more than £200,000. Berkeley would later accuse Archer of having made false expenses claims while he worked for the UNA.

In 1968, he had resigned from the Conservative Party, largely in opposition to its stance on the Vietnam War. In 1970, he joined the Labour Party and stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for Fylde North in October 1974.

He then spent time apparently working as a roving ambassador of the now defunct Republic of Transkei, a bantustan, until he was abducted one night in February 1979 while dining at the Umtata Holiday Inn, and assaulted on the side of a road, put into the boot of a car, and dumped over the border at Kei Bridge.

As a moderate and pro-European, Berkeley joined the SDP in 1981, and fought Southend East for them in 1987. In 1988, with the SDP splitting over whether to merge with the Liberals, he rejoined Labour.

<doc id="944494" wikidata="Q310603" url="?curid=944494" title="Pkgsrc">
<text>pkgsrc (&quot;package source&quot;) is a package management system for Unix-like operating systems. It was forked from the FreeBSD ports collection in 1997 as the primary package management system for NetBSD. Since then it has evolved independently; in 1999, support for Solaris was added, followed by support for other operating systems.

pkgsrc currently contains over 22,000 packages and includes most popular open-source software. It is the native package manager on NetBSD, SmartOS and MINIX 3, and is portable across 23 different operating systems, including AIX, various BSD derivatives, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and QNX.

There are multiple ways to install programs using pkgsrc. The pkgsrc bootstrap contains a traditional ports collection that utilizes a series of makefiles to compile software from source. Another method is to install pre-built binary packages via the and tools. A high-level utility named also exists, and is designed to automate the installation, removal, and update of binary packages in a manner similar to Debian&#x27;s Advanced Packaging Tool.

Several vendors, including MNX.io, provide binary packages for popular operating systems, including macOS and Linux.

== Supported platforms ==
== History ==
On October 3, 1997, NetBSD developers Alistair Crooks and Hubert Feyrer created pkgsrc based on the FreeBSD ports system and intended to support the NetBSD packages collection. It was officially released as part of NetBSD 1.3 on January 4, 1998. DragonFly BSD used pkgsrc as its official package system from version 1.4 in 2006, to 3.4 in 2013.

On 2017-09-12, a commit message policy that accommodates DVCS was established by the project.

== Packages ==

The NetBSD Foundation provides official, pre-built binary packages for multiple combinations of NetBSD and pkgsrc releases, and occasionally for certain other operating systems as well.

As of 2018, several vendors provide pre-built binary packages for several platforms:

* Since at least 2014, Joyent has provided binary packages for SmartOS/illumos, macOS, and Enterprise Linux (CentOS/Oracle/Red Hat/Scientific). Packages are provided on a rolling release basis from the trunk (HEAD, in CVS terminology) of pkgsrc, with updates every few days; additionally, quarterly stable releases of pkgsrc for Joyent&#x27;s own SmartOS are also provided (dating back to 2012Q4).

* Since 2017, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee has provided binary packages for NetBSD, RHEL/CentOS, and Darwin/macOS. Packages are only built from the quarterly releases of pkgsrc, aiding use in long-term experiments, where stability and reproducibility of the findings is of the essence.

<text>Radio Moscow (), also known as Radio Moscow World Service, was the official international broadcasting station of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics until 1993, when it was reorganized into Voice of Russia, which was subsequently reorganized and renamed into Radio Sputnik in 2014. At its peak, Radio Moscow broadcast in over 70 languages using transmitters in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Cuba.

Radio Moscow&#x27;s interval signal was &quot;Wide Is My Motherland&quot; (). &quot;Moscow Nights&quot; was the station&#x27;s signature tune since its relaunch as the Radio Moscow World Service in 1978.

==History==

===Early years===
Radio Moscow&#x27;s first foreign language broadcast was in German on 29 October 1929; English and French services soon followed. Previously, Radio Moscow broadcast in 1922 with a transmitter station RV-1 in the Moscow region, and a second broadcasting centre came on air at Leningrad in 1925. By 1939, Radio Moscow was broadcasting (on mediumwave and shortwave) in English, French, Indonesian, German, Italian and Arabic. During the 1930s, Radio Moscow expressed concern about Nazi Germany and its dictator Adolf Hitler, while its Italian mediumwave service was jammed under the orders of Italy&#x27;s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during the late 1930s.

During World War II, Radio Moscow operated an effective international service to Germany and occupied Europe.

===The Cold War years===
The United States was first targeted by Radio Moscow during the early 1950s, with transmitters in the Moscow region. Later Western North America was targeted by the newly constructed Vladivostok and Magadan relay stations.

The first broadcasts to Africa went on the air in the late 1950s in English and French.

In 1961, Radio Moscow for the first time began to transmit broadcasts in three African languages: Amharic, Swahili and Hausa. Over time, speakers of another eight African languages were able to listen to services from Radio Moscow.

The first centralized news bulletin went on the air in August 1963 and reached out to listeners all over the world. In the years of the Cold War, most news reports and commentaries focused on the relations between the United States and Soviet Union.

In the 1970s, Radio Moscow&#x27;s commentators broadcast in the &quot;News and Views&quot; program. The participants were Viktor Glazunov, Leonid Rassadin, Yuri Shalygin, Alexander Kushnir, Yuri Solton and Vladislav Chernukha.

=== Changes late 1970s–1980s ===

In the late 1970s, the English language service was renamed Radio Moscow World Service. The project was launched and supervised by a long-time Radio Moscow journalist and manager Alexander Evstafiev. Later, North American, African and British Isles services (all in English) operated for a few hours per day alongside the regular (24 Hour) English World Service.

At one time in 1980, Radio Moscow had transmissions on the Medium Wave broadcast on 600 kHz (later 1040 kHz) from Havana, Cuba which reached the Caribbean islands and US State of Florida.

One programme on air in the 1980s with an informal presentation, in contrast to most other shows, was the &quot;Listeners&#x27; Request Club&quot;, hosted by radio presenter Vasily Strelnikov. Another feature on Radio Moscow was &quot;Moscow Mailbag&quot;, which answered listeners&#x27; questions in English about the Soviet Union. From 1957, the programme was presented by Joe Adamov.

=== Closure ===
On 22 December 1993, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin issued a decree which reorganized Radio Moscow with a new name: Voice of Russia.

== Languages ==
=== Languages of Radio Moscow ===
By 1931, when Radio Moscow came under the control of the newly established &quot;Gosteleradio&quot;, the service comprised eight languages: English, French, German, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, Swedish.

By the 1970s there were 64 languages:
* English (World Service and regional services), French (to Europe and Africa), Portuguese and Spanish (to Europe and Latin America), Arabic (to North Africa and Near/Middle East)
* 19 languages to Europe: Albanian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Serbo-Croat, Slovak, Slovene, Swedish
* 11 languages to Africa: Amharic, Bambara, Fula, Hausa, Lingala, Malagasy, Ndebele, Shona, Somali, Swahili, Zulu
* 28 languages to Asia: Assamese, Bengali, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Dari, Gujarati, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Laotian, Malayalam, Marathi, Mongolian, Nepali, Oriya, Persian, Punjabi, Pashto, Sinhalese, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese
* 1 language to Latin America: Quechua

In 1989 Russian, Malay and Tagalog were added.

=== Complementing services ===

==== Radio Peace and Progress ====
*Languages offered by both &quot;Radio Peace and Progress (RPP)&quot; and &quot;Radio Moscow&quot;: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Mongolian, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish.
*Languages covered by &quot;RPP&quot;, but not by &quot;Radio Moscow&quot;: Azerbaijani, Creole, Guarani, Hebrew, Yiddish.

==== The union republics ====
In 10 of the 14 union republics besides the RSFSR there were foreign broadcasting services.
*Radio Tallinn: Estonian, Finnish, Swedish
*Radio Riga: Latvian, Swedish
*Radio Vilnius: English, Lithuanian
*Radio Minsk: Belarusian, German
*Radio Kiev: English, German, Ukrainian
*Radio Tbilisi: Abkhazian, Georgian
*Radio Yerevan: Arabic, Armenian, English, French, Kurdish, Spanish
*Radio Baku: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Persian, Turkish
*Radio Tashkent: Arabic, Dari, English, Hindi, Persian, Urdu, Uzbek
*Radio Dushanbe: Dari, Persian, Tajik

==== Russian language services ====
Until 1988, there was no Russian service of Radio Moscow. Instead there were several other services for Russians abroad like the Fifth programme of the All-Union Radio (since 1960), Radio Motherland (Радиостанция Родина) of the Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Fellow-Countrymen Abroad or for fishermen Radio Pacific Ocean (Радиостанция Тихий Океан, 1963–2001) from Vladivostok and Radio Atlantic (Радиостанция Атлантика, 1965–2004) from Murmansk. The First All-Union Radio Programme and Radio Mayak were also relayed on shortwave.

== USSR Shortwave broadcasting innovations ==
The USSR pioneered the use of HRS 8/8/1 antennas (horizontal dipole curtain, eight columns, eight rows, with electrically steerable pattern) for highly targeted shortwave broadcasting long before HRS 12/6/1 technology became available in the west. HRS 8/8/1 curtain arrays create a 10-degree beam of shortwave energy, and can provide a highly audible signal to a target area some 7,000 km away.

<text>The Dartmouth Review is a conservative newspaper at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Founded in 1980 by a number of staffers from the college&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Dartmouth,&quot; the paper is most famous for having spawned other politically conservative U.S. college newspapers that would come to include the &quot;Yale Free Press&quot;, &quot;Carolina Review&quot;, &quot;The Stanford Review&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Salient&quot;, &quot;The California Review&quot;, the &quot;Princeton Tory&quot;, and the &quot;Cornell Review&quot;.

Past staffers have gone on to occupy positions in the Reagan, Bush, and Trump administrations, write for multiple publications, and author political books. Some of the most notable include Pulitzer Prize-winner Joseph Rago and Hugo Restall of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, James Panero of &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, author Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, talk show host Laura Ingraham, and Hoover Institution research fellow Peter Robinson. Author, columnist, and former Nixon and Reagan speechwriter Jeffrey Hart was instrumental in &quot;The Review&quot;″s founding and served as a long-time board member and advisor. As of 2013, the paper has 10,000 off-campus subscribers, distributes a further 2,000 newspapers on campus, and claims 50,000 unique viewers per month on its website.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
The history of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; can be traced to 1980, when a number of campus conservatives met in Jeffrey Hart&#x27;s living room to discuss the school&#x27;s prevailing political culture. Out of these conversations, the idea for a new publication was born. As early &quot;Review&quot; contributor Dinesh D&#x27;Souza tells it, the immediate impetus for the founding was a schism at daily campus newspaper which pitted a group of young Reagan-supporters against the organization&#x27;s progressive editors. After then editor-in-chief Gregory Fossedal began writing in support of the Republican national platform, other editors set about removing him from his position. In response, Fossedal resolved to start an alternative weekly paper of his own. With the help of Professor Hart and other like-minded conservatives, this is what he ultimately did in May 1980.

When Fossedal left &quot;The Daily Dartmouth&quot;, he took a number of the paper&#x27;s younger staffers with him. In the years that followed, this group of writers would form the core of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;″s early leadership and include some of the organization&#x27;s most famous alumni. Among them were Benjamin Hart, Keeney Jones, Gordon Haff, and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza. Peter Robinson, who had graduated the previous spring and was then studying at Oxford University, became an early correspondent and supporter of the paper&#x27;s efforts.

In June 1980, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published its first issue. Distributed to graduating students before the school&#x27;s annual commencement exercises, it focused on the college&#x27;s declining academic standards and the controversy surrounding its recent board of trustees elections. In a series of articles that received attention from many Dartmouth alumni, the editors endorsed write-in candidate John Steel and publicized allegations of improprieties amongst the administration-backed Alumni Council.

In the months that followed, the paper began printing on a weekly basis and released a revised statement of purpose from editor Dinesh D&#x27;Souza. In his words, &quot;The Review&quot;″s mission was &quot;to become what it was set-up to become: a responsible, bold publication of conservative opinion&quot; and a prodigious source of &quot;unbiased, reliable articles [written] without fear of administrative clamps.&quot; Throughout its first few months of activity, the organization and its leaders sought to achieve this greater degree of professionalism by publishing suggested revisions to administrative policy, investigative reports on fraternity controversies, and interviews with notable conservatives like William F. Buckley Jr. It also gained notoriety within some campus circles for its vocal support of Dartmouth&#x27;s disused Indian mascot and its criticism of affirmative action policies.

===The 1980s===

In the spring of 1982, &quot;The Review&quot; published a series of editorials that disparaged the administration&#x27;s affirmative action policies and lamented their effects on Dartmouth&#x27;s academic rigor. Among them was an article that used a combination of Ebonics and heavy satire to mock common excuses for the deficient classroom performance of many black students. This episode, when combined with the paper&#x27;s ongoing support of school&#x27;s controversial Indian mascot and its criticism of a black professor&#x27;s Music 2 class, led many on campus to accuse its editors of racism. Some student groups joined with concerned faculty members and administrators to condemn the editorial stances of the publication and denounce &quot;its particular breed of journalism.&quot;

During this period, the paper weathered many episodes of controversy and faced down several lawsuits, threats, and instances of vandalism. Despite this hostile reception, however, it continued to build a loyal following among many students and alumni and gained a national reputation for its high-quality writing and energetic style.

In its first decade of activity, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published several notable articles and led student opposition to a number of the administration&#x27;s policies. After the paper launched an editorial campaign that used a survey of national tribal leaders to defend the Indian mascot, support for the defunct symbol became so strong that undergraduates unfurled banners at home football games and proclaimed its return. Earlier that same year, the paper conducted an investigation into the Gay Students&#x27; Association (GSA) and its use of college funds. It attempted to reveal improprieties, but the administration did not withdraw its financial support of the GSA or reform its internal controls and standards in response to the paper&#x27;s investigation.

At this time, the paper also leveraged its burgeoning reputation to conduct interviews with several political and cultural leaders. Among them were Betty Friedan, Ralph Nader, Czeslaw Milosz, Abbie Hoffman, Richard Nixon, Donald Rumsfeld, Bobby Seale, Charlton Heston, Allen Ginsberg, Charlie Daniels, Gennifer Flowers, and Norman Podhoretz. Due in large part to these features and the success of its campus activism, &quot;The Review&quot; received early endorsements from the likes of Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, and William F. Buckley Jr. Far from being damaged by the controversies, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; grew throughout its first decade of publication.

===The 1990s===

The 1990s began on a controversial note for &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; when an unknown saboteur slipped an anti-Semitic quote from Adolf Hitler into the paper&#x27;s credo. Although then editor-in-chief Kevin Pritchett immediately recalled the issue and apologized to all who had been offended, the incident fueled further accusations that the paper and its editors were racist. In response to popular demands from students and faculty members alike, President Freedman and the administration organized a &quot;Rally Against Hate&quot; to promote campus unity and censure the actions of &quot;The Review&quot;. Many alumni and national media outlets were critical of this decision and faulted Freedman for not conducting a fact-finding mission before assuming that the Hitler quote was a deliberate ploy. Despite this blowback, however, the incident severally damaged the reputation of the publication and led to the resignation of several key editors. It would be years before staff recruitment and fundraising fully recovered.

Throughout the rest of President Freedman&#x27;s tenure, the paper remained a vocal presence within the campus debate and was a consistent critic of the administration&#x27;s affirmative action, governance, and free speech policies. After President Freedman retired and was replaced by James Wright in 1998, &quot;The Review&quot; became embroiled in yet another controversy as it spearheaded popular opposition to a proposed fraternity reform plan. In the end, Wright&#x27;s proposal to force the fraternities to go coed was defeated by overwhelming criticism from students and alumni alike. In the aftermath, many cited &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; and its national readership as the key to the opposition&#x27;s success.

===The 2000s and into the present===

Since 2000, the paper has continued to play an important, albeit more moderate, role in the college&#x27;s political discourse. Between 2001 and 2005, it became a critical force behind a series of governance fights in which the school&#x27;s alumni attempted to reassert their influence over the trustee selection process. In what came to be known as the &quot;Lone Pine Revolution,&quot; a plurality of alums succeeded in independently nominating and electing four trustees who were critical of the college&#x27;s stance on issues concerning free speech, athletics, alumni rights, and the curriculum. Among them were Peter Robinson, a member of the Class of 1979 and an early contributor to &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, and Todd Zywicki, a member of the class of 1988 and a vocal critic of the Freedman administration. The two would later observe that their campaigns were aided immensely by &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; and its favorable coverage of them.

In 2006, the paper sparked campus-wide controversy for its decision to publish an issue with an Indian brandishing a tomahawk on its cover. Inside, the editors included several articles that criticized the college&#x27;s apologies for a string of incidents that many Native Americans found offensive. After many campus groups expressed their outrage, the paper&#x27;s leadership apologized for the cover and admitted that it was a mistake.

In the last few years, &quot;The Review&quot; has focused on the administration&#x27;s policies concerning the fraternities, governance, free speech, and student life. After President Jim Kim announced an unpopular new meal plan in the spring of 2011, &quot;The Review&quot; took the lead in criticizing its deficiencies and suggesting more cost-effective alternatives. The paper was also quick to defend Dartmouth against allegations of &quot;institutionalized hazing&quot; brought by Andrew Lohse and &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot; in the winter of 2012. Since then, it has supported Dartmouth&#x27;s Greek system against the administration&#x27;s renewed attempts at reforming it.

In 2013, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; completed a major internal reorganization under J. P. Harrington and Nicholas Desatnick, then Editors-In-Chief and Stuart A. Allan, then President. The Review built a web and social media presence, increased donations, substantially revised editorial and business practices and moved operations into a large office on Hanover&#x27;s Main Street. As a result of these reforms, the rejuvenated paper gained national attention for its coverage of campus protests that disrupted the school&#x27;s prospective student weekend. After representatives from a number of interest groups forced their way into the &quot;Dartmouth Dimensions&quot; show and began protesting racism, elitism, and other social ills, &quot;The Review&quot; became the first campus publication to cover the event and release full-length stories on its website. In the incident&#x27;s aftermath, the paper was supportive of campus reform efforts but remained critical of the administration for canceling classes on the following Wednesday and for not punishing the students who were involved. In the months since, the paper has begun publishing commentary on national political events and their reception by various student constituencies on campus. &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; also launched its inaugural Great Issues debate, modeled after Dartmouth College&#x27;s lauded Great Issues Lecture Series which ran under the college&#x27;s President John Sloan Dickey until the late 1970s. The inaugural debate was between former reviewer Dinesh D&#x27;Souza and Bill Ayers.

As of 2016, the paper has more than 40 writers and business associates on staff and produces sixteen issues a year.

==Format==
In the years since 1980, the basic layout of &quot;The Review&quot; has remained largely unchanged. Published in a black-in-white, broadsheet format, each issue is typically 12 to 16 pages in length and includes upwards of 25,000 words in original content. On the first or second page, a letter from the editor-in-chief appears next to the masthead and below a slogan borrowed from the Scottish Highlanders: nemo me impune lacessit (&quot;no one threatens me with impunity&quot;). The remainder of each issue contains articles written by regular staffers and the occasional guest contributor. It is traditional for the final page to include &quot;Gordon Haff&#x27;s Last Word,&quot; a compilation of quotes related to the issue&#x27;s central theme, and &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Mixology, a humorous (and often anonymous) satire written in the form of a cocktail recipe. &quot;The Review&quot; also makes a habit of publishing letters from its subscribers as well as a number of cartoons and caricatures donated by supportive alumni.

==Editorial stances==
Founded as an advocate of conservative ideas on Dartmouth&#x27;s campus, &quot;The Review&quot; has been a consistent and vocal advocate for a number of social and political positions. In addition to defending the traditions and customs of what many consider to be &quot;the old Dartmouth,&quot; the paper has long supported students&#x27; rights to free speech, the fraternity system, a Western core curriculum, Dartmouth&#x27;s undergraduate focus, and more stringent academic standards. It has also criticized affirmative action policies, academic multiculturalism, and administrative restrictions on alumni involvement in issues of college governance.

==Controversies==
After &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; first gained notoriety for opposing affirmative action policies in the early 1980s, the paper became the focal point of several legal and political battles that garnered a great deal of attention in the national press. Although &quot;The Review&quot; has become considerably more moderate in recent years, it retains its reputation for having outspoken views and for actively shaping contemporary campus debates. Examples of controversy from the organization&#x27;s history include:

In March 1982, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published an article in which author Keeney Jones criticized affirmative action policies by donning the persona of a disaffected African American student. Entitled &quot;Dis Sho&#x27; Ain&#x27;t No Jive, Bro,&quot; it was written entirely in Ebonics and included such excerpts as &quot;white folk be itchin&#x27; to be puttin&#x27; us back into [fetters]&quot; and &quot;we not be includin&#x27; dat Uncle Tom, Tom Sowell, in dis.&quot; In response, several campus groups and faculty members voiced concerns about the stereotypical nature of the column and its potential effects on race relations at Dartmouth. &quot;The Review&quot;″s editors defended the piece by pointing out that writers like Mark Twain and Damon Runyon had previously used racial dialects in social satire and that, since many claim jive is a viable alternative to traditional English, the article was the equivalent of publishing a feature in French, Spanish, or Latin.

In May 1982, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; cofounder Benjamin Hart was delivering copies of the paper&#x27;s latest issue when he was attacked and bitten by a black administrator from the college&#x27;s alumni center. The Dartmouth faculty voted to censure the actions of &quot;The Review&quot; and support the alumni center employee who was convicted of assault and sentenced to three months probation. A number of campus groups, including the Afro-American Society, the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and the Undergraduate Council, similarly condemned the publication and issued statements &quot;deploring [its] particular breed of journalism.&quot; Following the attack, Benjamin Hart sought treatment at Mary Hitchcock Hospital and was released after receiving a tetanus shot.

In January 1983, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published an article by Laura Ingraham criticizing Professor William Cole&#x27;s Music 2 course and judging his curriculum to be &quot;one of Dartmouth&#x27;s most academically deficient.&quot; In response, Professor Cole visited Ingraham&#x27;s campus dorm room and, finding her absent, pounded on the door until a startled roommate calmed him down. The following Tuesday, despite repeated warnings from the Dean of the Faculty, he cancelled his class for two sessions and demanded a public apology from &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;. When the editors stood by the content of the story, he sued them for libel and sought over $2.4 million in remuneration. In the months that followed, the case garnered considerable national attention and pitted much of the Dartmouth faculty against the publication and its supporters. After Professor Cole&#x27;s representation was unable to demonstrate that there were any factual inaccuracies or generalizations in the piece, he decided to dismiss his libel suit in June 1985.

In May 1984, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published an editorial that contained various anecdotes from a Gay Students&#x27; Association meeting. The event was advertised as being open to the public; however, the reporter in attendance, Teresa Polenz, brought a tape recorder hidden in a Kenya-style handbag and recorded the meeting without the consent or knowledge of those in attendance. Polenz was subsequently charged with violating New Hampshire privacy statutes 644:9 as well as state wire tapping and eavesdropping ordinances. After a five-month review of the case, Polenz was acquitted of all charges and permitted to re-enroll at the college.

In January 1986, a number of Dartmouth undergraduates formed the committee to Beautify the Green and used sledgehammers to dismantle the shanties that had been erected in the center of the campus as part of a campaign to promote institutional divestment of South African assets. The timing of the &quot;attack&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other media referred to it, was 3:00 am, and two Dartmouth students were sleeping inside one of the shanties when the sledgehammer attack began and were &quot;awakened by the sound of hammers and glass shattering.&quot;

Prior to the event, the shanties had been deemed illegal by the Hanover Police Department and the college had requested that the protesters vacate the Green prior to the traditional festivities of the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. Despite these efforts, the protestors remained in their wooden structures and refused to stage their demonstration elsewhere. When negotiations with College administrators reached an impasse, a band of twelve undergraduates took matters into their own hands and drove a flat-bed onto the Green, dismantled three of the four shanties, and sent the lumber off to a local charity. Former Editor-in-Chief of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; and &quot;Committee to Beautify the Green&quot; spokeswoman Debbie Stone was reported as acknowledging that the committee was &quot;partly a project of the &quot;Dartmouth Review&quot;.&quot;

The news of the shanties&#x27; demise provoked campus-wide uproar and received immediate censure from President McLaughlin. Ten out of the twelve individuals involved were affiliated with &quot;The Review&quot;, leading to the paper being blamed for the incident. Charges of racism were levied against its editors because the demolition had occurred the evening after Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday. Student activists barricaded themselves in the President&#x27;s office with demands that the Dean of the college issue a public repudiation of the paper and host teach-ins about racial tolerance. In response, the administration canceled classes on the following Friday and filed disciplinary charges against the twelve perpetrators. After an internal judicial review found them all guilty of violating the school&#x27;s Code of Conduct and selectively suspended the ten who wrote for &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, concerns about the apparent bias of the proceedings and witness tampering led to national outrage and calls for a retrial. With help from New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey and Governor John Sununu, the ten students successfully appealed the findings of the panel and were able to remain enrolled at the college.

In February 1988, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published an editorial in which its editors criticized several courses for their lack of academic rigor. Among them was Dr. William Cole&#x27;s Music 2 class. Prior to the completion of the piece, then Editor-in-Chief Christopher Baldwin informed Professor Cole of the paper&#x27;s intent to publish anecdotes from his course and that, should he desire it, &quot;The Review&quot; would give him a space to respond. After Baldwin was rebuffed, he and three other staffers went to speak with Professor Cole personally. When Cole saw them, however, he became enraged and began berating and physically threatening &quot;Review&quot; editor John Sutter. In the confrontation that followed, Cole repeatedly poked at Sutter&#x27;s eyes, grabbed the paper&#x27;s photographer, and ripped the flashbulb off of his camera. When prompted for an apology, Cole beckoned at Sutter and told him to &quot;come and take it from me.&quot; On February 26, Dartmouth&#x27;s Committee on Standards charged the four students involved with &quot;harassment, violating the right to privacy, and disorderly conduct.&quot; An attempt by &quot;The Review&quot;″s editors to file similar charges against Cole and the African American students who subsequently threatened them was blocked by Dean of the college, Edward Shanahan. In the judicial proceedings that followed, the committee voted to separate Baldwin and Sutter from Dartmouth for six terms, suspend photography editor, John Quilhot, for two, and place &quot;Review&quot; contributor Sean Nolan on disciplinary probation for four. Because of perceived procedural errors and the admitted bias of several members of the panel, all four staffers sought to appeal their punishments, but their requests were denied by the administration. In response, both Baldwin and Sutter sought a legal injunction before a full-scale jury trial to readmit them at the start of the following term. In what became a closely followed case that drew national media attention from outlets such as &quot;The National Review&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Judge Bruce Mohl of the New Hampshire Superior Court ruled in favor of &quot;The Review&quot; staffers and ordered the administration to &quot;forthwith reinstate the plaintiffs… as full time students at Dartmouth College.&quot; He also noted that although the college&#x27;s own judicial proceedings were rife with procedural flaws, he found &quot;no persuasive evidence that Dartmouth [had] retaliated against or otherwise pursued disciplinary action against the plaintiffs on account of their association with &quot;The Dartmouth Review.&quot;&quot;. When Professor Cole resigned from faculty in the fall of 1990, he would cite this incident and his checkered history with the paper as one of the reasons for his departure.

In October 1988, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; published a column by James Garrett that compared the administration of College President James Freedman to that of the Third Reich. Entitled &quot;Ein Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Freedman,&quot; the piece suggested that Dartmouth&#x27;s first Jewish president had used his charisma to seek &quot;&#x27;a Final Solution&#x27; to the Conservative Problem&quot; and was actively persecuting &quot;Review&quot; staffers for their political beliefs. Many student groups, faculty members, and alumni criticized the editors&#x27; decision to publish the article and accused the publication of anti-Semitism. The staff, a quarter of whom were Jewish at the time, defended the column as an instance of &quot;shock journalism&quot; and issued an apology to those they had offended.

In the fall of 1990, an issue of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; appeared not with the traditional quote from Theodore Roosevelt in the masthead but with several lines of text from Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. When the discovery was made, then Editor-in-Chief Kevin Pritchett recalled every issue that had not already been distributed, publicly apologized for what had occurred, and pledged to conduct &quot;a thorough investigation into the source of the sabotage.&quot; Rather than work with the paper as the editors had requested, however, President Freedman and the rest of the administration publicly censured &quot;The Review&quot; and organized a &quot;Rally Against Hate&quot; to promote racial solidarity and condemn what was assumed to be a deliberate act of anti-Semitism. News of the campus controversy quickly attracted attention from national news outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The National Review&quot;. In response to assertions that the paper was racist, Pritchett commissioned two independent reports, one from the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission and the other from the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;Nai B&#x27;irth, to investigate &quot;The Review&quot;″s treatment of Jewish religious and social matters since its inception. Neither organization &quot;[found] any hint of bigotry or prejudice&quot; and concluded that the Hitler quote was most likely inserted as a deliberate act of sabotage. The paper also worked with the Hanover Police Department to identify the culprit and conduct a thorough internal investigation. Although the inquiry named several suspects, no one has ever officially established who inserted the Hitler quote into the masthead.

The November 28, 2006, issue of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; featured an image of an Indian brandishing a scalp with the headline: &quot;The Natives are Getting Restless!&quot; The paper contained multiple pieces criticizing both Native American students&#x27; complaints about a string of incidents perceived as racist as well as the college&#x27;s apologies for them. In an interview with the Associated Press, the &quot;Dartmouth Review&quot; editor-in-chief described the issue as a response to &quot;the overdramatic reaction to events this term.&quot; Editors subsequently issued statements expressing their regret and called the cover a mistake.

In fall of 2012, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; ran a cover with a picture of Dean of the College Charlotte Johnson and the Director of the Greek Letter Organizations and Societies office, Wes Schaub, posed in the style of &quot;American Gothic&quot;. The issue criticized the college&#x27;s new alcohol and walkthrough policies as unsafe and invasive, predicting they would force the college&#x27;s fraternities to shut their doors to freshmen in an effort to reduce liability. Later that year, the college&#x27;s Inter-Fraternity Council moved to impose such a measure for the following school year.

Blake Neff, a member of the class of 2013 who had written for &quot;The Dartmouth Review,&quot; served as the head writer for &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; until it emerged that he had made anonymous posts on the message board AutoAdmit that featured racist, sexist, and homophobic content. He resigned from Fox News in July 2020.

Throughout its history, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; has met opposition for its controversial use of the college&#x27;s name. Many critics of the paper have claimed that because it does not have any institutional affiliation with Dartmouth and because its social stances are perceived to be inimical to the values of the school, the paper should be forced to change its name. For its part, &quot;The Review&quot; has resisted such charges by reminding opponents that many of Hanover&#x27;s independent shops and businesses have adopted the college&#x27;s name. As a result, requiring a political organization to strike &quot;Dartmouth&quot; from its title would be seen as a selective infringement on free speech and would set a dangerous precedent for future abuse.

== Influence and legacy ==
Critics have charged that the paper is more provocative than effective, though the staff asserts that the combination of its investigative journalism and its consistent advocacy of issues relating to the curriculum, governance, and free speech have led to changes at the college. Some have credited its writings for the resilience of the fraternity system, reforms to club and activity funding, and greater alumni involvement in internal policy formation. The fact that early contributors like Peter Robinson could later be elected to Dartmouth&#x27;s Board of Trustees testifies to the paper&#x27;s ability to influence public opinion and have a lasting effect on mainstream campus debates.

Since 1980, dozens of similar publications, including &quot;The Yale Free Press&quot;, &quot;The Stanford Review&quot;, &quot;The Harvard Salient&quot;, &quot;The California Review&quot;, &quot;The Princeton Tory&quot;, and &quot;The Cornell Review&quot;, have been founded at peer institutions and credited &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; as a guiding influence.

Outside of the academy, the paper has also had an important impact on the conservative movement as a whole. As Peter Robinson relates:

:&quot;At the Reagan White House, I wrote speeches for the President, Will Cattan &#x27;83 wrote speeches for the Vice President, and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza &#x27;83 helped administer the Office of Domestic Policy. Within a few blocks, Gregory Fossedal &#x27;81 held a senior position at the Department of Education, Benjamin Hart &#x27;81 produced position papers for The Heritage Foundation, Michael [Keeney] Jones &#x27;82 wrote speeches for the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and Laura Ingraham &#x27;85 served as an assistant to the Secretary of Transportation. So many Dartmouth students went from &quot;The Review&quot; straight to positions of responsibility in the nation&#x27;s capital that Sidney Blumenthal, a reporter for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, composed an article about us in which he hinted darkly at some sort of conspiracy.&quot;

<text>Fuerzas Populares Revolucionarias Lorenzo Zelaya (Revolutionary Popular Forces Lorenzo Zelaya), was a clandestine politico-military movement in Honduras. FPRLZ was formed in 1980 by dissidents of PCMLH. FPRLZ was inspired by the Nicaraguan Revolution of 1979, and unlike the traditional communist parties (the PCH and PCMLH), FPRLZ advocated guerrilla struggle.

FPRLZ maintained relations with Salvadoran Fuerzas Populares de Liberación, and later with FMLN when the front was more consolidated. In 1990 FPRLZ merged with other tendencies to form Partido Renovación Patriótica.

FPRLZ was named after the peasants leader Lorenzo Zelaya, who was murdered in 1965.</text><links>

<text>Solid State Logic Ltd. (SSL) is a British company based in Begbroke, Oxfordshire, England that designs and markets audio mixing consoles, signal processors, and other audio technologies for the post-production, video production, broadcast, sound reinforcement and music recording industries. SSL employs over 160 people worldwide and has regional offices in Los Angeles, Milan, New York City, Paris, and Tokyo, with additional support provided by an international network of distributors. Solid State Logic is part of the Audiotonix Group.

==History==
===Early history===
Solid State Logic was founded by Colin Sanders in 1969 as the first manufacturer of solid-state control systems for pipe organs. Sanders coined the company&#x27;s name to explain the then-modern technology of transistor and FET switching to organ builders.

Sanders also owned and operated Acorn Studios, a recording studio in Stonesfield, Oxfordshire. When he sought a mixing console for recording, with routing flexibility and settings recall unavailable on consoles at that time, Sanders applied his experience to design and build his own, building two mixing consoles with computer control which featured one-button switching between recording, tracking and mixdown modes. The two prototype mixing consoles, given the model designation of SL 4000 A, became the start of a series of large-format mixers that would define and establish SSL as a mixing console manufacturer.

===Large-format mixing consoles===
In 1976, SSL combined the SL 4000&#x27;s in-line mixing console design with a computer that provided fader automation and programmable tape transport auto-location functionality, A total of six B Series consoles were built for and sold to studios, beginning with Abbey Road Studios in London, followed by Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Canada, Virgin Records&#x27; Townhouse Studios in London, and Tocano Studio in Copenhagen. 
The SL 4000 E Series, introduced in 1979, offered various improvements on the B Series, including a new 4-band EQ section developed in collaboration with George Martin. Most notably, the E Series introduced the ability to save and recall mixer settings, and was the first mixer to feature a compressor/gate on every channel as well as the master bus compressor. SSL introduced the SL 4000 G Series at the AES New York Convention in 1987, which again offered a redesigned EQ, among other improvements. The ability to save and recall mixer settings, along with the inclusion of a dedicated compressor and noise gate on every channel on SL 4000 E Series consoles and its successors and variants drove widespread adoption in professional recording studios, including The Power Station, Sarm Studios, Larrabee Sound Studios, Battery Studios, Record One, Eden Studios, and RG Jones Recording Studios, and used by recording engineers such as Bob Clearmountain, Steve Lillywhite, Tom Lord-Alge, Alan Moulder, and Trevor Horn.

The SL 4000 E Series and G Series consoles were later also made available in 5000 Series, 6000 Series, and 8000 Series formats, which offered various routing and bussing configurations to address the needs of sound for the recording, film, video, and broadcast markets. SSL introduced SuperAnalogue design in the SL 9000 J Series console, which utilized a capacitor-free signal path to achieve very high bandwidth with extremely low distortion.
In 1996 Billboard magazine&#x27;s Studio Action Chart reported that 83% of number one singles that year had been produced using an SSL mixing console. The company claims that more platinum albums have been recorded on SSL mixing consoles than any other company&#x27;s equipment combined. By 2004, there were more than 3,000 SSL-equipped facilities worldwide.

In the 1990s, SSL also developed products for the post production and motion picture industry, and introduced the A Series digital mixing consoles. In the 2000s, the company introduced the C Series consoles designed to meet the needs of the broadcast production market.

===Outboard processors and consoles with DAW control===
In 2003, SSL introduced outboard signal processors that offered processing previously only available in SSL&#x27;s large-format mixing consoles. The XLogic family of products included the Logic Channel, the company&#x27;s first standalone channel strip. 2005 saw the release of additional processors, including the E Series channel strip and G Series Compressor, which utilized SSL&#x27;s classic G Series center compressor design elements within a SuperAnalogue design topology. The X-Rack offered a modular solution for outboard signal processing. 

In late 2004, SSL launched AWS 900, an integrated analogue console and DAW controller, and introduced its successor, the AWS 900+, two years later. SSL eventually listed over 300 studios using the AWS900. SSL later introduced the AWS 916, 924, and 948 with support for SSL&#x27;s delta control plug-in.
 

In late 2006, SSL launched Duality, a large-format console that combined mixing console functionality of the XL 9000K with the control surface features of the AWS 900. Duality featured updated signal routing controls, accessible from the console&#x27;s center section rather than on each channel. The console&#x27;s channel strips include both E Series &amp; G Series equalization, which is selected via a single button per channel. The console also features &#x27;Variable Harmonic Drive&#x27;, or VHD microphone/line preamplifiers, which can either be utilised as standard low-distortion preamps, or in a mode which introduces 2nd (even) &amp; 3rd (odd) order harmonic distortion.

Also in 2006 SSL introduced the Duende DSP platform designed to emulate SSL channel strip features for home recording enthusiasts, including filters, SSL E and G Series EQ and dynamics processing. Additionally, the system offers the SSL Stereo Bus Compressor. Based on the digital technology behind SSL&#x27;s C-Series consoles, Duende was designed to integrate into DAW environments using either a FireWire cable connection or PCI-e card, with the digital processing channels appearing as VST or Audio Units plug-ins. On 25 April 2007, SSL announced the release of another plug-in for the Duende, called Drumstrip, which contained a noise gate, a transient shaper, high frequency and low frequency enhancers, and the Listening Mic Compressor.

The same year, the company announced its expansion into broadcast video content management and delivery with their MediaWAN system.

==Ownership changes==
Solid State Logic sold its organ division in 2002; it is now known as Solid State Organ Systems. The proprietary aptX-codec was sold in a management buyout, with APT Licensing Ltd. incorporated on 1 March 2005 in Belfast.

In 2005, musician Peter Gabriel and broadcast entrepreneur David Engelke became majority shareholders of the company.

In 2017, Solid State Logic was acquired by the Audiotonix Group, while Gabriel became a major investor in the group following this transaction.

==Awards==
The company received The Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export) in 1981, and The Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise: Innovation (Technology) in 1993 and 2020.

The company received a Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2004 for &quot;contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field.&quot;

Two of SSL&#x27;s products were inducted into the TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame, which &quot;honors and recognizes audio products and innovations that have made a significant contribution to the advancement of audio technology&quot;: the SL 4000 series of mixing consoles was inducted in 2004, and the AWS studio console was inducted in 2018.

<text>Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (PWC or P&amp;WC) is a Canada-based aircraft engine manufacturer. PWC&#x27;s headquarters are in Longueuil, Quebec, south of Montreal. It is a division of the larger US-based Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W), itself a business unit of RTX Corporation. United Technologies had given PWC a world mandate for small and medium aircraft engines while P&amp;W&#x27;s US operations develop and manufacture larger engines.

Although PWC is a division of P&amp;W, it does its own research, development and marketing as well as the manufacturing of its engines. The company currently has about 10,000 employees worldwide, with 6,000 of them in Canada.

==History==
The Canadian Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Company, Ltd. was founded in November 1928 to act as a service centre for P&amp;W aircraft engines. During World War II, it assembled Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp series engines built in the U.S. In 1952, the production of Wasp engines was transferred to Canadian Pratt &amp; Whitney so P&amp;W could concentrate on developing jet engines.

In the late 1950s, a team of 12 Canadian Pratt &amp; Whitney engineers began the development of the first small turbine engine in Canada, the PT6. The first example was delivered to a customer in 1963. In 1962, the company was renamed United Aircraft of Canada (UAC), and assumed its current name in 1975. In 1963 a total of 41 Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King (originally CHSS-2) helicopters were delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy. The airframe components were made in Connecticut by another United Aircraft subsidiary, Sikorsky, but most of the aircraft were assembled by UAC in Longueuil, Quebec.

Its 100,000th engine was produced in May 2017, its fleet logged 730 million flight hours and 60,000 in-service engines are operated by 12,300 customers in more than 200 countries.

==Products==
===Engines===
====Next Generation Regional Turboprop====
By 2017, PWC was developing a new engine, the &quot;Next Generation Regional Turboprop&quot;, scalable from for 90-seaters and featuring a new compressor, state-of-the-art propeller and nacelle among technologies, materials and manufacturing processes improvements to deliver 20% better fuel efficiency and 20% less maintenance costs than the PW100.
The high-efficiency compressor testing began in 2012 and ran the full range of aerodynamic design points to validate the component efficiency and pressure ratio.
Compressor tests were successfully completed in 2016 and Hot-section technology was to be adapted from the PW1000G. PWC targeted 2023-25 for its introduction, and it was to halve operating cost per shaft horsepower.

===Aircraft===
* Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King - primary assembly

==Fleet==
As of February 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada has the following aircraft registered with Transport Canada and operate as ICAO airline designator PWC, and telephony PRATT.

* Boeing 747SP - 2
* Cessna 560XLS - 1
* De Havilland Canada Dash 8 - 1
* Dornier 328JET (328–300) - 1

<text>Partido Morazanista de Liberación Nacional was a leftist party in Honduras. PMLN was earlier known as &quot;Frente Morazanista para la Liberación de Honduras&quot;. FMLH had been formed as a break-away of PCMLH. FMLH was a clandestine politico-military organization. FMLH was, however, mainly based in exile in neighbouring Nicaragua. According to one source, FMLH had 300 fighters at its peak.

In 1992, PMLN joined with three other groups to form the Democratic Unification Party.

<doc id="944513" wikidata="Q3045384" url="?curid=944513" title="Peril Strait">
<text>Peril Strait or Shee Káx’ is a strait in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska. It is between Chichagof Island to its north and Baranof Island and Catherine Island to its south. The strait is long and reaches from Salisbury Sound on the west to the Chatham Strait on the east. It is entirely within the limits of the City and Borough of Sitka.
==Name==
Shee Káx’ comes from “Shee” which is the original name of Baranof Island. Káx’ is “above”, a locative description.

The strait was named Proliv Pogibshy by Russians because of a fatal incident during a fur seal hunting expedition led by Alexander Baranof in 1799. According to V. F. Lisianski, Baranof employed Native Aleut hunters, ate poisonous shellfish from the strait, which resulted in approximately one hundred and fifty deaths. Beyond the strait are the points Poison Cove and Deadman&#x27;s Reach, also named for the incident. Peril Strait is the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey translation of Proliv Pogibshiy.

This name Haat xhishxhaak is actually used in reference to Sergius Narrows, as well as any area with rapids or whirlpools. &quot;Haat&quot; is tide, rapids, whirlpool, back-eddy.

The name of Peril Strait is Shee Kax&#x27;, &quot;Shee&quot; being the name of Baranof Island and kax&#x27; meaning &quot;on top of&quot;.

Hoonah Sound is called Shee Kaax Yik (Up and Offset From Shee [Baranof Island]).

==Navigation==
On May 10, 2004, the AMHS vessel M/V &quot;LeConte&quot; grounded on Cozian Reef in Peril Strait. There were no major injuries, and after an extensive salvage process, the &quot;LeConte&quot; was escorted to Ketchikan for successful repairs. The cause of the grounding was determined to be operator error, not tidal currents.

The Fairway Island Light, located on the eastern entrance to Peril Strait, was an important aid-to-navigation in the early 20th century.

<doc id="944515" wikidata="Q1629834" url="?curid=944515" title="McPherson Range">
<text>The McPherson Range is an extensive mountain range, a spur of the Great Dividing Range, heading in an easterly direction from near Wallangarra to the Pacific Ocean coastline. It forms part of the Scenic Rim on the border between the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Further west of the McPherson Range is the Main Range. Towards the coast the range continues into the Border Ranges and other mountainous terrain formed by the Tweed Volcano.

The Australian electoral Division of McPherson was named after the mountain range.

==Geography==
Wilsons Peak is considered to be the intersection of the Great Divide and the McPherson Range. There are five waterfalls in this part of the range including Teviot Falls, Queen Mary Falls, Daggs Falls and Browns Falls . Other notable mountains in the range include Mount Lindesay and Mount Barney.

The range contains a number of national parks, including Mount Barney National Park, Border Ranges National Park and Lamington National Park among others which possess World Heritage listing, as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.

The Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor and the Lions Road pass over the range at Richmond Gap, as does the Mount Lindesay Highway and the Nerang-Murwillumbah Road. A third passage through Teviot Gap, provides a road route between Boonah and Killarney near Wilson&#x27;s Peak.

==History==
The ranges were first explored by white settlers in 1828. The party was headed by Allan Cunningham and Patrick Logan while searching for a route to the Darling Downs from the newly established Moreton Bay penal colony. Logan had climbed Mount Barney thinking that he was on Mount Warning until he reached the summit and saw the true Mount Warning further south. Realising they were on another range they named it the McPherson Range after Major Duncan McPherson. Logan named Wilsons Peak and Mount Shadforth, which is now known as Mount Toowoonan.

The McPherson Range was the location of the 1937 Airlines of Australia Stinson crash, which went missing on a flight between Brisbane and Sydney in 1937. Bernard O&#x27;Reilly, a local farmer, trekked through thick forests and rugged terrain to discover the wreck and two emaciated, badly injured survivors, nine days after the crash.

==Flora and fauna==
The sub-tropical rainforest on the range has never been damaged by severe bushfires (until the fires of 2019)and contains more than 20 species of rock and tree orchids.

The stream lily is a perennial plant found along creeks and gullies of the range. The extinct fern species &quot;Antrophyum austroqueenslandicum&quot; may still exist in unsurveyed parts of the range.

The unique Lamington spiny crayfish colours has evolved with white in New South Wales valleys and blue crayfish in Queensland&#x27;s section of the range.

The rainforests contain important populations of the endangered rufous scrub-bird, and the vulnerable Albert&#x27;s lyrebird, both of which are confined to south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales.

<text>Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari (4 July 1841 – 3 September 1879) was a British soldier and military administrator.

Cavagnari was the son of Count Louis Adolphus Cavagnari, of an old family from Parma in the service of the Bonaparte family, by his marriage in 1837 with an Anglo-Irish woman, Caroline Lyons-Montgomery. Cavagnari was born at Stenay, in the Meuse département, France, on 4 July 1841. He was killed on 3 September 1879 during the siege of the British Residency (then at Bala Hissar) in Kabul in Afghanistan.

He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school, starting at the age of 10 years. He had obtained naturalization as a British subject, and entered the military service of the East India Company. After passing through college at the Addiscombe Military Seminary, he served through the Oudh campaign against the mutineers in 1858 and 1859. In 1861 he was appointed an assistant commissioner in the Punjab region of British India, and in 1877 became deputy commissioner of Peshawar (now in Pakistan) and took part in several expeditions against the Pashtun tribes.

In September 1878 he was attached to the staff of a British mission to Kabul, Afghanistan, which the Afghans refused to allow to proceed through the Khyber Pass. In May 1879, after the British-Indian forces had invaded Afghanistan, and the death of Afghan Emir Sher Ali Khan, Cavagnari negotiated and signed the Treaty of Gandamak with Sher Ali Khan&#x27;s son and successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan. With this treaty, the Afghans agreed to admit a British representative to Kabul, and the post was conferred on Cavagnari, who also received the Star of India and was made a KCB. He took up his residence in July 1879. On 3 September 1879, Cavagnari and the other European members of the mission, along with their guards who were made up of The Guides, were killed after he refused the demands of mutinous Afghan troops. Cavagnari was survived by his wife, Lady Cavagnari (&quot;née&quot; Mercy Emma Graves), whom he had married in 1871.

<doc id="944524" wikidata="Q1506714" url="?curid=944524" title="Patricio Montojo y Pasarón">
<text>Patricio Montojo y Pasarón (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was a Spanish Navy officer who commanded Spain&#x27;s Pacific Squadron based in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. Considered a man of high ability and experience, he was given the difficult task of defending the Spanish Philippines with a small navy and low supplies against a larger U.S. Asiatic Squadron. Despite his valor and determination, Montojo&#x27;s navy was defeated at the decisive Battle of Manila Bay by a United States Navy squadron under Commodore George Dewey. He was later held accountable for the defeat and was court-martialed in Spain. Although the decision was later overturned, Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.

==Early life and career==
Born in Ferrol, Galicia, Montojo studied at the Naval School in the southern Spanish city of Cádiz and was assigned as a midshipman in 1855. By 1860, he had become a sublieutenant and fought against the Moros of Mindanao in the Philippines before he returned to Spain in 1864. During his stay in the Philippines, the Spanish officer visited China and the French colony in southern Vietnam.

Montojo fought in the Battle of Abtao and the Battle of El Callao under Admiral Casto Méndez Núñez against Peru and assumed a post at the Secretariat of the Admiralty. He was promoted to the rank of Commander in 1873. His new duties included commanding several warships at the Havana naval station as well as those in the Río de la Plata. Montojo remained in Madrid until November 1891, when he was promoted to flag officer. In 1892, he became a candidate for the Order of Isabella the Catholic, and in 1897, he received the Military Order of María Cristina.

==Service in the Philippines==

By 1898, Montojo returned to the Philippines as rear admiral, serving as general commander of all Spanish Philippine naval stations and taking part in operations against Filipino insurgents. At a meeting with the colony&#x27;s captain general, Basilio Augustín, on March 15, 1898, he expressed his concerns that their forces would be destroyed by the Americans in battle because of their disadvantages, as it became apparent that war with the United States was increasingly likely. Of the 37 ships in the Spanish naval fleet stationed in the Philippines, most were small gunboats and so there were only seven ships that would be used to take on the U.S. Asiatic Squadron. In addition, there were other problems facing the Spaniards. Their force did not possess enough adequate mines, and some of the ones they had lacked components. The admiral requested additional supplies from the homeland, but they were ultimately not delivered. In the end, Montojo decided to send the squadron to Subic Bay to the northwest of Manila, which would be easier to defend for the Spaniards when the American ships arrived. If they ignored them and headed for Manila, he believed his squadron could then head back and ambush the U.S. squadron at night.

However, when the Americans had arrived and checked at Subic on April 30, they found no Spanish ships there because Montojo had judged the position to be indefensible since the Spaniards, being behind schedule, had not finished installing the naval guns on the ground at the entrance to Subic Bay. However, according to American scouts, the guns were lying on the beach and could have been mounted in less than 24 hours. In addition, the wooden cruiser had technical problems. Thus, a council of squadron captains decided to return to Manila Bay. Reportedly, another factor in Montojo&#x27;s decision was that he would not be able to save Spanish sailors in the depth of forty meters of water at Subic, which American naval officers found to be astounding. Thus, the American squadron leader, Admiral George Dewey and his other officers initially had a low opinion of the Spanish commander&#x27;s abilities.
The American ships passed into Manila Bay without striking the few mines that the Spaniards had emplaced (the water was too deep and the waterway was too wide for them to be of much use), and aside from artillery fire from the guns on Corregidor island, they met little resistance. They entered the bay without loss. Meanwhile, the Spanish ships were anchored at the naval arsenal near Cavite, where Montojo, who was pessimistic on the battle, believed his men would have the best chance of survival. The engagement that followed between the Spanish squadron and the Americans became the first major naval battle that Montojo had fought in for over 30 years. The US squadron arrived near Cavite and engaged the Spanish on May 1, 1898, around 5:00 in the morning. By 5:40, despite fire from the shore artillery and Montojo&#x27;s squadron, none of the US ships had been damaged. The American squadron returned fire and Montojo&#x27;s flagship, the cruiser , sustained heavy damage along with the rest of the Spanish ships, forcing him to move his flag to the . The captain of a British steamer that was then passing noted, &quot;[Montojo] stood upright in the stern perfectly unmoved, although splashes of water flew repeatedly over the little craft... it was an example of unparalleled heroism.&quot;

By 7:30 in the morning, the Asiatic Squadron withdrew to restock its ammunition and provide rest for the crew. The only American casualties had been eight wounded aboard the USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; and one death on the . After about three-and-a-half hours, at around 11:15 a.m., the American ships returned to face the Spaniards again. However, by then much of the Spanish squadron was destroyed and resistance was limited, and not long afterwards, the Spaniards surrendered. Montojo reported around 381 casualties for his squadron in total, and among the wounded was one of his two sons.

==Later life==

After the defeat at Manila Bay, &quot;Contraalmirante&quot;, Montojo was recalled to Madrid to be held as a scapegoat for the loss by the court-martial despite the circumstances that led to the defeat. He left Manila in October and arrived in November 1898. By decree of the court-martial, he was imprisoned in March 1899, but was later released. Among the testimony was Admiral George Dewey, to whom Montojo had sent a letter asking for assistance, and the American officer replied, &quot;Although without accurate knowledge as to the condition of your ships, I have no hesitation in saying to you what I have already had the honor to report to my government, that your defense at Cavite was gallant in the extreme. The fighting of your flagship, which was singled out for attack, was especially worthy of a place in the traditions of valor of your nation.&quot; Montojo was later absolved of the charges but was still discharged from the Spanish Navy. In June 2017, a screenplay was written based on Montojo&#x27;s court-martial and Admiral Dewey assisting him in March 1899.

He died in Madrid on September 30, 1917.

==Personal life==
Montojo wrote a number of literary works and articles for various publications. Among those was &quot;León Aldao&quot;, &quot;A Critical Essay on the First Lands Discovered by Columbus&quot;, &quot;Encyclopedic Nautical Handbook&quot;, and translations of Angelo Secchi&#x27;s book on physics and &quot;The Two Admirals&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper.

One of his nieces was Fermina Montojo Torrontegui, second wife of Enrique Zóbel de Ayala (born 1877), of the billionaire Zobel de Ayala family, original owners of Sotogrande. Her son and his grandson Fernando Zobel de Ayala y Montojo is the famous modern Filipino-Spanish painter.

<text>Salisbury Sound is a sound between the north shore of Kruzof Island and the southwestern end of Chichagof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. It is about 40 km (25 mi) northwest of the city of Sitka, and within the limits of Sitka City and Borough.

Salisbury Sound was named by Captain Nathaniel Portlock in 1787, in honor of Bishop Salisbury, even though Portlock did not ever see the sound itself. It was also named Puerto de los Remedios by Francisco Antonio Maurelle in 1775, Bay of Islands by Captain James Cook on 2 May 1778, Zund Klokacheva by navigator Ivan Vasiliev in 1809, and Protiv Olgi by Captain Tebenkov.

Salisbury Sound is the namesake of the seaplane tender USS &quot;Salisbury Sound&quot;.

The town is located on the south shore of Great Slave Lake at the mouth of the Hay River. It is separated into two sections: A new town and an old town. The Hay River/Merlyn Carter Airport is located between the two sections. The town is situated in the South Slave RegionSouth Slave, and along with Fort Smith, the town is home to one of the two regional offices in the region.

==History==

The area has been in use by First Nations, known as the Long Spear people, as far back as 7000 BC.

According to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories the first buildings were those of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1868 followed by a Roman Catholic Mission in 1869 and an Anglican Mission in 1894.

However, according to the history of the area provided by the town, the first permanent settlement in the area of Hay River was established in what is now the Katl&#x27;odeeche First Nation or Hay River Reserve. This was sometime between 1892 and 1893. This first settlement was established by Chief Chiatlo and a group of people by the building of log cabins and bringing dairy cows. This was followed in 1893 by the Anglican Mission, at the request of Chief Chiatlo in 1893 with the Roman Catholic Mission and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company arriving later.

A school, health centre and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police followed, and as part of the Canol Road project the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a runway on Vale Island in the Hay River delta. In 1948 the Government of Canada built a gravel road, now the Mackenzie Highway, from Grimshaw, Alberta to Hay River, making it the first community in the NWT to be linked with southern Canada. The settlement&#x27;s role as terminus of all-season trucking, and the establishment of a commercial fishing industry, started an economic boom. In 1949, the community organized its first community government, forming an Administrative District under the direction of the Government of Canada, run by a trustee board with two elected members, two appointed members, and a chairman.

In 1959, the Northern Transportation Company Limited located their main base in Hay River and over the years developed the facilities. Today the base is the major staging point for the annual sealift along the Mackenzie River, via Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk and the communities of the Arctic Ocean, as far east as Taloyoak, Nunavut and west to Utqiagvik, Alaska.

In 1964, Vale Island, the historical location of the town, was severely flooded. As a response, the town was moved to the new location upstream.

By 1964, as part of the Pine Point Mine development, the Mackenzie Northern Railway was constructed. The railway, through Canadian National Railway in Edmonton, makes Hay River the northernmost point in Canada, and all of North America, which is connected to the continental railway system. The Alaska Railroad is located farther north but is orphaned from the network.

In 1978, Hay River, along with the now-abandoned Pine Point, hosted the fifth Arctic Winter Games.

In 2022, the town suffered flooding caused by ice breakup on the Hay River, resulting in an evacuation order for the entire community. Ice jams built up in two channels, and combined with a wide-ranging storm system, and already waterlogged ground resulted in a larger than normal flood. Hay River also flooded in 1963, 2008, 2009, and 2020.

On 25 August 2023 the entire town population was ordered to evacuate by the government of the Northwest Territories due to the 2023 Canadian wildfires.

==Services==
The community has a full hospital, the H.H. Williams Memorial Hospital, a woman&#x27;s shelter/transition house, a dental clinic and an ambulance service. The RCMP detachment has eight members and the South Mackenzie Correctional Centre is located here. There are two grocery stores in Hay River, including the Northern Store, branches of both the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Royal Bank of Canada and a Home Hardware. There is also a museum detailing the history of Hay River and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Old Town.

Airlines servicing Hay River include the locally based Buffalo Airways, who provide scheduled flights to Yellowknife as well as charter services and a courier service throughout the north. First Air provides scheduled services to Yellowknife with connections elsewhere. Northwestern Air also offers scheduled service to Edmonton and Fort Smith. Other companies offering charter services in Hay River include Landa Aviation, Carter Air Services (fixed-wing aircraft), Denendeh Helicopters and Remote Helicopters.

Religious services include a Catholic church, an Anglican/Grace United church, a Baptist church, a Pentecostal church, and a Community Fellowship within New Town. There is also a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall along the highway coming into town. On the Katl&#x27;odeeche First Nations Reserve there are a small Catholic church, and a larger Pentecostal church. There is also an Anglican church that was destroyed in the 2008 Hay River ice breakup. The religious diversity in Hay River exceeds the outward appearance given by these services.

==Education==

The town hosts four schools, three of which are administered by South Slave Divisional Education Council (SSDEC). The SSDEC is responsible for Harry Camsell K-3 School, Princess Alexandra Middle School, and Diamond Jenness Secondary School, while École Boréale Francophone school is administered separately by the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest. Harry Camsell is a primary school and serves students from kindergarten to Grade 3. Princess Alexandra, named for and opened by Princess Alexandra in 1967, is a middle school and serves the Grade 4 to the Grade 7. École Boréale is a francophone school that was opened in 2005 and works with students from PK4 to grade 12.

The town also supports a Community Learning Centre and a Career Centre.

<text>Betty Madigan (born 1928) is an American former traditional popular singer and actress.

Born in Washington, D.C., Madigan attended Catholic University.

==Career==
In 1954, Madigan was rated &quot;the newer female vocalist [with] the greatest chance to become one of the top female vocalist names&quot; in a poll of disc jockeys conducted by &quot;Billboard&quot;. That year, she appeared on &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;, &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot;, and &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. In 1956, she portrayed Martha Cratchitt in a 1956 episode of &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; called &quot;The Stingiest Man in Town,&quot; a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; A Christmas Carol. Madigan performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1957, and on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot; on 1958.

A description of Madigan in a 1959 issue of &quot;Gramophone&quot; said that she sounds like Alma Cogan and also resembles her.

In November 2018, Jasmine Records released a two-CD compilation of her singles recorded between 1953 and 1961, totaling 58 songs. Sepia Records also released a CD containing two of her albums, &quot;Am I Blue?&quot; and &quot;The Jerome Kern Songbook&quot;

<doc id="944549" wikidata="Q6869209" url="?curid=944549" title="Minor v. Happersett">
<text>Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162 (1875), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that citizenship does not confer a right to vote, and therefore state laws barring women from voting are constitutionally valid. The Supreme Court upheld state court decisions in Missouri, which had refused to register a woman as a lawful voter because that state&#x27;s laws allowed only men to vote.

The &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; ruling was based on an interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court readily accepted that Minor was a citizen of the United States, but it held that the constitutionally protected privileges of citizenship did not include the right to vote.

The opinion concluded with the statement that &quot;...the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone&quot;. This was clarified in &quot;Ex parte Yarbrough&quot; 110 U.S. 651 (1884) stating that &quot;the Constitution adopts as the qualification for voters of members of Congress that which prevails in the State where the voting is to be done; therefore... the right is not definitely conferred on any person or class of persons by the Constitution alone, because you have to look to the law of the State for the description of the class. But the court did not intend to say that when the class or the person is thus ascertained, his right to vote for a member of Congress was not fundamentally based upon the Constitution&quot;.

The Nineteenth Amendment, which became a part of the Constitution in 1920, superseded &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; with respect to women&#x27;s suffrage. &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; continued to be cited in support of restrictive election laws of other types until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court started interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause to prohibit discrimination among citizenry in voting rights.

== Background ==
Virginia Minor, a leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Missouri, attempted to register to vote on October 15, 1872, in St. Louis County, Missouri, but was refused on the grounds that she was a woman. With the assistance of her husband, Francis Minor (a lawyer), she brought an action in state courts against Reese Happersett, the registrar who had rejected her application to register to vote, alleging that the provisions of the Missouri state constitution which allowed only men to vote were in violation of the United States Constitution, and specifically the Fourteenth Amendment. The key to the Minors&#x27; argument was that citizenship entailed voting rights—an assertion with enough rhetoric on both sides to make it an open question.
The Missouri Supreme Court ruled in favor of the registrar and against Minor. The state court observed that the &quot;almost universal practice of all of the States ... from the adoption of the Constitution to the present time&quot; was to restrict voting rights to men only; and, additionally, that the clear intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to give the rights of citizenship to the former slaves, and not to force other changes in state laws. The court noted, in particular, that the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment (penalizing states which denied the right to vote to any of its citizens) referred specifically to male citizens, and concluded that &quot;this clearly recognizes the right, and seems to anticipate the exercise of the right, on the part of the States to restrict the right of suffrage to the male inhabitants.&quot;

Minor appealed the Missouri ruling to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the same arguments before the Supreme Court as had been unsuccessfully put forth before the state court, and additionally proposing that women&#x27;s suffrage was consistent with the original intent of the framers of the Constitution. The Supreme Court observed that the sole point at issue was whether the Constitution entitled women to vote despite state laws limiting this right to men only. The State of Missouri did not send counsel to defend its decision before the Supreme Court, choosing instead to justify its decision in a three-sentence demurrer.

The case was argued on February 9, 1875 and decided March 29, 1875.

== Opinion of the Court ==

The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Missouri voting legislation, saying that voting was not an inherent right of citizenship, that the Constitution neither granted nor forbade voting rights for women, and that allowing only male citizens to vote was not an infringement of Minor&#x27;s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The opinion (written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite) first asked whether Minor was a citizen of the United States, and answered that she was, citing both the Fourteenth Amendment and earlier common law. Exploring the common-law origins of citizenship, the court observed that &quot;new citizens may be born or they may be created by naturalization&quot; and that the Constitution &quot;does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens.&quot; Under the common law, according to the court, &quot;it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners.&quot; The court observed that some authorities &quot;include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents&quot;—but since Minor was born in the United States and her parents were U.S. citizens, she was unquestionably a citizen herself, even under the narrowest possible definition, and the court thus noted that the subject did not need to be explored in any greater depth.

The court then asked whether the right to vote was one of the &quot;privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States&quot; at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s adoption in 1868. Citing a variety of historical sources, it found that it was not. The court reasoned that the Constitution of the United States did not explicitly give citizens an affirmative right to vote and that, throughout the history of the nation from the adoption of the Constitution, a wide variety of persons—including women—were recognized as citizens but denied the right to vote. For example, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, none of the original Thirteen Colonies gave all citizens the right to vote, all attaching restrictions based on factors such as sex, race, age, and ownership of land. The opinion continues that &quot;it cannot for a moment be doubted that if it had been intended to make all citizens of the United States voters, the framers of the Constitution would not have left it to implication. So important a change in the condition of citizenship as it actually existed, if intended, would have been expressly declared.&quot;

==Subsequent history==
The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1920, prohibited sex-based denial or abridgment of any United States citizen&#x27;s right to vote—thus effectively overruling the key holding in &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot;. In some later voting rights cases, however, &quot;Minor&quot; was cited in opposition to the claim that the federal Constitution conferred a general right to vote, and in support of restrictive election laws involving poll taxes, literacy tests, and the role of political parties in special elections.

In the 1960s, the Supreme Court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissenting opinion in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964) involving reapportionment in the Alabama state legislature, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II included &quot;Minor&quot; in a list of past decisions about voting and apportionment which were no longer being followed. However, the majority opinion in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; does not mention or cite &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot;, and instead cites &quot;Ex parte Yarbrough&quot; in concluding that the federal constitution does protect the right of qualified citizens to vote in federal and state elections.

<text>Murwillumbah ( ) is a town in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, in the Tweed Shire, on the Tweed River. Sitting on the south eastern foothills of the McPherson Range in the Tweed Volcano valley, Murwillumbah is 848 km north-east of Sydney, 13 km south of the Queensland border and 132 km south of Brisbane.

The town&#x27;s name is often abbreviated to M&#x27;bah or Murbah. At the 2021 census, Murwillumbah had a population of 9,812. Many of the buildings are Art Deco in style and there are cafes, clothes shops and antique shops in the town.

==History==

The first people to live in the area were Kalibai people. The name Murwillumbah may derive from an Aboriginal compound meaning either &quot;camping place&quot; – from &quot;murrie&quot;, meaning &quot;aboriginal people&quot;, &quot;wolli&quot;, &quot;a camp&quot;, and &quot;bah&quot;, &quot;place&quot; – or alternatively from &quot;murra&quot;, &quot;big&quot;, &quot;willum&quot;, &quot;possum&quot;, and &quot;bah&quot;. Nearby Mount Warning and its attendant national park are known as Wollumbin, meaning &quot;Cloud Catcher&quot;, in the Bundjalung language.

Timber-getters were drawn to the region in the 1840s. The river port at Tumbulgum was initially the main settlement. In 1902, a local government municipality was declared with Murwillumbah as its centre.

Most of the town&#x27;s business district was destroyed by fire in 1907.

In 1918 an initial 18 allotments were advertised for sale in the Hartigan Estate and a subsequent 200 allotments were advertised for sale in September 1920. The land was bounded by the Tweed River and Commercial Road on the east, Condong Street on the north, Riverview Street on the west and Elizabeth Street to the south. The subdivision was sold as part of the estate of Denis Hartigan. In December 1923, &quot;Bray Estate&quot; made up of 9 farm and farmlet blocks was advertised to be auctioned by A. E. Budd &amp; Son.

Murwillumbah was the location of Australia&#x27;s largest bank robbery, when A$1.7 million in cash was stolen from the vault of the Bank of New South Wales by the &#x27;Magnetic drill gang&#x27; in 1978. The case remains unsolved.

In November 2023, fire ants were discovered at Murwillumbah, the first time the species has been found outside of South East Queensland since the outbreak began in 2001.

===Floods===
Murwillumbah is protected by a series of levees, but they do not protect all parts of the town in major floods. The worst inundation, exceeding those of 1954, 1956, 1974, 2008 and 2009, started on 30 March 2017. The Tweed River reached after rainfall of over from the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Debbie fell in its upper catchment over a 36-hour period. There was extensive and severe flooding, with mass evacuations from South Murwillumbah and other low-lying areas, and road access cut from both north and south. It fell just short of overtopping the levees protecting the central business district.

The March 1974 flood caused two hundred people to be evacuated from the town after floodwater from Tropical Cyclone Zoe inundated the area. In January 2008, Murwillumbah and its surrounding areas were hit by severe flooding, while May 2009 saw more evacuations in the town and surrounds after very heavy rainfall. Major flooding also occurred in 2022. The 2022 floods were the worst seen on record. Even worse than 2017, much of Murwillumbah was inundated.

== Heritage listings ==
Murwillumbah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Casino-Murwillumbah railway, South Murwillumbah: Murwillumbah railway station. This station now serves as the start of Section 1 of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail.

==Transport==

The Pacific Highway passed through South Murwillumbah, but the town was completely bypassed when the 27 kilometre dual carriageway Yelgun to Chinderah upgrade was opened in August 2002. The pre-existing highway, now significantly quieter, was renamed The Tweed Valley Way, and is the main means of access to Murwillumbah from both north and south.

A road leading north west, a scenic tourist drive, heads along the Numinbah Valley through the towns of Chillingham, Numinbah and Natural Bridge. A road south west of the town heads to Kyogle via the town of Uki, passing near to Nimbin en route.

Murwillumbah railway station was the terminus of the Casino–Murwillumbah branch line, and had daily services to Sydney until the line closed in 2004. Today NSW TrainLink coaches to and from Casino provide connections to Sydney, while the station itself is used as a tourist information centre.

Several bus services serve the area. Murwillumbah Bus Company offers regular services to major parts of the town, as well as Condong and Uki. Parson&#x27;s Bus Service links passengers with Pottsville, Cabarita Beach, and Stokers Siding. Gosel&#x27;s Bus Service offers services to Nimbin via Uki. Singh&#x27;s Bus Service links the town to Chillingham, Tyalgum and Eungella. Kinetic Group operate hourly service to Tweed Heads via Terranora.

Murwillumbah&#x27;s airfield, Whittle Field (ICAO code YMUR), is named after a noted local World War II Spitfire pilot, the late Bob Whittle. There are no scheduled flights, but its 800-metre grass runway supports Murwillumbah Aero Club and business activities including crop-dusting, aircraft restoration, training and scenic charter flights.

==Industry==

Aside from tourism, the major industry of the area, is sugarcane growing. The sugar mill at nearby Condong was served by numerous tramways until 1973 saw the introduction of mechanical cane harvesting. There is also some dairy farming in the area. Coffee, bananas and assorted tropical fruit and vegetables are also produced throughout the area. South Murwillumbah is home to Stone &amp; Wood Brewing Co.&#x27;s second brewery, which opened in 2014.

There are alternative lifestyle retreats nearby, including one of the Hare Krishna organisation.

==Festivals==
The annual Tweed Banana Festival, the second oldest festival in Australia is staged in the town. In 2005, the festival celebrated its 50th anniversary.

From 2002 to 2009 an historic motor racing festival was run through the streets of Murwillimbah, featuring a parade through town, a one kilometre hillclimb course, and connected events, attracting thousands of spectators. Modeled on the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Speed on Tweed was a highlight of the local calendar attracting cars and competitors from all over Australia and from Europe and North America. In September 2009 the event was held in conjunction with Rally Australia which has scheduled one special stage in Murwillumbah.

<text>The Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWOT-SM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was created through Executive Order 13289 on 12 March 2003, by President George W. Bush. The medal recognizes those military service members who have supported operations to counter terrorism in the War on Terror from 11 September 2001, to a date yet to be determined.

From its creation in March 2003 through September 2022, the GWOT-SM was a quasi-automatically awarded medal similar to the National Defense Service Medal (NDSM). The GWOT-SM was awarded for the broadly defined criterion of &quot;support duty&quot; to most servicemembers after thirty days of post-entry training active service up until around January to February 2015. After that point, it was no longer awarded for just completing basic training and required specific participation in designated operations in support of the Global War on Terrorism. However, effective September 11, 2022, the GWOT-SM is now awarded to servicemembers only serving in the area of effect for approved campaigns related to the Global War on Terrorism.

==Background==
In September 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense sent a request to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry to provide a design for a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. In January 2003, a design was completed, which was then approved and made official in March 2003.

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal will cease being awarded when , &quot;Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks&quot;, delivered on 14 September 2001, is terminated by the U.S. government. It was most recently extended in 2022 until 2023.

==Operations==
The following are the approved operations for the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal:

Note: Enduring Freedom name is still in operational use today for deployments to the Middle East, OEF encompasses Operation JUNIPER SHIELD, OCTAVE SHIELD and SPARTAN SHIELD.
The Coast Guard awards the medal for different operations (qv).

==Criteria==
To receive the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, a military service member must have served on active duty during a designated anti-terrorism operation for a minimum 30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days. For those who were engaged in combat, killed, or wounded in the line of duty the time requirement is waived. By July 2022, the Department of Defense updated the criteria to remove this requirement, and instead awarding it to servicemembers who were deployed to approved campaigns or within 12-miles of a country&#x27;s shoreline where an ongoing campaign is being undertaken.

The initial authorized operation for the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal was the so-called &quot;Airport Security Operation&quot; which occurred between 27 September 2001 and 31 May 2002. Additional operations, for which the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal is authorized, include the active military campaigns of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Future operations are at the discretion of United States component commanders upon approval from the United States Department of Defense.

===Support duty===
In 2004, Defense Department and military service branches began publishing directives, messages, and orders, specifying that the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal would be awarded not only for direct participation in specific operations, but also to any personnel who performed support duty of an anti-terrorism operation but did not directly participate. The phrase &quot;support&quot; was further defined as any administrative, logistics, planning, operational, technical, or readiness activity, which provides support to an operation of the Global War on Terrorism. As a result of this blanket term, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal became an eligible award for most personnel of the United States Armed Forces who performed service after 11 September 2001 through March 2004.

With the orders granting the GWOT-SM for broadly-defined &quot;support duty&quot;, awarding of the medal has essentially become practically automatic, akin to being a similar type of award as the National Defense Service Medal (graduates of training schools, ROTC, and service academies are typically presented both awards at the same time). The primary difference between the NDSM and the GWOT-SM is that the NDSM is automatic as soon as a person joins the military whereas the GWOTSM may only be presented after thirty days of active duty in a unit (or three months in the case of the Reserve Component). The regulations for Reservists and National Guardsmen are also not as well defined for the GWOT-SM as they are for the NDSM, since the presentation of the NDSM to reservists and National Guardsmen was codified and clarified as far back as the Persian Gulf War. Widely called the &quot;support&quot; loophole, the Department of Defense rescinded this eligibility requirement.

===Army===
The U.S. Army&#x27;s regulations state that all soldiers &quot;on active duty, including Reserve Component Soldiers mobilized, or Army National Guard Soldiers activated on or after 11 September 2001 to a date to be determined having served 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days are authorized the GWOTSM.&quot;
The GWOT-SM was awarded automatically to all service members on Active Duty between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2004. While the award is no longer automatic, the termination &quot;date to be determined&quot; has not been set. The Battalion Commander is the approval authority for the GWOT-SM. Service members are still eligible for the medal provided they meet the criteria in AR 600-8-22.

U.S. Army soldiers serving on active duty primarily in a training status (basic training, advanced individual training, officer training courses, etc...) are not authorized award of the GWOT-SM for the active duty time they are in training. The criteria for the awards specifically states that a Soldier has to serve on active duty in support of a designated GWOT operation (Operation Noble Eagle [ONE], Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF], Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF], Operation New Dawn [OND], Operation Inherent Resolve [OIR], and Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel [OFS]) for 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days. Army soldiers in a training status are not considered to be supporting these designated operations.

===Navy, Marine Corps, and Military Sealift Command===
Regulations for rating the GWOT-SM are the same in the Navy, the Marine Corps, and Military Sealift Command for those who serve on both active duty, reserve duty, and support. Essentially, 30 days of consecutive duty or 60 days of non-consecutive duty in support of approved organizations. Eligibility begins when they reach their first permanent duty station. Civilian Mariners (CIVMARs) attached to Military Sealift Command&#x27;s supply ships may be eligible for the Global War on Terrorism Civilian Service Medal. Beginning 11 September 2022, the Marine Corps will be limiting the award of the GWOT-SM to &quot;service members who directly serve in a designated military counter-terrorism (CT) operation (e.g., deployed on orders for a designated CT operation; directly supported a designated CT operation on a full-time basis while assigned to an organization conducting such a CT operation) for a minimum of 30 days (consecutive or non-consecutive).&quot;

===Air Force===
Air Force service members were first awarded the GWOT-SM for conducting airport security operations in the fall and winter of 2001. It was subsequently awarded for participation or support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Members must be assigned, attached or mobilized to a unit participating in or serving in support of these designated operations for thirty consecutive days or sixty nonconsecutive days. Personnel who are not deployed may be eligible for service in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Examples of these duties are maintaining and loading weapons systems for combat missions, securing installations against terrorism, augmenting command posts or crisis action teams, and processing personnel for deployment.

===Coast Guard===
Coast Guard regulations concerning the award of the GWOT-SM, &quot;From 11 September 2001 to 30 January 2005&quot;: Awarded to all Coast Guard active duty and reserve members on active duty during the eligibility period. To qualify, members must have served on active duty for a period of not less than 30 consecutive days or 60 non-consecutive days following initial accession point training. Service while assigned to training duty as a student, cadet, officer candidate, and duty under instruction (DUINS), does not count toward eligibility. This includes both training and summer cruises for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and Officer Candidate School. For reservists, &quot;active duty&quot; includes ADT and IDT service in an operational vice classroom setting.

From 31 January 2005 to a date to be determined: Eligible service members must be or have been assigned, attached, or mobilized to a unit participating in or serving in direct support of specified Global War on Terrorism operations (e.g., NOBLE EAGLE, LIBERTY SHIELD, NEPTUNE SHIELD, PORT SHIELD, ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, or Area Commander-designated GWOT operations) for 30 consecutive or 60 cumulative days, or meet one of the following criteria:
(a) Be engaged in actual combat regardless of time served in the operation; or
(b) While participating in the operation, regardless of time, be killed, wounded, or injured requiring medical evacuation.&quot;

==Appearance==
The medal is a bronze color metal disc 1.25 inches in diameter. The obverse depicts an eagle with spread wings. On the breast of the eagle is a shield of thirteen vertical bars. In the eagle&#x27;s right claw is an olive branch and in the left claw are three arrows. The eagle is surmounted by a terrestrial globe with the inscription above &quot;WAR ON TERRORISM SERVICE MEDAL.&quot; On the reverse is a laurel wreath on a plain field. The medal is suspended from an Old Glory Blue ribbon 1.375 inches wide with stripes of golden yellow, scarlet and white.

==Devices==
Only one award of this medal may be authorized for any individual, thus no bronze or silver inch service stars are prescribed for second or subsequent awards.

;Battle stars
Although qualifying circumstances would be extremely rare, bronze inch battle stars were applicable for personnel who were engaged in actual combat against the enemy involving grave danger of death or serious bodily injury. Only a Combatant Command could initiate a request for a GWOT-SM (or Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal) battle star. This request would have contained the specific unit(s) or individual(s) engaged in actual combat, the duration for which combat was sustained, and a detailed description of the actions against the enemy. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was the approving authority for the specific battle stars.

To date there have been no battle stars authorized for the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. The Military Decorations and Awards Review Results released in January 2016 resolved to &quot;eliminate authority for battle stars&quot; in regard to the GWOT-SM.

<doc id="944577" wikidata="Q338363" url="?curid=944577" title="Thom Hartmann">
<text>Thomas Carl Hartmann (born May 7, 1951) is an American radio personality, author, businessman, and progressive political commentator. Hartmann has been hosting a nationally syndicated radio show, &quot;The Thom Hartmann Program&quot;, since 2003 and hosted a nightly television show, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, between 2010 and 2017.

==Early life==
Hartmann was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, one of four children of Jean and Carl Thomas Hartmann. His paternal grandparents were from Norway, and his other ancestry includes Welsh and English. He lived in Detroit at age two, and later grew up in Lansing, Michigan. Interested in politics from a young age, he was raised in a conservative, right-wing, Midwestern household. He campaigned with his staunch-Republican father for Barry Goldwater during the 1964 presidential election when he was thirteen. Hartmann was expelled from high school during tenth grade for starting a newspaper that protested against the Vietnam War. He later earned a GED.

Hartmann enrolled at Lansing Community College and transferred to Michigan State University, majoring in electrical engineering. In 1968, Hartmann opened his first business, a repair shop named &quot;The Electronics Joint&quot; located next to Michigan State University and became a part-time disc jockey at local country music station WITL-FM. With Students for a Democratic Society, Hartmann protested against the Vietnam War. Hartmann had been interested in consciousness and spirituality since childhood, and by 1969 his interest evolved from hippie subculture to Christian mysticism. During that year, he met the head of the Coptic Center, Kurt Stanley, called Master Stanley. In this case, &quot;Coptic&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Center Of Personal Transformation In Consciousness&quot; and has no relation the Coptic Orthodox Church. In 1971 Hartmann was ordained as a Minister with Coptic Fellowship International. He has since been a keynote speaker at many Coptic Conferences nationally. In 1973, Hartmann returned to Detroit to work as an engineer with RCA.

== Business career ==
Hartmann began his business career in the early 1970s while in his 20s, co-founding The Woodley Herber Company. Woodley Herber sold herbal products, potpourris and teas, and operated until 1978. During this time, Hartmann obtained degrees in herbology and homeopathic medicine. Hartmann moved to New Hampshire to start The New England Salem Children&#x27;s Village, which currently operates in Rumney, New Hampshire. He was its Executive Director for five years and served on the board of directors for more than 25 years. The childcare&#x27;s model was based on the German Salem International organization, and through his affiliation with that group, he helped start international relief programs internationally.

Hartmann founded International Wholesale Travel and its retail subsidiary Sprayberry Travel in Atlanta in 1983, a business which in the intervening years generated over a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue. According to their website, Sprayberry Travel was lauded by the Wall Street Journal in 1984 as one of the early adopters of frequent travel programs analogous to the recent frequent flyer programs of the airline industry. He sold his share in the business in 1986, and retired with his family to Germany to work with the international relief organization Salem International. In the late 1970s, he was a trainer in advertising and marketing for The American Marketing Centers (now defunct), and in 1987, after returning from Germany, founded the Atlanta advertising agency Chandler, MacDonald, Stout, Schneiderman &amp; Poe, Inc., doing business as The Newsletter Factory. He sold his interest in that company in 1996, and re-retired to Vermont.

== Talk radio career ==

Having worked as a DJ and news director at Lansing radio stations from 1968 to 1978, Hartmann started a radio show in February 2003 on a local station in Vermont; a month later it was picked up on the I.E. America Radio Network and on Sirius Satellite Radio. In 2005, he moved from Vermont to Oregon and, in addition to continuing his national show, also co-hosted a local talk show in Portland, Oregon (with Carl Wolfson, the late Heidi Tauber, and later Christine Alexander) on KPOJ. The station, initially an affiliate of Air America Radio, carried the program until 2007 when the station took on a sports talk format.

Hartmann&#x27;s national program, on the air since 2003 and now in the noon to 3 pm. ET daypart, was chosen by Air America to replace Al Franken on most Air America affiliates in 2007. From 2008 to 2011, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; rated Hartmann the most popular liberal talk show host in America, rising from number 10 among all talk show hosts in 2008 to number 8 in 2011 and 2015. According to his then-syndicator Dial Global, more people listened to Hartmann&#x27;s show on more stations than any other progressive talk show in America. &quot;The Thom Hartmann Program&quot; is estimated by industry magazine &quot;Talkers&quot; to have 7 million unique listeners per week.

As of March 2016, the show was carried on 80 terrestrial radio stations in 37 states, as well as on SiriusXM Progress channel 127. A community radio station in Africa, Radio Builsa in Ghana, also broadcasts the show. Various local cable TV stations simulcast the program. In addition to Westwood One, the show is now also offered via Pacifica Audioport to non-profit stations in a non-profit compliant format and is simulcast on Dish Network channel 9415 and DirecTV channel 348 via Free Speech TV. The program also airs in London, England.

Many guests appear on the show expressing a variety of points of view on diverse social and political topics. Some guests proffer progressive views similar to Hartmann&#x27;s, but more than half are conservatives, libertarians, or Ayn Rand Institute members who espouse opposing views. Due to his eagerness to invite people who disagree with him, vigorous discussion and debate between the host and guests usually ensues; &quot;My goal in my conversations with conservatives is not to create a spectacle, and not to win the argument, not to prove that I&#x27;m the smartest guy in the room or that I&#x27;m a tough warrior and I can smack down people.&quot; For many years, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appeared every Friday for the &quot;Brunch with Bernie&quot; segment. Other regular phone-in guests include Congressmen Mark Pocan (Mid-day with Mark) and Ro Khanna, both members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Ellen Ratner of the Talk Radio News Service provides Washington commentary daily. Victoria Jones who is the White House correspondent for Talk Radio News Service appears occasionally, as does Ravi Batra, an economics professor at SMU.

Like most talk radio shows, &quot;The Thom Hartmann Program&quot; takes calls from listeners. When callers asked Hartmann how he was, he used to reply, &quot;I&#x27;m great, but I&#x27;ll get better.&quot; But after a time, callers would regularly try to elicit this response, so he&#x27;s stopped replying this way routinely. Hartmann ends each show with the phrase, &quot;Activism begins with you, democracy begins with you. Get out there, get active! Tag, you&#x27;re it!&quot;

Michael Harrison, publisher of radio industry trade magazine &quot;Talkers&quot;, offered this appraisal of Hartmann:
===TV program===
Hartmann hosted a one-hour daily TV show at 7 pm. ET Monday to Friday, &quot;The Big Picture with Thom Hartmann,&quot; which was editorially directed by his wife and was broadcast from the Washington, D.C., studios of the RT America news network. The show featured many conservative guests who routinely sparred with Hartmann. Hartmann co-produced the program with RT, who provided studio and carriage, while Hartmann retained full editorial control of his programming. The RT network aired the program via Dish Network, DirecTV, and on selected local-origination and public-access television cable TV channels globally. After hosting the program for seven years, Hartmann announced his departure as host on September 29, 2017.

== Other areas of notability ==
Hartmann has published more than twenty books on diverse topics. The title with the most critical acclaim is &quot;The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight&quot;. In 1999, he was invited by the Dalai Lama to spend a week in Dharamsala after the Dalai Lama read the book. Hartmann won the Project Censored Award in 2004 for &quot;Unequal Protection&quot;. As a result of a book on spirituality, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Way&quot;, he was invited in 1998 to meet Pope John Paul II.

Hartmann is a practitioner of the pseudo-scientific Neuro-Linguistic Programming, having been trained by Richard Bandler. Hartmann popularized some of NLP&#x27;s concepts in &quot;Cracking the Code&quot; (2007), arguing Newt Gingrich and Frank Luntz made use of them in the 1980s and 1990s for Republican Party causes, while advocating using them to advance liberalism. His book &quot;Healing ADD&quot; also utilises NLP techniques. Co-authored with Lamar Waldron, Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Sacrifice&quot; (2005) echoes the conspiracy theory that the Mafia ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent.

Hartmann was one of several contributors to &quot;Air America, the Playbook&quot;, a collection of essays, transcripts, and interviews by liberal radio personalities. It was published in 2006 and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for October 8, 2006.

Leonardo DiCaprio made a web movie titled &quot;Before The Flood&quot;, inspired by &quot;The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight&quot;. Hartmann appears in DiCaprio&#x27;s 2007 documentary &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, as well as the feature documentary film &quot;Dalai Lama Renaissance&quot; (with Harrison Ford), and &quot;Crude Impact&quot;. In 2010, Warner Brothers and Leonardo DiCaprio announced they are making a motion picture based on the book &quot;Legacy of Secrecy&quot;, authored by Lamar Waldron and Hartmann. Hartmann also narrated the 2011 documentary film &quot;&quot;

In September 2013, Hartmann was granted an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Goddard College in Port Townsend, Washington. According to President Barbara Vacarr, &quot;Thom&#x27;s work as a journalist, author, and community activist is a living example of the very mission of Goddard College, and what our students are committed to—advancing cultures of rigorous inquiry, collaboration, and lifelong-learning, where individuals take imaginative and responsible action.&quot;

Hartmann served on the board of Voqal, a collaboration of EBS licensees working to advance social equity.

== Political views ==
Hartmann is considered to have progressive/liberal politics, although he describes himself as part of the radical middle. His books include &quot;Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights&quot;, in which he argues that the 1886 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company&quot; (118 U.S. 394) did not actually grant corporate personhood, and that this doctrine derives from a mistaken interpretation of a Supreme Court clerk&#x27;s notes. Hartmann considers this a clear contradiction of the intent of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He has also written on the separation of church and state, drawing upon &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; to argue that the Founding Fathers warned against the notion of the United States being a Christian nation. He contends that the 2000 American election and 2004 American election were stolen through electronic tampering, denial of the voting franchise by rigged voting lists, and limiting availability of voting machines in selected precincts. He also accused the Bush administration of eroding democracy and individual freedoms.

Hartmann is a vocal critic of the effects of neoliberal globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises&#x27; being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States&#x27; traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival of American democracy. This argument is expressed in Hartmann&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What We Can Do About It.&quot; One of the book&#x27;s main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media&#x27;s shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, Hartmann described his political philosophy as democratic socialism:
==Personal life==
Hartmann has three children with his wife Louise. Hartmann has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager.

== Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ==

Hartmann has written about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adult attention-deficit disorder (AADD), and has proposed (in 1978, published in 1992) the hunter vs. farmer hypothesis, suggesting that ADHD is an expected evolutionary adaptation to hunting lifestyles where individuals have the ability to rapidly shift focus and external attention, while holding multiple trains of thought. This ability, Hartmann theorizes, causes difficulties for those who live and work in cultures in which &quot;farming&quot;—planned, predictable, organized, repetitive behaviors—is typical. His first book on the disorder, &quot;Attention Deficit Disorder: a Different Perception&quot; was described by &quot;Scientific American&quot; as &quot;innovative and fresh&quot;. Hartmann has established specialized schools for children with ADHD, such as The Hunter School in Rumney, New Hampshire, which he co-founded with his wife Louise.

He also operated the &quot;ADD Forum&quot; and &quot;DeskTop Publishing Forum&quot;, along with several others, on CompuServe.

<text>Maicer Eduardo Izturis (; born September 12, 1980) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. During his career he played for the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Izturis is the half brother of shortstop César Izturis and minor league shortstop Julio Izturis.

==Professional career==

===Montreal Expos===
Izturis was signed by the Cleveland Indians as a non-drafted free agent on April 1, 1998. He, and Ryan Church were traded to the Montreal Expos for Scott Stewart on January 5, 2004.

In 2004, Izturis hit .338 with three home runs and 36 RBI for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers before being promoted to the Major League level with the Montreal Expos. He registered a hit in his August 27, 2004 debut, singling off San Diego Padres right-hander Dennis Tankersley in the second inning. In 32 games with the Expos, Izturis hit .206 (22-for-107) with one home run and 14 RBI.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
On November 19, 2004, Izturis was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim along with outfielder Juan Rivera for outfielder José Guillén.

Though a shortstop by trade, Gold Glove winner Orlando Cabrera was already at shortstop on the Angels roster, relegating Izturis to the role of a utility infielder. After the placement of veteran Darin Erstad on the disabled list, the Angels moved star utilityman Chone Figgins to center field during the 2006 campaign, and Izturis emerged as the club&#x27;s starting third baseman, until the Angels signed Gary Matthews, Jr. to start in center field for the 2007 season, forcing Figgins back to third base.

In a game against the Cleveland Indians on July 17, 2006, he had a career high four hits in one game, going 4–5 with 1 RBI and 3 runs.

On January 25, 2010, the Angels signed Izturis to a three-year contract worth $10 million, avoiding arbitration. &quot;FanGraphs&quot;&#x27; Matthew Carruth called it a &quot;fantastic deal&quot; at &quot;an insanely discounted rate&quot; estimating his market value at about $20 million over three years. &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; called the deal a good &#x27;insurance policy&#x27;, adding, &quot;he&#x27;s a good enough offensive contributor to add value whatever the position among second, short, and third, and a good enough defender at any of them to be playable&quot;.

After Scot Shields&#x27; retirement following the 2010 season, as well as the trade of Juan Rivera to the Toronto Blue Jays, Izturis became the longest-tenured Angel.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

On November 8, 2012, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that they had signed the free agent Izturis to a three-year $9 million deal with a $3 million club option for 2016. His option has a $1 million buyout.

On August 1, 2013, Izturis returned to Angel Stadium of Anaheim for the first time as a visitor, and was greeted with warm cheers from the Angel fans. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 22 with a sprained left ankle. Ryan Goins was called up to replace Izturis. He was moved to the 60-day disabled list on August 24, effectively ending his first season as a Blue Jay. Izturis batted .236 in 2013 with 5 home runs and 32 RBI in 107 games.

On April 13, 2014, in the final game of a three-game series against the Baltimore Orioles, he had to be scratched from the lineup shortly before the start of the game after tripping on the dugout stairs. Izturis told the team he heard two loud pops when he tripped, and was taken for an MRI the following day. The MRI determined that he had torn his lateral collateral ligament in his left knee, and would require surgery. Izturis told reporters he would seek a second opinion before undergoing surgery, as the expected recovery time of 4–6 months would likely sideline him for the rest of the 2014 season. He was later put on the 60-day disabled list. In 11 games in 2014, Izturis batted .286 with 1 RBI.

Izturis suffered a groin strain near the end of 2015 spring training, and opened the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list. On May 1, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. Izturis began a rehab assignment with the Dunedin Blue Jays in mid-May, but was shut down on May 23 after diving to make a play and injuring his shoulder. On May 30, it was announced that he had suffered a tear in his shoulder. Izturis underwent surgery to repair the tear in his shoulder in mid-June, and missed the remainder of the 2015 season. On November 3, Izturis&#x27;s option for 2016 was declined by the Blue Jays, making him a free agent.

On January 29, 2016, Izturis signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays that included an invitation to spring training. He would have earned $900,000 for the season if added to the 40-man roster, and incentives based on plate appearances could have totaled an additional $100,000. However, on March 4, 2016, Izturis announced his retirement from baseball, stating &quot;I put my heart, my soul and my body into it this year to see how I was going to feel, but my body couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. So I decided this is the last time I&#x27;m going to be playing baseball.&quot;. His retirement left Bartolo Colón as the last active Montreal Expos player.

==Personal life==
During his career Izturis spoke to the English-speaking press through an interpreter.

In his retirement, he runs an academy in Barquisimeto, Venezuela with his half brother Cesar. His half nephew Cesar Daniel is a minor league prospect for the Seattle Mariners.

<text>Weko is a Turumbu village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located 30 km to the north of Yangambi town. The territory of Weko covers an area of about 30 000 ha. In Weko, the main livelihoods are shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing, canoe construction and gold mining. The village of Weko provides around 66% of the wildmeat biomass sold in the town of Yangambi - an equivalent of about 97.6 tons of smoked meat per year. Despite this large catch, food security is poor because most of the hunting occurs for commercial purposes, with more than 80% of the biomass being sold to the Yangambi market. The main species sold are small monkeys and red duikers, followed by blue duikers, bush pigs and brush tailed porcupines.

<doc id="944595" wikidata="Q4353743" url="?curid=944595" title="Kruzof Island">
<text>Kruzof Island () is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska. It is about west of Sitka, and is part of the City and Borough of Sitka. It was named in 1805 by Captain U.T. Lisianski as Crooze Island, after a Russian Admiral. It hosts the region&#x27;s only volcano, Mount Edgecumbe.

In 1849, Captain Tebenkov recorded the Tlingit name for the island as being Tlikh.

==Naming history==
Before being named by Lisianski, it was called San Jacinto after its highest point, Mount Edgecumbe, was named Montaña de San Jacinto by Don Juan de la Bodega y Quadra in 1775. La Pérouse referred to that name by calling the island St. Hyacinthe. Captain Nathaniel Portlock named the island Pitt Island in 1787. Early Russian traders called it Sitka Island. In 1849, Constantin Grewingk called the island Edgecumbe. It later became known as Kruzow Island before finally becoming Kruzof Island.

==Geography==
The island is long and wide with a land area of , making it the 41st largest island in the United States. The island is formed in part by Mount Edgecumbe, a small, dormant stratovolcano, and several volcanic cones and collapsed cones that make up its volcanic field.

==Human importance==
Kruzof Island does not have a permanent resident population. There is a maintained trail leading from Fred&#x27;s Creek cabin, a United States Forest Service cabin on the inside coast, to the summit of Mount Edgecumbe, as well as several trails across the island.

In January 1813, the Russian exploration ship &quot;Neva&quot; wrecked just off the island. The survivors made it to shore and established a camp where they subsisted until rescued about a month later. The site of the wreck, and also the survival camp has since been found.

Kalinin Bay, on the northern shore of the island, provided the name for the World War II United States Navy escort aircraft carrier . From the 1950s through the 1970s, forests on Kruzof Island were the source for clearcut timber extraction.

<doc id="944600" wikidata="Q211421" url="?curid=944600" title="Marcus Grönholm">
<text>Marcus Ulf Johan &quot;Bosse&quot; Grönholm (born February 5, 1968) is a Finnish former rally and rallycross driver, being part of a family of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland lineage. His son, Niclas Grönholm, is an upcoming FIA World Rallycross Championship driver. Grönholm&#x27;s nicknames are either &quot;Bosse&quot; (mainly in his native Finland and the Scandinavian countries) or &quot;Magic Marcus&quot;. Grönholm is one of the most successful WRC drivers of all time, ranking third in rally wins (30), and winning two championships, in 2000 and 2002. After Peugeot withdrew from the World Rally Championship, Grönholm moved to Ford for the 2006 season and placed second in the drivers&#x27; world championship, losing out to Sébastien Loeb by one point. The next year he again placed second, four points behind Loeb. He and his co-driver Timo Rautiainen retired from rallying after the 2007 season but returned to the championship in 2009 driving a private Subaru for a short period of time, and in the 2019 World Rally Championship where he competed in a Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT-maintained Toyota Yaris under the GRX Team banner.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Grönholm&#x27;s father, Ulf &quot;Uffe&quot; Grönholm, had been an active rally driver in the late 1970s to early 1980s, and with measurable success too, winding up twice Finnish champion. He was killed during a practice run for Hankiralli on February 25, 1981, in Kirkkonummi. Despite this connection, his son, only 13 years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death, was latterly to refute any suggestion that it was Ulf, and not fellow rally-driving cousin (and occasional Peugeot factory squad teammate at various points during the early 2000s), Sebastian Lindholm, who tempted him into following in his father&#x27;s footsteps by also participating in the sport. In his teens Grönholm was fond of motocross as a recreational activity, but a serious knee injury forced a switch to boxing.

Grönholm featured in various bit-part roles in the world series throughout the 1990s, most notably with Toyota with whom he drove Celicas and Corolla WRCs. Much considered as a late-bloomer he did not become a factory driver until his early 30s. A staggering string of fastest stage times one year as a privateer, on the final day of the Rally Finland, subsequently brought him to the attention of such factory teams as Ford, Toyota and Peugeot, who all presented him with offers for further employment. It was only when he joined the latter marque, championship newcomers for 1999, that he began to enjoy such meteoric success.

===1999–2005: Peugeot===

After suffering an engine failure on the season-opening round in Monte Carlo in 2000, he took his first championship win on the Swedish Rally the following month, with the 206 WRC. Consequent wins, including on his home round of the series, were sufficient to see off closest points challenger, Subaru&#x27;s Richard Burns and land a shock first title after finishing second to the Englishman in the Rally of Great Britain. After an irksome and unsuccessful championship defense in 2001 during which assorted mechanical problems kept him down to fourth overall in the points table, he easily won his second title in 2002.
In 2003 Peugeot stuck with the same lineup as 2002 (Grönholm, Burns, Panizzi and Rovanperä) and also the 206. The only change was that the team now had major sponsorship from cigarette giants Marlboro painting the cars red and white. However the 206 was now four years old and showing its age. Grönholm covered this with three wins in Sweden, New Zealand and Argentina (the latter after an incident with a bank which dropped him to as low as 6th); however fuel pressure issues in Greece and a broken Propshaft in Cyprus meant Grönholm lost valuable points. A second in Germany was followed by accidents in Finland, Australia and Italy and by this stage he had fallen to sixth in the Championship. Fourth in France and sixth in Spain after a wrong tire choice was followed by another crash in Great Britain when he hit a pile of logs on a stage. The police soon caught him and despite his best efforts Grönholm was forbidden to go back to service. He finished sixth with 46 points.

In 2004 Peugeot introduced the new 307 to replace the 206, but the car was plagued by gearbox and power steering woes throughout the season. Grönholm took an immediate dislike to the new car because of its poor reliability, battling gearbox problems in Monte Carlo and power steering issues in Sweden. After more power steering woes in Mexico he stated &quot;I&#x27;m fed up with this car&quot;. An eventful second in New Zealand was followed by heartbreak in Cyprus: Here Grönholm thought he had taken the 307&#x27;s first win but after the event both he and teammate Harri Rovanperä (who finished fifth) were disqualified for illegal water pumps. A damaged suspension took him out in Greece, while despite a second in Turkey, co-driver Rautiainen suffered two broken bones in his bottom after they ran over a loose steel rod lying on the stage they were driving on which went through Rautiainen&#x27;s seat - this incident went viral when after a reporter&#x27;s question, Grönholm explained that something went through the seat &quot;up in the ass of Timo&quot;. In Finland everything clicked despite a gearbox issue and Grönholm finally got a win he was allowed to keep, but he went from hero to zero by crashing on the first stage in Germany. Spain would be his last podium of the year, coming home second after winning a battle with Carlos Sainz. This meant Grönholm finished a frustrating fifth with 62 points.

For 2005 Peugeot switched from Michelin to Pirelli tires, feeling that they could win on different rubber and to give Pirelli opportunities with other teams as only Subaru used their rubber in 2004. Grönholm also had a new teammate in Markko Märtin as Rovanperä joined Mitsubishi. After a difficult start with crashes in Monaco and Sweden Grönholm finished second in Mexico and New Zealand and was in contention for the win in Italy until a hefty roll down a hill cost him a heap of time and he had to settle for third. Retirement in Cyprus was followed by another third in Turkey where he lost a fight with Solberg for second; however both were comfortably beaten by Loeb who dominated the year with ten wins and Michelin tires that were superior to the Pirelli on the Peugeot. Groholm criticised the 307&#x27;s speed in Argentina where despite coming second he stated &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to go faster with this car&quot;. He did take two wins in Finland and Japan, both of which creating contrasting emotions. In Finland he won his home rally for the fifth time despite Rautiainen having another bizarre injury when he damaged a vertebra over a jump. The Japan event came just a week after the death of Märtin&#x27;s co-driver Michael Park after a crash in Great Britain (Grönholm was therefore withdrawn from the event) and Grönholm was set to finish second until rally leader Petter Solberg crashed on the penultimate stage handing Grönholm the win. It would be Grönholm&#x27;s last with Peugeot as he retired from the last three events of the year in France (gearbox issues) Spain (technical failure) and Australia (damaged suspension) and although he tied with Solberg on 71 points, the Norwegian pipped him to second with more wins (3-2) so Grönholm finished third. At the end of the year Peugeot left the championship and Grönholm needed to find a new team.

===2006–2007: Ford===

For the 2006 season, Grönholm switched to the Ford team, driving their all-new 2006-specification Focus RS WRC. On his debut, in January, he won his first ever tarmac rally in Monte Carlo, beating Sébastien Loeb by over a minute, albeit beaten by the Frenchman on the road with the championship&#x27;s unliked &#x27;Superally&#x27; regulations coming to his rescue as a shunt for the Citroën hastened its exit from Leg One. Although he was to follow this up with an entirely credible win in the second event of the season, Sweden, subsequent events saw Loeb surge past into a comfortable lead: the Frenchman was to never finish below second place in every event he entered, while his adversary was left to rue a string of retirements and errors that stymied his challenge.
In the meantime, the hopeful Grönholm collected victories over Loeb in Greece and Finland. Loeb&#x27;s hopes seemed to be coming to fruition when yet another victory in Cyprus brought him to the brink of the title; however he was to suffer his own blow days later when injury from a biking accident forced him out of the last four rounds of the series. Grönholm was able to push within one point of the lead in the total standings as Loeb recovered, but his claim to the title was finally extinguished when he rolled out of contention on the first leg of the penultimate event in Australia. Some solace for Grönholm, though, came in that another victory in New Zealand ahead of teammate Mikko Hirvonen was to confirm the manufacturers&#x27; title for his Ford team over Loeb-less Kronos Citroën.
The 2007 season started in good fashion for Grönholm. He claimed third place in the 75ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo behind the dominant returning works Citroens, and then the top spot in the Swedish Rally, mirroring the previous year&#x27;s result. While the usually consummate Loeb tumbled out of the points from a potentially auspicious position in both Norway and Sardinia, Grönholm remained consistent and after winning for the 28th time in his career over the Citroen titan in Greece, led the championship by nine points over Loeb over the championship&#x27;s summer break. At the 2007 Rally Finland, Ford secured a one-two with Grönholm taking the win and Hirvonen the second place ahead of Loeb. At the next rally, the 2007 Rallye Deutschland, Grönholm got distracted by a cow along the road and made a driving error while trying to secure a second place ahead of hard-charging François Duval, dropping him to fourth place behind his teammate.
Then came New Zealand, where after a tight battle over all three legs, Grönholm took a victory of historic slenderness over Loeb. The final winning margin between the two represented the closest ever in the history of the World Rally Championship: 0.3 seconds. This victory put him ten points clear in the championship with five rounds remaining. Podium finishes in Spain and France kept him on track for the championship, but after crashing out early at both Japan and Ireland the championship lead switched back to Loeb. Second place at Wales Rally GB was not enough to dislodge Loeb and so Grönholm finished the season as runner-up.

On 14 September 2007, Grönholm announced long-rumoured plans to retire from rallying at the end of the 2007 season, stating that &quot;I wanted to stop while I still had the speed to win rallies. I didn&#x27;t want to leave the decision too late so that I wasn&#x27;t capable of winning any longer&quot;, also citing the opportunity ahead of him to potentially retire as a three-time World Rally Champion.

===Other success===
Grönholm also won the 2002 Race of Champions, taking home the &quot;Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy&quot; and earning the title &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;. At the 2006 Race of Champions, he formed team Finland with Heikki Kovalainen and the pair won the Nations&#x27; Cup.

===Rallycross===

On April 16, 2008, Grönholm, at a press conference in the Kungsträdgården of Stockholm, announced a limited programme to take part in at least five rounds of the FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers (ERC). Grönholm participated in the series as team member of Andréas Eriksson&#x27;s &quot;Ford Team RS Europe&quot; and, like the 2003 Swedish rally champion, drove a brand new 4WD Ford Fiesta ST &quot;European Rallycross Car (ERC)&quot; with and 800+ Nm torque that goes from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.2 seconds, faster than any current Formula One car. The programme was later reduced to three 2008 ERC rounds (Sweden, the Netherlands and Poland). Grönholm qualified on pole and went on to take the win in his ERC debut at Höljes in Sweden on July 6 in front of 23,400 spectators.

In 2011 Grönholm participated in the American Global RallyCross Championship (GRC) in a 560 bhp Best Buy Ford Fiesta Mk7 prepared by the Swedish company Olsbergs MSE. 2012 he continued in the GRC for the same team and car and started the season with two overall victories on two events. A career-ending injury took place during practice for the tjirdround, held at X Games Los Angeles 2012.

===Later rally career===
In August 2008, Grönholm turned down Stobart M-Sport Ford&#x27;s offer to return to the WRC to replace the injured Gigi Galli. It was later reported that the factory teams of Citroën and Subaru both wanted to sign him for the 2009 season. In December, Grönholm and Subaru were reportedly close to signing to a full 12-event program, when the team re-structured the potential deal for financial reasons to include only four events, which did not interest Grönholm. Soon after, Subaru announced its shock withdrawal from the series due to the economic downturn.

Grönholm came out of retirement to contest the 2009 Rally Portugal in a Prodrive-prepared Subaru Impreza WRC2009. He stated that he was not aiming for the win and that &quot;it will be fun to return [to the WRC], even in an ad hoc way, in a car that I don&#x27;t know at all and after a year where I competed in some rallycross events.&quot; Despite this Grönholm performed well and stayed in touch with the leaders; he was in 4th position when he crashed on Saturday&#x27;s opening stage, damaging the car&#x27;s engine and ending his rally.

Grönholm took part in the 2010 Rally Sweden driving a Ford Focus RS WRC 08 for Team Therminator, alongside countryman Matthias Therman. Grönholm was co-driven, as usual, by Timo Rautiainen. He finished the rally – the first round of the 2010 WRC season in 21st place after technical problems on stage 6 costing him 13 minutes making him drop down to 33rd then making all the way up again until he got to 24th place but then dropped again to 30th place because of a puncture costing him another 7 minutes.

Grönholm made a return to the wheel of a Prodrive-run rally car in September 2010 when he test drove the Mini Countryman WRC in Portugal. Grönholm agreed to the test before taking any long-term decisions about his future. He also made a limited appearance in the 2019 World Rally Championship where he drove a Toyota Gazoo Racing-run Yaris under the GRX Team banner in the 2019 Rally Sweden.

==Personal life==
Grönholm lives in Ingå with his wife Teresa and their three children. One of them is Niclas Grönholm, who currently competes in the FIA World Rallycross Championship. While Grönholm is a native speaker of Swedish, he is fully bilingual with Finnish and had his pace notes in the latter language.

He and his co-driver Timo Rautiainen are brothers-in-law. He is the cousin of Sebastian Lindholm

Grönholm, along with Rautiainen, appeared in the first season of &quot;Amazing Race Suomi&quot; where they finished fifth place.

<doc id="944604" wikidata="Q7715761" url="?curid=944604" title="The Basil Brush Show">
<text>The Basil Brush Show is a British children&#x27;s television sitcom series, starring the glove puppet fox Basil Brush. It was produced for six series by The Foundation, airing on CBBC from 27 September 2002 to 25 December 2007. The show is a spin-off from the original 1960s–1970s BBC television series, but without any of the original cast.

==Overview==
The series is set in a colourful modern penthouse flat, which is jointly owned by Basil and his sidekick, Stephen (Christopher Pizzey). Living with them are Stephen&#x27;s niece and nephew, Molly (Georgina Leonidas), and Dave (Michael Hayes). They are left under the care of Stephen so that Molly &amp; Dave&#x27;s parents can go on a round the world trip.

Other characters include Anil (Ajay Chhabra), the owner of a greasy-spoon café under the name of &#x27;Anil&#x27;s&#x27;, where the main characters would frequently be seen dining. Ella (Tisha Martin) is Basil and Stephen&#x27;s neighbour who loves to sing. She is later replaced by Maddison (Laura Evans), an American fashion designer. In Series 1, Laurie Ventry appeared in 12 out of the 13 episodes, playing a different character every time.

Notably, the series takes a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude towards the show&#x27;s atmosphere, and the fourth wall is frequently broken; characters often reference the fact that they are on a studio set, and several episodes feature scenes and segments where the show&#x27;s cameramen and crew become involved in the storyline.

As the show was re-vamped in later years, two other characters were introduced. Liam (Michael Byers) replaces Stephen as Basil&#x27;s new sidekick, with Lucy (Janine Vieira - Series 5 &amp; Madeline Castrey - Series 6) debuting as Anil&#x27;s niece.

==Key characters==

===Basil Brush===

Basil Brush is a red fox, rendered as both a glove puppet and an animated character. He usually wears a green jacket and a red cravat, and speaks in a posh manner, using Received Pronunciation and addressing people as &quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Miss&quot;. His catchphrase is &quot;Boom! Boom!&quot;, usually exclaimed after bursting out laughing at one of his own jokes.

===Stephen===
Stephen (usually referred to by Basil as &quot;Mr Stephen&quot;) is the uncle to Dave and Molly, and is left in charge of them when their parents go on a round-the-world tour. He was on the show from 2002 to 2006. He is often the main subject of Basil&#x27;s or another character&#x27;s jokes, much to his annoyance. He was also not very clever as he did not seem to know a very simple sum (as established in the episode &quot;Bing Trouble&quot;, when Molly told him that 2 + 2 = 4 to which he said &quot;Does it?&quot;). He was played by Christopher Pizzey and left at the end of series 4. He appeared briefly in series 5 when Basil mentioned that he has been snapped up by Hollywood. But this later reveals he is working at a Hollywood burger van. His cousin Liam arrives shortly after to take his place.

===Liam===
Liam is played by Michael Byers and is a distant cousin of Stephen&#x27;s, replacing him as Basil&#x27;s sidekick in the fifth series of the show, appearing from 2006 to 2007. Liam is trying to come to terms with the exciting things which are yet to happen to him in life. He can appear slightly dumb in some aspects, but is actually quite smart. Several episodes revolve around some of his near-impossible inventions (like a time machine and a shrink ray) and he is also good at chemistry. A recurring joke is that he will mention some odd night class he has been to, with the line, &quot;I knew those (-whatever is relevant to the story-) night classes would come in handy.&quot; In the episode &quot;Ballroom Basil&quot;, it is stated that his surname is O&#x27;Dingleberry.

===Dave===
Dave is a child character who is 10 years old in Series 1, growing to be 15 in Series 6. He is regularly shown to have a flair for business and has, throughout the course of the series, set up a media empire which was later destroyed by Basil and Stephen in the episode Meeja Mogul, imported stolen goods and even started his own television show. He is usually addressed as a 14-year-old multi-billionaire entrepreneur and is played by Michael Hayes.

===Molly===
Molly is Dave&#x27;s older sister and Stephen&#x27;s niece. She is 12 years old in series 1 and 17 in series 6. She is portrayed as the sensible character, trying to reason with the characters whenever they make a bad decision and can sometimes be very violent. Molly is one of the most popular characters on the show. She is very clever and very witty. From Series 5, Molly appears in only a few episodes as a recurring character, with Lucy partially replacing her character-type. Molly only appears in two episodes in the final season, in &quot;Ballroom Basil&quot; where she says she is going to get some milk and she may be gone for some time, and in Basil Christmas Dinners where she returns and explains there was a worldwide milk shortage and she had to go all the way to Timbuktu which is why she was so long. She is portrayed by Georgina Leonidas.

===Madison===
An American who was introduced as &#x27;Madison Square-Gardens&#x27;, Madison is a fashion student living in the flat upstairs. She was on the show from 2004 to 2007. The character of Madison is played by Laura Evans, a singer/songwriter from Aberdare in South Wales. Her initial designs were thrown out by Basil, having mistaken them for rubbish. Madison is Stephen&#x27;s third love interest in the show. She pronounces Basil&#x27;s name in the southern US way, as &quot;Bay-zull&quot;. When things start going wrong, she often protests that the only reason she is still in the UK is because she has lost her passport. Her name comes from Madison Square Garden.

===Anil===
Appearing in every series of the show, Anil is the owner of Basil&#x27;s local hangout, Anil&#x27;s Caff. Like Mr Stephen, he is shown to have a less than average intelligence, and a running joke through the series is the terrible quality of his food. It is revealed that he is sexist in &quot;Bend it like Basil&quot;. He is played by Ajay Chabra. In the episode &quot;Camping&quot; it is revealed that Anil wears a wig, has a glass eye, false teeth and a prosthetic wooden leg.

===Lucy===
Lucy is Anil&#x27;s niece and currently lives in Basil&#x27;s flat. Lucy was Anil&#x27;s &quot;slave&quot; but was &quot;rescued&quot; by Madison. She can be quite stubborn at times but loves hanging out in the flat with Basil and the rest of the gang. She hates cousin Mortimer&#x27;s pranks and Dave&#x27;s cons. Lucy replaces Molly after she left the show after series 4, and aired on the show from 2006 to 2007. The character of Lucy is played by Janine Vieira in Season 5 and Madeline Castrey in Season 6.

===Ella===
Ella is Stephen&#x27;s second love interest, only appearing in the second series (2003). She is also good friends with Molly. It is revealed that she is a football prodigy in &quot;Bend it like Basil&quot;. She is played by Tisha Martin.

==Semi-regular and recurring characters==

===The Voice-over Man===
The Voice Over Man was an unseen character who often voiced over at times when he annoys the gang but occasionally he undid some mistakes that Basil and his friends made. He was part of the regular cast from 2002 to 2005, quietly retiring from the show after Series 4. He was credited as Basil Soper.

===Mortimer Brush===
Mortimer is Basil&#x27;s cousin and recurring antagonist. He is a career criminal, and usually wears a black leather jacket. Basil describes Mortimer as having been to prison so many times that his prison cell has a revolving door.

In the first series finale, he arrived and pretended to be kind and helpful to the local people but secretly he was stealing things and getting Basil into trouble. In the second series, he was released from prison and he was still causing havoc. His catchphrase is &quot;Bang! Bang!&quot;, followed by the sound of two projectile ricochets.

In the third series he and Basil had to get along for 24 hours without fighting and arguing but they over-wound the wind-up clock and they fought one minute too early . He also appeared at Basil&#x27;s wedding when he was marrying evil Kelly Foxwell but in the end, Kelly liked Mortimer more than Basil. He returned in the Christmas special. He appeared in the fourth series in prison. He is voiced by Don Austen.

He appeared in the 2005 and 2006 Christmas specials.

In the first series finale, his full name is revealed to be Mortimer Trouble Brush.

===Bingo Brush===
Basil&#x27;s playful and hyperactive nephew fox cub. His catchphrase is &quot;Bing bing!&quot;. Bingo has a twin brother called Bungo whom Basil says is &quot;much, much worse&quot;, who only appeared at the end of Bingo&#x27;s first story. Bingo appeared on the show multiple occasions, starting from 2003. Bingo is voiced by Don Austen.

===Roxy===
Roxy is Basil&#x27;s girlfriend, but unlike the other foxes in the show she is an Arctic fox. She has only been seen in four episodes of the fifth series (2006), including the 2006 Christmas Special. She pronounces Basil&#x27;s name as Ba-Zeal. She is voiced by Sheila Clark.

===Mr Rossiter===
Mr Rossiter is the landlord who own the flats the main characters live in. He is named after Leonard Rossiter, who famously played the landlord Rupert Rigsby in the sitcom Rising Damp. He is played by Milton Johns.

===India===
India is a waitress who works at Anil&#x27;s Cafe (Basil&#x27;s local hangout). She is a terrible cook like her boss but has a beautiful singing voice, as shown to perform songs occasionally throughout the series. India was only mentioned for a brief portion of the final season (2007). She is played by India de Beaufort.

===Amanda===

Amanda first appeared in the first episode in Season 1. She is a restaurant critic and Stephen&#x27;s first love interest. In the series 1 finale, Amanda sides with Mortimer when he takes over the show and turning it into a seedy backdrop. She dresses up as a club harlot and breaks the fourth wall, claiming she &quot;can&#x27;t afford to be out of work&quot;. When Stephen orders her to &quot;get those cloths off!&quot;, she indignantly leaves and is never seen again. She is played by Jodie Scott.

== Locations ==
* Stephen&#x27;s Flat (2002–07): This is the place where the gang live and spend most of their time. It is made up of a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and four bedrooms. The bathroom is seen on many occasions, and Basil and Stephen&#x27;s bedroom is seen at the end of every episode from Series 1–4. Molly&#x27;s room is only seen in one episode in Series One, and Dave&#x27;s room is only seen in an episode from Series 4. There is also another bedroom behind a yellow door. Liam moves into the flat for Series 5 and 6.
* Anil&#x27;s Café (2002–07): The gang spend most of their time here, although it apparently serves bad food (the reason for this is given by Basil, when asked by Anil once, as &quot;it&#x27;s the only other set we&#x27;ve got&quot;, to which Anil responds &quot;good point&quot;). This is the place where the group meets Amanda (1.1), India (Series 2 – 4), and Lucy (5.1). We also see Anil&#x27;s Kitchen in one episode from Series 2. It is later refurbished in Series 5 in the episode toothache. In Series 6, it is seen again in the episode fox on the run.
* Ella&#x27;s Flat (2003): Only featured twice in the 2003 series. The first appearance in &quot;Ella&quot; after Stephen and Basil end up falling through an air vent and a second time in &quot;Molly in Love&quot;, when Molly visits and tells Ella about her crush. It is seen as mostly light brown and beige in colour.
* Madison&#x27;s Flat (2004–07): This is the place where Madison lives. It is exceptionally smaller than both Ella&#x27;s and Stephen&#x27;s flat.
* The alley (2005–07): The first episode where this set was used was in &quot;Basil&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

<doc id="944612" wikidata="Q7855" url="?curid=944612" title="Sébastien Loeb">
<text>Sébastien Loeb (; born 26 February 1974) is a French professional rally, racing and rallycross driver. He is the most successful driver in the World Rally Championship (WRC), having won the world championship a record nine times in a row. He holds several other WRC records, including most event wins, most podium finishes and most stage wins. Loeb retired from full time WRC participation at the end of 2012. He currently drives part time in the WRC for M-Sport Ford World Rally Team, and full time in the World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) for Bahrain Raid Xtreme.

Originally a gymnast, Loeb was a four time Champion of Alsace and one time champion of the French Grand East. He switched to rallying in 1995 and won the Junior World Rally Championship in 2001. Signed by the Citroën World Rally Team for the 2002 season, he and co-driver Daniel Elena took their maiden WRC win that same year at the Rallye Deutschland. After finishing runner-up to Petter Solberg by one point in 2003, Loeb took his first drivers&#x27; title in 2004. Continuing with Citroën, he went on to take a record ninth consecutive world title in 2012. Loeb is a tarmac expert, having won all but three of the WRC rallies on that surface in which he has participated between 2005 and 2013. In 2018, Loeb won the Spanish round of that year&#x27;s championship, in a rare entry six years after his retirement as a full-time WRC driver.

Loeb made his debut at the Dakar Rally in 2016 and has participated in it every year since bar 2020. He has a best finish of second in 2017, 2022 and 2023. Besides his success in rallying, Loeb is a four-time winner at the Race of Champions, after taking home the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy and the title &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2022. In 2004, he won the Nations&#x27; Cup for France with Jean Alesi. In 2006, he finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Loeb was named the French Sportsman of the Year in 2007 and 2009, and made knight of the Legion of Honour (&quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;) in 2009. In 2012, he won the rallycross final in his first appearance at X Games XVIII. The same year, Loeb founded his own motorsports team, Sébastien Loeb Racing; which participates in various racing series. The following year, he participated in the FIA GT Series for Loeb Racing and scored four wins and finished fourth overall. In 2014 and 2015 he had a successful stint in the World Touring Car Championship, scoring six wins in total and with a best finish of third overall in both seasons. From 2016 to 2018 he also participated in the FIA World Rallycross Championship, with two wins and a best position of fourth overall.

In 2021, he tested the Ford Puma Rally1 car several times, before joining the M-Sport Ford WRT for a part-time drive in the 2022 WRC season. He took his 80th WRC victory at the 2022 Monte Carlo Rally, barely a week after finishing second at the 2022 Dakar Rally. Loeb later also won the 2022 Extreme E Championship alongside Cristina Gutiérrez; for Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s Team X44. Loeb has also competed in other motorsports like the GT World Challenge Europe, the Porsche Supercup, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Andros Trophy and other racing categories across many disciplines. Loeb is the only racing driver to win an event in four different FIA-affiliated world championships since winning the Andalucía Rally in 2022.

==Career==

===Rallying===

====Early career====

Loeb initially competed as a gymnast and became a four-time Alsatian champion, once champion of the French Grand East, and fifth in the French championship. He broke off school in 1992 but resumed taking classes in 1994, aiming at vocational training in electrical engineering. On 1994, in parallel with his classes, he started working as an electrician at the Socalec company near Haguenau Airport, where he was the oldest apprentice and already noted for his daring/reckless driving style. On this level, he could count on the understanding of his boss, who was himself fascinated by speed and owned a Ferrari Testarossa 512 TR.

In 1995, at age 21, he quit his job and classes and definitively turned his attention to racing. In 1998, he started entering events in the French Citroën Saxo Trophy series, winning the title in 1999. Guy Fréquelin, Citroën Sport&#x27;s team principal, would serve as Loeb&#x27;s mentor as he entered the Junior World Rally Championship in 2001, becoming the series&#x27; first champion by winning five of the six events. The only event he didn&#x27;t win this year was Rallye Sanremo: for this event, he was elected as a driver for the WRC championship, driving a Citroën Xsara WRC alongside Philippe Bugalski and Jesús Puras. In only his third rally with a World Rally Car, he surprisingly hounded Peugeot tarmac specialist and eventual victor Gilles Panizzi to the finish, and ended up second.

====2002–03====

The 2002 season was Loeb&#x27;s first as a WRC driver with the Citroën Total World Rally Team, although the team only participated in seven rounds in the build-up to their full entry the following year. Loeb started the season by provisionally winning the Monte Carlo Rally, after racing under appeal due to a two-minute time penalty incurred by an illegal tyre change during the second day. Citroën considered the penalty too severe but later withdrew the appeal, and Subaru&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen then took a record fourth consecutive Monte Carlo win. Loeb later took his maiden victory at the Rallye Deutschland in Germany, edging out Peugeot&#x27;s Richard Burns.

In 2003, his first full season in the championship, Loeb won three WRC events, Monte Carlo, Germany and Sanremo, before losing to Petter Solberg in the Wales Rally Great Britain, also losing the championship to him by just one point. Loeb was asked by his team not to chase Solberg at all costs so that he didn&#x27;t jeopardise Citroën&#x27;s lead in the constructors&#x27; championship. Loeb&#x27;s reputation grew as he defeated his more illustrious teammates – Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae – over the course of the season.

====2004====

In the 2004 season, Loeb dominated the WRC scene in a similar way to Michael Schumacher&#x27;s domination of Formula One the same year, by winning six events and taking six runner-up spots to securely give him the drivers&#x27; title, 36 points clear of second-placed Solberg. His six WRC victories tied the record for victories in one season with fellow Frenchman Didier Auriol, who won six events in 1992. He was also responsible for Citroën&#x27;s second manufacturers&#x27; title in a row.

Originally known as a tarmac specialist, 2004 was the year Loeb proved himself capable of winning on other surfaces as well. He won the snow-based Swedish Rally, becoming the first non-Nordic to win the event. On gravel, he triumphed in the Cyprus Rally, Rally of Turkey and the Rally Australia. On tarmac, he continued his success in Monte Carlo and Germany.

====2005====

In 2005, with victory in the ninth round in Argentina, Loeb became the first to win six consecutive rallies, beating Timo Salonen&#x27;s record of four from 1985. Having already won the season-opening Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo, he also became the first to win seven in a season, beating his (and Didier Auriol&#x27;s) own record of six wins in a season. Loeb was in a position to clinch the title while leading the Wales Rally Great Britain, but after it was announced that the last two stages of the rally would be abandoned due to the death of Markko Märtin&#x27;s co-driver Michael Park in an accident on stage 15, Loeb deliberately incurred a two-minute penalty to drop him to third place and avoid retaining his title in such circumstances. He went on to secure the title by finishing second to Peugeot&#x27;s Marcus Grönholm at the next rally in Japan.

Loeb eventually extended his win record to ten and won the title with a 56-point margin, breaking a 25-year-old record; Walter Röhrl&#x27;s margin over Hannu Mikkola in 1980 was 54. Loeb set several other records during the season as well. He won all twelve stages in the 2005 Tour de Corse in France, which marked the first time a driver had won every stage of a WRC rally. Loeb&#x27;s twelve podium and thirteen points-scoring finishes in a row were also new records in the series.

====2006====

Citroën&#x27;s parent company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, pulled both manufacturers out of the WRC at the end of 2005, but Citroën planned to return in 2007 with the C4 WRC, and developed the car during 2006. Loeb was closely involved with this as he was guaranteed the leading role in the team at the comeback. In the meantime, a &#x27;gap year&#x27; beckoned in the privateer ranks, namely with Citroën-sponsored Kronos Racing entered as the Kronos Total Citroën World Rally Team.

In order to score on the first round in Monte Carlo, Loeb was initially forced to activate the SupeRally rules for retiring competitors, having spun off the road on day one. Although he did manage to fight his way back to second place, it was the first time he had ever been beaten to the finish (namely by fellow double world champion Marcus Grönholm) on these roads in the Xsara WRC. This outcome was mirrored on the following month&#x27;s Swedish Rally, with Grönholm again the man to whom Loeb was forced to give best, placing the duo in an early runaway 1–2 position in the points standings.
But the Frenchman&#x27;s bridesmaid status was not to last, and racking up a triumph on the ensuing Rally Mexico – the first of five on the trot that season – propelled him into a championship lead he was never to lose. He tied Carlos Sainz&#x27;s record number of 26 individual rally victories in August with a fifth consecutive victory in Germany. With his subsequent victory in Japan, the world record of 27 victories and counting eventually became his. His victory in Cyprus put him on the verge of a third consecutive World Rally Championship title.

Shortly after, Loeb broke his right humerus in a mountain-biking accident near his home in Switzerland, causing him to miss the last four rallies of the season (Turkey, Australia, New Zealand and Wales). In spite of this, Loeb had accumulated such a huge point lead before Turkey that Marcus Grönholm&#x27;s failure to finish third or better in Australia handed Loeb the 2006 championship crown by one point. He received the news at home via an Internet video link to the rally HQ. Due to the time difference, he made do with early morning coffee instead of the customary champagne, calling the whole experience &quot;strange&quot;.

In 2022, on the WRC Backstories Podcast with Becs Williams, Loeb revealed that he even considered to co-drive for Colin McRae for the rest of the season due to the injury. As co-drivers themselves scored points, Loeb could have possibly scored points for himself as a driver to try and win the title. The plan never came to fruition though as Grönholm&#x27;s crash meant Loeb won the title anyway.

====2007====

For 2007, Loeb returned as an official Citroën driver, with the new Citroën C4 WRC. He won the 75ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo, the first race for the new C4, following that with a solid second place after Grönholm, in Sweden, to set a two-point lead over the Finn after two of 16 rounds. At the first Rally Norway, Loeb went off and lost eight minutes during SS12 while chasing Grönholm and the leader, Mikko Hirvonen. On the next stage, he made another mistake and lost nine minutes. He eventually finished 14th in the rally and dropped to third in the championship standings. He won 8 of the 18 stages in this rally. Loeb won the next rally, the 21º Corona Rally México, 55.8 seconds clear of Grönholm.

He then followed this success with his third and fourth season victories on the Portuguese and Argentinian rallies. Characteristically, he was once more to be found in the lead on the seventh round, the Rally d&#x27;Italia in Sardinia. On new stages on the final leg to those of the previous year, however, Loeb was once more to lament error and the surrender of probable victory, this time after crashing and breaking his car&#x27;s suspension in a ditch. He left the lead in the hands of Grönholm, who won to propel himself seven points ahead of Loeb at the top of the championship standings. A second loss to the Finn in as many years on the Acropolis Rally then extended the deficit to nine points over the championship&#x27;s summer break.

Loeb occupied his recess by, amongst other engagements, competing in the Shell Donegal International Rally on 15, 16 and , partially as preparation for the coming Rally Ireland World Championship round that November. He scored a comprehensive victory, albeit only after being given a scare by the pace of tenacious private Subaru-driver Mark Higgins, who had a 45-second lead at the end of day one. Punctures afflicted upon his rival eventually settled the contest.

Ambitions of finally scoring victory on Rally Finland proved once more unrealised, with Loeb relegated to third place behind the pacy natives Grönholm and Hirvonen. Rallye Deutschland, as was traditional, differed somewhat. At the scene of his first victory and on a rally where he had never subsequently lost, Loeb was left unexpectedly to fend off the challenge not of the Finn, but of a privateer, his one-time teammate and championship returnee François Duval. He eventually triumphed and reduced some of his championship points deficit.
A very close battle on the gravel stages of Rally New Zealand ended with the second closest win in WRC history – Loeb finished only 0.3s behind his main rival. The next two rounds allowed the French driver to regain some points, as he won both tarmac events – Rallye Espana, where his teammate Dani Sordo took second place and two points from Grönholm, and Rally France.

Rally Japan was another dramatic event – Loeb got the chance to take the lead in the Championship after Grönholm&#x27;s early mistake, but he was unable to, as his co-driver&#x27;s mistake caused the C4 to go off the road on one of the stages of second leg. Both drivers ended with no points after finally retiring from the event. In Ireland, during 1st Rally Ireland almost the same happened – Marcus Grönholm overcooked a slippery right corner on one of the early stages, trying to keep a fast pace, and had to retire from the rally. Loeb made use of his rival&#x27;s mistake and, by making no major mistakes, although having some suspension-related problems with keeping pace at the beginning, he added 10 points to his account, moving ahead of the Finnish driver just one round before the season&#x27;s end. In Wales he was not fighting for the win, focusing mostly on securing his advantage, finishing the event third – on 2007 Loeb became World Rally Champion for the fourth time in a row.

====2008====

Loeb started the 2008 season with a record fifth win in Monte Carlo. On the second rally of the year, 2008 Swedish Rally, he crashed out during day one. Although he re-joined the rally to collect manufacturers&#x27; points, the team later decided to retire him due to a damaged engine. After winning in Mexico and Argentina, Loeb had a crash with Conrad Rautenbach on a road section in Jordan, from which he could only recover to take tenth place in the rally. He went on to win two events, and then finish close third to the Ford factory team duo Mikko Hirvonen and Jari-Matti Latvala at the Rally of Turkey.

Loeb later notably won the Rally Finland ahead of Hirvonen. This was the fourth time in the event&#x27;s 58-year history that a non-Nordic driver won the rally, after Carlos Sainz in 1990, Didier Auriol in 1992 and Markko Märtin in 2003. This started a string of five victories for Loeb. In Germany, New Zealand and Spain, Citroën also took double wins as his teammate Dani Sordo took three runner-up spots in a row.
Going into the penultimate round of the season, the 2008 Rally Japan, Loeb led Hirvonen by 14 points and needed a third place to secure the world drivers&#x27; title. Finishing behind Ford&#x27;s Hirvonen and Latvala, Loeb broke Juha Kankkunen&#x27;s, Tommi Mäkinen&#x27;s and his own record of four titles and became the first five-time world champion in rallying.

After clinching the World Rally Championship, Loeb edged out Latvala to take his first Wales Rally GB win, a feat which also helped secure his team their first manufacturers&#x27; title since 2005, from 2006 and 2007 victors Ford.

====2009====

Loeb started the year by winning Rally Ireland for the second time since 2007. He then won his first Rally Norway ever, after a fierce battle with Mikko Hirvonen, lasting throughout the very final stage. Being first on the road through all three days, Loeb kept his lead, in the end winning with 9.8 seconds over Hirvonen. Loeb continued his good form by winning over Hirvonen in Cyprus, marking his career 50th victory, and in Portugal. His victory in Argentina, the fifth in a row in this country, was also his fifth victory in a row since the start of the season.

At the Rally d&#x27;Italia Sardegna, Loeb had a puncture after going off the road and dropped from third to fourth. Although he passed Petter Solberg for the final podium spot, he still finished fourth due to a time penalty for a safety rule violation; co-driver Daniel Elena had unfastened his safety belts before the crew stopped the car for a tyre change. At the Acropolis Rally, Loeb crashed out from third place. On Rally Poland&#x27;s return to the WRC, Loeb had another crash but he continued in the event under &quot;superally&quot; rules. After team orders issued for the Citroën Junior Team drivers and a late mistake by Ford&#x27;s Jari-Matti Latvala, Loeb found himself seventh but had lost the championship lead to Hirvonen by one point.

By winning the Rally Catalunya, Loeb reduced the deficit to Hirvonen in the title race before the final event of the year; once again trailing by a single point. The Frenchman gained the championship by winning the final event of the year, the Rally GB. Victory was secured partly due to an incredible performance over SS8 and SS9, where in the course of only two stages Loeb extended his lead in the rally over Hirvonen from 2.4s to 25s.

====2010====

The 2010 WRC season started with the snow-based Swedish Rally, where Loeb finished second behind Ford&#x27;s Mikko Hirvonen. He went on to take a clear championship lead by winning the following three gravel events: Rally México, Jordan Rally and Rally of Turkey. In New Zealand, Loeb finished third in a tight battle that saw the top five finish within 26 seconds of each other. In Portugal, Loeb narrowly lost the win to his countryman Sébastien Ogier of the Citroën Junior Team, who took his debut win in the World Rally Championship. In the following Rally Bulgaria, a new event in the series and the season&#x27;s first tarmac rally, Loeb won while Citroën scored the WRC&#x27;s first 1–2–3–4 in seventeen years.

At the 60th Rally Finland, Loeb beat Citroën privateer Petter Solberg to the final podium position, behind Ford&#x27;s Jari-Matti Latvala and Ogier. He went on to win the Rallye Deutschland for the eighth time in a row, marking the first time a driver has won a WRC rally eight times. After a fifth place in Japan, Loeb secured a record-extending seventh consecutive World Rally Championship title by winning his home event, the Rallye de France. As the Rallye de France–Alsace had replaced the Tour de Corse as the French round of the WRC, Loeb ended up clinching the title on a final stage that was held in his home town of Haguenau, Alsace.

During the course of the season, he was on the podium of all events but one (Japan where he finished fifth), and ended up the season with a record 105 points over runner-up Jari-Matti Latvala.

====2011====

The 2011 season brought a new generation of World Rally Cars. Now at the wheel of a Citroën DS3 WRC, Loeb started his year by finishing sixth at the Rally Sweden. He went on to win in Mexico for the fifth time in row, after teammate Sébastien Ogier crashed out from a narrow lead. In Portugal, Loeb finished second to Ogier and took his first Power Stage win, collecting three more points from the final stage. At the Jordan Rally, held during the Arab Spring, the entire first day was cancelled. Loeb placed third behind the closest-ever finish in the history of the World Rally Championship. He then beat Ford&#x27;s Mikko Hirvonen to the win at the Rally d&#x27;Italia Sardegna.

In Argentina, Loeb won after a tight three-way battle, taking the lead from Ogier on the final stage and finishing 2.4 seconds ahead of Hirvonen. At the next event, the Acropolis Rally in Greece, Loeb had to settle for second behind Ogier. In the high-speed Rally Finland, he beat Jari-Matti Latvala to become the first non-Nordic driver to win twice in the event&#x27;s 60-year history. In August, Loeb signed a two-year contract extension with Citroën. At the Rallye Deutschland, Loeb held a close lead ahead of Ogier after the first day and Citroën decided to freeze the situation. A puncture later dropped Loeb out of contention and he finished behind his teammate. This ended his record win streak in Germany and was the first time that he had lost in a tarmac-based event since the 2006 Monte Carlo Rally. Tension in the team grew; David Evans of &quot;Autosport&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s war between the two Sebs&quot;.
Before Australia, Loeb held a 25-point lead in the championship ahead of Ogier. During the first day of the rally, both Sébastiens crashed out. Loeb later gained a point by climbing to tenth place after Citroën ordered Ogier to slow down. In his home event, the Rallye de France, Loeb took the lead from the start but soon fell victim to a rare engine failure in his DS3 WRC and had to retire. As Ogier beat Mini&#x27;s Dani Sordo to the win, Loeb now tied the lead in the championship with Hirvonen, and Ogier was only three points adrift. At the Rally Catalunya, Loeb took his fifth win of the season and broke Markku Alén&#x27;s record (801) for most stage wins in the world championship. He carried an eight-point lead over Hirvonen into the season-ending Wales Rally GB. Loeb took the rally lead from Latvala on the third stage, but lost it to Hirvonen by 0.4 seconds on stage six. However, Hirvonen soon went wide, spun and broke his radiator, which in turn caused severe engine problems. As Hirvonen was unable to restart, Loeb secured his eighth consecutive world championship. This title moved him ahead of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher in terms of major motorsport championships won. While running in second place behind Latvala, Loeb retired from the rally due to a road section collision with a spectator who had driven his car on the wrong side of a narrow road.

====2012====

Loeb began his 2012 season by beating Mini&#x27;s Dani Sordo to a record sixth win in the Monte Carlo Rally. He also secured the maximum points by recording the fastest time for the power stage. In Sweden, after hitting a snowbank on stage seven, Loeb was forced out of the fight for the number one spot. He finished sixth and gained three extra points by again winning the power stage. Loeb took his second victory of the season at the Rally Mexico, ahead of his new teammate Mikko Hirvonen.
In Portugal, he crashed out from third place on the night stages of the first day, after misunderstanding a pacenote. The Rally Argentina was dominated by the Citroëns and Loeb drove to his 70th WRC victory. At the Acropolis Rally in Greece, he cruised to an easy win after Ford&#x27;s Jari-Matti Latvala and Petter Solberg ran into several problems and dropped out of contention.

He went on to continue his WRC win streak in New Zealand and in Finland, where he edged out Hirvonen to take his third win in the event. This marked the fourth double win in a row for the Citroën duo. After beating Latvala to the win in Germany, Loeb finished second to the Finn at the Wales Rally GB, after a tight battle for the position with Solberg.

In late September, Loeb announced his retirement from full-time rallying, stating that he would compete only in selected events during the upcoming season. He added that he is interested in taking on a new challenge such as the World Touring Car Championship. In his home event, the Rallye de France, Loeb built a cushion over Latvala and title rival Hirvonen on the first two days. He then held Latvala at bay on the wet roads on Sunday, securing a record ninth drivers&#x27; title in the World Rally Championship and aiding Citroën to its eighth manufacturers&#x27; title. German magazine &quot;Auto Bild&quot; noted that Loeb was now two world championship titles clear of Schumacher and equal to Valentino Rossi, and dubbed him &quot;the best rally driver of all time and a shining light in motorsport.&quot; Former world champion Ari Vatanen opined that Loeb&#x27;s records are unlikely to be broken.

====2013====

Loeb competed in five rallies of the 2013 season: Monte Carlo, Sweden, Argentina, Germany and France. He started his partial WRC season with a win in Monte Carlo, and finished last to Sébastien Ogier in Sweden, followed by another win in Argentina. Ahead of his home rally in France, it has been speculated it could be his WRC swansong. It was confirmed on 1 October 2013 as Loeb will continue racing for Citroën, this time for World Touring Car Championship. However, Loeb crashed out on the first stage of day three. The rally was eventually won by Sebastien Ogier.

====2014–20====

Returning to the WRC after being absent in 2014, in 2015 Loeb participated in the Monte Carlo Rally and finished 8th after a crash. In 2016 and 2017 he did not contest any rounds.

He drove 3 rounds in 2018 and won his last rally with Citroën, the Rally Catalunya.

He signed to race part time with the Hyundai World Rally Team for the 2019 season. He got one podium in the Rally Chile and participated in 6 rounds. He closed out 2019 with a win at the non-championship rally, the Rallye du Var with his partner Laurène Godey as his co-driver.

In 2020, he continued with Hyundai and finished 6th at the Monte Carlo Rally and got a podium at Turkey, which were the only two rounds he entered in that season.

On 1 October 2020, he announced that he would be leaving Hyundai World Rally Team. He did not participate in the WRC in 2021.

====2021====

On the 29th November 2021, Loeb&#x27;s co-driver Daniel Elena announced his retirement.

Loeb then tested the Ford Puma Rally1 for M Sport, later announcing that would compete for the British squad part time in the WRC with new co-driver Isabelle Galmiche.

====2022====

At the Monte Carlo Rally, Loeb participated alongside Isabelle Galmiche for M-Sport Ford World Rally Team, barely having recovered from the Dakar Rally and with very little time behind the wheel of a WRC car since 2018. He battled his former rival Sébastien Ogier (co-driver Benjamin Veillas) all rally long, till Ogier got a puncture in the penultimate stage. At the final stage Loeb led by 9.5s, and Ogier got a 10-second penalty for a jumpstart. Loeb won his 80th WRC rally by 10.5s over Ogier, first for a manufacturer other than Citroën World Rally Team and his first with a co-driver other than Daniel Elena. He also became the oldest driver to lead and win a WRC Rally. Galmiche became the first woman co-driver to win a WRC event since Fabrizia Pons in 1997.

At the Rally de Portugal, Loeb and Galmiche were 10.1 seconds behind rally leader Elfyn Evans (co-driver Scott Martin) in SS3, but won the next stage and took 10.6 seconds out of their deficit; therefore putting them in the overall rally lead by 0.5 seconds over Evans. At the first corner of SS5 though, Loeb slid wide into a barrier, completely destroying his rear-right suspension. On Saturday, Loeb had another mechanical issue which forced him to retire.

The next rally they took part in was the Safari Rally. The last time Loeb participated in that rally before 2022 was in 2002. Loeb and Galmiche had good speed and even managed to win a stage on Friday, but Loeb&#x27;s engine had a small fire and wouldn&#x27;t start up later. They retired for the day. Even though they were out of contention, they won two more stages on Sunday and ultimately recovered to eighth place.

Loeb and Galmiche then took part in the Acropolis Rally, where they ran for the lead alongside M Sport teammate Pierre-Louis Loubet (co driver Vincent Landais). Both crews traded stage wins, but Loeb was leading with Friday done. On the next day though, Loeb again encountered issues and had to retire. 

====2023====

Loeb alongside his partner and co-driver Laurène Godey won the Azores Rallye on their first attempt, in a Škoda Fabia R5.

===Dakar Rally and Rally Raid===
====2016====

Loeb made his debut at the 2016 Dakar Rally in the Peugeot 2008 DKR. He led the rally by 7 minutes and 48 seconds but lost the lead to teammate Stéphane Peterhansel by over 8 minutes in SS6. Peterhansel won the event. Loeb won 4 stages and finished 9th, over 2 hours and 22 minutes from the lead.

==== 2017 ====
At the 2017 Silk Way Rally Loeb had to abandon due to a finger injury which he had sustained in stage 9. He had been leading the overall standings up to that point.

Loeb also took his career best finish of 2nd at the 2017 Dakar Rally by winning 5 stages and just 5 minutes from the leader, Stéphane Peterhansel.

====2018====
Loeb retired on day five of the 2018 Dakar Rally and could not continue any further as his co-driver Daniel Elena had a tailbone injury. Prior to the retirement he had won only one stage, SS4.

====2019====

Peugeot withdrew from World Rallycross and from Rally-Raid hence at the 2019 Dakar Rally Loeb and Elena competed with a private Red Bull backed 2017 Peugeot 3008 DKR. They finished 3rd with 4 stage wins, 1 hour and 54 minutes away from winner Nasser Al-Attiyah.

====2020====
Loeb did not compete in the 2020 Dakar Rally. He announced in December that year that he will return in 2021 with the Prodrive run Bahrain Raid Xtreme team.

====2021====
At the 2021 Dakar Rally Loeb made his debut for the Prodrive run Bahrain Raid Xtreme Team. He received a 5-minute penalty for speeding in SS4, which left him furious. He retired in SS8 after getting two punctures and being stranded for 5 hours. He also experienced many navigation issues with his co driver Daniel Elena. Elena and Loeb later in 2021 announced that they had split.

====2022====
Loeb took part in the inaugural World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) this time with new co-driver, Belgian Fabian Lurquin; again driving the BRX Hunter.

They began the year at the Dakar Rally, finishing 2nd to Toyota Gazoo Racing&#x27;s Nasser Al-Attiyah and Mathieu Baumel by 27 minutes and 48 seconds; even in spite of many mechanical issues and punctures.

At the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge they finished 6th overall after having a driveshaft failure on day 1 and two punctures on day 5, the final day. The transmission broke on the first day, but their determination to finish meant that they scored valuable points. In the last stage they had two punctures and drove cautiously for the last 200 km. They still managed to score 28 points, bringing the total to 112 and led the W2RC standings by one point from Al Attiyah and Baumel.

At the Rallye du Maroc, Loeb and Lurquin ran among the leading times, but in Stage 4 encountered a mechanical issue they couldn&#x27;t fix, and hence dropped back in the overall rally standings. They continued to run the rally for earning points in the W2RC standings. They finished the rally with two stage wins.

Loeb earned his first victory in the rally-raid discipline on the Andalucia Rally, but finished second in the overall championship obtaining a total of 149 points, 20 points behind Al-Attiyah, who won the title.

====2023====

Loeb entered the second season of the World Rally-Raid Championship in 2023, driving an upgraded BRX Hunter.

He kicked off the year by finishing 2nd again behind Toyota Gazoo Racing&#x27;s Nasser Al-Attiyah and Mathieu Baumel, with the final deficit to car #200 being 1 hour, 20 minutes and 49 seconds. He won seven stages in total with six consecutive stage victories from stage 8 to 13, which is a Dakar Rally record. Loeb bounced back from suffering massive time losses on stage 2, where his BRX Hunter suffered multiple punctures, despite receiving a spare wheel from teammate Orlando Terranova. He also lost time with mechanical issues, with a tradrod breakage on stage 3 and a minor crash on stage 5, from which he was able to recover from and continue.
 Overheating problems at the start of the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge set the Frenchman back, and he would virtually fall out of title contention with a crash at the Sonora Rally in Mexico.

===Racing===
====Le Mans and sports cars====
As his WRC stature grew, Loeb began to participate in road racing events and tests. He first competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car race in 2005, where he drove for the Pescarolo Sport team&#x27;s No. 17 entry. Reportedly Loeb did much of his preparation for the race by running practice laps around the circuit in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; aboard a private jet. In the race the car was plagued by incidents, but Loeb proved to be able to drive fast for his first race on a closed track. Loeb finished second overall in the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Pescarolo-Judd, between the two Diesel-powered Audi R10.

Free time in his WRC schedule allows him to race in the French GT Championship (FFSA GT) where he drove a Ferrari 550 Prodrive and a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR as well as in the French Carrera Cup where he achieved top-10 finishes. For 2012 Loeb launched Sébastien Loeb Racing which competes in FFSA GT and the European Le Mans Series. Loeb drove for his own team at the Circuit de Pau in the French Carrera Cup and won the race.

====Formula One====
Loeb has had a number of Formula One tests. He first tested for Renault F1 at Paul Ricard in December 2007, in a switch that saw Heikki Kovalainen test Loeb&#x27;s WRC car.
Red Bull, which became a major sponsor of the Citroën factory team during the 2008 season, rewarded Loeb for winning the WRC with a Formula One test in Red Bull Racing&#x27;s 2008-spec Red Bull RB4. He first drove the car at Silverstone, and then took part in the first official Formula One winter test in Barcelona. Loeb was eighth quickest of 17 drivers.

Loeb continued to set his sights on a switch to Formula One in 2009. Following stories that fellow Frenchman Sébastien Bourdais was under threat at Toro Rosso, Loeb told French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; that he was interested in replacing Bourdais at the Red Bull-backed team. He intended to make his F1 debut at the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which took place in November, after the WRC season finished, with a view to making the switch full-time for . However, this plan was scuppered when he was not granted an FIA Super Licence, rendering him ineligible to race in F1 for the foreseeable future as he had not done enough circuit racing at lower levels. He had also been in contact with the US F1 Team about a possible drive for .

Loeb has also taken part in an official GP2 Series testing session after the 2009 season, where he drove for the David Price Racing team, finishing last of 25 drivers.

====FIA GT Series and Porsche Supercup====

Loeb participated in the 2013 FIA GT Series season, driving for Sébastien Loeb Racing which entered two McLaren MP4-12C cars. Loeb paired up with Portuguese driver Álvaro Parente in one of the cars while Frenchman Mike Parisy and Austrian Andreas Zuber were the driver pairing for the other Sébastien Loeb Racing car. Loeb and Parente took a total of three qualifying race wins and one championship race win on their way to fourth place overall in the season. A number of reliability issues and racing incidents prevented the pair from scoring more victories.

Loeb also participated in two races of the 2013 Porsche Supercup season at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and Circuit de Monaco circuits, both events being held as support category races for the 2013 Formula One season. Loeb finished 11th in Spain and 16th in Monaco.

====World Touring Car Championship====

In June 2013 it was confirmed that Citroën were to enter the FIA World Touring Car Championship in 2014 with Loeb driving one of the factory supported cars built for new to 2014 regulations. He was partnered by 4-time WTCC champion, 10-time ice racing champion and fellow Frenchman Yvan Muller, José María López and Ma Qing Hua. In his first full season in circuit racing, Loeb won two races and scored six podiums on his way to third in the championship behind surprise champion Lopez and runner-up Muller. In the next season, he scored four wins and twelve podiums; again finishing third overall though with 61 more points. For the following season, contesting the Dakar Rally meant Loeb switched to Peugeot Sport and was not retained by Citroën for the 2016 WTCC season; which he expressed surprise at as he was hoping to contest for the WTCC title that season.

====FIA World Rallycross Championship====

On 29 February 2016, it was officially revealed that Loeb is going to join the factory backed Swedish Team Peugeot-Hansen to participate in all 12 rounds of the 2016 FIA World Rallycross Championship, together with his Swedish teammate Timmy Hansen. On 2 October, Loeb took his maiden victory in the Latvian round of the world championship. With four podiums and six top fives, he finished fifth in the Supercar class drivers standings. In the next season, he scored six podiums but no wins and finished fourth overall. In his final season, he scored his last win at the World RX of Belgium. He scored seven podiums in total and again finished fourth overall, with 15 more points than the previous season. He returned with Team Special One in 2023, but before the 2023 World RX of Britain, his car set on fire, destroying his, his teammate Guerlane Chicherit and the team&#x27;s truck, ruling them all out of the rest of the season.

====Extreme E====
=====2021=====
In 2020, Loeb Signed with Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s Team X44 for competing in the Extreme E Championship alongside Spanish driver Cristina Gutiérrez. They finished the season in 2nd behind Rosberg X Racing&#x27;s Johan Kristoffersson and Molly Taylor. The teams were level on points but RXR were ahead on virtue of their 3 wins to X44&#x27;s one win.

=====2022=====
A few days after the 2022 Monte Carlo Rally it was announced that Team X44 retained their lineup of Loeb and Gutiérrez for the 2022 Extreme E Championship.

They won the Copper X Prix, bringing them within contention of the title again.

At the Energy X-Prix, Gutiérrez crashed and had to change the chassis, resulting in a penalty. Nonetheless, X44 won the crazy race, enabling them to race the final. Their rivals Rosberg X Racing did not make it to the final. X44 scored five crucial points in the Continental Traction Challenge, and ran fourth during the race, but were promoted to third due to the car ahead getting a Switch Zone speeding penalty. They therefore won the title by two points over RXR.

Loeb and Gutiérrez finished the season with one win, four podiums, one pole and 86 points overall.

====DTM====
Loeb announced he would make a one-off appearance for AlphaTauri AF Corse alongside Felipe Fraga in the DTM Series at their 2022 season opener at the Algarve International Circuit.

<text>Japonski Island (, , ) is a small island in the city of Sitka in the Alexander Archipelago of southeastern Alaska, United States. It lies across the Sitka Channel from Sitka&#x27;s central business district.

The island&#x27;s name was devised during the Russian colonial period in reference to Japanese fishermen who were stranded there in 1805 and returned to Ezo in 1806. The term &quot;Yaponskiy&quot; is the Russian language demonym for Japanese people.

Japonski Island is connected to Baranof Island and Sitka by the O&#x27;Connell Bridge. Before the bridge there was a ferry system similar to that which currently exists in Ketchikan. They carried approximately 1000 passengers a day from 1946 to 1972.

Japonski Island is home to Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport; the Sitka branch campus of the University of Alaska Southeast; Mt. Edgecumbe High School — a state-run boarding school for rural Alaskans; the Indian Health Service regional hospital SEARHC (SouthEast Alaska Regional Healthcare Center); a United States Coast Guard air station; the port and facilities for the USCGC &quot;Kukui&quot;; and the restored boathouse maintained by the Sitka Maritime Heritage Society. Besides the Coast Guard housing complex, there are very few Sitkans who live on Japonski Island. The official population was 269 persons at the 2000 census. The land area of Japonski Island, including the connected nearby much smaller islands such as Virublennoi (Russian for &quot;harvested&quot; or &quot;cut out&quot;), Sasedni (Russian for &quot;neighbor&quot;), Kirushkin (probably a Russian surname), Makhnati (Russian for &quot;shaggy&quot;) and smaller islets, was .

== Demographics ==

Japonski Island appeared once separately on the 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was later annexed into Sitka.

<doc id="944620" wikidata="Q345176" url="?curid=944620" title="Markko Märtin">
<text>Markko Märtin (born 10 November 1975 in Tartu) is a retired rally driver from Estonia, who competed in the World Rally Championship from 2000 until 2005.

==Career==
Märtin, as understudy to then-team mates Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz, rose to prominence with the Ford World Rally Team in the 2002 season. He was leading that year&#x27;s Acropolis Rally Greece until he suffered two punctures and fell behind the more experienced McRae. He won the equivalent event in Greece the following year as well as being only the third driver in the history of the WRC to break the Nordic stranglehold on the Neste Rally Finland. In addition to this, Märtin was inaugural winner, again with Ford, of the Corona Rally Mexico in the 2004 season. He also won the tarmac rallies of Corsica and Catalunya in the same year. These victories were the last for the Märtin/Michael Park partnership.

For 2005 Märtin departed the team for former constructors&#x27; champion Peugeot and its 307 car. He and co-driver Park had still notched up four podium finishes for their new employers by the time they had arrived in Wales to contest the Wales Rally Great Britain. On the final leg of the event, two kilometres from the start of Stage 15 at Margam Park, Märtin&#x27;s Peugeot crashed into a tree. Although the Estonian driver was left unhurt by the crash, co-driver Michael Park was immediately killed in the accident, the first fatality for a competitor at WRC-level for over a decade. As a result, Märtin announced that he would pull out of the last four events of the 2005 season.

Shaken by the death of Park, Märtin effectively left the WRC stage. He went on to manage a junior rallying team in the Estonian rally scene, indicating that he would likely refuse any offers to drive at the top level again. He has since spoken out against the FIA&#x27;s treatment of the WRC, claiming that the series had lost much of its lustre and calling for a far-reaching rules overhaul.

However, Märtin made a limited return to competitive rallying in March 2006 at the 2006 Rally of Portugal. The invitational event was held as a candidate for full WRC status. Märtin competed in a Subaru Impreza, his first outing in an FIA-spec Group N car in nearly a decade. He was co-driven by David Senior, who formerly worked with Alister McRae. Märtin also partook in the 2006 Danish Touring Car Championship with Hans Hartmann&#x27;s Honda Racing.

Märtin signed a deal to become the official test driver for the Subaru World Rally Team in 2008. He has since test-driven for Ford and Mini.

==Life after WRC==
In 2009, Märtin was hired by Ford to work as a R&amp;D factory driver. He helped to train WRC rookie Ken Block for the 2010 WRC season. On 7 June 2010, it was announced that Märtin would race in Rally Estonia, which took place on 16–18 July 2010 and which was also an IRC candidate event. Märtin drove a Ford Focus RS WRC 03, which he referred to as &quot;the best rally car in the world.&quot;
Märtin won all twelve stages, second place, Ott Tänak lost 2.50,3.

Together with his father, Märtin runs a haulage company in Estonia. He also rents out land and property, most prominently a piece of land to Autospirit, an Estonian car dealership. In 2005 he also created MM Motorsport, which won several Estonian Rally Championship titles. The team also has numerous Ford Fiesta R5 for rent.

==Personal life==
Märtin lives in Monaco with Miss Model Estonia 2004 Mari-Liis Sallo and they welcomed their first child together in summer 2007.

Märtin also appeared in the 2019 documentary film &quot;Ott Tänak: The Movie&quot; and in the 2023 film &quot;Legends of the Winding Roads&quot; as one of the interviewees.

<text>Plumage () is a layer of feathers that covers a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies and may vary with age classes. Within species, there can be different colour morphs. The placement of feathers on a bird is not haphazard but rather emerges in organized, overlapping rows and groups, and these are known by standardized names.

Most birds moult twice a year, resulting in a breeding or &quot;nuptial plumage&quot; and a &quot;basic plumage&quot;. Many ducks and some other species such as the red junglefowl have males wearing a bright nuptial plumage while breeding and a drab &quot;eclipse plumage&quot; for some months afterward. The painted bunting&#x27;s juveniles have two inserted moults in their first autumn, each yielding plumage like an adult female. The first starts a few days after fledging replacing the &quot;juvenile plumage&quot; with an &quot;auxiliary formative plumage&quot;; the second a month or so later giving the &quot;formative plumage&quot;.

Abnormal plumages include a variety of conditions. Albinism, total loss of colour, is rare, but partial loss of colours is more common. Some species are colour polymorphic, having two or more colour variants. A few species have special types of polymorphism, as in the male ruff which has an assortment of different colours around the head and neck in the breeding season only.

Hen feathering is an inherited plumage character in domestic fowl controlled by a single gene. &quot;Plumology&quot; (or &quot;plumage science&quot;) is the name for the science that is associated with the study of feathers.

==Humphrey–Parkes (H–P) moult and plumage terminology==
Almost all species of birds moult at least annually, usually after the breeding season, known as the &quot;pre-basic moult&quot;. This resulting covering of feathers, which will last either until the next breeding season or until the next annual moult, is known as the basic plumage. Many species undertake another moult before the breeding season known as the &quot;pre-alternate moult&quot;, the resulting breeding plumage being known as the &quot;alternate plumage&quot; or nuptial plumage. The alternate plumage is often brighter than the basic plumage, for sexual display, but may also be cryptic to hide incubating birds that might be vulnerable on the nest.

The Humphrey–Parkes terminology requires some attention to detail to name moults and plumages correctly.

==Eclipse plumage==

Many male ducks have bright, colourful plumage, exhibiting strong sexual dimorphism. However, they moult into a dull plumage after breeding in mid-summer. This drab, female-like appearance is called &quot;eclipse plumage&quot;. When they shed feathers to go into an eclipse, the ducks become flightless for a short period. Some duck species remain in eclipse for one to three months in the late summer and early fall, while others retain the cryptic plumage until the next spring when they undergo another moult to return to their breeding plumage.

Although mainly found in the Anatidae, a few other species, including related red junglefowl, most fairywrens and some sunbirds also have an eclipse plumage. In the superb and splendid fairywrens, very old males (over about four years) may moult from one nuptial plumage to another whereas in the red-backed and white-winged fairywrens, males do not acquire nuptial plumage until four years of age – well after they become sexually mature and indeed longer than the vast majority of individuals live.

In contrast to the ducks, males of hummingbirds and most lek-mating passerines – like the Guianan cock-of-the-rock or birds of paradise – retain their exuberant plumage and sexual dimorphism at all times, moulting as ordinary birds do once annually.

==Abnormal plumages==
There are hereditary as well as non-hereditary variations in plumage that are rare and termed abnormal or aberrant plumages. Melanism refers to an excess of black or dark colours. Erythromelanism or erythrism is the result of excessive reddish-brown erythromelanin deposition in feathers that normally lack melanin. Melanin of different forms combine with xanthophylls to produce colour mixtures and when this combination is imbalanced it produces colour shifts that are termed schizochroisms (including xanthochromism – an overabundance of yellow – and axanthism – lack of yellow – which are commonly bred in cagebirds such as budgerigars). A reduction in eumelanin leads to non-eumelanin schizochroism with an overall fawn plumage while a lack of phaeomelanin results in grey-coloured non-phaeomelanin schizochroism. Carotenism refers to the abnormal distribution of carotenoid pigments.

The term &quot;dilution&quot; is used for situations where the colour is of a lower intensity overall; it is caused by decreased deposition of pigment in the developing feather, and can thus not occur in structural coloration (i.e., &quot;dilute blue&quot; does not exist); pale structural colors are instead achieved by shifting the peak wavelength at which light is refracted. Dilution regularly occurs in normal plumage (grey, buff, pink and cream colours are usually produced by this process), but may in addition occur as an aberration (e.g., all normally black plumage becoming grey).

In some birds – many true owls (Strigidae), some nightjars (Caprimulgidae) and a few cuckoos (&quot;Cuculus&quot; and relatives) being widely known examples – there is colour polymorphism. This means that two or more colour variants are numerous within their populations during all or at least most seasons and plumages; in the above-mentioned examples a brown (phaeomelanin) and grey (eumelanin) morph exist, termed &quot;hepatic form&quot; particularly in the cuckoos. Other cases of natural polymorphism are of various kinds; many are melanic/nonmelanic (some paradise-flycatchers, &quot;Terpsiphone&quot;, for example), but more unusual types of polymorphism exist – the face colour of the Gouldian finch (&quot;Erythrura&quot;&quot; gouldiae&quot;) or the courtship types of male ruffs (&quot;Philomachus pugnax&quot;).

=== Albinism ===
Albinism in birds is rare, occurring to any extent in perhaps one in 1800 individuals. It involves loss of colour in all parts including the iris of the eyes, bills, skin, legs, and feet. It is usually the result of a genetic mutation causing the absence of tyrosinase, an enzyme essential for melanin synthesis. Leucism (which includes what used to be termed as &quot;partial albinism&quot;) refers to loss of pigments in some or all parts of feathers. A bird that is albino (from the Latin &quot;albus&quot;, &quot;white&quot;) has white feathers in place of coloured ones on some portion of its body. A bird that is naturally white, such as a swan, goose, or egret, is not an albino, nor is a bird that has seasonally alternating white plumage.

Four degrees of albinism have been described. The most common form is termed &quot;partial albinism&quot;, in which local areas of the bird&#x27;s body, such as certain feathers, are lacking the pigment melanin. The white areas may be symmetrical, with both sides of the bird showing a similar pattern. In &quot;imperfect albinism&quot;, the pigment is partially inhibited in the skin, eyes, or feathers, but is not absent from any of them. &quot;Incomplete albinism&quot; is the complete absence of pigment from the skin, eyes, or feathers, but not all three.
A completely albino bird is the most rare. The eyes in this case are pink or red, because blood shows through in the absence of pigment in the irises. The beak, legs, and feet are very pale or white. Albino adults are rare in the wild because their eyesight is poor resulting in greater risk of predation. They are likely easier targets for predators because their colour distinguishes them from their environment. Falconers have observed that their trained birds are likely to attack a white pigeon in a flock because it is conspicuous. A complete albino often has weak eyesight and brittle wing and tail feathers, which may reduce its ability to fly. In flocks, albinos are often harassed by their own species. Such observations have been made among red-winged blackbirds, barn swallows, and African penguins. In a nesting colony of the latter, three unusual juveniles—one black-headed, one white-headed, and one full albino—were shunned and abused by companions.

Albinism has been reported in all orders and in 54 families of North American birds. The American robin and house sparrow led bird species in the incidence of albinism. Albinistic white appears to replace brown pigments more often than red or yellow ones; records suggest a greater incidence in crows, ravens, and hawks than in goldfinches or orioles.

Several kinds of albinism in chickens has been described: A complete albinism controlled by an autosomal recessive gene and two different kinds of partial albinism. One of the partial albinisms is sex-linked and the other is autosomal recessive. A fourth kind of albinism severely reduce pigmentation in the eyes, but only dilutes the pigment in the plumage.

Abnormally white feathers are not always due to albinism. Injury or disease may change their color, including dietary deficiencies or circulatory problems during feather development. Aging may also turn a bird&#x27;s feathers white.

===Hen feathering in cocks===
Hen feathering in cocks is a genetically conditioned character in domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). Males with this condition develop a female-type plumage, although otherwise look and respond like virile males. In some breeds, one can see males that have a plumage completely similar in all aspects to that of females. The trait is controlled by a simple autosomic dominant gene, whose expression is limited to the male sex. The condition is due to an enhanced activity of the aromatase complex of enzymes responsible for estrogen synthesis. So estrogen formation in the skin is as much as several hundred-fold higher than that of normal chickens.

* Melanism (or melanosis), unusually dark melanin pigmentation
* Xanthochromism, unusually yellow pigmentation
* Ino budgerigar mutation, the occurrence of this mutation in captive-bred budgerigars
* Axanthism, lack of yellow pigmentation

<text>Earth&#x27;s energy budget (or Earth&#x27;s energy balance) is the balance between the energy that Earth receives from the Sun and the energy the Earth loses back into outer space. Smaller energy sources, such as Earth&#x27;s internal heat, are taken into consideration, but make a tiny contribution compared to solar energy. The energy budget also takes into account how energy moves through the climate system. The Sun heats the equatorial tropics more than the polar regions. Therefore, the amount of solar irradiance received by a certain region is unevenly distributed. As the energy seeks equilibrium across the planet, it drives interactions in Earth&#x27;s climate system, i.e., Earth&#x27;s water, ice, atmosphere, rocky crust, and all living things. The result is Earth&#x27;s climate.

Earth&#x27;s energy budget depends on many factors, such as atmospheric aerosols, greenhouse gases, surface albedo, clouds, and land use patterns. When the incoming and outgoing energy fluxes are in balance, Earth is in radiative equilibrium and the climate system will be &quot;relatively&quot; stable. Global warming occurs when earth receives more energy than it gives back to space, and global cooling takes place when the outgoing energy is greater.

Multiple types of measurements and observations show a warming imbalance since at least year 1970. The rate of heating from this human-caused event is without precedent. The main origin of changes in the Earth&#x27;s energy is from human-induced changes in the composition of the atmosphere. During 2005 to 2019 the Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) averaged about 460 TW or globally .

It takes time for any changes in the energy budget to result in any significant changes in the global surface temperature. This is due to the thermal inertia of the oceans, land and cryosphere. Most climate models make accurate calculations of this inertia, energy flows and storage amounts.

== Definition ==
Earth&#x27;s energy budget includes the &quot;major energy flows of relevance for the climate system&quot;. These are &quot;the top-of-atmosphere energy budget; the surface energy budget; changes in the global energy inventory and internal flows of energy within the climate system&quot;.

== Earth&#x27;s energy flows ==

In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via solar insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

The main origin of changes in the Earth&#x27;s energy is from human-induced changes in the composition of the atmosphere, amounting to about 460 TW or globally .

=== Incoming solar energy (shortwave radiation) ===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (TOA) is measured in watts and is given by the solar constant times the cross-sectional area of the Earth corresponded to the radiation. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the globally and yearly averaged TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340 watts per square meter (W/m2). Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are multi-year averages obtained from multiple satellite measurements.

Of the ~340 W/m2 of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77 W/m2 is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23 W/m2 is reflected by the surface albedo, leaving ~240 W/m2 of solar energy input to the Earth&#x27;s energy budget. This amount is called the absorbed solar radiation (ASR). It implies a value of about 0.3 for the mean net albedo of Earth, also called its Bond albedo (A):
: formula_1

=== Outgoing longwave radiation ===

Thermal energy leaves the planet in the form of &quot;outgoing longwave radiation&quot; (OLR). Longwave radiation is electromagnetic thermal radiation emitted by Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. Longwave radiation is in the infrared band. But, the terms are not synonymous, as infrared radiation can be either &quot;shortwave&quot; or &quot;longwave&quot;. Sunlight contains significant amounts of shortwave infrared radiation. A threshold wavelength of 4 microns is sometimes used to distinguish longwave and shortwave radiation.

Generally, absorbed solar energy is converted to different forms of heat energy. Some of the solar energy absorbed by the surface is converted to thermal radiation at wavelengths in the &quot;atmospheric window&quot;; this radiation is able to pass through the atmosphere unimpeded and directly escape to space, contributing to OLR. The remainder of absorbed solar energy is transported upwards through the atmosphere through a variety of heat transfer mechanisms, until the atmosphere emits that energy as thermal energy which is able to escape to space, again contributing to OLR. For example, heat is transported into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes or conduction/convection processes, as well as via radiative heat transport. Ultimately, all outgoing energy is radiated into space in the form of longwave radiation.

The transport of longwave radiation from Earth&#x27;s surface through its multi-layered atmosphere is governed by radiative transfer equations such as Schwarzschild&#x27;s equation for radiative transfer (or more complex equations if scattering is present) and obeys Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation.

A one-layer model produces an approximate description of OLR which yields temperatures at the surface (Ts=288 Kelvin) and at the middle of the troposphere (&quot;T&quot;a=242 K) that are close to observed average values:
: formula_2
In this expression &quot;σ&quot; is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and &quot;ε&quot; represents the emissivity of the atmosphere, which is less than 1 because the atmosphere does not emit within the wavelength range known as the atmospheric window.

Aerosols, clouds, water vapor, and trace greenhouse gases contribute to an effective value of about . The strong (fourth-power) temperature sensitivity maintains a near-balance of the outgoing energy flow to the incoming flow via small changes in the planet&#x27;s absolute temperatures.
As viewed from Earth&#x27;s surrounding space, greenhouse gases influence the planet&#x27;s atmospheric emissivity (&quot;ε&quot;). Changes in atmospheric composition can thus shift the overall radiation balance. For example, an increase in heat trapping by a growing concentration of greenhouse gases (i.e. an &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) forces a decrease in OLR and a warming (restorative) energy imbalance. Ultimately when the amount of greenhouse gases increases or decreases, in-situ surface temperatures rise or fall until the absorbed solar radiation equals the outgoing longwave radiation, or ASR equals OLR.

=== Earth&#x27;s internal heat sources and other minor effects ===
The geothermal heat flow from the Earth&#x27;s interior is estimated to be 47 terawatts (TW) and split approximately equally between radiogenic heat and heat left over from the Earth&#x27;s formation. This corresponds to an average flux of 0.087 W/m2 and represents only 0.027% of Earth&#x27;s total energy budget at the surface, being dwarfed by the of incoming solar radiation.

Human production of energy is even lower at an average 18 TW, corresponding to an estimated 160,000 TW-hr, for all of year 2019. However, consumption is growing rapidly and energy production with fossil fuels also produces an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases, leading to a more than 20 times larger imbalance in the incoming/outgoing flows that originate from solar radiation.

Photosynthesis also has a significant effect: An estimated 140 TW (or around 0.08%) of incident energy gets captured by photosynthesis, giving energy to plants to produce biomass. A similar flow of thermal energy is released over the course of a year when plants are used as food or fuel.

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in the calculations, including accretion of interplanetary dust and solar wind, light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, Joseph Fourier had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the greenhouse effect.

== Budget analysis ==
In simplest terms, Earth&#x27;s energy budget is balanced when the incoming flow equals the outgoing flow. Since a portion of incoming energy is directly reflected, the balance can also be stated as absorbed incoming solar (shortwave) radiation equal to outgoing longwave radiation:
: formula_3

=== Internal flow analysis ===
To describe some of the internal flows within the budget, let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (= 340 W/m2), as shown in the accompanying Sankey diagram. Called the albedo of Earth, around 35 units in this example are directly reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units (ASR = 220 W/m2) are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The 51 units reaching and absorbed by the surface are emitted back to space through various forms of terrestrial energy: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of vaporisation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 as absorbed infrared by greenhouse gases). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial energy and 14 from insolation) are then finally radiated back to space. This simplified example neglects some details of mechanisms that recirculate, store, and thus lead to further buildup of heat near the surface.

Ultimately the 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) are emitted as OLR. They approximately balance the 65 units (ASR) absorbed from the sun in order to maintain a net-zero gain of energy by Earth.

=== Heat storage reservoirs ===
 Land, ice, and oceans are active material constituents of Earth&#x27;s climate system along with the atmosphere. They have far greater mass and heat capacity, and thus much more thermal inertia. When radiation is directly absorbed or the surface temperature changes, thermal energy will flow as sensible heat either into or out of the bulk mass of these components via conduction/convection heat transfer processes. The transformation of water between its solid/liquid/vapor states also acts as a source or sink of potential energy in the form of latent heat. These processes buffer the surface conditions against some of the rapid radiative changes in the atmosphere. As a result, the daytime versus nighttime difference in surface temperatures is relatively small. Likewise, Earth&#x27;s climate system as a whole shows a slow response to shifts in the atmospheric radiation balance.

The top few meters of Earth&#x27;s oceans harbor more thermal energy than its entire atmosphere. Like atmospheric gases, fluidic ocean waters transport vast amounts of such energy over the planet&#x27;s surface. Sensible heat also moves into and out of great depths under conditions that favor downwelling or upwelling.

Over 90 percent of the extra energy that has accumulated on Earth from ongoing global warming since 1970 has been stored in the ocean. About one-third has propagated to depths below 700 meters. The overall rate of growth has also risen during recent decades, reaching close to 500 TW (1 W/m2) as of 2020. That led to about 14 zettajoules (ZJ) of heat gain for the year, exceeding the 570 exajoules (=160,000 TW-hr) of total primary energy consumed by humans by a factor of at least 20.

=== Heating/cooling rate analysis ===
Generally speaking, changes to Earth&#x27;s energy flux balance can be thought of as being the result of external forcings (both natural and anthropogenic, radiative and non-radiative), system feedbacks, and internal system variability. Such changes are primarily expressed as observable shifts in temperature (T), clouds (C), water vapor (W), aerosols (A), trace greenhouse gases (G), land/ocean/ice surface reflectance (S), and as minor shifts in insolaton (I) among other possible factors. Earth&#x27;s heating/cooling rate can then be analyzed over selected timeframes (Δt) as the net change in energy (ΔE) associated with these attributes:
:formula_4

Here the term ΔET, corresponding to the Planck response, is negative-valued when temperature rises due to its strong direct influence on OLR.

The recent increase in trace greenhouse gases produces an enhanced greenhouse effect, and thus a positive ΔEG forcing term. By contrast, a large volcanic eruption (e.g. Mount Pinatubo 1991, El Chichón 1982) can inject sulfur-containing compounds into the upper atmosphere. High concentrations of stratospheric sulfur aerosols may persist for up to a few years, yielding a negative forcing contribution to ΔEA. Various other types of anthropogenic aerosol emissions make both positive and negative contributions to ΔEA. Solar cycles produce ΔEI smaller in magnitude than those of recent ΔEG trends from human activity.

Climate forcings are complex since they can produce direct and indirect feedbacks that intensify (positive feedback) or weaken (negative feedback) the original forcing. These often follow the temperature response. Water vapor trends as a positive feedback with respect to temperature changes due to evaporation shifts and the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. An increase in water vapor results in positive ΔEW due to further enhancement of the greenhouse effect. A slower positive feedback is the ice-albedo feedback. For example, the loss of Arctic ice due to rising temperatures makes the region less reflective, leading to greater absorption of energy and even faster ice melt rates, thus positive influence on ΔES. Collectively, feedbacks tend to amplify global warming or cooling.

Clouds are responsible for about half of Earth&#x27;s albedo and are powerful expressions of internal variability of the climate system. They may also act as feedbacks to forcings, and could be forcings themselves if for example a result of cloud seeding activity. Contributions to ΔEC vary regionally and depending upon cloud type. Measurements from satellites are gathered in concert with simulations from models in an effort to improve understanding and reduce uncertainty.

== Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) ==

The Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) is defined as &quot;the persistent and positive (downward) net top of atmosphere energy flux associated with greenhouse gas forcing of the climate system&quot;.

If Earth&#x27;s incoming energy flux (ASR) is larger or smaller than the outgoing energy flux (OLR), then the planet will gain (warm) or lose (cool) net heat energy in accordance with the law of energy conservation: 
: formula_5.
Positive EEI thus defines the overall rate of planetary heating and is typically expressed as watts per square meter (W/m2). During 2005 to 2019 the Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance averaged about 460 TW or globally 0.90 ± 0.15 W per m2.

When Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) shifts by a sufficiently large amount, the shift is measurable by orbiting satellite-based instruments. Imbalances that fail to reverse over time will also drive long-term temperature changes in the atmospheric, oceanic, land, and ice components of the climate system. Temperature, sea level, ice mass and related shifts thus also provide measures of EEI.

The biggest changes in EEI arise from changes in the composition of the atmosphere through human activities, thereby interfering with the natural flow of energy through the climate system. The main changes are from increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, that produce heating (positive EEI), and pollution. The latter refers to atmospheric aerosols of various kinds, some of which absorb energy while others reflect energy and produce cooling (or lower EEI).  
It is not (yet) possible to measure the absolute magnitude of EEI directly at top of atmosphere, although &quot;changes over time&quot; as observed by satellite-based instruments are thought to be accurate. The only practical way to estimate the absolute magnitude of EEI is through an inventory of the changes in energy in the climate system. The biggest of these energy reservoirs is the ocean.

=== Energy inventory assessments ===

The planetary heat content that resides in the climate system can be compiled given the heat capacity, density and temperature distributions of each of its components. Most regions are now reasonably well sampled and monitored, with the most significant exception being the deep ocean.
Estimates of the absolute magnitude of EEI have likewise been calculated using the measured temperature changes during recent multi-decadal time intervals. For the 2006 to 2020 period EEI was about and showed a significant increase above the mean of for the 1971 to 2020 period.

EEI has been positive because temperatures have increased almost everywhere for over 50 years. Global surface temperature (GST) is calculated by averaging temperatures measured at the surface of the sea along with air temperatures measured over land. Reliable data extending to at least 1880 shows that GST has undergone a steady increase of about 0.18 °C per decade since about year 1970.

Ocean waters are especially effective absorbents of solar energy and have a far greater total heat capacity than the atmosphere. Research vessels and stations have sampled sea temperatures at depth and around the globe since before 1960. Additionally, after the year 2000, an expanding network of nearly 4000 Argo robotic floats has measured the temperature anomaly, or equivalently the ocean heat content change (ΔOHC). Since at least 1990, OHC has increased at a steady or accelerating rate. ΔOHC represents the largest portion of EEI since oceans have thus far taken up over 90% of the net excess energy entering the system over time (Δt):
: formula_6.

Earth&#x27;s outer crust and thick ice-covered regions have taken up relatively little of the excess energy. This is because excess heat at their surfaces flows inward only by means of thermal conduction, and thus penetrates only several tens of centimeters on the daily cycle and only several tens of meters on the annual cycle. Much of the heat uptake goes either into melting ice and permafrost or into evaporating more water from soils.

=== Measurements at top of atmosphere (TOA) ===

Several satellites measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth, and thus by inference the energy imbalance. These are located top of atmosphere (TOA) and provide data covering the globe. The NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) project involved three such satellites: the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.
NASA&#x27;s Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments are part of its Earth Observing System (EOS) since March 2000. CERES is designed to measure both solar-reflected (short wavelength) and Earth-emitted (long wavelength) radiation. The CERES data showed increases in EEI from in 2005 to in 2019. Contributing factors included more water vapor, less clouds, increasing greenhouse gases, and declining ice that were partially offset by rising temperatures. Subsequent investigation of the behavior using the GFDL CM4/AM4 climate model concluded there was a less than 1% chance that internal climate variability alone caused the trend.

Other researchers have used data from CERES, AIRS, CloudSat, and other EOS instruments to look for trends of radiative forcing embedded within the EEI data. Their analysis showed a forcing rise of from years 2003 to 2018. About 80% of the increase was associated with the rising concentration of greenhouse gases which reduced the outgoing longwave radiation.

Further satellite measurements including TRMM and CALIPSO data have indicated additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting some of the increase in the longwave greenhouse flux to the surface.

It is noteworthy that radiometric calibration uncertainties limit the capability of the current generation of satellite-based instruments, which are otherwise stable and precise. As a result, relative changes in EEI are quantifiable with an accuracy which is not also achievable for any single measurement of the absolute imbalance.

=== Geodetic and hydrographic surveys ===
Observations since 1994 show that ice has retreated from every part of Earth at an accelerating rate. Mean global sea level has likewise risen as a consequence of the ice melt in combination with the overall rise in ocean temperatures.
These shifts have contributed measurable changes to the geometric shape and gravity of the planet.

Changes to the mass distribution of water within the hydrosphere and cryosphere have been deduced using gravimetric observations by the GRACE satellite instruments. These data have been compared against ocean surface topography and further hydrographic observations using computational models that account for thermal expansion, salinity changes, and other factors. Estimates thereby obtained for ΔOHC and EEI have agreed with the other (mostly) independent assessments within uncertainties.

=== Importance as a climate change metric ===

Climate scientists Kevin Trenberth, James Hansen, and colleagues have identified the monitoring of Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance as an important metric to help policymakers guide the pace for mitigation and adaptation measures. Because of climate system inertia, longer-term EEI (Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance) trends can forecast further changes that are &quot;in the pipeline&quot;.

Scientists found that the EEI is the most important metric related to climate change. It is the net result of all the processes and feedbacks in play in the climate system. Knowing how much extra energy affects weather systems and rainfall is vital to understand the increasing weather extremes.

In 2012, NASA scientists reported that to stop global warming atmospheric CO2 concentration would have to be reduced to 350 ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. As of 2020, atmospheric CO2 reached 415 ppm and all long-lived greenhouse gases exceeded a 500 ppm -equivalent concentration due to continued growth in human emissions.

<doc id="944644" wikidata="Q3437802" url="?curid=944644" title="American rock">
<text>American rock has its roots from 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and country music, and also draws from folk music, jazz, blues, and classical music. American rock music was further influenced by the British Invasion of the American pop charts from 1964 and resulted in the development of psychedelic rock.

From the late 1960s and early 1970s, American rock music was highly influential in the development of a number of fusion genres, including blending with folk music to create folk rock, with blues to create blues rock, with country music to create country rock, roots rock and Southern rock and with jazz to create jazz rock, all of which contributed to psychedelic rock. In the 1970s, rock developed a large number of subgenres, such as soft rock, hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock, progressive rock and punk rock.

New subgenres that were derived from punk and important in the 1980s included new wave, hardcore punk, post-punk, thrash, and alternative rock. In the 1990s, alternative rock broke through into the mainstream with grunge, and other significant subgenres included indie rock and nu metal. In the 2000s genres that emerged into the mainstream included emo, metalcore and there was a garage rock/post-punk revival. The development of digital technology led to the development of new forms of digital electronic rock.

== Rock and roll (1950s to early 1960s) ==
=== Origins ===
The foundations of American rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music; in addition to country and western. In 1951, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to describe the music.

There is much debate as to what should be considered the first rock and roll record. One contender is &quot;Rocket 88&quot; by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (in fact, Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in Memphis in 1951. It has been argued that &quot;That&#x27;s All Right (Mama)&quot; (1954), Elvis Presley&#x27;s first major single for Sun Records was the first rock and roll record, but, at the same time, Big Joe Turner&#x27;s &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot;, later covered by Bill Haley, was already at the top of the Billboard R&amp;B charts. Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1955) became the first rock and roll song to top Billboard magazine&#x27;s main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture. Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and crooners, such as Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, and Patti Page, who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.

=== Diversification ===
Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with &quot;hillbilly&quot; country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley. In contrast doo wop placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 40s African American vocal groups. Acts like The Crows, The Penguins, The El Dorados and The Turbans all scored major hits, and groups like The Platters, with songs including &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; (1955), and The Coasters with humorous songs like &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period. The era also saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar, and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore. Also significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force. It developed out of rhythm and blues with a re-injection of gospel music and pop and was led by pioneers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke from the mid-1950s. By the early 60s figures like Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were dominating the R&amp;B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts, helping to accelerate their desegregation, while Motown and Stax/Volt Records were becoming major forces in the record industry. All of these elements, including the close harmonies of doo wop and girl groups, the carefully crafted song-writing of the Brill Building Sound and the polished production values of soul, have been seen as influencing the Merseybeat sound, particularly the early work of The Beatles, and through them and others the form of later rock music. Some historians of music have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period, particularly the Wall of Sound pursued by Phil Spector.

=== &quot;Decline&quot; ===

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the initial rock and roll era had come to an end. More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible. While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early 60s, mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker. Having died down in the late 1950s, doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period, with hits for acts like The Marcels, The Capris, Maurice Williams and Shep and the Limelights. The rise of girl groups like The Chantels, The Shirelles and The Crystals placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll. Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the Brill Building Sound, named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based, which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; in 1960, penned by the partnership of Gerry Goffin and Carole King.

=== Surf music ===
The instrumental rock and roll pioneered by performers such as Duane Eddy, Link Wray, and The Ventures was developed by Dick Dale who added distinctive &quot;wet&quot; reverb, rapid alternate picking, as well as Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, producing the regional hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot; in 1961 and launching the surf music craze. Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the Bel-Airs, The Challengers, and Eddie &amp; the Showmen. The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with &quot;Pipeline&quot; in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963&#x27;s &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965. The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand. These included The Astronauts, from Boulder, Colorado, The Trashmen, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who had a number 4 hit with &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; in 1964 and The Rivieras from South Bend, Indiana, who reached number 5 in 1964 with &quot;California Sun&quot;. The Atlantics, from Sydney, Australia, made a significant contribution to the genre, with their hit &quot;Bombora&quot; (1963).

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of the Beach Boys, formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock (among them covers of music by Dick Dale) and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the Four Freshmen. Their first chart hit, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; in 1962 reached the Billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon. From 1963 the group began to leave surfing behind as subject matter as Brian Wilson became their major composer and producer, moving on to the more general themes of male adolescence including cars and girl in songs like &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; (1964) and &quot;California Girls&quot; (1965). Other vocal surf acts followed, including one-hit wonders like Ronny &amp; the Daytonas with &quot;G. T. O.&quot; (1964) and Rip Chords with &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;, which both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were Jan &amp; Dean, who had a number 1 hit with &quot;Surf City&quot; (co-written with Brian Wilson) in 1963. The surf music craze, and the careers of almost all surf acts, was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964. Only the Beach Boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid-1960s, producing a string of hit singles and albums, including the highly regarded &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in 1966, which made them, arguably, the only American rock or pop act that could rival The Beatles.

== Development (mid-to-late 1960s) ==

=== The British Invasion ===
By the end of 1962 British beat groups like The Beatles were drawing on a wide range of American influences including soul music, rhythm and blues and surf music. Initially, they reinterpreted standard American tunes, playing for dancers doing the twist, for example. These groups eventually infused their original compositions with increasingly complex musical ideas and a distinctive sound. During 1963, The Beatles and other beat groups, such as The Searchers and The Hollies, achieved popularity and commercial success in Britain.

British rock broke through to mainstream popularity in the United States in January 1964 with the success of the Beatles. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was the band&#x27;s first number 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, starting the British Invasion of the American music charts. The song entered the chart on January 18, 1964, at number 45 before it became the number 1 single for 7 weeks and went on to last a total of 15 weeks in the chart. Their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show February 9 is considered a milestone in American pop culture. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for an American television program. The Beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed by numerous British bands, particularly those influenced by blues music including The Rolling Stones, The Animals and The Yardbirds.

The British Invasion arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music, vocal girl groups and (for a time) the teen idols, that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and early 60s. It dented the careers of established R&amp;B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts, including Elvis. The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music, and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters.

=== Garage rock ===

Garage rock was a raw form of rock music, prevalent in North America in the mid-1960s, and called so because of the perception that it was rehearsed in a suburban family garage. Garage rock songs revolved around the traumas of high school life, with songs about &quot;lying girls&quot; being particularly common. The lyrics and delivery were more aggressive than was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming. They ranged from crude one-chord music (like the Seeds) to near-studio musician quality (including the Knickerbockers, the Remains, and the Fifth Estate). There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas. The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound.
The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958. &quot;Tall Cool One&quot; (1959) by The Wailers and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by The Kingsmen (1963) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages. By 1963, garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers, including Paul Revere and the Raiders (Boise), the Trashmen (Minneapolis) and the Rivieras (South Bend, Indiana). Other influential garage bands, such as the Sonics (Tacoma, Washington), never reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In this early period many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and there was a cross-pollination between garage rock and frat rock, sometimes viewed as merely a subgenre of garage rock.

The British Invasion of 1964–66 greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many (often surf or hot rod groups) to adopt a British Invasion lilt, and encouraging many more groups to form. Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits. Examples include: &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Care&quot; by New York City&#x27;s The D-Men (1965), &quot;The Witch&quot; by Tacoma&#x27;s The Sonics (1965), &quot;Where You Gonna Go&quot; by Detroit&#x27;s Unrelated Segments (1967), &quot;Girl I Got News for You&quot; by Miami&#x27;s Birdwatchers (1966) and &quot;1–2–5&quot; by Montreal&#x27;s The Haunted. Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels, most were commercial failures. It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966. By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college, work or the draft. New styles had evolved to replace garage rock (including blues-rock, progressive rock and country rock). In Detroit garage rock stayed alive until the early 70s, with bands like the MC5 and The Stooges, who employed a much more aggressive style. These bands began to be labelled punk rock and are now often seen as proto-punk or proto-hard rock.
=== Blues rock ===
In America blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist Lonnie Mack, but the genre began to take off in the US the mid-60s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included Paul Butterfield (whose band acted like Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), Canned Heat, the early Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, The J. Geils Band and Jimi Hendrix with his power trios, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade.

Early blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock. From about 1967 bands like Cream had begun to move away from purely blues-based music into psychedelia. By the 1970s blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of British bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues rock and hard rock &quot;were barely visible&quot;, as bands began recording rock-style albums. The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood, but bands became focused on heavy metal innovation, and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.

=== Folk rock ===
By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement, using traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments. In America the genre was pioneered by figures such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and often identified with progressive or labor politics. In the early sixties figures such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan had come to the fore in this movement as singer-songwriters. Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; (1963) and &quot;Masters of War&quot; (1963), which brought &quot;protest songs&quot; to a wider public, but, although beginning to influence each other, rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with mutually exclusive audiences.

The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with The Byrds&#x27; recording of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; which topped the charts in 1965. With members who had been part of the cafe-based folk scene in Los Angeles, the Byrds adopted rock instrumentation, including drums and 12-string Rickenbacker guitars, which became a major element in the sound of the genre. Later that year Dylan adopted electric instruments, much to the outrage of many folk purists, with his &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; becoming a US hit single. Folk rock particularly took off in California, where it led acts like The Mamas &amp; the Papas and Crosby, Stills and Nash to move to electric instrumentation, and in New York, where it spawned performers including The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and Simon and Garfunkel, with the latter&#x27;s acoustic &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits.

Folk rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967-8, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Dylan and the Byrds, who began to develop country rock. However, the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music, bringing in elements of psychedelia, and helping to develop the ideas of the singer-songwriter, the protest song and concepts of &quot;authenticity&quot;.

=== Psychedelic rock ===
Psychedelic music&#x27;s LSD-inspired vibe began in the folk scene, with the New York-based Holy Modal Rounders using the term in their 1964 recording of &quot;Hesitation Blues&quot;. The first group to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock were the 13th Floor Elevators from Texas, at the end of 1965; producing an album that made their direction clear, with &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; the following year.

Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California&#x27;s emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds from folk to folk rock from 1965. The psychedelic life style had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were The Grateful Dead, Country Joe and the Fish, The Great Society and Jefferson Airplane. The Byrds rapidly progressed from purely folk rock in 1966 with their single &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, widely taken to be a reference to drug use.

Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade. The Summer of Love of 1967 was prefaced by the Human Be-In event and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival, the latter helping to make a major American star of Jimi Hendrix. Key recordings included Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; and The Doors&#x27; &quot;Strange Days&quot;. These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts, but by the end of the decade psychedelic rock was in retreat. The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream broke up and many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into more back-to-basics &quot;roots rock&quot;, the wider experimentation of progressive rock, or riff-laden heavy rock.

== Roots rock (late 1960s to early 1970s) ==
Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly country and folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock. In 1966 Bob Dylan went to Nashville to record the album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend included the Californian-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, who mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George, and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Banquet&quot; (1968) and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970).

=== Country rock ===

In 1968 Gram Parsons recorded &quot;Safe at Home&quot; with the International Submarine Band, arguably the first true country-rock album. Later that year he joined the Byrds for &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; (1968), generally considered one of the most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming The Flying Burrito Brothers who helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career. Country rock was particularly popular in the Californian music scene, where it was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers, Poco and New Riders of the Purple Sage, the Beau Brummels and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers; one-time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band; and Neil Young. The Dillards were, unusually, a country act, who moved towards rock music. The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with artist including the Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles (made up of members of the Burritos, Poco and Stone Canyon Band), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976).

=== Southern rock ===
The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from blues rock, but incorporating elements of boogie, soul, and country in the early 1970s. The most successful act to follow them were Lynyrd Skynyrd, who helped establish the &quot;good ol&#x27; boy&quot; image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s guitar rock. Their successors included the fusion/progressive instrumentalists Dixie Dregs, the more country-influenced Outlaws, jazz-leaning Wet Willie and (incorporating elements of R&amp;B and gospel) the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like .38 Special, Molly Hatchet and The Marshall Tucker Band.

== New genres (the early 1970s) ==

=== Progressive rock ===
Progressive rock, a term sometimes used interchangeably with art rock, was an attempt to move beyond established musical formulas by experimenting with different instruments, song types, and forms. From the mid-1960s groups including The Left Banke and The Beach Boys, had pioneered the inclusion of harpsichords, wind and string sections on their recordings to produce a form of Baroque rock. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy and science fiction. The American brand of prog rock varied from the eclectic and innovative Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart and Blood, Sweat and Tears, to more pop rock orientated bands like Boston, Foreigner, Kansas, Journey and Styx. These, beside British bands Supertramp and Electric Light Orchestra, all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s, issuing in the era of &quot;pomp&quot; or &quot;arena rock&quot;, which would last until the costs of complex shows (often with theatrical staging and special effects), would be replaced by more economical rock festivals as major live venues in the 1990s.

=== Glam rock ===

Glam rock was prefigured by the showmanship and gender identity manipulation of American acts such as The Cockettes and Alice Cooper. It emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and reaction against, those trends. Musically it was very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism to complex art rock, and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical subgenre. Visually it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamor, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war Cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics. The success of British artists like David Bowie led to the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as &quot;glitter rock&quot; and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.

=== Soft and hard rock ===
From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included Carole King, James Taylor and America. It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late- 70s with acts like Billy Joel and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade. In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was played louder and with more intensity. It often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like The Who and The Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and The Jeff Beck Group and American bands including Iron Butterfly, MC5, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge. Hard rock-influenced bands that enjoyed international success in the 1970s included Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all-American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973, and were followed by bands like Aerosmith.

=== Early heavy metal ===

From the late 1960s the term heavy metal began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity, first as an adjective and by the early 1970s as a noun. The term was first used in music in Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; (1967) and began to be associated with pioneer bands like Boston&#x27;s Blue Cheer and Michigan&#x27;s Grand Funk Railroad. By 1970 three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre. Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues-rock, Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phrase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony, helping to produce a &quot;darker&quot; sound. These elements were taken up by a &quot;second generation&quot; of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s, including Kiss, Ted Nugent and Blue Öyster Cult from the US. Despite a lack of airplay and very little presence on the singles charts, late-1970s heavy metal built a considerable following, particularly among adolescent working-class males in North America and Europe.

=== Christian rock ===
Rock has been criticized by some Christian religious leaders, who have condemned it as immoral, anti-Christian and even demonic. However, Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s, particularly out of the Jesus movement beginning in Southern California, and emerged as a subgenre in the 1970s with artists like Larry Norman, usually seen as the first major &quot;star&quot; of Christian rock. The genre has been particularly popular in the United States. Many Christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary Christian music scene, while other bands and artists are closely linked to independent music. Since the 1980s Christian rock performers have gained mainstream success, including figures such as the American gospel-to-pop crossover artist Amy Grant. While these artists were largely acceptable in Christian communities the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles by bands like Petra and Stryper, who achieved considerable mainstream success in the 1980s, was more controversial. From the 1990s there were increasing numbers of acts who attempted to avoid the Christian band label, preferring to be seen as groups who were also Christians, including P.O.D and Collective Soul.

== Punk and its aftermath (mid-1970s to the 1980s) ==

=== Punk rock ===
Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels. By late 1976, acts such as the Ramones and Patti Smith, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and The Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive clothing styles and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. Since punk rock&#x27;s initial popularity in the 1970s and the renewed interest created by the punk revival of the 1990s, punk rock continues to have a strong underground following. A more extreme variation of punk rock, hardcore punk emerged from local scenes, particularly in Los Angeles and New York and taking root in Washington DC, Boston, and San Francisco. With louder, faster and usually shorter songs with shouted or screamed vocals it spawned bands like the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat and Black Flag.

=== New wave ===
Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales, or American radio airplay (as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album-oriented rock). Punk rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate, arty approach, such as Talking Heads, and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene; in some quarters the description &quot;New Wave&quot; began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands. Record executives, who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement, recognized the potential of the more accessible New Wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave. Many of these bands, such as The Cars, The Runaways and The Go-Go&#x27;s can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave; other existing acts, while &quot;skinny tie&quot; bands exemplified by The Knack, or the photogenic Blondie, began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory.

=== Post-punk ===

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 80s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were The Velvet Underground, The Who, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New York-based no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, DNA and Sonic Youth. Early contributors to the genre included the US bands Pere Ubu, Devo, The Residents and Talking Heads. Although many post-punk bands continued to record and perform, it declined as a movement in the mid-1980s as acts disbanded or moved off to explore other musical other areas, but it has continued to influence the development of rock music and has been seen as a major element in the creation of the alternative rock movement.

=== Glam and extreme metal ===
In the late 1970s Eddie Van Halen established himself as a metal guitar virtuoso after his band&#x27;s self-titled 1978 album.
Inspired by Van Halen&#x27;s success and the new wave of British heavy metal, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California from the late 1970s, based on the clubs of L.A.&#x27;s Sunset Strip and including such bands as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Mötley Crüe, and W.A.S.P., who, along with similarly styled acts such as New York&#x27;s Twisted Sister, incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam rock acts like Alice Cooper and Kiss. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior and musically were distinguished by rapid-fire shred guitar solos, anthemic choruses, and a relatively melodic, pop-oriented approach. By the mid-1980s bands were beginning to emerge from the L.A. scene that pursued a less glam image and a rawer sound, particularly Guns N&#x27; Roses, breaking through with the chart-topping &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), and Jane&#x27;s Addiction, who emerged with their major label debut &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;, the following year.

In the late 1980s metal fragmented into several subgenres, including thrash metal, which developed in the US from the style known as speed metal, under the influence of hardcore punk, with low-register guitar riffs typically overlaid by shredding leads. Lyrics often expressed nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. It was popularised by the &quot;Big Four of Thrash&quot;: Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Death metal developed out of thrash, particularly influenced by the bands Venom and Slayer. Florida&#x27;s Death and the Bay Area&#x27;s Possessed emphasized lyrical elements of blasphemy, diabolism and millenarianism, with vocals usually delivered as guttural &quot;death growls&quot;, high-pitched screaming, complemented by downtuned, highly distorted guitars and extremely fast double bass percussion.

=== Heartland rock ===
American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, blue collar American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll. It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South. Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and new wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison, and the basic rock of 60s garage and the Rolling Stones.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty, along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism. The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the USA&quot; (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including John Mellencamp, Steve Earle and more gentle singer/songwriters as Bruce Hornsby. It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel and Tracy Chapman.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland&#x27;s artists turned to more personal works. Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri&#x27;s Bottle Rockets and Illinois&#x27; Uncle Tupelo, found themselves labeled alt-country.

=== Emergence of alternative rock ===
The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed &quot;alternative&quot; had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements. Important bands of the 1980s alternative movement in the US included R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Sonic Youth and the Pixies. Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth. Few of these bands, with the exception of R.E.M., achieved mainstream success, but despite a lack of spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 80s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the U.S. during the 1980s included jangle pop, associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as 10,000 Maniacs and The Feelies.

== Alternative goes mainstream (the 1990s) ==

=== Grunge ===
By the early 1990s, rock was dominated by commercialized and highly produced pop, rock, and &quot;hair metal&quot; artists, while MTV had arrived and promoted a focus on image and style. Disaffected by this trend, in the mid-1980s, bands in Washington state (particularly in the Seattle area) formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music of the time. The developing genre came to be known as &quot;grunge&quot;, a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who actively rebelled against the over-groomed images of popular artists. Grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback. The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock.

Bands such as Green River, Soundgarden, the Melvins and Skin Yard pioneered the genre, with Mudhoney becoming the most successful by the end of the decade. However, grunge remained largely a local phenomenon until 1991, when Nirvana‘s &quot;Nevermind&quot; became a huge success thanks to the lead single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. &quot;Nevermind&quot; was more melodic than its predecessors, but the band refused to employ traditional corporate promotion and marketing mechanisms. During 1991 and 1992, other grunge albums such as Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;, Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; and Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot;, along with the &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; album featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, became among the 100 top selling albums. The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to nickname Seattle &quot;the new Liverpool.&quot; Major record labels signed most of the remaining grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of acts moved to the city in the hope of success. However, with the death of Kurt Cobain and the subsequent break-up of Nirvana in 1994, touring problems for Pearl Jam and the departure of Alice in Chains&#x27; lead singer Layne Staley in 1996, the genre began to decline, partly to be overshadowed by Britpop and more commercial sounding post-grunge.

=== Post-grunge ===
The term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream, and subsequent hiatus, of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound. Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, punk-pop, alternative metal or hard rock. The term post-grunge was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an &quot;authentic&quot; rock movement. From 1994, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl&#x27;s new band, the Foo Fighters, helped popularize the genre and define its parameters.

Some post-grunge bands, like Candlebox, were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like Los Angeles&#x27; Audioslave, and Georgia&#x27;s Collective Soul, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the late 1990s. Although male bands predominated, female solo artist Alanis Morissette&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, labelled as post-grunge, also became a multi-platinum hit. Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown, Seether and 3 Doors Down.

=== Pop punk ===
The origins of 1990s punk pop can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like The Buzzcocks and The Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as The Jam and The Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid, Pennywise, Weezer and Green Day. In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album &quot;Dookie&quot;, which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous début from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US. This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band The Offspring with &quot;Smash&quot; (1994). This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997) and The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Americana&quot; (1998).

A second wave of punk pop was spearheaded by Blink-182, with their breakthrough album &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999), followed by bands such as Good Charlotte, Bowling for Soup and Sum 41, who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk. Later pop-punk bands, including Simple Plan, All-American Rejects and Fall Out Boy, had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving considerable commercial success.

=== Indie rock ===
In the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably. By the mid-1990s, as elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge and pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning. Those bands following the less commercial contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie. They characteristically attempted to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying on touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion. Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge influenced bands like Superchunk, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. It has been noted that indie rock has a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of feminist-informed Riot Grrrl music.

By the end of the 1990s many recognisable subgenres, most with their origins in the late 80s alternative movement, were included under the umbrella of indie. Lo-fi eschewed polished recording techniques for a D.I.Y. ethos and was spearheaded by Beck, Sebadoh and Pavement. The work of Talk Talk and Slint helped inspire both post rock, an experimental style influenced by jazz and electronic music, taken up by acts such as Tortoise, as well as leading to more dense and complex, guitar-based math rock, developed by acts like Polvo and Chavez. Sadcore emphasised pain and suffering through melodic use of acoustic and electronic instrumentation in the music of bands like American Music Club and Red House Painters, while the revival of Baroque pop reacted against lo-fi and experimental music by placing an emphasis on melody and classical instrumentation, with artists like Rufus Wainright.

=== Alternative metal, rap rock and nu metal ===
Alternative metal emerged from the hardcore scene of alternative rock in the US in the later 1980s, but gained a wider audience after grunge broke into the mainstream in the early 1990s. Early alternative metal bands mixed a wide variety of genres with hardcore and heavy metal sensibilities, with acts like Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Primus using prog-rock, Soundgarden and Corrosion of Conformity using garage punk, The Jesus Lizard and Helmet mixing noise-rock, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails influenced by industrial music, Monster Magnet moving into psychedelia, Pantera and White Zombie creating groove metal, while Biohazard and Faith No More turned to hip hop and rap.

Hip hop had gained attention from rock acts in the early 1980s, including The Clash with &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1981) and Blondie with &quot;Rapture&quot; (1981). Early crossover acts included Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. Detroit rapper Esham became known for his &quot;acid rap&quot; style, which fused rapping with a sound that was often based in rock and heavy metal. Rappers who sampled rock songs included Ice-T, The Fat Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and Whodini. The mixing of thrash metal and rap was pioneered by Anthrax on their 1987 comedy-influenced single &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;.
In 1990, Faith No More broke into the mainstream with their single &quot;Epic&#x27;, often seen as the first truly successful combination of heavy metal with rap. This paved the way for the success of existing bands like 24-7 Spyz and Living Colour, and new acts including Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers, who all fused rock and hip hop among other influences. Among the first wave of performers to gain mainstream success as rap rock were 311, Bloodhound Gang, and Kid Rock. A more metallic sound – &quot;nu metal&quot; – was pursued by bands including Limp Bizkit, Korn and Slipknot. Later in the decade this style, which contained a mix of grunge, punk, metal, rap and turntable scratching, spawned a wave of successful bands like Linkin Park, P.O.D. and Staind, who were often classified as rap metal or nu metal, the first of which are the best-selling band of the genre.

In 2001, nu metal reached its peak with albums like Staind&#x27;s &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;, P.O.D&#x27;s &quot;Satellite&quot;, Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Iowa&quot; and Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. New bands also emerged like Disturbed, post-grunge-hard rock band Godsmack and Breaking Benjamin, and even Papa Roach, whose major label début &quot;Infest&quot; became a platinum hit. However, by 2002 there were signs that nu metal&#x27;s mainstream popularity was weakening. Korn&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Untouchables&quot;, and Papa Roach&#x27;s second album &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;, did not sell as well as their previous releases, while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and MTV began focusing on pop punk and emo. However, Korn&#x27;s album &quot;Untouchables&quot; went platinum and its single &quot;Here to Stay&quot; peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number one on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live twice. Also, nu metal band Evanescence became extremely popular in 2003 and Linkin Park continued having much mainstream success. After the early 2000s, many nu metal bands changed their style, with alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock and standard heavy metal being examples of the genres nu metal bands changed to.

=== Emo ===
Emo emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s Washington, D.C., initially as &quot;emocore&quot;, used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive, barking style. The style was pioneered by bands Rites of Spring and Embrace, the last formed by Ian MacKaye, whose Dischord Records became a major centre for the emerging D.C. emo scene, releasing work by Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty, Nation of Ulysses and Fugazi. Fugazi emerged as the definitive early emo band, gaining a fanbase among alternative rock followers, not least for their overtly anti-commercial stance. The early emo scene operated as an underground, with short-lived bands releasing small-run vinyl records on tiny independent labels. The mid-90s sound of emo was defined by bands like Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate who incorporated elements of grunge and more melodic rock. Only after the breakthrough of grunge and pop punk into the mainstream did emo come to wider attention with the success of Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996) album, which used pop punk. Late 1990s bands drew on the work of Fugazi, SDRE, Jawbreaker and Weezer, including The Promise Ring, Get Up Kids, Braid, Texas Is the Reason, Joan of Arc, Jets to Brazil and most successfully Jimmy Eat World, and by the end of the millennium it was one of the more popular indie styles in the US.

Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001) and Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; (2003). The new emo had a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term emo expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. The term emo has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and disparate groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, even when they protest the label.

=== Garage rock/post-punk revival ===
In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock, emerged into the mainstream. They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or new wave revival. There had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s and by 2000 several local scenes had grown up in the US. The Detroit rock scene included: The Von Bondies, Electric Six, The Dirtbombs and The Detroit Cobras and that of New York: Radio 4, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Rapture.

The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by bands including The Strokes, who emerged from the New York club scene with their début album &quot;Is This It&quot; (2001) and The White Stripes, from Detroit, with their third album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001). They were christened by the media as the &quot;The&quot; bands, and dubbed &quot;The saviours of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, leading to accusations of hype. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition as a result of the movement included Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Killers, Interpol, the Black Keys and Kings of Leon from the US.

=== Metalcore and contemporary heavy metal ===
Metalcore, originally an American hybrid of thrash metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s. It was rooted in the crossover thrash style developed two decades earlier by bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, and Stormtroopers of Death and remained an underground phenomenon through the 1990s. By 2004, melodic metalcore, influenced by melodic death metal, was sufficiently popular for Killswitch Engage&#x27;s &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; and Shadows Fall&#x27;s &quot;The War Within&quot; to debut at number 21 and number 20, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Lamb of God, with a related blend of metal styles, hit the number 2 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 2009 with &quot;Wrath&quot;. The success of these bands and others such as Trivium, who have released both metalcore and straight-ahead thrash albums, and Mastodon, who played in a progressive/sludge style, inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the &quot;New Wave of American Heavy Metal&quot;.

=== Digital electronic rock ===
In the 2000s, as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet, and new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding. These techniques also began to be used by existing bands, as with industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails&#x27; album &quot;Year Zero&quot; (2007), and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indie electronic, electroclash and dance-punk.

Indie electronic, which had begun in the early 1990s with bands like Stereolab and Disco Inferno, took off in the new millennium as the new digital technology developed, with acts including The Postal Service, and Ratatat from the US, mixing a variety of indie sounds with electronic music, largely produced on small independent labels. The Electroclash subgenre began in New York at the end of the 1990s, combining synth pop, techno, punk and performance art. It was pioneered by I-F with their track &quot;Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass&quot; (1998), and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat and Peaches. It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium, but rapidly faded as a recognisable genre. Dance-punk, mixing post-punk sounds with disco and funk, had developed in the 1980s, but it was revived among some bands of the garage rock/post-punk revival in the early years of the new millennium, particularly among New York acts such as Liars, The Rapture and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud.

Since around 1964, with the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the United States spearheaded by the Beatles, British rock music has had a considerable impact on the development of American music and rock music across the world.

Initial attempts to emulate American rock and roll took place in Britain in the mid-1950s, but the terms &quot;rock music&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; usually refer to the genre a whole, shoterning the term rock and roll, this would happen in the late 50s and ealry 60s due to the eruption of increasing sub genres. The term is often used in combination with other terms to describe a variety of hybrids or subgenres, and is often contrasted with pop music, with which it shares many structures and instrumentation. Rock music has tended to be more orientated toward the albums market, putting an emphasis on innovation, virtuosity, performance and song writing by the performers.

Although much too diverse to be a genre in itself, British rock has produced many of the most significant groups and performers in rock music internationally, and has initiated or significantly developed many of the most influential subgenres, including beat music, progressive rock, art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, punk, post-punk, new wave, and indie rock.

==Early British rock and roll==

In the 1950s, Britain was well placed to receive American rock and roll music and culture. It shared a common language, had been exposed to American culture through the stationing of troops in the country, and shared many social developments, including the emergence of distinct youth sub-cultures, which in Britain included the Teddy Boys. Trad jazz became popular, and many of its musicians were influenced by related American styles, including boogie-woogie and the blues. The skiffle craze, led by Lonnie Donegan, utilised mostly amateurish versions mainly of American folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll, folk, R&amp;B and beat musicians to start performing. At the same time British audiences were beginning to encounter American rock and roll, initially through films including &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955) and &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1955). Both films contained the Bill Haley &amp; His Comets hit &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, which first entered the British charts in early 1955 – four months before it reached the US pop charts – topped the British charts later that year and again in 1956, and helped identify rock and roll with teenage delinquency. American rock and roll acts such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Buddy Holly thereafter became major forces in the British charts.

The initial response of the British music industry was to attempt to produce copies of American records, recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols. British rock and rollers soon began to appear, including Wee Willie Harris and Tommy Steele. The bland or wholly imitative form of much British rock and roll in this period meant that the American product remained dominant. However, in 1958 Britain produced its first &quot;authentic&quot; rock and roll song and star, when Cliff Richard reached number 2 in the charts with &quot;Move It&quot;. British impresario Larry Parnes fashioned young singers to the new trend, giving them corny names such as Billy Fury, Marty Wilde and Vince Eager. At the same time, TV shows such as &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; and &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;, both produced by Jack Good, promoted the careers of British rock and rollers like Marty Wilde and Adam Faith. Cliff Richard and his backing band The Drifters, who quickly changed their name to The Shadows, were the most successful home grown rock and roll based acts of the era. Other leading acts included Joe Brown, and Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates, whose 1960 hit song &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; became a rock and roll standard. The first American rock and roll artist to hit British stages and appear on television was Charlie Gracie, quickly followed by Gene Vincent in December 1959, soon joined on tour by his friend Eddie Cochran. The producer Joe Meek was the first to produce sizeable rock hits in England, culminating with The Tornados&#x27; instrumental &quot;Telstar&quot;, which went to number one in both the UK and USA.

==Development in the 1960s and early 1970s==
===Beat music===
In late 1950s Britain a flourishing culture of groups began to emerge, often out of the declining skiffle scene, in major urban centres in the UK like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London. This was particularly true in Liverpool, where it has been estimated that there were around 350 different bands active, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs.
These beat bands were heavily influenced by American groups of the era, such as Buddy Holly and the Crickets (from which groups the Beatles and The Hollies derived their names), as well as earlier British groups such as The Shadows. After the national success of the Beatles in Britain from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers, The Searchers, and Cilla Black. Among the most successful beat acts from Birmingham were The Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues; The Animals came from Newcastle, and Them, featuring Van Morrison, from Belfast. From London, the term &quot;Tottenham Sound&quot; was largely based around The Dave Clark Five, but other London bands that benefited from the beat boom of this era included the Rolling Stones, The Kinks and The Yardbirds. The first non-Liverpool, non-Brian Epstein-managed band to break through in the UK were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester, as were Herman&#x27;s Hermits and The Hollies. The beat movement provided most of the bands responsible for the British invasion of the American pop charts in the period after 1964, and furnished the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, particularly through their small group format – typically lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, and drums, sometimes replacing the rhythm guitar with keyboards, either with a lead singer or with one of the musicians taking lead vocals and the others providing vocal harmonies.

===British blues boom===
In parallel with beat music, in the late 1950s and early 1960s a British blues scene was developing recreating the sounds of American R&amp;B and later particularly the sounds of bluesmen Robert Johnson, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Muddy Waters. Initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies, it reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s, when it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, Cream, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin (who morphed out of The Yardbirds). A number of these moved through Blues-rock to different forms of rock music, with increasing emphasis on technical virtuosity and improvisational skills. As a result, British blues helped to form many of the subgenres of rock, including psychedelic rock and heavy metal music. Since then direct interest in the blues in Britain has declined, but many of the key performers have returned to it in recent years, new acts have emerged and there has been a renewed interest in the genre.

===The Beatles and the &quot;British Invasion&quot;===
The Beatles themselves were less influenced by blues music than the music of later American genres such as soul and Motown. Their popular success in Britain in the early 1960s was matched by their new and highly influential emphases on their own song writing, and on technical production values, some of which were shared by other British beat groups. On 7 February 1964, the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite ran a story about the Beatles&#x27; United States arrival in which the correspondent said &quot;The British Invasion this time goes by the code name Beatlemania&quot;. A few days later, they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Seventy five per cent of Americans watching television that night viewed their appearance thus &quot;launching&quot; the invasion with a massive wave of chart success that would continue until the Beatles broke up in 1970. On 4 April 1964, the Beatles held the top 5 positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, the only time to date that any act has accomplished this. During the next two years, Peter and Gordon, The Animals, Manfred Mann, Petula Clark, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, The Rolling Stones, The Troggs, and Donovan would have one or more number one singles in the US. Other acts that were part of the &quot;invasion&quot; included The Who, The Kinks, and The Dave Clark Five; these acts were also successful within the UK, although clearly the term &quot;British Invasion&quot; itself was not applied there except as a description of what was happening in the USA. So-called &quot;British Invasion&quot; acts influenced fashion, haircuts and manners of the 1960s of what was to be known as the &quot;Counterculture&quot;. In particular, the Beatles&#x27; movie &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and fashions from Carnaby Street led American media to proclaim England as the centre of the music and fashion world. The success of British acts of the time, particularly that of the Beatles themselves, has been seen as revitalising rock music in the US and influenced many American bands to develop their sound and style. The growth of the British music industry itself, and its increasingly prominent global role in the forefront of changing popular culture, also enabled it to discover and first establish the success of new rock artists from elsewhere in the world, notably Jimi Hendrix and, in the early 1970s, Bob Marley.

===Freakbeat===

Freakbeat is a loosely defined subgenre of rock and roll music developed mainly by harder-driving British groups, often those with a mod following, during the Swinging London period of the mid-to late 1960s. The genre bridges British Invasion mod/R&amp;B/pop and psychedelia. The term was coined by English music journalist Phil Smee. AllMusic writes that &quot;freakbeat&quot; is loosely defined, but generally describes the more obscure but hard-edged artists of the British Invasion era such as the Creation, the Pretty Things or Denny Laine&#x27;s early solo work. Much of the material collected on Rhino Records&#x27;s 2001 box-set compilation &quot;Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964–1969&quot; can be classified as freakbeat. Other bands include The Smoke, The Eyes, The Birds, The Action and The Sorrows.

===Psychedelic rock===
Psychedelic music is a style of music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of hallucinogenic drugs. It particularly grew out of blues-rock and progressive folk music and drew on non-Western sources such as Indian music&#x27;s ragas and sitars as well as studio effects and long instrumental passages and surreal lyrics. It emerged during the mid-1960s among progressive folk acts in Britain such as The Incredible String Band and Donovan, as well as in the United States, and rapidly moved into rock and pop music being taken up by acts including the Beatles, The Yardbirds, The Moody Blues, Small Faces, The Move, Traffic, Cream and Pink Floyd. Psychedelic rock bridged the transition from early blues-rock to progressive rock, art rock, experimental rock, hard rock and eventually heavy metal that would become major genres in the 1970s. Shock rock pioneer Arthur Brown performed his 1968 hit song &quot;Fire&quot; wearing black and white makeup (corpse paint) and a burning headpiece. He has been a significant influence on extreme acts that have followed.

===Mainstream and global success===

By the early 1970s, rock music had become more mainstream, and internationalised, with many British acts becoming massively successful in the United States and globally. Some of the most successful artists, such as the individual members of The Beatles, Elton John, David Bowie, and Rod Stewart performed their own songs (and in some cases those written by others) in an eclectic variety of styles, in which the presentation of the performance itself became increasingly important. By way of contrast, the former psychedelic-pop act, The Status Quo, dropped the definite article from their name and became one of the most successful British rock acts by presenting an apparently unsophisticated style of boogie-based rock music; and Van Morrison gained international critical acclaim through a blend of rock, jazz and blues styles. Some well-established British bands that began their careers in the British Invasion, notably The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks, also developed their own particular styles and expanded their international fan base during that period, but would be joined by new acts in new styles and subgenres.

==New subgenres in the 1970s==
===British folk rock===

British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle which built on elements of American folk rock, and on the second British folk revival. Using traditional English music as its basis, these bands drew heavily on the Child Ballads, ballads of the British Isles from the medieval period until the 19th century. An early success was Fairport Convention&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Liege and Lief&quot;, but it became more significant in the 1970s, when it was taken up by groups such as Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. It was rapidly adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Brittany, where it was pioneered by Alan Stivell and bands like Malicorne; in Ireland by groups such as Horslips; and also in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives. It was also influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to the UK, such as the US and Canada and gave rise to the subgenre of Medieval folk rock and the fusion genres of folk punk and folk metal. By the end of the 1970s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, as other forms of music, including punk and electronic began to be established.

===Progressive rock===
Progressive or prog rock developed out of late 1960s blues-rock and psychedelic rock. Dominated by British bands, it was part of an attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. Progressive rock bands attempted to push the technical and compositional boundaries of rock by going beyond the standard verse-chorus-based song structures. The arrangements often incorporated elements drawn from classical, jazz, and international sources later called &quot;world music&quot;. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme. King Crimson&#x27;s 1969 début album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;, which mixed powerful guitar riffs and mellotron, with jazz and symphonic music, is often taken as the key recording in progressive rock, helping the widespread adoption of the genre in the early 1970s among existing blues-rock and psychedelic bands, as well as newly formed acts. The term was applied to the music of bands such as Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Soft Machine, Electric Light Orchestra, Procol Harum, Hawkwind, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. It reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1970s, but had mixed critical acclaim and the punk movement can be seen as a reaction against its musicality and perceived pomposity. Many bands broke up, but some, including Genesis, ELP, Yes, and Pink Floyd, regularly scored Top Ten albums with successful accompanying worldwide tours.

===Glam rock===
Glam or glitter rock developed in the UK in the post-hippie early 1970s. It was characterised by &quot;outrageous&quot; clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. The flamboyant lyrics, costumes, and visual styles of glam performers were a campy, playing with categories of sexuality in a theatrical blend of nostalgic references to science fiction and old movies, all over a guitar-driven hard rock sound. Pioneers of the genre included David Bowie, Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople, Marc Bolan and T. Rex. These, and many other acts straddled the divide between pop and rock music, managing to maintain a level of respectability with rock audiences, while enjoying success in the UK singles chart, including Queen and Elton John. Other performers aimed much more directly for the popular music market, where they were the dominant groups of their era, including Slade, Wizzard, Mud and Sweet. The glitter image was pushed to its limits by Gary Glitter and The Glitter Band. Largely confined to the British music scene where it originated, glam rock peaked during the mid-1970s, before it declined in the face of punk rock and new wave trends. It has had a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later.

===Hard rock/heavy metal===

With roots in blues-rock, psychedelic rock and garage rock the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, powerful sound, characterised by overt rhythmic basslines, highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles often incorporated elements of fantasy and science fiction, and are generally associated with masculinity and machismo. The three pioneering heavy metal bands, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, were all British and, while gaining little critical acclaim, they and the next generation of metal groups, which included American, Australian and continental bands beside British acts Judas Priest, Motörhead and Rainbow, attracted large audiences and record sales. Rainbow moved heavy metal into stadium rock while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. After a decline in popularity in the late 1970s Judas Priest discarded most of the genre&#x27;s blues influences, particularly on their 1980 album &quot;British Steel&quot;, which opened the door for the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) including Iron Maiden, Vardis, Saxon and Def Leppard, and a return to popularity in the 1980s.
Although NWOBHM inspired many new bands, in the late 1980s much of the creative impetus in the genre shifted towards America and continental Europe (particularly Germany and Scandinavia), which produced most of the major new subgenres of metal, which were then taken up by British acts. These included thrash metal and death metal, both developed in the USA; black metal and power metal, both developed in continental Europe, but influenced by the British band Venom; and doom, which was developed in the USA but which soon had a number of bands from England, including Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General. There&#x27;s also a large British influence in the doom/gothic metal scene, pioneered by such bands as Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema. Grindcore, or simply grind, was a hybrid of death metal and hardcore punk, characterized by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, high speed tempo, blast beats, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams. Pioneers, the British band Napalm Death inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.

Probably the most successful British metal band since the days of NWOBHM were Cradle of Filth, formed in 1991, and pursuing a form of extreme metal that is difficult to categorise. The term &quot;retro-metal&quot; has been applied to such bands as The Darkness, whose mix of glam rock and heavy riffs earned them a string of singles hits and a quintuple platinum album with &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot; (2005), which reached number 11 in the UK charts. Bullet for My Valentine, from Wales, broke into the top 5 in both the U.S. and British charts with their metalcore, a mixture of metal and hardcore, with &quot;Scream Aim Fire&quot; (2008).

==Proto-punk, punk and new wave==
===Pub rock===
Pub rock was a short-lived trend that left a lasting influence on the British music scene, especially in punk rock. It was a back-to-basics movement that reacted against the glittery glam rock of David Bowie and Gary Glitter, and peaked in the mid-1970s. Pub rock developed in large north London pubs. It is said to have begun in May 1971 with Eggs over Easy, an American band, playing in the Tally Ho! in Kentish Town. A group of musicians who had been playing in blues and R&amp;B bands during the 1960s and early &#x27;70s soon formed influential bands like Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe and Bees Make Honey. Brinsley Schwarz was probably the most influential group, achieving some mainstream success both in the UK and in the States. The second wave of pub rock included Kilburn and the High Roads, Ace, Johnny Kid &amp; the Pirates, and Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers; these were followed by the third and final wave of pub rock, including Dr. Feelgood, and Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears. Several pub rock musicians joined the new wave acts such as Graham Parker&#x27;s backing band, The Rumour, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions and even The Clash.

===Punk rock===
Punk rock developed between 1974 and 1976, originally in the United States, where it was rooted in garage rock, and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music. The first punk band is usually thought to be the Ramones from 1976. This was taken up in Britain by bands also influenced by the pub rock scene, like the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned, particularly in London, who became the vanguard of a new musical and cultural movement, blending simple aggressive sounds and lyrics with clothing styles and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. Punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock, creating fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraced a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels. 1977 saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major international cultural phenomenon. However, by 1978, the initial impulse had subsided and punk had morphed into the wider and more diverse new wave and post-punk movements.

===New wave===
As the initial punk impulse began to subside, with the major punk bands either disbanding or taking on new influences, the term &quot;New Wave&quot; began to be used to describe particularly British bands that emerged in the later 1970s with mainstream appeal. These included pop bands like XTC, Squeeze and Nick Lowe, the electronic rock of Gary Numan as well as songwriters like Elvis Costello, rock &amp; roll influenced bands like the Pretenders, the reggae influenced music of bands like The Police, as well as bands of the mod revival like The Jam and of the ska revival like The Specials and Madness. By the end of the decade many of these bands, most obviously the Police, were beginning to make an impact in American and world markets.

===Post-punk===

Beside the development of mainstream new wave, there were also less commercial, darker and sub-culture acts, often classified as post-punk. Like new wave they incorporated a range of influences, including electronic music, Jamaican dub music (specifically in bass guitar), and American funk. Examples of post-punk outfits in Britain included The Smiths, Orange Juice, The Psychedelic Furs, Television Personalities, The Fall, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Lords of the New Church, Joy Division, Killing Joke, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Gang of Four, The Cure, Bauhaus, Magazine, Wire, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and Tubeway Army. Post-punk would be a major element in the creation of the alternative rock and gothic rock genres.

=== 2 tone ===
Two-tone or 2 tone is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s that focused traditional Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae music with elements of punk rock and new wave music. Its name derives from 2 Tone Records, a record label founded in 1979 by Jerry Dammers of the Specials, and references a desire to transcend and defuse racial tensions in Thatcher-era Britain: many two-tone groups, such as the Specials, the Selecter and the Beat, featured a mix of black, white, and multiracial people. Originating in the Midlands city Coventry in England in the late 1970s, it was part of the second wave of ska music, following on from the first ska music that developed in Jamaica in the 1950s and 1960s, and infused with punk and new wave textures.

===Folk punk===
Folk punk or rogue folk is a fusion of folk music and punk rock, or occasionally other genres, which was pioneered by the London-based band The Pogues in the 1980s. It achieved some mainstream success in the 1980s and, particularly as the subgenre of Celtic punk, has been widely adopted in areas of the Celtic diaspora in North America and Australia and by many bands in continental central and eastern Europe. Unlike earlier Celtic rock and electric folk groups, folk punk groups tend to include relatively little traditional music in their repertoire, but instead usually performed their own compositions, often following the form of punk rock, using additional folk instrumentation, including, mandolin, accordion, banjo and particularly violin. Other bands adopted some traditional forms of music, including sea shanties and eastern European gypsy music. Among the most successful performers were The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, New Model Army, Oysterband, The Levellers, and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, who enjoyed a series of hits in the 1980s.

==Electronic rock in the early 1980s==
===Synth rock===
Many progressive rock bands had incorporated synthesizers into their sound, including Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis. In 1977, Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR-77 drum machine, which was first featured in their October 1977 single release &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;. The ballad arrangement, metronome-like percussion and heavy use of the ARP Odyssey synthesizer was effectively a prototype for nearly all synthpop and rock bands that were to follow. In 1978, the first incarnation of The Human League released their début single &quot;Being Boiled&quot;. Others were soon to follow, including Tubeway Army, a little known outfit from West London, who dropped their punk rock image and jumped on the band wagon, topping the UK charts in the summer of 1979 with the single &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot;. This prompted the singer, Gary Numan to go solo and in the same year he release the Kraftwerk inspired album, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; and again topped the charts for the second time with the single &quot;Cars&quot;. Particularly through its adoption by New Romantics, synthesizers came to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 80s. Albums such as Visage&#x27;s &quot;Visage&quot; (1980), John Foxx&#x27;s &quot;Metamatic&quot; (1980), Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Telekon&quot; (1980), Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980), The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Dare&quot; (1981) and Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; (1981), established a sound that influenced most mainstream pop and rock bands, until it began to fall from popularity in the mid-1980s.

===New Romantics===
New Romantic emerged as part of the new wave music movement in London nightclubs including Billy&#x27;s and The Blitz Club towards the end of the 1970s. Influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music, it developed glam rock fashions, gaining its name from the frilly fop shirts of early Romanticism. New Romantic music often made extensive use of synthesizers. Pioneers included Visage, Japan and Ultravox and among the commercially most successful acts associated with the movement were Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, The Human League, Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran. By about 1983 the original movement had dissolved, with surviving acts dropping most of the fashion elements to pursue mainstream careers.

===The second British invasion===
From its inception in 1981, the cable music channel MTV featured a disproportionate amount of music videos from image conscious British acts. British acts, who had been accustomed to using music videos for half a decade, featured heavily on the channel. The Buggles&#x27; &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; was the first music video shown on MTV. In late 1982, &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; by A Flock of Seagulls entered the Billboard Top Ten, arguably the first successful song that owed almost everything to video. They would be followed by bands like Duran Duran whose glossy videos would come to symbolise the power of MTV. Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; gently poked fun at MTV which had helped make them international rock stars. In 1983, 30% of the record sales were from British acts. 18 of the Top 40 and 6 of the Top 10 singles on 18 July were by British artists. Overall record sales would rise by 10% from 1982. &quot;Newsweek&quot; featured Annie Lennox of Eurythmics and Boy George of Culture Club on the cover of one of its issues, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would release an &quot;England Swings&quot; issue. In April 1984, 40 of the Top 100 singles were from British acts while 8 of the Top 10 singles in a May 1985 survey were of British origin. Veteran music journalist Simon Reynolds theorised that similar to the first British Invasion the use of black American influences by the British acts helped to spur success. Commentators in the mainstream media credited MTV and the British acts with bringing colour and energy back to pop music while rock journalists were generally hostile to the phenomenon because they felt it represented image over content.

== Oi!, street punk and punk/metal hybrids ==
=== Oi! and street punk===

Oi! is a subgenre of punk rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The music and its associated subculture had the goal of bringing together punks, skinheads, and other disaffected working-class youth. The movement was partly a response to the perception that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of The Business guitarist Steve Kent, &quot;trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic... and losing touch.&quot; First-generation Oi! bands such as Sham 69 and Cock Sparrer were around for years before the word &quot;Oi!&quot; was used retroactively to describe their style of music. In 1980, writing in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, rock journalist Garry Bushell labelled the movement &quot;Oi!&quot;, taking the name from the garbled &quot;Oi!&quot; that Stinky Turner of Cockney Rejects used to introduce the band&#x27;s songs. The word is a British expression meaning &quot;hey&quot; or &quot;hey there!&quot; In addition to Cockney Rejects, other bands to be explicitly labeled Oi! in the early days of the genre included Angelic Upstarts, the 4-Skins, the Business, Anti-Establishment, Blitz, the Blood and Combat 84.

A related scene was street punk which emerged from the style of Oi! and hardcore punk bands. A key band in defining the aesthetic was the Exploited. The three most prominent UK82 bands, according to Ian Glasper, are the Exploited, Discharge, and GBH. Street punks generally have a much more ostentatious and flamboyant appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Lyrics frequently denounced the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher in the same way that American hardcore punk bands addressed the Ronald Reagan administration.

=== Crust punk and grindcore ===
In the second half of the 1980s, it became increasingly normalised for UK hardcore bands to be influenced by heavy metal styles. Crust punk is a form of music influenced by punk rock and extreme metal. Founded by the English bands Amebix and Antisect, taking its name from Newcastle band Hellbastard&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Ripper Crust&quot; demo. Crust punk influenced further developments into UK hardcore, specifically in its contribution to the creation of grindcore. Grindcore, developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the anarcho-punk scene in Birmingham, England. Napalm Death&#x27;s seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984 with the goal of becoming &quot;the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time,&quot; the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as &quot;pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [vocalists] Dean [Jones] and Phil [Vane] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit.&quot;

==Indie rock==

Indie or independent rock, particularly in America often known as alternative rock, was a scene that emerged from post-punk and new wave in the 1980s, eschewing the major record labels for control of their own music and relying on local scenes or national sub-cultures to provide an audience. Having enjoyed some success a number of indie acts were able to move into the mainstream, including early indie bands Aztec Camera, Orange Juice and The Smiths, followed by The Housemartins and James. Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. The Jesus and Mary Chain wrapped their pop melodies in walls of guitar noise, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with techno and house music, forging the alternative dance style. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s.

===Gothic rock===
Gothic rock, often shortened to goth, developed out of the post-punk scene in the later 1970s. It combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and depressing lyrics. Notable early gothic rock bands include Bauhaus (whose &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; is often cited as the first goth record), Siouxsie and the Banshees (who may have coined the term), The Cure, The Sisters of Mercy, and Fields of the Nephilim. Gothic rock gave rise to a broader goth subculture that included clubs, various fashion trends and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s, gaining notoriety by being associated with several moral panics over suicide and Satanism.

===Madchester===

The independent rock scene that had developed in Manchester in the second half of the 1980s, based in The Haçienda nightclub and Factory Records and dubbed Madchester, came to national prominence at the end of the decade, with the Happy Mondays, the Inspiral Carpets, and Stone Roses charting late in 1989. The scene became the centre of media attention for independent rock in the early 1990s, with bands like World of Twist, New Fast Automatic Daffodils, The High, Northside, Paris Angels, and Intastella also gaining national attention. The period of dominance was relatively short lived with The Stone Roses beginning to retreat from public performance while engaged in contractual disputes, the Happy Mondays having difficulty in producing a second album and Factory Records going bankrupt in 1992. Local bands catching the tail-end of Madchester, such as The Mock Turtles, became part of a wider baggy scene. The music press in the UK began to place more focus on shoegazing bands from the south of England and bands emerging through US grunge.

===Dream pop and shoegazing===
Dream pop had developed out of the indie rock scene of the 1980s, when bands like Cocteau Twins, The Chameleons, The Passions, Dif Juz, Lowlife and A.R. Kane began fusing post-punk and ethereal experiments with bittersweet pop melodies into sensual, sonically ambitious soundscapes. The 4AD record label is the one most associated with dream pop, though others such as Creation, Projekt, Fontana, Bedazzled, Vernon Yard, and Slumberland also released significant records in the genre. A louder, more aggressive strain of dream pop came to be known as shoegazing; key bands of this style were Lush, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Chapterhouse, Curve and Levitation. These bands kept the atmospheric qualities of dream pop, but added the intensity of post-punk-influenced bands such as The Chameleons and Sonic Youth.

===Post-rock===

Post-rock originated in the release of Talk Talk&#x27;s album &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; and US band Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot;, both in 1991, which produced experimental work influenced by sources as varied as electronica, jazz, and minimalist classical music, often abandoning the traditional song format in favour of instrumental and ambient music. The term was first used to describe the band Bark Psychosis and their album &quot;Hex&quot; (1994), but was soon employed for bands such as Stereolab, Laika, Disco Inferno and Pram and other acts in America and Canada. Scottish group Mogwai are one of the influential post-rock groups to arise at the turn of the 21st century.

===Indie pop===

Initially dubbed as &#x27;C86&#x27; after the 1986 &quot;NME&quot; tape, and also known as &quot;cutie&quot;, &quot;shambling bands&quot; and later as &quot;twee pop&quot;, indie pop was characterised by jangling guitars, a love of sixties pop and often fey, innocent lyrics. It was also inspired by the DIY scene of punk and there was a thriving fanzine, label and club and gig circuit. Early bands included The Pastels, The Shop Assistants and Primal Scream. Scenes later developed in the United States particularly around labels such as K Records. Genres such as Riot Grrrl and bands as diverse as Nirvana, Manic Street Preachers, and Belle and Sebastian have all acknowledged its influence.

===Britpop and Britrock===
Britpop emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands influenced by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States. New British groups such as Suede and Blur launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass, The Boo Radleys, Kula Shaker, Ash, Ocean Colour Scene and Elastica. Other bands with a heavier sound were sometimes referred to by the sobriquet &#x27;Britrock&#x27;, including Skunk Anansie, The Wildhearts, Terrorvision, Reef, and Feeder. Britpop and Britrock groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called Cool Britannia. Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade.

===Post-Britpop===
From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), with American influences, including grunge. Radiohead, Placebo and Post-Britpop bands like The Verve, Travis, Stereophonics, Feeder, and particularly Coldplay, achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

===Garage rock revival and post-punk revival===

In the 2000s British indie rock experienced a resurgence. Like modern American alternative rock, many British indie bands such as Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines and Bloc Party drew influences from post-punk groups such as Joy Division, Wire, and Gang of Four. Other prominent independent rock bands in the 2000s include: Editors, The Fratellis, Lostprophets, Razorlight, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs, Muse, Kasabian, The Cribs, The Maccabees, The Kooks and Arctic Monkeys (the last being the most prominent act to gain their initial fan base through the use of internet social networking).

=== Hardcore, post-hardcore and metalcore ===
In 1996, a hardcore scene in London began around the informal collective &quot;London Black-Up&quot;, which include bands like Knuckledust, Ninebar and Bun Dem Out. Bands in this scene often incorporated elements of grime, hip hop and metal into their sounds and was based around venues such as the Camden Underworld, New Cross Inn and the Dome in Tufnell Park. The 2000s saw the rise in prominent of a number of UK post-hardcore bands, the most prominent of which was Bridgend&#x27;s Funeral for a Friend, whose 2003 debut album &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; peaked at number 12 on the UK singles chart. In March 2007, Gallows signed a deal with Warner Bros Records, making them the first British hardcore punk band to sign to a major label. The success of Gallows led to other British hardcore acts of the time gain notability like the Ghost of a Thousand, Heights, Dead Swans and Blackhole. The late-2000s metalcore scene was fronted by Architects and Bring Me the Horizon. The style of Bring Me the Horizon´s early work, including their debut album &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;, has been described primarily as deathcore, but over the course of several albums, the band has shifted its style and moved in a more melodically-oriented direction by combining their approach to metalcore with elements of electronica, pop and hip hop. Asking Alexandria from York were the most successful bands to originate from the MySpace metalcore scene.

===New rave===

With developments in computer technology and music software advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet, and new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding. In Britain the combination of indie with American pioneered dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to a number of bands, including Trash Fashion, New Young Pony Club, Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles, and Shitdisco forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier raves.

=== Early 2020s ===

In the mid-to-late 2010s and early 2020s, a new wave of post-punk bands from Britain and Ireland emerged. The groups in this scene have been described with the term &quot;Crank Wave&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; and The Quietus in 2019, and as &quot;Post-Brexit New Wave&quot; by NPR writer Matthew Perpetua in 2021. Perpetua describes the groups in the scene as &quot;U.K. bands that kinda talk-sing over post-punk music, and sometimes it&#x27;s more like post-rock.&quot; Many of the acts are associated with producer Dan Carey and his record label Speedy Wunderground, and with The Windmill, an all-ages music venue in Brixton, London. Artists that have been identified as part of the style include Black Midi, Squid, Black Country, New Road, Dry Cleaning, Shame, Sleaford Mods, Fontaines D.C., The Murder Capital, Idles and Yard Act. At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, the post punk and indie pop band from the Isle of Wight Wet Leg won Best Alternative Music Album for their debut and Best Alternative Music Performance for &quot;Chaise Longue&quot;, and were nominated for Best New Artist. They also won Best New Artist and Best British Group at the 2023 Brit Awards.
