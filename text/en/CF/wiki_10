<text>William Henry (12 December 17742 September 1836) was an English chemist. He was the son of Thomas Henry and was born in Manchester England. He developed what is known today as Henry&#x27;s Law.

==Life==
William Henry was apprenticed to Thomas Percival and later worked with John Ferriar &amp; John Huit at the Manchesters Infirmary. He began to study medicine at University of Edinburgh in 1795, taking his medical in 1807, but ill-health interrupted his practice as a physician, and he devoted his time mainly to chemical research, especially with regard to gases. One of his best-known papers (published in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, 1803) describes experiments on the quantity of gases absorbed by water at different temperatures and under different pressures. His results are known today as Henry&#x27;s law. His other papers deal with gas-analysis, fire-damp, illuminating gas, the composition of hydrochloric acid and of ammonia, urinary and other morbid concretions, and the disinfecting powers of heat. His &quot;Elements of Experimental Chemistry&quot; (1799) enjoyed considerable vogue in its day, going through eleven editions in 30 years. He was one of the founders of the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, the original precursor of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. 

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1809, having been awarded their prestigious Copley Medal in 1808.

He shot himself in his private chapel at Pendlebury, near Manchester, in 1836.

<doc id="939731" wikidata="Q1869414" url="?curid=939731" title="Long Meg and Her Daughters">
<text>Long Meg and Her Daughters is a Neolithic stone circle situated north-east of Penrith near Little Salkeld in Cumbria, North West England. One of around 1,300 stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany, it was constructed as a part of a megalithic tradition that emerged during Neolithic, and continued into the Early Bronze Age (circa 3200 - 2500BC). 

The stone circle is the third widest in England, behind Avebury in Wiltshire and Stanton Drew in Somerset. It consists of 66 stones (of which 27 remain upright) set in an east / west oval configuration measuring on its long axis. There may originally have been as many as 77 stones, as this was mentioned by William Camden in the 16th century. Long Meg herself is a high monolith of red sandstone , standing to the southwest of the circle. The stone is marked with examples of megalithic art including a cup and ring mark, a spiral, and rings of concentric circles. This art mirrors examples from Neolithic Ireland, including the contemporary Newgrange. The composition and position of the stone is similar to that of the Altar Stone, at Stonehenge, and may be part of a similar tradition of using red sandstone to mark the solstice.

Infra-red aerial photography has identified several Early Neolithic enclosures. These include a so-called &#x27;super henge&#x27;, a possible cursus monument, and a henge similar to examples found near Millom to the far west of Cumbria. These appear to pre-date the stone circle, and its northern edge dips to avoid the lost ditch. There is also the smaller kerbed burial mound of Little Meg to the north.

==Location==
The Long Meg monolith and accompanying circle () forms one part of a complex of monuments in the Penrith area that includes, as well as the nearby Little Meg circle, a smaller circle seen by William Stukeley in 1725 to the south-west, no longer extant, plus the impressive Mayburgh Henge at Eamont Bridge, a partly destroyed henge at nearby King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, and a third, completely destroyed, henge just a few yards to the south of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table. The terrace upon which Long Meg and the circle sit extends along the River Eden, alongside several other monuments. These incliude: Little Meg, Glassonby Stone Circle, and the lost Old Parks Cairn, all of which are decorated with rock art. 

The stone circles, henges, cairns and other standing stones in the area are often grouped near water (rivers, springs), possibly for religious or cosmological reasons. The Shap Stone Avenue to the south of Penrith, (including the Goggleby Stone, the Thunder Stone, Skellaw Hill, as well as Oddendale to the east), forms an &#x27;avenue&#x27; running to the east of the River Lowther along a main route to the north; the Long Meg complex runs alongside the River Eden; Mayburgh and the other henges run alongside the River Eamont near its confluence with the River Lowther. 

Long Meg and her Daughters lie on a terrace above water, immediately to the south of a ditched enclosure that runs round the present farm. This ditch seems to pre-date the circle of stones, as the latter is deliberately flattened to take the enclosure into account. A spring lies just above the northern perimeter of the enclosure, and another spring may have existed within the enclosure itself. Another, smaller, enclosure lies to the south-east. Although the circle appears to have been built on a slope, Clare suggests that the large enclosure was made across a valley up to deep. This valley leads to the River Eden where deposits of gypsum are found. It is possible, therefore, like the henges at Thornborough in North Yorkshire, that the banks of the ditched enclosure and the stone circle &quot;may have been white.&quot;

==Construction==

The monument is × in diameter. Long Meg herself stands outside the circle, above the farthest stone in the circle, &quot;and is the tallest of the 69 stones at high and weighing c. 9 tons (tonnes).&quot; The Long Meg monolith is of local red sandstone, probably from the River Eden or the nearby Lazonby hills, whereas the circle stones are of rhyolite and are glacial erratics. Two large blocks are placed to the east and west and there are two extra &#x27;portal&#x27; stones placed to the south-west. The placement of Long Meg is in the alignment between the centre of the circle and the point of the midwinter sunset. The south-west face of Long Meg has crystals in it, whereas the face looking towards the circle has spirals and other rock art inscribed on it.

The circle may have had a bank running round some of the stones at least, and the centre may have been scraped out to some extent.

The English antiquary William Dugdale (1605–1686) reported that there were &quot;two barrows of cobble-stones, nine or ten feet high&quot; in the centre of the circle. It is thought that these were later burials using cobbles from the surrounding area.

Four of the stones in the circle appear to be non-local and are formed of quartz crystal. They seem to have been deliberately selected and placed at specific points in the circle that mark certain calendrical events (sunsets and solstices related to the four seasons, for example). They work by standing outside the circle at the stone directly opposite to the quartz stone concerned. One alignment, at Samhain/All Souls&#x27; Day, may involve Long Meg herself, a portal stone and one of the quartz stones.

The use of different coloured stones also seems to be significant – red, white and blue/grey predominate (Long Meg herself being of red sandstone). There might also be a red &#x27;equinox stone&#x27; on the east side of the Long Meg circle (as at Swinside and Castlerigg stone circle), involved in the autumn equinox and vernal equinox sunrises and sunsets. The Long Meg stones may be involved not just with solar timings, but also with lunar ones as well (most northerly/southerly Moon rises and sets).

==Rock art==

The Long Meg monolith has motifs on the face looking towards the circle arranged in three sections. The markings include: in the centre, a cup at the centre of three rings, a spiral of four turns and various concentric arcs; in the lower section, three faint figures at the left-hand corner, an anti-clockwise spiral, cup and ring and various concentric arcs; in the upper section are faint rings, ovoids, spirals and other markings. Some of the stones in the circle itself have artificial markings on them as well.

==Dating and purpose==
The large ditched enclosure lying immediately to the north of the circle is probably Early Neolithic (c. 3800 - 3200 BC). In this respect, it may be of the same date as other enclosures found in Cumbria that include: Carrock Fell, Skelmore Heads, Howe Robin, and Green How. If the stone circle is later than the enclosure, it is likely to be either late Neolithic, or early Bronze Age. As it has a very similar form to Swinside, another stone circle in Cumbria, it likely shares the same dating. There is the possibility that the Long Meg monolith was not contemporary with the stone circle.

Long Meg appears to have been more than a burial place. However, the exact nature of the purpose of the monument is still a matter of conjecture. Clare summarises the various arguments concerning types, purpose, construction, size, layout, origins and dates, of Cumbrian stone circles and other monuments. His conclusion seems to be that the nature 
of the monument, and others like it (such as at Swinside), suggests that they are &quot;places where people came together, probably at certain times of the year. Amongst activities at such times, we might envisage ritual, social exchange and trade.&quot; The &quot;certain times of the year&quot; mentioned here would probably have been calculated using the suggested predictive calendar as outlined by Hood. The actual building of the circle, perhaps taking place in stages over time, might in itself have been one of the purposes of the monument.

==Folklore and popular culture==
The most famous of the many legends that surround the stones is that they were once a coven of witches who were turned to stone by a wizard from Scotland named Michael Scot. It is said the stones cannot be counted – but, if anyone is able to count them twice and come to the same total – the spell will be broken or it will bring very bad luck. Another legend states that if you walk round the circles and count the number of stones correctly, then put your ear to Long Meg, you will hear her whisper. The name itself is said to come from a local witch, Meg of Meldon, who was alive in the early 17th century. From a certain angle, the Long Meg stone resembles the profile of a witch, facing the stones. Note however that Meg of Meldon is the name given to Margaret Fenwick (née Selsby) who lived at Meldon near Morpeth, Northumberland, some 70 miles from these stones. Long animal bones found buried at the site may have been misinterpreted in the past as a &#x27;Giant&#x27;s bone and body&#x27;.

Long Meg and Her Daughters was a filming location for the 2012 film &quot;Sightseers&quot;.

Long Meg and Her Daughters featured in the Opera &quot;Kings, Witches, Lovers, and Souls&quot;, a new opera about Cumbrian folktales, premiered by the Cumbria Opera Group.

<text>Museum railway station is a heritage-listed underground commuter rail station that is located on the City Circle route at the southern end of Hyde Park in the Sydney central business district of New South Wales, Australia. The station is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line, T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line and T8 Airport &amp; South Line. The station is named after the nearby Australian Museum. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

== History ==
=== The need for a city rail link ===

Railway development in Sydney began with the opening of the Sydney to Parramatta line in 1850. The terminus in Devonshire Street was, however, a considerable distance from most of the city&#x27;s shops and workplaces located to the north. Disembarked railway passengers were required to either walk or be conveyed to the city centre by horse drawn and in later years steam and electrically powered trams which ran along George, Pitt or Elizabeth Streets. Throughout the second half of the 19th century and early years of the 20th century, Sydney developed a tram based public transport system which adequately served most parts of the city then settled. However, the growth in population and increased residential density in the inner suburban areas in particular resulted in the heavy congestion of thoroughfares leading into the city.

The first plans for extending the railway line into the city proper were prepared as early as 1857 by the Engineer in Chief, John Whitton. Surveys were undertaken to develop a railway line via Castlereagh Street to Circular Quay. By the 1860s it became clear that the area in or around Hyde Park was an ideal location for the city railway station. In 1862 plans were prepared for a line via Hyde Park to the Quay. Survey work continued between 1862 and 1889. In 1894 funds were made available and plans prepared for a railway line extension to a principal station between Park Street and St James Road and a branch line to Fort Macquarie. A change of Colonial Government, however, caused the abandonment of the project.

Mounting public concern over the increasing congestion of street traffic and the need for a rail link into the city eventually forced the Government to appoint a Royal Commission in March 1890. Thirty six separate schemes were submitted, advocating either extension along the western, business side of the city or, along the eastern side through Hyde Park to minimise the costly land resumptions necessary. The Royal Commission recommended the adoption of a proposal by the Chief Railway Commissioner, Mr Eddy, for a line along the eastern city edge to a terminus in Hyde Park. Public opinion was, however, against the loss of a large portion of Hyde Park for railway purposes and eventually the Royal Commission recommended the adoption of an alternative proposal from Mr Eddy which would see a central city station at King Street and branch lines splitting east and north.

No further action was taken until April 1896 when the Premier was forced &quot;in the interest of the safety and comfort of the travelling public&#x27; to appoint a second Royal Commission to investigate and report on a suitable route. Inquiries and reports continued over the next few years and, while the Government did authorise the construction of Central station in 1900, agreement on a city railway service could not be achieved. Public opposition to the loss of Hyde Park land and the large capital outlay required were two major hurdles to settlement.

In 1908 a &quot;Royal Commission on Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs&quot; was appointed and recommended a plan for a loop railway proceeding down York Street to Circular Quay and returning to Central station via Macquarie Street and Hyde Park. Six underground stations were to be located generally in the positions of the Central, Town Hall, Wynyard, Circular Quay, St James and Museum stations of today.

===Developments by John Bradfield===
In 1912 the Government commissioned the engineering firm of Mott and Hay who recommended an amended variation of the 1908 scheme with lines to the eastern and western suburbs. The scheme was not adopted being judged expensive, inefficient and impractical on numerous counts. In February 1915 the Chief Engineer of Metropolitan Railway Construction, John Bradfield, after studying the city railways of Europe and North America, submitted his &quot;Report on the Proposed Electric Railways for the City of Sydney&quot;. Bradfield&#x27;s farsighted plan proposed an electric underground city railway loop, viaduct crossings and tunnels out of the city, a Harbour Bridge Crossing and connections from the city network to two lines progressing north to Hornsby and to Narrabeen/Pittwater, a loop line through stations at King Cross, Paddington, Edgecliff, Bondi, Waverley, Coogee, Waterloo to Erskineville, a western loop to a Balmain station via a bridge from to Darling Street, through stations at Rozelle, Leichhardt and Annandale to Stanmore and a branch line through Drummoyne, Five Dock, Gladesville to Ryde – all costing around excluding land resumptions.

St James station was proposed to form a vital link in the network by being built on two levels to accommodate both through trains from the North Shore, and city loop traffic in the style demonstrated by Grand Central station, New York. In late 1915 the Government passed a City and Suburban Electric Railways Bill, the Vice President of the Legislative Council saying that &quot;underground railways are a necessary part of great cities all over the world&quot;, Sydney then having a population of 800,000 people.

Work on the city railway system commenced in 1916 with the firm of Norton, Griffiths and Co beginning excavations tunnelling and foundation building for the link between Central station to Macquarie Street. After the firm&#x27;s contract was cancelled in early 1918, work was taken over by the Department of Railways. Funding problems resulting from World War 1 austerity measures and political indecision forced construction to cease in June 1918 with the completion of the Macquarie Street Bridge and tunnels through the Botanical Garden. From 1917 to 1922, Bradfield maintained a publicity campaign to rally support for his scheme. He presented papers before conferences, professional bodies, public groups, union organisations and the popular press. A city railway built to his plan would benefit workers, he argued, by enabling them &quot;to reside further afield and enjoy fresh are and sunlight&quot;, property owners and local government, because they would benefit from increased land values and rates and the future of Sydney in general because of the huge increases in population then forecast.

Excavation work for Museum (then known as Liverpool Street) and St James stations began in 1922/23. The imagination of the public was captivated as crowds gathered daily to view construction of the tunnels and stations beneath the Hyde Park grounds. The method used was that known as &quot;cut and cover&quot; – seeing an expansive open cut trench dug into Hyde Park, more than of rock and soil removed, the walls of the tunnels and station formed, roofing put in place and the site eventually covered over. Construction of the two station utilised concrete for the walls and steel framework and concrete for the roof.

Costing , Museum station was built as a single main tunnel arch in concrete spanning both east and west platforms and two centre tracks. The station is free of columns and other supporting structures in the European &quot;tube&quot; style tradition. It was decided to rename the station after the nearby Australian Museum before construction was complete. St James station was constructed from concrete with four platforms and four tunnels, only two of which have been used to date. The other two tunnels were intended for a link from Gladesville to the Eastern line which has not eventuated. Central walls with archway openings divide platforms and support the arch roof structures. Concourse areas were formed above the platforms of both stations, acting as focal points for pedestrian ways from street entrances.

===Interior of Museum station===
The interiors of Museum and especially St James station were well detailed, with extensive use of wall tiling and metal stair railings in the style of the period. The main entrances to both stations were each marked by two sandstone and brick entrance buildings designed in the &quot;stripped-classical&quot; style. Entry points led passengers through tiled subway passages to concourse areas.

After several years of construction, newspapers finally heralded the opening of Australia&#x27;s first underground electric railway on 20 December 1926 when the new line section of Central station, and Museum and St James stations were connected by trains. The railway attracted tens of thousands of people during the first few weeks of its operations, &quot;swarms of interested mothers and fathers, together with their children, thronged the platforms and stairways examining Dr Bradfield&#x27;s super Christmas box to the public&quot;. Media praise for the opening of the two city stations was offset by reporting which focused on the fact that only a small portion of Bradfield&#x27;s plan was in place. &quot;The Evening News&quot; of 18 December 1926 stated &quot;the traffic problem, before it becomes far worse, can only be met by the construction of the inner loop of the City railway&quot;.

1934 entry and exits to St. James and Museum Stations in Hyde Park South and North built, as the southern portion of Hyde Park was only handed back to Sydney City Council in 1932. St James and Museum were busy stations until 1956 when they were connected by the line through Circular Quay allowing trains to run into the city and back out again without needing to stop and reverse at St James as was previously done. The central two tunnels at St James, built to link with the proposed Eastern Suburbs railway have never been used for train movement although they were, along with the section of tunnel built to connect with Circular Quay, used as air raid shelters during World War II. After 1956 and the opening of Circular Quay station, St James and Museum suffered from reduced passenger usage and peak hours are now only a shadow of those in earlier years.

In the 1960s an outdoor café was constructed behind (north-east) of Museum Station entry building, by Sydney City Council. Design of the café and landscaping were the work of Ilmars Berzins, SCC landscape architect. Although affected by reduced maintenance spending and unsympathetic additions, both stations have retained much of their original detailing and character.

==Design==

Designed by John Bradfield in the Inter-War Stripped Classical architectural style, the station comprises two platforms, each long by wide, under an arch with span . Museum&#x27;s signage and cream tiling with maroon highlights are reminiscent of a typical London Underground tube station of the era, however its layout of central tracks under a grand arch are more in keeping with older stations of the Paris Métro. Until the construction of the Airport Line in the 1990s, it was the only underground station in Sydney without an island platform. It is a companion to St James station, both opened at the same time and use a roundel design on their station signage that is similar to the one used on the London Underground. The station opened on 20 December 1926 with the opening of the eastern city line from Central to St James. It became part of the City Circle loop on 22 January 1956.

The main entrance to the station is located at the corner of Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets. Another entrance featuring a sandstone façade is located on the corner of Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets. This entrance sits at the foot of the District Court of New South Wales&#x27; Downing Centre, formerly the site of the Mark Foy&#x27;s department store. Other entrances are also located on three corners of the intersection of Elizabeth and Bathurst Streets.

All exits flow into one of two concourses at the station. The main concourse is the southern one, located near the Elizabeth and Liverpool St intersection. The toilets, station office and lifts are all located in this concourse. The northern concourse is located near the intersection of Elizabeth and Bathurst St, with much less facilities compared to the main concourse. This concourse is used much less than the other one, and so is only open during the daytime on weekdays. At other times, only the southern concourse is open.

There are photos of the station being built and a complete photo history through the pedestrian tunnels of this station. The platforms feature various period advertisements.

Work commenced on the 27 May 2015 on lifts between the street and the concourse level at the Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets entrance with further lifts to the platforms.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 1 November 2010, Museum Station has state significance as the first underground station in Australia (with St James opened the same day) and demonstrates the adaptation of the London tube style station to the Australian situation. The station is well constructed, proportioned and detailed and represents the culmination of many years of political lobbying to have a city railway system in place.

The station complex is an important part of the larger NSW railways network, particularly the inner-city system, and has associations with prominent persons such as JJC Bradfield and organisations such as the Department of Railways. It played an important part in the development of the CBD in Sydney as evidenced by direct pedestrian subway connections to adjacent department stores such as Mark Foys.

The Museum Station entry building (Liverpool Street) is a fine and largely intact example of a small-scale Inter-War Stripped Classical style building which adds to the general character of the immediate area. It has significance as one of two buildings of its type and style remaining in the city (the other being St James). The combination of the entry portals, pedestrian subways and decorative interiors including light fittings, tiling and signage contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place and evoke a former era of railway travel.

Museum railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Historic value encompasses the history of aesthetics, science and society and therefore, to a large extent underlines all of the terms set out. A place may have historic value because it has influenced or has been influenced by a historic figure, event, phase or activity. It may also have historic value as the site of an important event. Significance is greater when associated evidence survives in-situ or when the settings are substantially intact.

* The site of St James station is associated with early plans for a terminus for the city railway system.
* St James, along with Museum station were the first underground railway stations operating in Australia.
* St James station is strongly associated with the railway/transportation planning of prominent early 20th century engineer Dr J. J. C. Bradfield.
* Unused tunnels at both ends of St James station were blocked off with concrete walls to form bomb shelters as a precaution against possible air raids during World War II.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Aesthetic value includes aspects of sensory perception including consideration of the form, scale, colour, texture and material of the fabric.

* The sandstone entry or portal building is a representative example of a low scale public building in the inter-war &quot;stripped classical&quot; style.
* The interior of the station, with its generous provision of space has retained most of its original detailing including tiling, balustrading, signage and other fixtures and fittings.
* The two (one demolished in the 1970s) portal buildings to St James were designed to integrate with, yet inversely reflect, the two original portal buildings of Museum station.
* The largely underground nature of St James station does not detract from the streetscape or parkland environment of the area.
* The location of the station at the head of Market Street has an important civic sense and street vista value.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Social value embraces the qualities for which a place has become a focus of political, national, regional, local or other cultural sentiment to a majority or minority group.

* The construction and utilization of St James Station represents approximately 70 years of pressure by citizens for city railway stations from the 1850s onwards.
* The underground nature of the station is a product of citizens&#x27; concern over possible loss of Hyde Park land.
* St James station, when linked to the rest of the city rail network from 1926 onwards was considered as important in enabling ease of transportation to the city and thereby allowing workers to live in more &quot;healthy conditions&quot; in suburbs further afield than was usual at the time.
* St James station, and the rest of the city rail network by enabling ease of transportation for workers into the city, is thought to have contributed to the expansion of Sydney&#x27;s suburbia from the early to mid 20th century onwards.
* St James station, and the rest of the city underground network, is representative of a facility designed to cater for the future transportation of Sydney&#x27;s citizens.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The scientific or research value of a place depends on the data involved, its rarity, quality or representativeness, and on the degree to which the place may contribute further information.

* St James station demonstrates a period of railway technology in New South Wales and Australia as a whole.
* The scale and methods of construction work especially excavation, completed for the station represented a major feat of engineering at the time.

<doc id="939742" wikidata="Q841144" url="?curid=939742" title="Round-robin tournament">
<text>A round-robin tournament or all-play-all tournament is a competition format in which each contestant meets every other participant, usually in turn. A round-robin contrasts with an elimination tournament, wherein participants are eliminated after a certain number of wins or losses.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;round-robin&quot; is derived from the French term (&#x27;ribbon&#x27;). Over time, the term became idiomized to &quot;robin&quot;.

In a &quot;single round-robin&quot; schedule, each participant plays every other participant once. If each participant plays all others twice, this is frequently called a &quot;double round-robin&quot;. The term is rarely used when all participants play one another more than twice, and is never used when one participant plays others an unequal number of times, as is the case in almost all of the major North American professional sports leagues.

In the United Kingdom, a round-robin tournament has been called an American tournament in sports such as tennis or billiards which usually have single-elimination (or &quot;knockout&quot;) tournaments, although this is now rarely done.

A round-robin tournament with four players is sometimes called &quot;quad&quot; or &quot;foursome&quot;.

==Applications==
In sports with a large number of competitive matches per season, double round-robins are common. Most association football leagues in the world are organized on a double round-robin basis, in which every team plays all others in its league once at home and once away. This system is also used in qualification for major tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup and the continental tournaments (e.g. UEFA European Championship, CONCACAF Gold Cup, AFC Asian Cup, CONMEBOL Copa América and CAF Cup of Nations). There are also round-robin cricket, bridge, chess, draughts, go, ice hockey, curling, and Scrabble tournaments. The World Chess Championship decided in 2005 and in 2007 on an eight-player double round-robin tournament where each player faces every other player once as white and once as black. There has been several major international cricket tournaments held in this format including ICC events, including the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.

In a more extreme example, the KBO League in baseball plays a 16-fold round robin, with each of the 10 teams playing each other 16 times for a total of 144 games per team.

LIDOM (Baseball Winter League in the Dominican Republic) plays an 18-fold round robin as a semi final tournament between four classified teams.

Group tournaments rankings usually go by number of matches won and drawn, with any of a variety of tiebreaker criteria.

Frequently, pool stages within a wider tournament are conducted on a round-robin basis. Examples with single round-robin scheduling include the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship, and UEFA Cup (2004–2009) in football, Super Rugby (rugby union) in the Southern Hemisphere during its past iterations as Super 12 and Super 14 (but &quot;not&quot; in its later 15- and 18-team formats), the Cricket World Cup along with Indian Premier League, major Twenty-20 Cricket tournament, and many American football college conferences, such as the Conference USA (which currently has 9 members). The group phases of the UEFA club competitions and Copa Libertadores are contested as a double round-robin, as are most basketball leagues outside the United States, including the regular season of the EuroLeague (as well as its former Top 16 phase); the United Football League has used a double round-robin for both its 2009 and 2010 seasons.

Season ending tennis tournaments also use a round robin format prior to the semi on stages.

==Evaluation==
===Advantages===
The champion in a round-robin tournament is the contestant that wins the most games, except when draws are possible.

In theory, a round-robin tournament is the fairest way to determine the champion from among a known and fixed number of contestants. Each contestant, whether player or team, has equal chances against all other opponents because there is no prior seeding of contestants that will preclude a match between any given pair. The element of luck is seen to be reduced as compared to a knockout system since one or two bad performances need not ruin a competitor&#x27;s chance of ultimate victory. Final records of participants are more accurate, in the sense that they represent the results over a longer period against the same opposition.

The system is also better for ranking all participants, not just determining the winner. This is helpful to determine the final rank of all competitors, from strongest to weakest, for purposes of qualification for another stage or competition as well as for prize money.

In team sports, the round-robin major league champions are generally regarded as the &quot;best&quot; team in the land, rather than the cup winners, whose tournaments usually follow a single-elimination format.

Moreover, in tournaments such as the FIFA or ICC World Cups, a first round stage consisting of a number of mini round robins between groups of 4 teams guards against the possibility of a team travelling possibly thousands of miles only to be eliminated after just one poor performance in a straight knockout system. The top one, two, or occasionally three teams in these groups then proceed to a straight knockout stage for the remainder of the tournament.

In the circle of death it is possible that no champion emerges from a round-robin tournament, even if there is no draw, but most sports have tie-breaker systems which resolve this.

===Disadvantages===
Round-robins can suffer from being too long compared to other tournament types, and with later scheduled games potentially not having any substantial meaning. They may also require tie-breaking procedures.

Swiss system tournaments attempt to combine elements of the round-robin and elimination formats, to provide a worthy champion using fewer rounds than a round-robin, while allowing draws and losses.

====Tournament length====
The main disadvantage of a round robin tournament is the time needed to complete it. Unlike a knockout tournament where half of the participants are eliminated after each round, a round robin requires one round less than the number of participants. For instance, a tournament of 16 teams can be completed in just 4 rounds (i.e. 15 matches) in a knockout format; a double elimination tournament format requires 30 (or 31) matches, but a round-robin would require 15 rounds (i.e. 120 matches) to finish if each competitor faces each other once.

Other issues stem from the difference between the theoretical fairness of the round robin format and practice in a real event. Since the victor is gradually arrived at through multiple rounds of play, teams who perform poorly, who might have been quickly eliminated from title contention, are forced to play out their remaining games. Thus games are played late in the competition between competitors with no remaining chance of success. Moreover, some later matches will pair one competitor who has something left to play for against another who does not. It may also be possible for a competitor to play the strongest opponents in a round robin in quick succession while others play them intermittently with weaker opposition. This asymmetry means that playing the same opponents is not necessarily completely equitable.

There is also no scheduled showcase final match unless (by coincidence) two competitors meet in the last match of the tournament, with the result of that match determining the championship. A notable instance of such an event was the 1950 FIFA World Cup match between Uruguay and Brazil.

====Qualified teams====
Further issues arise where a round-robin is used as a qualifying round within a larger tournament. A competitor already qualified for the next stage before its last game may either not try hard (in order to conserve resources for the next phase) or even deliberately lose (if the scheduled next-phase opponent for a lower-placed qualifier is perceived to be easier than for a higher-placed one).

Four pairs in the 2012 Olympics Women&#x27;s doubles badminton, having qualified for the next round, were ejected from the competition for attempting to lose in the round robin stage to avoid compatriots and better ranked opponents. The round robin stage at the Olympics was a new introduction, and these potential problems were readily known prior to the tournament; changes were made prior to the next Olympics to prevent a repeat of these events.

====Circle of death====
Another disadvantage, especially in smaller round-robins, is the &quot;circle of death&quot;, where teams cannot be separated on a head-to-head record. In a three-team round-robin, where A defeats B, B defeats C, and C defeats A, all three competitors will have a record of one win and one loss, and a tiebreaker will need to be used to separate the teams. This famously happened during the 1994 FIFA World Cup Group E, where all four teams finished with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss. This phenomenon is analogous to the Condorcet paradox in voting theory.

==Scheduling algorithm==
If formula_1 is the number of competitors, a pure round robin tournament requires formula_2 games. If formula_1 is even, then in each of formula_4 rounds, formula_5 games can be run concurrently, provided there exist sufficient resources (e.g. courts for a tennis tournament). If formula_1 is odd, there will be formula_1 rounds, each with formula_8 games, and one competitor having no game in that round.

=== Circle method ===
The circle method is a simple algorithm to create a schedule for a round-robin tournament. All competitors are assigned to numbers, and then paired in the first round:

Next, one of the competitors in the first or last column of the table is fixed (number one in this example) and the others rotated clockwise one position:

This is repeated until when the next iteration would lead back to the initial pairings:

With an even number formula_1 of competitors this algorithm realizes every possible combination of them (equivalently, that all pairs realized are pairwise different).

First, the algorithm obviously realizes every pair of competitors if one of them equals formula_10 (the non-moving competitor).

Next, for pairs of non-formula_10 competitors, let their distance be the number formula_12 of times the rotation has to be carried out in order that one competitor arrives at the position the other had.

In the example given (formula_13), formula_14 has distance formula_10 to formula_16 and to formula_17 and it has distance formula_18 to formula_19 and to formula_20.

In a round, a non-leftmost position (not including formula_10) can only be taken by competitors of a fixed distance. In round formula_10 of the example, in the second position competitor formula_14 plays against formula_24, their distance is formula_14. In round formula_14, this position is held by competitors formula_17 and formula_28, also having distance formula_14, etc. Similarly, the next position (formula_16 against formula_28 in round formula_10, formula_14 against formula_34 in round formula_14, etc.) can only hold distance-formula_36 competitors.

For every formula_12, there are exactly formula_38 pairs of distance formula_39. There are formula_38 rounds and they all realize one distance-formula_39 pair at the same position. Clearly, these pairs are pairwise different. The conclusion is that every distance-formula_39 pair is realized.

This holds for every formula_39, hence, every pair is realized.

If there are an odd number of competitors, a dummy competitor can be added, whose scheduled opponent in a given round does not play and has a bye. The schedule can therefore be computed as though the dummy were an ordinary player, either fixed or rotating.

Instead of rotating one position, any number relatively prime to formula_44 will generate a complete schedule. The upper and lower rows can indicate home/away in sports, white/black in chess, etc.; to ensure fairness, this must alternate between rounds since competitor 1 is always on the first row. If, say, competitors 3 and 8 were unable to fulfil their fixture in the third round, it would need to be rescheduled outside the other rounds, since both competitors would already be facing other opponents in those rounds. More complex scheduling constraints may require more complex algorithms. This schedule is applied in chess and draughts tournaments of rapid games, where players physically move round a table. In France this is called the Carousel-Berger system (Système Rutch-Berger).

The schedule can also be used for &quot;asynchronous&quot; round-robin tournaments where all games take place at different times (for example, because there is only one venue). The games are played from left to right in each round, and from the first round to the last. When the number of competitors is even, this schedule performs well with respect to quality and fairness measures such as the amount of rest between games. On the other hand, when the number of competitors is odd, it does not perform so well and a different schedule is superior with respect to these measures.

=== Berger tables ===
Alternatively Berger tables, named after the Austrian chess master Johann Berger, are widely used in the planning of tournaments. Berger published the pairing tables in his two &quot;Schach-Jahrbücher&quot; (Chess Annals), with due reference to its inventor Richard Schurig.

This constitutes a schedule where player 14 has a fixed position, and all other players are rotated counterclockwise formula_45 positions. This schedule is easily generated manually. To construct the next round, the last player, number 8 in the first round, moves to the head of the table, followed by player 9 against player 7, player 10 against 6, until player 1 against player 2. Arithmetically, this equates to adding formula_45 to the previous row, with the exception of player formula_1. When the result of the addition is greater than formula_44, then subtract formula_44 from the sum.

This schedule can also be represented as a (n-1, n-1) table, expressing a round in which players meets each other. For example, player 7 plays against player 11 in round 4. If a player meets itself, then this shows a bye or a game against player n. All games in a round constitutes a diagonal in the table.

The above schedule can also be represented by a graph, as shown below:
Both the graph and the schedule were reported by Édouard Lucas in as a recreational mathematics puzzle. Lucas, who describes the method as &quot;simple and ingenious&quot;, attributes the solution to Felix Walecki, a teacher at Lycée Condorcet. Lucas also included an alternative solution by means of a sliding puzzle.

=== Mnemonic ===
To easily remember this method, the following mnemonic can be used. Starting from the first round,

the next round is constructed:

and then,

If the number of players is odd, the player in the first venue gets a bye. If the number is even, an added player (ω) becomes the opponent.

=== Original construction of pairing tables by Richard Schurig (1886) ===
For an even number formula_1 or an odd number formula_51 of competitors, Schurig builds a table with formula_52 vertical rows and formula_38 horizontal rows. Then he populates it starting from the top left corner by repeating the sequence of numbers from 1 up to formula_38. Here is an example table for 7 or 8 competitors:
Then to get the opponents a second table is constructed. Every horizontal row formula_55 is populated with the same numbers as row formula_56 in the previous table (the last row is populated with numbers from the first row in the original table), but in the reverse order (from right to left). 
By merging above tables:

Then the first column is updated: if the number of competitors is even, player number formula_1 is alternatingly substituted for the first and second positions, whereas if the number of competitors is odd a bye is used instead.

The pairing tables were published as an annex concerning the arrangements for the holding of master tournaments. Schurig did not provide a proof nor a motivation for his algorithm.

<doc id="939743" wikidata="Q5006416" url="?curid=939743" title="C. E. M. Joad">
<text>Cyril Edwin Mitchinson Joad (12 August 1891 – 9 April 1953) was an English philosopher, author, teacher and broadcasting personality. He appeared on &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, a BBC Radio wartime discussion programme. He popularised philosophy and became a celebrity, before his downfall in a scandal over an unpaid train fare in 1948.

==Early life==
Joad was born in Durham, the only son of Edwin and Mary Joad (née Smith). In 1892 his father became an Inspector of Schools and the family moved to Southampton, where he received a very strict Christian upbringing. Joad started school at the age of five in 1896, attending Oxford Preparatory School (later called the Dragon School) until 1906, and then Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton, Devon, until 1910.

===Balliol College===
In 1910 Joad went up to Balliol College, Oxford. Here he developed his skills as a philosopher and debater. By 1912 he was a first class sportsman and Oxford Union debater. He also became a Syndicalist, a Guild Socialist, and then a Fabian. In 1913 he heard about George Bernard Shaw through the newly founded magazine the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. This developed his study of philosophy, one of the building blocks for his career as a teacher and broadcaster. After completing his course at Balliol, achieving a first in Honour Moderations in Literae Humaniores (1912), a first in Greats (a combination of philosophy and ancient history, 1914) and John Locke scholarship in mental philosophy (1914), Joad entered the civil service.

==Civil service==
Joad began at the Board of Trade in 1914 after attending a Fabian Summer School. His aim was to infuse the civil service with a socialist ethos. Joad socialised with other Fabians like Agnes Harben and her husband, and was quoted on the experience of meeting suffragettes recovering from hunger strike mixing with the &#x27;county set&#x27;. He worked in the Labour Exchanges Department of the Board of Trade, the department becoming the new Ministry of Labour in 1916. In the months leading up to the First World War he displayed &quot;ardent&quot; pacifism, which resulted in political controversy. Joad, along with George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell, became unpopular with many who were trying to encourage men to enlist as soldiers to fight for their country.

==Marriage==
In May 1915 Joad married Mary White, and they bought a home in Westhumble, near Dorking, in Surrey. The village, formerly home to Fanny Burney, was near to the founder of the Fabian Society, Beatrice Webb. Joad evaded conscription by fleeing to Snowdonia, Wales. After the birth of three children, Joad&#x27;s marriage ended in separation in 1921. Joad later said that his separation had caused him to abandon his feminism and instead adopt a belief in the &quot;inferior mind&quot; of women.

== Life after separation ==
After the separation Joad moved to Hampstead in London with a student teacher, Marjorie Thomson. She was the first of many mistresses, all of whom were introduced as &#x27;Mrs Joad&#x27;. He described sexual desire as &quot;a buzzing bluebottle that needed to be swatted promptly before it distracted a man of intellect from higher things.&quot; He believed that female minds lacked objectivity, and he had no interest in women without sexual congress. Joad was &quot;short and rotund, with bright little eyes, round, rosy cheeks, and a stiff, bristly beard.&quot;

Job interviews proved a great difficulty for Joad, due to his flippancy. In 1930, he left the civil service to become Head of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London. The department was small and he made full use of his great teaching skills. He popularised philosophy, and many other philosophers were beginning to take him seriously. With his two books, &quot;Guide to Modern Thought&quot; (1933) and &quot;Guide to Philosophy&quot; (1936), he became a well-known figure.

==1930s–1940s==

In his early life Joad very much shared the desire for the destruction of the Capitalist system. He was expelled from the Fabian Society in 1925 because of sexual misbehaviour at its summer school, and did not rejoin until 1943. In 1931, disenchanted with Labour in office, Joad became Director of Propaganda for the New Party. Owing to the rise of Oswald Mosley&#x27;s pro-Fascist sympathies, Joad resigned, along with John Strachey. Soon afterwards he became bitterly opposed to Nazism, but he continued to oppose militarism and gave his support to pacifist organisations, including the No More War Movement and the Peace Pledge Union.

While at Birkbeck College Joad played a leading role in The King and Country debate. The motion, devised by David Graham and debated on Thursday 9 February 1933, was &quot;that this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country.” The debate was often interpreted as illustrating both the attitude of Oxford undergraduates and the state of Europe at the time; Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor of Germany just ten days prior to the debate. Joad was the principal speaker in favour of the proposition, which passed by a vote of 275 to 153. Joad&#x27;s speech was described as “well-organized and well-received, and probably the single most important reason for the outcome of the debate.” Joad&#x27;s part in the debate caused him to gain a public reputation as an absolute pacifist. Joad was also involved in the National Peace Council, which he chaired, 1937–38.

Joad was an outspoken controversialist; he declared his main intellectual influences were George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. He was strongly critical of contemporary philosophical trends such as Marxism, Behaviorism and Psychoanalysis. He was also repeatedly referred to as &quot;the Mencken of England&quot;, although, as Kunitz and Haycraft pointed out, Joad and Mencken &quot;would be at sword&#x27;s point on most issues&quot;. On aesthetics he was incurably platonic: on listening to the &quot;lowering effect&quot; of Debussy&#x27;s music, he felt his &quot;vitality and zest for life draining away&quot;; jazz and swing music are &quot;sounds which do not strictly belong to the class of music at all&quot;; Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London&quot; was partly &quot;meaningless... some of the allusions baffle the intellect&quot;; symbolism in art is &quot;often used as a device... for disguising the fact that there is nothing to communicate&quot;, citing Denton Welch&#x27;s &quot;Narcissus Bay&quot; as an example; and in her &quot;persistent refusal to grade, to give moral marks or to assign values&quot;, he found Virginia Woolf&#x27;s work leaving him feeling that &quot;nothing seems to be very much worth while&quot;.

Joad&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Under the Fifth Rib&quot; included &quot;The dominating interest of my University career, an interest which has largely shaped my subsequent outlook on life, was Socialism. And my Socialism was by no means the mere undergraduate pose which what I have said hitherto may have suggested. Admittedly I and my Socialist contemporaries talked a good deal of inflated nonsense; admittedly we played with theories as a child plays with toys from sheer intellectual exuberance. But we also did a considerable amount of hard thinking.&quot;

Joad crusaded to preserve the English countryside against industrial exploitation, ribbon development, overhead cables and destructive tourism. He wrote letters and articles in protest against decisions being made to increase Britain&#x27;s wealth and status, as he believed the short term status would bring long-term problems. He organised rambles and rode recklessly through the countryside. Joad was also associated with the fledgling naturist movement in England. He also had a passion for hunting.

Hating the idea of nothing to do, Joad organised on average nine lectures per week and two books per year. His popularity soared and he was invited to give many lectures and lead discussions. He also involved himself in sporting activities such as tennis and hockey, and recreational activities such as bridge, chess and the player piano. He was a great conversationalist, and enjoyed entertaining distinguished members of society.

After the outbreak of the Second World War he became disgusted at the lack of liberty being shown (he was a founding vice-president of the National Council for Civil Liberties from 1934). He went as far as to beg the Ministry of Information to make use of him. In January 1940 Joad was selected for a BBC Home Service wartime discussion programme, &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, which was an immediate success, attracting millions of listeners. Shortly afterwards Joad abandoned his pacifism and placed his support behind the British war effort. Although Joad never reverted to pacifism, he actively supported at least one conscientious objector during the war, leading to a pamphlet, &quot;The Present Position of Conscientious Objection&quot;, published by the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, 1944. Joad also opposed the continuation of conscription into peacetime, writing the pamphlet &quot;The Rational Approach to Conscription&quot;, published by the No Conscription Council, 1947.

==Psychical research==
Joad was interested in the paranormal, and partnered with Harry Price on a number of ghost-hunting expeditions, also joining the Ghost Club, of which Price became the president. He involved himself in psychical research, travelling to the Harz Mountains to help Price to test whether the &#x27;Bloksberg Tryst&#x27; would turn a male goat into a handsome prince at the behest of a maiden pure in heart; it did not. In 1934 he became Chairman of the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation, an unofficial committee formed by Price as a successor body to his National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In 1939, Joad&#x27;s publications on psychical research were severely criticised in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Society for Psychical Research. It was discovered that Joad was not present at séances he had claimed to have attended. Price later suspended the operations of the council.

Joad opposed the spiritualist hypothesis of mediumship. He debated the psychical researcher Shaw Desmond on spiritualism. He argued against immortality and spirit communication, preferring his &quot;mindlet&quot; hypothesis which held that bundle of ideas which were formerly regarded as the mind of the dead person may survive death for a temporal period of time. During the later years of his life he published articles on how extrasensory perception may fit into a Christian framework.

==&quot;The Brains Trust&quot;==
Joad&#x27;s prominence came from &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, which featured a small group including Commander A. B. Campbell and Julian Huxley. His developed and matured discussion techniques, his fund of anecdotes and mild humour brought him to the attention of the general public.

The programme came to deal with difficult questions posed by listeners, and the panellists would discuss the question in great detail, and render a philosophical opinion. Examples of the questions ranged from &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; to &quot;How can a fly land upside-down on the ceiling?&quot; Joad became a star of the show, his voice being the most heard on radio except for the news. Joad nearly always opened with the catchphrase &quot;It all depends on what you mean by…&quot; when responding to a question. Although there was opposition from Conservatives, who complained about political bias, the general public considered him the greatest British philosopher of the day and celebrity status followed.

==Rise and fall==
As Joad had become so well known, he was invited to give after-dinner speeches, open bazaars, even advertise tea, and his book sales soared. He stood as a Labour candidate at a by-election in November 1946 for the Combined Scottish Universities constituency but lost.

Joad once boasted in print, &quot;I cheat the railway company whenever I can.&quot; On 12 April 1948 Joad was caught travelling on a Waterloo to Exeter train without a valid ticket. When he failed to give a satisfactory explanation, he was convicted of fare dodging and fined £2 (). This made front-page headlines in the national newspapers, destroyed his hopes of a peerage and resulted in his dismissal from the BBC. The humiliation of this had a severe effect on Joad&#x27;s health, and he soon became confined to bed at his home in Hampstead. Joad renounced his agnosticism and returned to the Christianity of the Church of England, which he detailed in his book &quot;The Recovery of Belief&quot;, published in 1952.

==Death==
After the bed-confining thrombosis following his dismissal from the BBC in 1948, Joad developed terminal cancer. He died on 9 April 1953 at his home, 4 East Heath Road, Hampstead, aged 61, and was buried at Saint John&#x27;s-at-Hampstead Church in London.

==Legacy==
Joad was one of the best known British intellectuals of his time, as well known as George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell in his lifetime. He popularised philosophy, both in his books and by the spoken word. In spite of this, he was loathed by most academic philosophers, including Russell. Cambridge philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said, in a meeting where Joad had delivered a paper criticising the form of analytical philosophy popular at Cambridge, that &quot;naturally a slum landlord would object to slum clearance&quot;.

Quotes from Joad appear in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s monograph &quot;Three Guineas&quot;.
For example: 
&quot;If it is, then the sooner they give up the pretence of playing with public affairs and return to private life the better. If they cannot make a job of the House of Commons, let them at least make something of their own houses. If they cannot learn to save men from the destruction which incurable male mischievousness bids fair to bring upon them, let women at least learn to feed them, before they destroy themselves.&quot;

Joad was invited to appear at the Socratic Club, an undergraduate society at Oxford University, where he spoke on 24 January 1944, on the subject &quot;On Being Reviewed by Christians&quot;, an event attended by more than 250 students. This was a stepping-stone in Joad&#x27;s life, particularly at a time when he was re-examining his convictions. This re-examination eventually led to his return to the Christian faith of his youth, an event he mentioned in &quot;The Recovery of Belief&quot;. C. S. Lewis, President of the Socratic Club, is mentioned twice in this book, once as an influence on Joad through Lewis&#x27; book &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;. Part of his legacy, then, was to return to the faith that he had set aside as an Oxford undergraduate and to defend that faith in his writings.

Joad is also mentioned in Stephen Potter&#x27;s book &quot;Gamesmanship&quot;, as his partner in a tennis match in which the two men were up against two younger and fitter players who were outplaying them fairly comfortably, until Joad asked his opponent whether a ball that had clearly landed way behind the line was in or out; an event which Potter says made him start thinking about the concept of gamesmanship.

<text>In everyday language, a stitch in the context of embroidery or hand-sewing is defined as the movement of the embroidery needle from the back of the fibre to the front side and back to the back side. The thread stroke on the front side produced by this is also called &quot;stitch&quot;. In the context of embroidery, an embroidery stitch means one or more &quot;stitches&quot; that are always executed in the same way, forming a figure. Embroidery stitches are also called &quot;stitches&quot; for short.

Embroidery stitches are the smallest units in embroidery. Embroidery patterns are formed by doing many embroidery stitches, either all the same or different ones, either following a counting chart on paper, following a design painted on the fabric or even working freehand.

==Common stitches==
Embroidery uses various combinations of stitches. Each embroidery stitch has a special name to help identify it. These names vary from country to country and region to region. Some of the basic stitches of embroidery are running stitch, cross stitch, stem stitch, back stitch, satin stitch, chain stitch and blanket stitch. Stitches are categorized to stitch families based on the nature of the technique used to create the individual stitch. Some embroidery books will include name variations. Taken by themselves the stitches are mostly simple to execute, however when put together the results can be extremely complex.

Categorization of stitches will vary in stitch sampler books, and the breakdown of the stitches in the sections of the books may vary from those below. 

===Running stitches===

Straight stitches pass through the fabric ground in a simple up and down motion, and for the most part moving in a single direction. These stitches can be executed in straight or curved lines, and work well for fine details. They can be used as the basis for some composite stitches, and can have a contrasting thread interlaced in them. Examples of straight stitches are:
*Running or basting stitch
*Simple satin stitch
*Algerian eye stitch
*Fern stitch
Straight Stitches that have two journeys (generally forwards and backwards over the same path). Examples:
*Holbein stitch, also known as the double running stitch
*Bosnian stitch

===Back stitches===

Back stitches pass through the fabric ground in an encircling motion. The needle in the simplest backstitch comes up from the back of the fabric, makes a stitch to the right going back to the back of the fabric, then passes behind the first stitch and comes up to the front of the fabric to the left of the first stitch. The needle then goes back to the back of the fabric through the same hole the stitch first came up from. The needle then repeats the movement to the left of the stitches and continues. Some examples of a back stitch are:

* Stem stitch or outline stitch
* Split stitch – the needle pierces the thread as it comes back up
* Crewel stitch - one of the easiest and most useful stitches

===Chain stitches===
Chain stitches catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric. In the simplest of the looped stitches, the chain stitch, the needle comes up from the back of the fabric and then the needle goes back into the same hole it came out of, pulling the loop of thread almost completely through to the back; but before the loop disappears, the needle come back up (a certain distance from the beginning stitch -the distance deciding the length of the stitch), passes through the loop and prevents it from being pulled completely to the back of the fabric. The needle then passes back to the back of the fabric through the second hole and begins the stitch again. Examples of chain stitches are:
* Chain stitch
* Lazy Daisy stitch, or detached chain. The loop stitch is held to the fabric at the wide end by a tiny tacking stitch.
*Spanish Chain or Zig-zag Chain

===Buttonhole stitches===

Buttonhole or blanket stitches also catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric but the principal difference is that the needle does not return to the original hole to pass back to the back of the fabric. In the classic buttonhole stitch, the needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The finished stitch in some ways resembles a letter &quot;L&quot; depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric. This stitch is also the basis for many forms of needle lace. Examples of buttonhole or blanket stitches.
*Blanket stitch
*Buttonhole stitch
*Closed buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch touch to form triangles
*Crossed buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch cross
*Buttonhole stitches combined with knots:
**Top Knotted Buttonhole stitch
**German Knotted Buttonhole stitch
**Tailor&#x27;s buttonhole stitch

===Feather stitches===
Feather stitches can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including foliage, and branches borders, smocking, and crazy quilting. Most are looped stitches, worked alternatively from left to right. They can be worked on plain or even-weave fabrics.

* Feather stitch
* Closed feather stitch
* Maidenhair stitch
* Chained feather stitch
* Cretan stitch

===Cross stitches===

Cross stitches or cross-stitch might be the oldest ornamental stitch, and has been found in ancient Egyptian and Hebrew embroideries. It is found in the decorative needlework of many cultures. This stitch has come to represent an entire industry of pattern production and material supply for the craft person. The stitch is done by creating a line of diagonal stitches going in one direction, usually using the warp and weft of the fabric as a guide, then on the return journey crossing the diagonal in the other direction, creating an &quot;x&quot;. True cross stitch has legs of equal length that cross in the center. Also included in this class of stitches are:
*Herringbone stitches, including the hem stitch
*Breton stitch, here the threads of the &quot;x&quot; are twisted together
*Sprat&#x27;s Head stitch
*Crow&#x27;s Foot stitch, these last two stitches are often used in tailoring to strengthen a garment at a point of strain such as a pocket corner or the top of a kick pleat.

===Knotted stitches===

Knotted stitches are formed by wrapping the thread around the needle, once or several times, before passing it back to the back of the fabric ground. This is a predominant stitch in Brazilian embroidery, used to create flowers. Another form of embroidery that uses knots is Candlewicking, where the knots are created by forming a figure 8 around the needle. Examples of knotted stitches are:
*French knot, or twisted knot stitch
*Chinese knot, which varies from the French knot in that it takes a tiny stitch in the background fabric while creating the knot
*Bullion knots
*Coral stitch
*There are also more complex knotted stitches such as:
**Knotted Loop stitch
**Plaited Braid stitch
**Sorbello stitch
**Diamond stitch
*Knotted edgings based on buttonhole stitches include:
**Antwerp edging stitch
**Armenian edging stitch

===Couching and laid work===

Couching or laid stitches involve two sets of threads: the set that is being &#x27;laid&#x27; onto the surface of the fabric and the set which attaches the laid threads. The laid threads may be heavier than the attaching thread, or they may be of a nature that does not allow them to be worked like a regular embroidery thread, such as metal threads. The stitches used to attach the laid thread may be of any nature—cross stitch, buttonhole stitch, or straight stitch—but some have specific names:
* Pendant couching
* Bokhara couching
* Square laid work
* Oriental couching
* Battlement couching
* Klosterstitch
* Roumanian couching

<text>Pushing Hands () is a 1991 comedy-drama film directed by Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee, his feature directorial debut. It stars Sihung Lung as a Chinese tai chi master living in New York, who struggles to find his place in the world. The film shows the contrast between traditional Chinese ideas of Confucian relationships within a family and the much more informal Western emphasis on the individual. Together with Ang Lee&#x27;s two following films, &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; (1993) and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; (1994), it forms his &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; trilogy, each of which deals with conflicts between an older and more traditional generation and their children as they confront a world of change.

The Taiwanese-American co-production was produced independently by Lee and Ted Hope, and features several of Lee&#x27;s frequent collaborators, including screenwriter James Schamus and editor Tim Squyres. It was released theatrically in Taiwan, but did not see a wide release in the United States for several years, after the success of &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;. It was critically well-received, and earned several accolades, including three Golden Horse Awards.

==Plot==
The story begins with the Chinese tai chi master, Chu, immigrating to the United States to live with his son, Alex, and his family. Due to Chu&#x27;s inability to speak English and his American daughter-in-law, Martha&#x27;s, lack of Mandarin proficiency, communication between them is nearly impossible. They rely on Alex, who is bilingual, to serve as an interpreter. Martha finds Chu&#x27;s presence disruptive, as his daily routine interferes with her writing of her second novel. Chu teaches tai chi classes at the local Chinese cultural center on Sundays, where he meets Mrs. Chen, another Beijing immigrant who teaches cooking.

The narrative depicts the conflict between Chu and Martha, as well as Alex&#x27;s struggle between filial duty and practical responsibilities. One evening, while Alex is out, Chu goes for a walk against Martha&#x27;s wishes, triggering a family crisis. Subsequently, Chu moves out of the house to live independently. He finds a job as a dishwasher in a small Chinatown apartment but faces discrimination from the owner. Using his tai chi skills, Chu defends himself during a confrontation with the owner, earning respect from others.

The story concludes with Alex realizing his misunderstandings about his father and attempting to reconcile. Despite Chu&#x27;s insistence on living alone, Alex expresses his love and hopes for him to visit regularly and see his grandson. Ultimately, Chu and Mrs. Chen continue their lives in Chinatown, pursuing freedom and independence.

== Cast ==

*Sihung Lung as Mr. Chu (), a tai chi master who travels to the United States.
* Bo Z. Wang as Alex Chu (), Chu&#x27;s son. He acts as an interpreter between Mr. Chu and Martha, but he deliberately mistranslates to reduce tensions between the two parties. 
* Deb Snyder as Martha Chu (), Alex&#x27;s European American wife. Martha, who does not speak or understand Chinese.
* Wang Lai as Mrs. Chen (), a widow who is a cooking instructor at the area Chinese community center.
*Haan Lee as Jeremy Chu (), Alex and Martha&#x27;s son.
* Fanny De Luz as Linda (), Martha&#x27;s friend.
*Hung-Chang Wang as Boss Huang, the owner of a Chinatown restaurant where Chu ends up working.
*Emily Yi-Ming Liu as Chen Yi-quan, Mrs. Chen&#x27;s adult daughter.

==Title==

The title of the film refers to the pushing hands training that is part of the grandfather&#x27;s tai chi routine. Pushing hands is a two-person training which teaches tai chi students to yield in the face of brute force. Tai chi teachers were persecuted in China during the Cultural Revolution, and the grandfather&#x27;s family was broken up as a result. He sent his son to the West several years earlier and when he could he came to live with his family with the expectation of picking up where they left off, but he was unprepared for the very different atmosphere of the West. &quot;Pushing Hands&quot; thereby alludes to the process of adaptation to culture shock felt by a traditional teacher in moving to the United States.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Taiwanese-born filmmaker Ang Lee had graduated from New York University Tisch School of the Arts in 1984, but had failed to find career opportunities since, working almost full-time as a house-father. During the intermediate six years, he became interested in martial arts, specifically tai chi, after reading the &quot;wuxia&quot; novel &quot;Jianghu qixia zhuan&quot; (The Story of an Extraordinary Gallant Errant). Lee first developed the idea of a film about an old man and old woman falling in love in front of their children, but did not start writing the script until he learned of a script competition being held by the Government Information Office of Taiwan. Lee began writing in February 1990, while practicing tai chi at a nearby community college. At the end of March, the script for &quot;Pushing Hands&quot; was submitted along with the one for &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot;, which he had already written. His scripts came in first and second, respectively.

The winning screenplays brought Lee to the attention of Hsu Li-kong, a recently promoted senior manager in a major studio who had a strong interest in Lee&#x27;s unique style and freshness. Hsu, a first-time producer, invited Lee to direct &quot;Pushing Hands&quot;. The film was financed by the Taiwanese production company Central Motion Pictures, who also handled the film&#x27;s domestic release. Lee hired Ted Hope and James Schamus of Good Machine to act as the U.S. production coordinator. Due to concerns about the international market and the American character, Ang asked Schamus to help rewrite the script.

=== Casting ===
The leading role of Mr. Chu was played by Sihung Lung, a veteran Taiwanese film, TV, and stage actor. At the time of his casting, he had already retired from acting, but enjoyed the script so much he came out of retirement to star in it. He would become one of Lee&#x27;s frequent collaborators, subsequently starring in &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot;, &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; (where he also played a character named Chu), and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Good Machine initially estimated that the filming period of the film would be three weeks, but under Lee&#x27;s insistence, Schamus and Hope changed the shooting period to four weeks. Before filming began, the crew spent two weeks setting and rehearsing. On the day of the shooting, the crew set up a table and incense, and held a gong ceremony, a practice Lee would continue into his future projects.

The film was shot entirely on-location in New York City, making it the first Taiwanese film to be shot entirely in the United States. The Chu residence was a house located in the North Riverdale sub-neighborhood of The Bronx. Ang requested that the house have very large windows in order to photograph the interior from the outside. Because the house didn&#x27;t have any furniture, the crew transported furniture from Manhattan, but Ang was not satisfied. Ang moved his own furniture onto the set, which was later destroyed in the scene where Alex trashes the kitchen. Some of the paintings used as props in the house were donated to the production by Ang&#x27;s artist friend. During production, one such painting was stolen.

The scenes set in the jail were filmed at a detention center in Yonkers. During the filming process, many overseas Chinese students studying in the United States enthusiastically assisted the crew.

== Reception ==
The film was critically acclaimed in both Taiwan and the United States. Donald Lyons wrote that Lee&#x27;s filming style displayed &quot;a mastery of the visual dynamics of interior spaces and their psychic pressures.&quot;

<text>Steven M. Newman (born May 31, 1954) is an American world trekker, public speaker and author. From April 1983 to April 1987, he walked solo around the world and became popularly known as &quot;The Worldwalker&quot;. He is the author or co-author of two books. The longest hiking trail in Ohio&#x27;s state park system, the Steven Newman Worldwalker Perimeter Trail at East Fork State Park, has been named after him.

== Career ==

Newman graduated from Ohio University in 1977 with a degree in journalism. He later returned to his hometown of Bethel to begin what would eventually be officially recognized as the first documented solo walk around the world, complete with having someone from each town he visited sign his log book. His walk around the world was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records.

Newman aimed to look at the world (even staying with over 400 families during his travels), stating &quot;I wanted it not only to be a look at the world, but a test of the world. I wanted to see how the world treated a stranger. I set out with the pledge to never ask for more than a drink of water, and if someone didn&#x27;t offer me food, I would go hungry that day. If no one offered me a place to sleep, I would sleep on the ground.&quot;

Newman&#x27;s walk took four years, spanning 21,000 miles (with flights done to get him from Boston to Ireland and other flights to Yugoslavia and Australia) and 40 million steps. His father, Edwin, died in 1984 while Newman was walking in India. Upon completing his walk, city officials in Bethel declared the day of his return an official holiday.

In 1989, William Morrow and Company published a book by Newman, &quot;Worldwalk&quot;, about his journey.

<text>The Rollright Stones are a complex of three Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments near the village of Long Compton, on the borders of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. Constructed from local oolitic limestone, the three monuments, now known as the King&#x27;s Men and the Whispering Knights in Oxfordshire and the King Stone in Warwickshire, are distinct in their design and purpose. They were built at different periods in late prehistory. During the period when the three monuments were erected, there was a continuous tradition of ritual behaviour on sacred ground, from the 4th to the 2nd millennium BCE.

The first to be constructed was the Whispering Knights, a dolmen that dates to the Early or Middle Neolithic period. It was likely to have been used as a place of burial. This was followed by the King&#x27;s Men, a stone circle that was constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age; unusually, it has parallels to other circles located further north, in the Lake District, implying a trade-based or ritual connection. The third monument, the King Stone, is a single monolith. Although its construction has not been dated, the dominant theory amongst archaeologists is that it was a Bronze Age grave marker.

The British philologist Richard Coates has proposed that the name &quot;Rollright&quot; is from the Brittonic phrase &quot;*rodland rïx&quot; &#x27;wheel enclosure groove&#x27;, where &quot;*rïx&quot; &#x27;groove&#x27; refers to a narrow valley near Great Rollright and &quot;*rodland&quot; &#x27;wheel enclosure&#x27; refers to the King&#x27;s Men circle. By the Early Modern period, folkloric stories had developed about the Stones, telling of how they had once been a king and his knights who had been turned to stone by a witch. Such stories continued to be taught amongst local people well into the 19th century. Meanwhile, antiquarians such as William Camden, John Aubrey and William Stukeley had begun to take an interest in the monuments. Fuller archaeological investigations were undertaken in the 20th century, culminating in excavations run by George Lambrick in the 1980s. The site is listed by Historic England as a scheduled monument and was first designated in 1882.

In the 20th century, the stones became an important site for adherents of various forms of Contemporary Paganism, as well as for other esotericists, who hold magico-religious ceremonies there. They also began to be referred to more widely in popular culture, being featured in television, literature, music and art.

==Location==

The Rollright Stones are on the contemporary border between the counties of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, north-northwest of the town of Chipping Norton, and west of the smaller village at Great Rollright. The monuments are on the scarp of the Cotswold Hills, just as the scarp forms a ridge between the Stour valley to the north and the Swere valley to the south. Geologically, this ridge had been formed from Chipping Norton limestone, itself a variant of the Great Oolite series of Jurassic limestone.

==Background==

===Early Neolithic Britain===
In the 4th millennium BCE, around the start of the Neolithic period in Britain, British society underwent radical changes. These coincided with the introduction to the island of domesticated species of animals and plants, as well as a changing material culture that included pottery. These developments allowed hunter-gatherers to settle down and produce their own food. As agriculture spread, people cleared land. At the same time, they also erected the first monuments to be seen in the local landscape. Such activity has been interpreted as evidence of a change in the way people viewed their place in the world.

During the Early and the Middle Neolithic large megalithic tombs were constructed across the British Isles. Because they housed the bodies of the dead, archeologists have typically believed these tombs to indicate rituals around death and ancestor veneration by those who constructed them. Such Neolithic tombs are common across much of western Europe, from Iberia to Scandinavia. The practice was likely brought to the British Isles along with, or roughly concurrent to, the introduction of farming. A widely held theory amongst archaeologists is that these megalithic tombs were intentionally made to resemble the long timber houses which had been constructed by Neolithic farming peoples in the Danube basin from circa 4800 BCE.

As the historian Ronald Hutton related:
There is no doubt that these great tombs, far more impressive than would be required of mere repositories for bones, were the centres of ritual activity in the early Neolithic: they were shrines as well as mausoleums. For some reason, the success of farming and the veneration of ancestral and more recent bones had become bound up together in the minds of the people.

===Late Neolithic Britain===
During the Late Neolithic, British society underwent a series of major changes. Between 3500 and 3300 BCE, these prehistoric Britons ceased their continual expansion and cultivation of wilderness. Instead they settled and farmed the most agriculturally productive areas of the island: Orkney, eastern Scotland, Anglesey, the upper Thames, Wessex, Essex, Yorkshire and the river valleys of The Wash.

Late Neolithic Britons also appeared to have changed their religious beliefs, ceasing to construct the large chambered tombs that archeologists widely think were connected with ancestor veneration. Instead, they began the construction of large wooden or stone circles, with many hundreds being built across Britain and Ireland over a period of a thousand years.

==Construction==
The Rollright Stones are three separate megalithic monuments, constructed close to one another during the later prehistoric ages of the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Their current names  – the King&#x27;s Men, the King Stone, and the Whispering Knights – descend from folklore that has surrounded the site since the Early Modern period. These local terms have since been adopted by archaeologists and heritage managers.

Fragments of stone used in the construction of the monument underwent a petrological examination at the British Museum in London, where it was established that they were a form of oolithic limestone that was local to the area around the Rollrights. Archaeologist George Lambrick argued that the stones had been discovered by prehistoric peoples as naturally occurring surface boulders, rather than having been quarried. He noted they had certain weathering patterns which were consistent with those found on surface boulders. He said that the most likely place that such surface boulders would have been found in the late prehistoric was &quot;on the sides of the ridge at or near the level of the strong spring line between the Inferior Oolithic and the Lias clay.&quot; If this had been the place where the megalith builders had found the boulders, the huge stones would have had to be transported up hill. The gradient averages about 1 in 15 on the shortest routes, for either 250 metres (for the Whispering Knights), or 450 metres (for the King Stone and King&#x27;s Men).

Basing his ideas upon experimental archaeological investigations performed at Stonehenge, Lambrick suggested that the prehistoric workers who hauled the stones uphill would have made use of wooden sledges. They may have used timber rollers beneath the sledges, in order to reduce the manpower needed to drag the sledge. Lambrick calculated the estimated work force and labour that would have been required to produce the Rollright Stone monuments. In comparison to that required for many other monuments, he concluded that the time and labour investment would have been &quot;trivial&quot;, and would not have stretched local resources in terms of manpower.

===The Whispering Knights===

Believed to be the earliest of the Rollright Stones, the Whispering Knights are the remains of the burial chamber of an Early or Middle Neolithic portal dolmen, lying 400 metres east of the King&#x27;s Men. Four standing stones survive, forming a chamber about two square metres in area around a fifth recumbent stone, probably the collapsed roof capstone. Although archaeologists and antiquarians had been speculating and debating the nature of the Whispering Knights for centuries, more about the monument was revealed only following the excavations carried out around the stones by George Lambrick and his team during the 1980s. They found that the portal dolmen had never been a part of a longer cairn, as had been suggested by some earlier investigators. In addition, they uncovered a few pieces of Neolithic pottery around the monument.

Writing in 1743, the antiquarian William Stukeley described the Whispering Knights as sitting upon a round barrow, something which Lambrick accepted as being &quot;reasonable in the context of a portal dolmen&quot;. But, he cautioned against accepting such an explanation too readily. He suggested that a &quot;mound-like effect&quot; could have been created at the base of the monument if ploughing in later centuries had led to the accumulation of soil around the dolmen&#x27;s uphill side and the removal of it on the downhill side. Excavation failed to provide evidence to prove either suggestion, leaving the issue &quot;ambiguous&quot;. Lambrick noted there was a possibility that some of the stratigraphic layers &quot;may represent the base of some sort of cairn&quot; around the Whispering Knights.

Lambrick believed that raising the capstone on the Whispering Knights would have been the hardest task of the Rollrights&#x27; construction. He said it was &quot;analogous&quot; to the raising of the lintels on Stonehenge. He suggested that the builders had constructed a ramp out of &quot;collected stones&quot;, which was &quot;placed against the back of the chamber&quot;. The capstone was then &quot;hauled up on rollers, probably running on logs embedded longitudinally in the ramp&quot;, in order to get it into position.

===The King&#x27;s Men===

The King&#x27;s Men is a stone circle in diameter, currently composed of seventy-seven closely spaced stones. It was constructed during the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age.

After undertaking limited excavation at the circle in the 1980s, Lambrick concluded that when it had been originally erected, it would have been a &quot;more perfect circle&quot; than it is today. He thought that each of the stones would have touched one another, creating a continuous barrier all the way around. He also speculated that the monument&#x27;s builders intentionally placed the smoother sides of the boulders to face inwards. The outer facing sides are predominantly rougher in texture.

Resistivity and magnetometry surveys undertaken during the 1980s revealed four magnetic anomalies within the centre of the circle, possibly representing &quot;pits related in some way to local ground surface undulations and the presence of localised burning.&quot; Lambrick noted that similar features could be found within the stone circles of Mayburgh, Stenness and Balbirnie. He said that it was a possible original prehistoric feature, although accepted it may equally have been the result of refuse deposited in the Romano-British period, or tree-planting holes.

Meanwhile, archaeological excavation revealed that there was &quot;no indication&quot; of there having been &quot;a substantial ditch&quot; either inside or outside the bank on which the stones were positioned.

Making an estimate of the time and manpower required for this project, Lambrick concluded that each of the King&#x27;s Men could have been constructed by a team of ten or twenty (depending on the size of the stone) in about two-and-a-half hours. He noted, however, that the time could have been reduced if the workers had been divided into two groups for some of the smaller stones. Concluding his examination of this issue, he argued that &quot;83 journeys by the whole team would have been required, giving an actual construction time of &quot;c&quot; 137 hours, or 3735 manhours.&quot; Adding to this &quot;210 manhours&quot; for digging the post holes for the boulders, as well as &quot;40 manhours for cutting timber and making the shear-legs and sledges&quot;, and &quot;another 40 for fetching and trimming the timbers&quot;, Lambrick concluded that a total of around &quot;4035 manhours&quot; would have gone into the construction of the stone circle. This would have been about three weeks&#x27; work for around twenty workers.

Since the late 19th century, the monument has been in part a reconstruction. In 1882, the owner of the site re-erected around a third of the stones that had previously fallen. Some were moved from their original positions. Using documentary evidence and lichen growth analysis, archaeologists have established that around that time, several new stones were added to the circle in order to fill in gaps where the original stone had been lost or destroyed. Lambrick doubted that more than two of those currently standing were modern additions. Four of the other, smaller additions were stolen by vandals in the 20th century.

===The King Stone===
The King Stone is a single, weathered monolith, 2.4 metres high by 1.5 metres wide, standing 76 metres north of the King&#x27;s Men. Unlike the other two of the Rollright monuments, it is of uncertain date. Many different interpretations have been made of the King Stone, with various arguments being presented as to what its original function was.

Lambrick catalogued six distinct hypotheses that had been presented by antiquarians and archaeologists over the preceding centuries and evaluated their likelihood. Some of these argued that it had been positioned in relation to the King&#x27;s Men stone circle, with others instead suggesting that it was a component of a long barrow or other burial site.

Lockyer (1909) and Thom (1967) suggested that the King Stone had been an astronomical marker that may at the same time have had a relation to the ceremonies being undertaken at the King&#x27;s Men. Lambrick dismissed any astronomical significance as unlikely, because the Stone aligns only with the rising of the star Capella as it would have appeared circa 1750 BCE. He notes there is no evidence that late prehistoric Britons valued the stars as important; they did build several of their monuments to have solar or lunar alignments.

Megalithic specialist Aubrey Burl in 1976 suggested that the King Stone had been a landmark or guidepost designed to mark the position of the King&#x27;s Men. Again, Lambrick disagreed with this, saying that its &quot;position and orientation make it too inconspicuous to be satisfactory as a marker for anyone approaching the circle either along the ridge or from the alleys either side.&quot; Early antiquarian John Aubrey and archaeologist Arthur Evans had suggested that the monolith was a surviving remnant of a stone avenue that had once led to the King&#x27;s Men. But Lambrick thought this unlikely, as no other archaeological evidence exists for such an avenue, and it would have been poorly aligned with the circle.

Other researchers had suggested that the stone was once a part of a long barrow. But Lambrick&#x27;s archaeological investigation in the 1980s failed to reveal any other evidence for such a monument. Bloxham had suggested in 1847 that the monolith was associated with a burial, or a larger cemetery. Lambrick came to agree with him, &quot;tentatively&quot; interpreting the monolith as a cemetery marker, primarily because of the &quot;unsatisfactory nature of other explanations and the existence nearby of Bronze Age barrows and cremations, one of which had been marked by a broad wooden post.&quot;

He estimated that when it was originally erected, the King Stone would have weighed somewhere in the region of 4.7 tonnes, but that since, much has been chipped away. Using his own estimates, Lambrick suggested that with a team of 58 workers, the King Stone could have been set up in about two hours.
==Folklore==

===Early Modern period===
Numerous folktales are associated with the stones. A rhyming version was reported by William Camden in 1610. A king riding across the county with his army was accosted by a local witch called Mother Shipton. She said to him:

&lt;poem&gt;Seven long strides thou shalt take, says she
And if Long Compton thou canst see,
King of England thou shalt be!&lt;/poem&gt;

His troops gathered in a circle to discuss the challenge, and his knights muttered amongst themselves, but the king boldly took seven steps forward. Rising ground blocked his view of Long Compton in the valley, and the witch cackled:

&lt;poem&gt;As Long Compton thou canst not see, King of England thou shalt not be! Rise up stick and stand still stone, For King of England thou shalt be none; Thou and thy men hoar stones shall be, And I myself an elder tree!&lt;/poem&gt;

The king became the solitary King Stone, while nearby his soldiers formed a &quot;cromlech&quot;, or circle, called the King&#x27;s Men. As the witch prepared to become an elder tree, she backtracked into four of the king&#x27;s knights, who had lagged behind and were whispering plots against the king. She turned them to stone as well. Today they are called the Whispering Knights.

===18th and 19th centuries===

Legend holds that as the church clock strikes midnight, the King Stone comes alive. Similarly, the king and his men were said to come to life on certain saints&#x27; days. 

The Rollright Stones became associated with fertility in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. Several different, related local customs arose in the nineteenth century: Girls from local villages ran naked around the stones at midnight of Midsummer&#x27;s Eve in the belief that they would see the man they were to marry. This drew upon earlier belief that eavesdropping upon the conversations of the living king and his men would likewise reveal the name of their future husband. Childless wives may have prayed to or near the King Stone, or rubbed their bare breasts on the King Stone as part of a local fertility-related custom.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation and preservation==

===Mediaeval accounts===
The earliest known written account describing the Rollrights comes from the 14th century CE, during the Late Mediaeval period in Britain. It was at this time that an unknown author wrote a tract entitled &quot;De Mirabilibus Britanniae&quot; (&quot;The Wonders of Britain&quot;) in which the prehistoric monuments at Stonehenge and the White Horse of Uffington were mentioned alongside the Rollrights. As the author related:

In the neighbourhood of Oxford there are great stones, arranged as it were in some connection by the hand of man. But at what time; or by what people; or for what memorial or significance, is unknown. Though the place is called by the inhabitants Rollendrith.

The nearby village, Great Rollright, is spelt as &quot;Magna Rollandryght&quot; in 1430.
The other village, Little Rollright, appears (in Latin) as &quot;Parva Roulondryght&quot; in 1460.

===Early Modern antiquarianism===

It was in the 16th century, during the Early Modern period of British history, that further written accounts of the Rollrights were made; one of the earliest of these was provided by the pioneering antiquarian John Leland (c.1503–1552) in his unpublished account of his travels across England, &quot;Itinerary&quot;. Nonetheless, despite the fact that he referred to it, he failed to go into any detail.

A more detailed account was made by his fellow antiquarian, William Camden (1551–1623), who wrote about it in his 1586 work &quot;Britannia&quot;, a topographical and historical survey of all of Great Britain and Ireland. Describing the stones and some of the folklore that the locals attributed to them, Camden went on to hypothesise that they were constructed as a &quot;memorial of some victory, perhaps by Rollo the Dane, who later possessed property in Normandy.&quot;

===John Aubrey and William Stukeley===
The antiquarians John Aubrey and William Stukeley were responsible for initiating modern study of Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge, Avebury and the Rollrights.

===Sheldon Tapestry Map===

An Elizabethan tapestry map of Warwickshire (the Sheldon Tapestry Map), created during the late 1580s for hanging in the home of Ralph Sheldon of Long Compton, is believed to be the earliest known depiction of the Rollright Stones on a map. After conservation and cleaning of the tapestry in 2012 it was noted for the first time that a number of monoliths, perhaps forming a stone circle, appear to be shown in the vicinity of Long Compton.

===Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments investigation: 1981–86===

At the start of the 1980s, the state-appointed Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments commissioned an investigation into the Rollright Stones and their immediate surroundings &quot;in order that a fully integrated policy for the future preservation and management of the complex might be formulated.&quot; This investigation took place between 1981 and 1982, and involved both archaeologists and historical researchers. As a part of the initial survey, historians undertook documentary research, examining the reports and accounts of the site that had been produced since the 17th century, with particular emphasis on antiquarian and early archaeological drawings. Aerial photographs of the area were looked at for signs of prehistoric crop marks, whilst both a geophysical survey and a fieldwalk of the area were undertaken.

With the surveying over, the investigators moved on to excavation, opening up several limited trial trenches, as well as excavating in its entirety one small round barrow, which had been heavily ploughed out. Excavator George Lambrick noted that, although the excavations had &quot;limited scope&quot;, &quot;a substantial new body of data&quot; was uncovered, revealing a number of lithics, pieces of pottery, soil profile changes, molluscan assemblages, carbonised plant remains and both animal and human bones, allowing archaeologists to build up a much wider image of the site and its surroundings.

An interim report on the project&#x27;s findings was published in a booklet written by Lambrick in 1983. He followed this up with an outline of the management history of the Stones, published in 1986. Lambrick&#x27;s third book on the monument appeared in 1988, published by the U.K. governmental body English Heritage as &quot;The Rollright Stones: Megaliths, monuments, and settlement in the prehistoric landscape&quot;. Containing the full site report, it was &quot;the first full record and analysis of the King&#x27;s Men, the Whispering Knights, the King Stone, and their archaeological setting&quot; and, in the book&#x27;s preface, the then Inspector of Ancient Monuments A.J. Fleming commented that the &quot;survey provides a firm basis for the improved management of the monument.&quot;

==Contemporary use==

===Contemporary Paganism===

In 1959, the Bricket Wood coven of Gardnerian Wiccans met for a ritual at the King&#x27;s Men, at which they hoped to reunite with the a group led by Doreen Valiente who had splintered from them several years before. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White suggested that this site was chosen because it was neutral ground not owned by either coven and because it had folkloric associations with the supernatural. Doyle White argued that the megalith&#x27;s folkloric associations with witchcraft were a key reason why Wiccans chose to adopt the site as a place for ritual; he highlighted that Valiente had discussed these folk tales in her books &quot;Where Witchcraft Lives&quot; (1962) and &quot;An ABC of Witchcraft&quot; (1973).

In 1975, the English ceremonial magician William G. Gray published a book entitled &quot;The Rollright Ritual&quot; which described his personal experiences with the site. In the book, Gray described a group of witches using the site, whose practices were reminiscent of those of his friend Robert Cochrane. Although it is unknown if Cochrane and his coven ever met at the site, The Regency, a Pagan group founded in 1966 by some of the coven&#x27;s members, did continue to meet there during the 1970s.

Many Pagans seek to meditate at the site with the intent of communing with spirit entities believed to reside there, while the American Pagan Diana Paxson has discussed her own performance of seidr at the site. Pagans have also left votive offerings at the site, which includes flowers and fruit, incense sticks, and tea lights, some of which has been characterised as &quot;ritual litter&quot; by heritage managers. In 2003, an archaeological excavation in the centre of the King&#x27;s Men circle revealed two recently buried crystals, while in 2011, Doyle White observed flowers inserted into cracks and fissures in the megaliths. Particular concern has been expressed about some offerings and other Pagan actions that damage the stones, such as coins that are wedged into cracks in the rock and fires that damage the rock itself as well as flora and lichen. Some Pagans have also had their cremated ashes scattered at the site. Within the Pagan community, concerns have been expressed about some practitioners tampering with the &#x27;energies&#x27; of the site during their rituals. For instance, a number of local Pagans were offended when US-based practitioners organised a &quot;Prophets&#x27; Conference&quot;, during which they planned to visit the site in order to &quot;awaken the stones&quot; through ritual; local Pagans argued that the stones were already &quot;awakened&quot;, and successfully lobbied for the conference organisers to cancel the event.

Examining the relationship between archaeologists and Pagans in early 21st-century Britain, archaeologist Robert Wallis and anthropologist Jenny Blain noted that members of both communities have &quot;made common cause&quot; at the Rollright Stones, developing &quot;a climate of inclusivity and multivocality&quot; which has produced &quot;fruitful negotiation&quot;.

===Earth Mysteries===

The site has also attracted interest from individuals involved in the Earth Mysteries movement. Alfred Watkins suggested that the Rollright Stones were part of a ley line running through Long Compton church, Chipping Norton church, and a tumulus near Charlbury.
During the late 1970s, the Dragon Project — led by the Earth Mysteries proponent Paul Devereux — carried out investigations at the site in an attempt to determine if any anomalous phenomena could be detected there. They concluded that ultrasonic pulsing could be detected at the King Stone at sunrise, while there were no ultrasound readings in the King&#x27;s Men circle at the summer solstice, suggesting that the stones acted as a shield from the low levels of ultrasound found elsewhere in the landscape. Devereux and Thomson suggested that the Stones were also part of another ley line, running from Arbury Banks in Northamptonshire to All Saints Church in Wroxton. A third putative ley line involving the Rollright Stones has also been suggested, running from the King&#x27;s Men circle to the Uffington White Horse.

===The Rollright Trust===

During the 1990s, the owner of the site, Pauline Flick, decided to sell it. In 1997 a campaign was launched by individuals — including a number of Pagans who used the site for ritual purposes — who feared that it would be purchased by those who would either turn it into a commercialised tourist attraction or prevent anyone from visiting it. They established a private charity, the Rollright Trust, which was eventually able to secure ownership through private donations and a grant from the Hanson Environment Fund. A ceremony was held in which the deeds were handed over the Trust in 2001, in which a performance was given by Morris dancers and local primary school pupils enacted a play of the story about the king and the witch.

The Trust charges a small entry fee to allow access to the King&#x27;s Men circle. It emphasises a preservation ethos, attempting to prevent any damage to the megaliths, and has reinforced the paths around the site, enabling wheelchair access to the Whispering Knights. The sites have experienced vandalism in this period; in the summer of 2001 a piece of the King Stone was chipped off, while in April 2004, yellow gloss paint was splashed onto the King&#x27;s Men. Some of these may be protests against the use of the site by modern Pagans. Under the Trust&#x27;s ownership, the site has been overseen by a paid manager and a number of voluntary wardens. The Trust erected a wardens&#x27; hut at the site, from which it sold both archaeological literature and publications by Pagan and earth mysteries groups. In January 2006, the hut was damaged beyond repair in an arson attack, with a group calling itself the Rollright Project holding benefit gigs to raise money for a replacement.

A registered charity, as of 2007 the Trust had on its board individuals from a range of backgrounds, including both Christians and Pagans, archaeologists, a biologist, and a landscape architect. The Trust has engaged with the Pagan community from the start, and allows Pagan groups to book slots in which they can perform ceremonies at the site.

===Popular culture===
The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Stones of Blood&quot; (1978) featured several scenes taped at the Rollright Stones. The site was presented as a fictional stone circle in Cornwall, at which modern Druids are worshipping an ancient goddess who turns out to be a malevolent alien.

The English rock band Traffic recorded a song named &quot;Roll Right Stones&quot; for their 1973 album &quot;Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory&quot;. English indie band Half Man Half Biscuit mention the stones in the song &quot;Twenty Four Hour Garage People&quot; on their 2000 album &quot;Trouble Over Bridgwater&quot;.

In 2003, to mark the centenary of the Art Fund, &quot;Turning the World Inside Out&quot;, a 1996 sculpture by Anish Kapoor, was relocated to the centre of the King&#x27;s Men for several months. The Trust also permits an annual performance of one of the plays of William Shakespeare at the site.

<text>Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (31 December 1776 – 10 November 1832) was a German physician who became one of the chief proponents of phrenology, which was developed c. 1800 by Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828).

==Biography==
Spurzheim was born near Trier, Germany, on 31 December 1776 and studied medicine at the University of Vienna. He became acquainted with Gall in 1800 and was soon hired by him as an assistant. Gall intended to have Spurzheim as his successor and added his name as a co-author to books and publications. In 1812, however, Gall and Spurzheim had a falling out, and Spurzheim started a separate career, lecturing and writing extensively on what he termed &#x27;The Physiognomical System of Drs Gall and Spurzheim&#x27;. He greatly popularised phrenology, and travelled extensively throughout Europe, achieving considerable success in England and France.

In 1816 he travelled to Edinburgh to refute an article by Dr John Gordon who had famously debunked Spurzheim, Gall and phrenology in general in an article in the Edinburgh Review in 1815.

He died of typhoid in Boston in 1832, cutting short his first and only American tour. After the public autopsy of Spurzheim, his brain, skull, and heart were removed, preserved in jars of alcohol as relics, and put on display to the public. Adoring Bostonians staged an elaborate public funeral and erected a monument in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Spurzheim made many alterations to Gall&#x27;s phrenological system, including an increase in the number of &quot;organs&quot;, as well as its organization into a hierarchical system. Spurzheim also used images and busts to illustrate the craniographic approach of phrenology.

<doc id="939759" wikidata="Q5257422" url="?curid=939759" title="Denis Napthine">
<text>Denis Vincent Napthine (born 6 March 1952) is an Australian former politician and veterinarian who served as the 47th premier of Victoria from 2013 to 2014. He held office as the leader of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia (LPA) and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Portland from 1988 to 2002, before transferring to that of South-West Coast from 2002 to 2015. 

He was elected leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party on 6 March 2013 following the resignation of Ted Baillieu and was sworn in as premier on the same day. His party lost the Victorian state election on 29 November 2014 and he announced he would step down as leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party, with Matthew Guy being elected his successor on 4 December.

== Early life ==
Napthine was born in 1952 to Len and Theresa Napthine in Geelong, Victoria, as the third child in a family of ten children.

Napthine spent his early school years at Winchelsea State School before attending Chanel College, a Catholic boys&#x27; school in Lovely Banks near Geelong. After graduating he attended the University of Melbourne, where he studied to be a veterinarian, undertaking a bachelor&#x27;s and then a master&#x27;s degree in veterinary science. He later completed a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from Deakin University.

== Political career ==

Napthine was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1988 as member for the country seat of Portland. He was re-elected in 1992, 1996 and 1999.

Napthine was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health in 1992 and then promoted to Minister for Youth and Community Services in 1996 in Jeff Kennett&#x27;s Liberal government, a position he held from 1996 to 1999.

Following the defeat of the Liberal Party at the 1999 election, Kennett resigned as Liberal leader and Napthine was elected to take his place. Napthine had briefly served as Deputy Liberal Leader, having been elected to the position just shortly before Kennett stood down as Liberal Leader. During his term as Opposition Leader the Liberal–National coalition split, fracturing the opposition parties.

Under Napthine&#x27;s leadership, the Liberal Party did poorly in the polls and made no significant electoral inroads on the ruling Labor government. Shortly before the 2002 state election, Shadow Health Minister Robert Doyle challenged Napthine for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Doyle won the leadership by a narrow margin. At this election, Napthine ran in South-West Coast, essentially a reconfigured version of Portland. Although it was ancestrally Liberal territory, Napthine only managed to hold onto the seat with a significantly reduced margin which fell from 4.9 to only 0.7 points. He was re-elected in November 2006 with an increased margin.

After the Liberals won the 2010 Victorian election, Napthine was made a member of the Baillieu cabinet. He served as the Minister for Ports, Racing, Regional Cities and Major Projects.

===Premier of Victoria===

On 6 March 2013, Baillieu resigned as state leader of the Liberal Party and hence as Premier of Victoria. At an emergency meeting of the Liberal partyroom, Napthine—who had turned 61 that day—was elected his successor. After the resignation of Geoff Shaw from the parliamentary Liberal Party earlier in the day, Napthine began leadership of a minority government, holding 43 seats (44 seats including that of the Speaker) to Labor&#x27;s 43 seats, with Shaw sitting as an independent politician on the crossbench.

On 28 November 2013 Australian media reported that Napthine had &#x27;secretly assisted&#x27; Shaw to draft a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to change state abortion legislation which Napthine voted against in 2008. Napthine refuted the allegations and stated his Government had no plans to change abortion laws, nor would he support any such change. In June 2014 Napthine stated:&quot;...that while I am Premier of this state, I will not allow Mr Shaw to introduce any legislation seeking to change the abortion laws in Victoria.&quot;

During September 2014 Napthine and Daniel Andrews told the Australian Christian Lobby that they would allow a conscience vote should a private members bill to repeal section eight of the Victorian abortion laws be introduced. Section eight if removed would mean doctors are not required by law to refer a woman who wants an abortion to an abortion doctor or perform the abortion even if they have a conscientious objection.

In May 2014 a parliamentary privileges committee found that Shaw was not diligent in the use of his parliamentary car and fuel card. On 3 June 2014 Shaw told radio station 774 ABC Melbourne that he would support a no confidence motion in the Napthine government. On 11 June 2014, following a Labor move to expel Shaw from Parliament that was defeated on party lines with the support of the speaker, Napthine&#x27;s government successfully moved a motion that resulted in the Members of the Legislative Assembly suspending Shaw for a period of eleven days, fined and ordered to apologise to the Parliament upon his return. Shaw&#x27;s suspension followed a period of political instability under Napthine&#x27;s leadership.

On 29 September 2014, Napthine along with former Minister for Public Transport and Roads Terry Mulder signed what was reported to be a $5.3 billion contract with the now defunct East West Connect consortium to build the controversial East West Link toll road. He has since received a lot of criticism for this, not only for his decision to sign on the eve of the month-long caretaker period before the upcoming November 2014 state election and before two legal cases into the planning approval for the project were resolved, but also for his decision, at the insistence of the East West Connect consortium, to direct the then state treasurer Michael O&#x27;Brien to sign a &quot;side letter&quot; guaranteeing the consortium compensation of more than $1 billion in the event that the court cases were successful or if for some other reason the contracts were cancelled (which Labor promised to do if it won the election), which was thought to be a contributing factor in the state having to pay what is thought to amount to $1.1 billion to EWC upon the declaration by the then new Andrews government to suspend work in December 2014, and the contracts eventually being terminated in June 2015. It was also revealed upon the contracts termination and release that the real cost of the Eastern section of East West Link amounted to $10.7 billion, $3.9 billion more than the $6.8 billion estimated cost by the Napthine government. In December 2015, the Victorian Auditor General revealed the cost of both sections of the East West Link would have been close to $22.8 billion in nominal terms.

===In opposition===
On 29 November 2014, after the Victorian state election, Napthine conceded defeat to Labor led by Daniel Andrews.

Napthine stated that he intended to serve a full parliamentary term despite losing the Premiership, however on 31 August 2015 he announced his resignation from the Victorian Parliament, which triggered a by-election in his electorate of South-West Coast.
Napthine gave money for John Pesutto&#x27;s legal case with Moira Deeming. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-21/moira-deeming-john-pesutto-defamation-battle-mp-gifts/103492714

== Personal life ==
Napthine and his wife Peggy have three children. His younger brother, Simon, was the unsuccessful ALP candidate for the federal seat of Flinders at the 2004 election.

Since childhood, Napthine supports the Geelong Football Club in the Australian Football League.

One of Napthine&#x27;s ancestors was convict Joseph Potaski.

<text>Jean Elizabeth Smart (born September 13, 1951) is an American actress. Her work includes both comedy and drama, and her accolades include six Primetime Emmy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and nominations for a Tony Award and a Grammy Award.

Smart first gained prominence for her leading role as Charlene Frazier Stillfield on the CBS sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot;, in which she starred from 1986 to 1991. She went on to win six Primetime Emmy Awards for her roles as Lana Gardner in the NBC series &quot;Frasier&quot; (2000–01), Regina Newley in the ABC sitcom &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; (2007–09), and Deborah Vance in the HBO Max comedy series &quot;Hacks&quot; (2021–present). She was Emmy-nominated for her roles in &quot;The District&quot; (2000–04), &quot;24&quot; (2006–07), &quot;Harry&#x27;s Law&quot; (2011), &quot;Fargo&quot; (2015), &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2019), and &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot; (2021). She also acted in FX&#x27;s &quot;Legion&quot; (2017–2019) and voiced Ann Possible in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002–2007).

On stage, she made her Broadway debut portraying Marlene Dietrich in the biographical play &quot;Piaf&quot; (1981). She returned to Broadway in the revival of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (2000), for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Smart&#x27;s film credits include &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; (1995), &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002), &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004), &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; (2009), &quot;The Accountant&quot; (2016), &quot;A Simple Favor&quot; (2018), and &quot;Babylon&quot; (2022). She received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for &quot;Guinevere&quot; (1999).

==Early life and education ==
Smart was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, the daughter of Kathleen Marie &quot;Kay&quot; (Sanders) and Douglas Alexander Smart, a teacher. She is the second of four children. Smart was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 13 years old. Her father was a first-generation Scottish-American. On Season 10 of the television show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Smart discovered she is a maternal descendant of Dorcas Hoar, one of the last women convicted of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials.

She is a 1969 graduate of Ballard High School in Seattle; it was there that she gained an interest in acting in the drama program. She graduated from the University of Washington Professional Actors Training Program with a BFA.

==Career==
===1975–1999: Theater roles and &quot;Designing Women&quot; ===

After graduating from college, Smart began her career appearing in regional theater throughout the Pacific Northwest, including in Washington, Alaska, and Oregon. She performed with the Seattle Repertory Theater as well as the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon. In the mid-1970s, she moved to New York City with college friend and fellow actress, Elizabeth Wingate (Lavery), and began working in Off-Broadway and professional regional productions. In 1980, she appeared as Lady Macbeth at the Pittsburgh Public Theater opposite Tom Atkins as Macbeth and Keith Fowler as Macduff. In 1981, Smart was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her performance in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Last Summer at Bluefish Cove&quot;. In February 1981, Smart appeared in the Broadway production of &quot;Piaf&quot; playing Marlene Dietrich, a role which she later reprised for the 1984 television version.

In addition to theater, Smart began working in television in several smaller to mid-size guest parts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, appearing on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, and &quot;Remington Steele&quot; among several others. According to Smart, after roles on the short-lived series &quot;Teachers Only&quot; and &quot;Reggie&quot; in 1983, &quot;casting directors just decided I was funny. When that happens, you usually get pigeonholed, but I was fortunate. I got to move back and forth.&quot; The following year, she had a supporting part in the thriller &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (1984).
In 1985, Smart was cast in the starring role of Charlene Frazier Stillfield on the comedy series &quot;Designing Women&quot;, a role she played from the show&#x27;s beginning in 1986 through its fifth season. After leaving &quot;Designing Women&quot;, her work mainly concentrated on made-for-television movies and supporting film roles. Notably, she portrayed serial killer Aileen Wuornos in the TV movie &quot;Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story&quot; (1992), followed by a supporting part in the black comedy &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992), opposite Robert De Niro and Eli Wallach. Critic Roger Ebert praised the film and called Smart&#x27;s character portrayal &quot;calculating&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the family drama &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; (1993), and as Ory Baxter in a television version of &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1994). She was then cast as Sally Brewton in the television miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1995), and appeared in a supporting role in &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; (1995). She also appeared in the television thriller film &quot;A Stranger In Town&quot; (1995) opposite Gregory Hines.

In 1995, Smart was cast as the lead in the comedy series &quot;High Society&quot;, which co-starred Mary McDonnell and ran for 13 episodes, followed by a role opposite Nancy McKeon in another short-lived CBS sitcom, &quot;Style &amp; Substance&quot;. Other roles included a part in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple II&quot; (1998) and as Deborah Sloane in the drama &quot;Guinevere&quot; (1999). She had a lead role in the comedy &quot;Forever Fabulous&quot; (1999) as an aging beauty queen.

===2000–2005: &quot;Frasier&quot; and return to Broadway ===
In 2000, Smart was cast as Lana Gardner in the critically acclaimed NBC comedy series &quot;Frasier&quot;, acting opposite Kelsey Grammer, set in her hometown of Seattle. She went on to win two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Reflecting on the role, Smart said: &quot;I had loved that role on &quot;Frasier&quot; so much, particularly that first episode. It&#x27;s nice to get nominated and win for something you were particularly proud of. At the time, I was a little bit snobby about doing guest parts. Based on what I don&#x27;t know. It wasn&#x27;t something I was seeking. But my agent said, &#x27;You have to read this.&#x27; I thought it was hilarious, and the show was brilliant, so I didn&#x27;t even hesitate. I remember when we did the table read with the rest of the cast, we could hardly get through it we were laughing so hard.&quot;

The same year, she was in the company of the second Broadway revival production of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, which earned her a Tony Award nomination. Soon after, she landed roles in several high-profile films including &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002), playing the mother-in-law of Reese Witherspoon, and in the comedy &quot;Bringing Down The House&quot; (2002), opposite Queen Latifah. She also had a supporting role in the independent drama &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004). Between 2000 and 2004, Smart played the role of Supervisor of Detectives and ex-wife to Chief Jack Mannion of the Metropolitan Police Department on &quot;The District&quot;. From 2002 to 2007, she voiced Dr. Ann Possible in &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, and also provided the voice of the alcoholic chain-smoking, Pickles Oblong, on &quot;The Oblongs&quot;. In 2004, she reprised her voice role as Reba Heyerdahl in an episode of the Nickelodeon series &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; The same year, she was cast in a lead role in the short-lived &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;. She also had a supporting role in David O. Russell&#x27;s &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004).

=== 2006–2019: Resurgence in television ===

In January 2006, Smart joined the cast of the Fox series &quot;24&quot;, playing the mentally unstable First Lady of the United States, Martha Logan, to actor Gregory Itzin&#x27;s President Charles Logan. She received back-to-back Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama for the role in 2006 and 2007. She also appeared in several films between 2006 and 2010, including the Curtis Hanson drama, &quot;Lucky You&quot; (2007), opposite Drew Barrymore; &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; (2009); and the independent comedy &quot;Barry Munday&quot; (2010). Smart won her third Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for portraying Samantha&#x27;s overbearing mother in the sitcom &quot;Samantha Who?&quot;, opposite Christina Applegate, which she played from 2007 to 2009. She later was cast as Hawaii Governor Pat Jameson during the first season of the CBS-TV remake of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In 2012, Smart was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her role in &quot;Harry&#x27;s Law&quot;. She then had a supporting role in the Lifetime film &quot;Call Me Crazy: A Five Film&quot; (2013).

In 2015, Smart starred in the second season of the FX television series &quot;Fargo&quot;, portraying Floyd Gerhardt. Floyd&#x27;s husband heads Fargo&#x27;s most prominent organized crime syndicate, and she is forced to take over after her husband suffers a debilitating stroke. She later finds herself having to lead the Gerhardt dynasty and deal with her sons, who are vying to replace their father. For her performance, Smart won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. She worked with Hawley again on &quot;Legion&quot;, in which she played Melanie Bird, a therapist who works with the protagonist David Haller. In 2016, Smart had a role in the thriller &quot;The Accountant&quot;, opposite Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, and John Lithgow. In 2018, Smart played a guardian angel, to co-star Candace Cameron, in the Hallmark Channel television film &quot;A Shoe Addict&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, which aired Sunday November 25, 2018.

In 2019, Smart portrayed Laurie Juspeczyk in the HBO superhero drama limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot; based on characters from the graphic novel of the same name. Smart plays as Laurie Blake formerly the second Silk Spectre, who has since become an FBI agent and member of the Anti-Vigilante Task Force. Smart starred alongside Regina King, Jeremy Irons, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Louis Gossett Jr. Smart&#x27;s performance was singled out by critics including Eric Deggans of NPR who described her performance as &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;the always-excellent Jean Smart [playing] a cynical, heroically-damaged middle-aged version of Laurie Juspecyk.&quot; The series received critical acclaim winning 11 Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Limited Series. Smart herself was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and received the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Hacks&quot; and continued acclaim ===
In 2021, Smart appeared in the seven-episode HBO crime drama limited series &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot; set in a small town in Pennsylvania. The series stars Kate Winslet as a grizzled detective with a supporting cast that includes Guy Pearce, Julianne Nicholson, and Evan Peters. Her role as Winslet&#x27;s mother has earned her critical acclaim with Jackson McHenry of &quot;Variety&quot; writing, &quot;It&#x27;s one of those essential truths of TV, as &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot; displayed recently, that if you need a tough-as-nails broad, you hire Jean Smart. Smart has the voice and the timing to play a stern matriarch, and whenever she&#x27;s onscreen in &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot;, she wrenches away the spotlight like she&#x27;s grabbing a juice box.&quot;

She also stars as the lead in the HBO Max dark comedy series &quot;Hacks&quot; (2021), playing a legendary Las Vegas comedy diva looking to appeal to a younger audience. &quot;USA Today&quot; declared Smart, at the age of 69, &quot;The Queen of HBO&quot;, after appearing in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot; and now &quot;Hacks&quot;. Glen Weldon of &quot;NPR&quot; praised Smart&#x27;s performance in his review, writing, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if the role of Deborah Vance was written for Smart, but she certainly makes it seem like it was...Smart&#x27;s also convincing as a standup, performing Deborah&#x27;s vaguely hokey routines with a naturalistic flair as if she was born to it.&quot; She won two consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (2021 and 2022). She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series again in 2024. 

In 2021, Smart co-starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;Senior Moment&quot; with William Shatner and Christopher Lloyd. In 2022, she played Peg, the grandmother of Kiernan Shipka&#x27;s character Bea Johnson, in &quot;Wildflower&quot;. In 2022, Smart appeared in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s 1920s period comedy-drama film &quot;Babylon&quot; as gossip columnist Elinor St. John. On September 28, 2024, she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s premiere episode of season 50. Zach Vasquez of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of her hosting duties, &quot;Smart is no slouch – a great dramatic and comedic actor of stage and screen, she nails her monologue, delivering jokes like the pro comic she plays on &quot;Hacks&quot;, before singing a rendition of Cole Porter’s &quot;I Happen to Like New York.&quot;

==Personal life==
Smart was married to actor Richard Gilliland for 35 years until his death in March 2021 after a brief illness. They met while working on the set of &quot;Designing Women&quot; (1986–93) where he played J.D. Shackelford, the boyfriend of Annie Potts&#x27;s character, Mary Jo Shively. Smart also worked with her husband in season 5 of &quot;24&quot;; he played Captain Stan Cotter in one episode, while she starred in the main cast role of First Lady Martha Logan.

They have two sons; they had their first child in 1989 and adopted their second in 2009.

<text>Umdat as-Salik wa &#x27;Uddat an-Nasik (&quot;Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper&quot;, also commonly known by its shorter title Reliance of the Traveller) is a classical manual of fiqh for the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence. The author of the main text is 14th-century scholar Shihabuddin Abu al-&#x27;Abbas Ahmad ibn an-Naqib al-Misri (AH 702-769 / AD 1302–1367). 
Al-Misri based his work on the previous Shafi&#x27;i works of Imam Nawawi and Imam Abu Ishaq as-Shirazi, following the order of Shirazi&#x27;s al-Muhadhdhab (&quot;The Rarefaction&quot;) and the conclusions of Nawawi&#x27;s Minhaj at-Talibin (&quot;The Seeker&#x27;s Road&quot;).

As recently as 1991, Reliance of the Traveller became the first standard Islamic legal reference to be translated into English (or any of the European languages), to be certified by Al-Azhar University in Egypt.

==Keller translation==

&quot;Umdat as-Salik&quot; was translated into English by the American Muslim scholar Nuh Ha Mim Keller in 1991 and became the first translation of a standard Islamic legal reference in a European language to be certified by Al-Azhar University. The translation comprises 26 sections titled according to the letters of the English alphabet, Book A, Book B, Book C, etc.

Books A through C contain introductory material forming a guide to fiqh compiled by Keller. Books D through O correspond to the original work of al-Misri, commencing with an &quot;Author&#x27;s Introduction&quot;. Following are translations of eight shorter works - Books P through V - which address topics such as personal ethics, character, and traditional Islamic Sufism, and include famous classical texts such as Al-Ghazzali&#x27;s &quot;Ihya’ ʿulum al-din&quot; and Nawawi&#x27;s &quot;Riyadh as-Saaliheen&quot;. Book W consists of extensive notes and appendices, Book X offers thumbnail biographies of hundreds of figures mentioned throughout the work, and Books Y and Z conclude it with a bibliography and indexes.

Certain sections of the book were left untranslated (although the original Arabic text is retained), as Keller considered them irrelevant to modern societies. These parts include a section on slavery, describing the rights and duties of slaves and their masters, as well as some smaller sections such as, for example, a discussion on fixing utensils using gold.

<doc id="939789" wikidata="Q2572443" url="?curid=939789" title="Deep Throat (The X-Files)">
<text>Deep Throat is a fictional character on the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. He serves as an informant, leaking information to FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder to aid Mulder&#x27;s investigation of paranormal cases, dubbed X-Files. Introduced in the series&#x27; second episode, also named &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, the character was killed off during the first season finale &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;; however, he later made several appearances in flashbacks and visions. In the season 11 episode &quot;This&quot;, his real name is ostensibly revealed to be Ronald Pakula.

The character of Deep Throat was portrayed by Jerry Hardin in all his appearances. After the character was killed, Steven Williams was introduced in the second season episode &quot;The Host&quot; to portray his successor, X. The creation of Deep Throat was inspired by the historical Deep Throat, Mark Felt, who leaked information on the Watergate scandal, and by Donald Sutherland&#x27;s character X in the film &quot;JFK&quot;.

==Conceptual history==
Series creator Chris Carter has stated that the character of Deep Throat was &quot;of course&quot; inspired by the historical Deep Throat. The real Deep Throat was an informant leaking information on the FBI&#x27;s investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. After the conclusion of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, this Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence on the fictional Deep Throat was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film &quot;JFK&quot;. In the film, Sutherland&#x27;s X reveals information about the possibility that the assassination of John F. Kennedy was orchestrated by elements within the American government. Carter felt he needed to create a character who would bridge the gap between FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and the shadowy conspirators who were working against them; he conceived of a character &quot;who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists&quot;.

Carter was drawn to actor Jerry Hardin after seeing him in 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Firm&quot;. Hardin believed his initial appearance would be a one-time role, although he soon found himself regularly commuting to the series&#x27; Vancouver filming location on short notice. Producer Howard Gordon has spoken of the elusiveness of the character&#x27;s allegiances, stating that during production, it was often left ambiguous whether he was &quot;ally or foe&quot;. After filming the character&#x27;s death in the first season finale, &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;, Hardin was toasted with champagne, and told by Carter that &quot;no one ever really dies on &quot;X-Files&quot;&quot;. As such, Hardin made several more appearances as Deep Throat after this—seen in visions in the third season&#x27;s &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; and the seventh season&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati&quot;, in flashbacks in the fourth season&#x27;s &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, and as one of the guises assumed by a shapeshifting alien in the third season&#x27;s finale, &quot;Talitha Cumi&quot;.

==Character arc==

During the first season of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Deep Throat provided Mulder and Scully with information they would have been otherwise unable to obtain. As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he was in a position to know a great deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, in &quot;E.B.E.&quot; Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.

During the Vietnam War, Deep Throat worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. When a UFO was shot down over Hanoi by US Marines, the surviving extraterrestrial was brought to Deep Throat, who executed it (depicted in flashback for the fourth season episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;). He later claimed that assisting Mulder was his way of atoning for his actions. He also stated that he was &quot;a participant in some of the most insidious lies and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine&quot;.

In the first season finale of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;, Mulder was taken hostage by a group of Men in Black operatives, following his investigation into an alien-human hybrid program. Fearing for Mulder&#x27;s life, Deep Throat helped Scully gain access to a high containment facility, where she managed to secretly remove a cryogenically-preserved alien fetus for use as collateral in saving Mulder. In the subsequent meeting between the operatives and Deep Throat, he was gunned down by an assassin, the Crew Cut Man. Deep Throat was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. The character later appeared in dreams and visions experienced by Mulder during his recuperation on a Navajo reservation, and again years later while being experimented on by The Smoking Man.

The character of Deep Throat has been well received by critics and fans. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Hardin&#x27;s performance as &quot;world-weary and heavyhearted&quot;, and listed his appearance in the character&#x27;s eponymous début episode as the 37th greatest television moment of the 1990s. However, they felt at times that his presence in episodes such as &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; seemed &quot;gratuitous&quot;. Reviewing the character&#x27;s début episode, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; called Deep Throat &quot;the most interesting new character on television&quot;. Chris Carter has stated that Hardin&#x27;s performance gave the series an element of &quot;believability&quot; that it needed; and felt that the episode &quot;E.B.E.&quot; was a great opportunity to expand the character&#x27;s role. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Zack Handlen called Deep Throat&#x27;s death &quot;a shocking moment, even when you know it&#x27;s coming&quot;, praising the &quot;desperation&quot; evident in Hardin&#x27;s performance, although lamenting the &quot;curse of continuity&quot; that led to the character being quickly replaced with Steven Williams&#x27; X. Ben Rawson-Jones, writing for Digital Spy, felt that Deep Throat&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The X-Files&quot; was &quot;arguably the show&#x27;s peak&quot;, and praised Hardin&#x27;s acting in the role. Brian Lowry, in his book &quot;The Truth Is Out There&quot;, has noted that the character &quot;helped establish a tone and undercurrent of gravity on &quot;The X-Files&quot; that was to provide the spine of the series&quot;. A.J. Black, writing on &quot;The Companion&quot;, about the influence of the Watergate scandal on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, observes: &quot;While Deep Throat’s involvement in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, ostensibly easy to consider as a narrative cheat for Mulder’s investigations, in truth serves to further enhance the series’ deeper connections to the conspiratorial history of the 1970s.&quot;

<doc id="939802" wikidata="Q273679" url="?curid=939802" title="Mary Peters (athlete)">
<text>Lady Mary Elizabeth Peters (born 6 July 1939) is a Northern Irish former athlete and athletics administrator. She is best known as the 1972 Olympic champion in the pentathlon, for which she won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Peters was named as Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter on 27 February 2019. She was installed in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, the chapel of the Order, on Garter Day, 17 June.

==Early life and education==
Peters was born in Halewood, Lancashire, later living at 5 Mere Avenue in Alkrington, where she went to primary school.

She moved to Ballymena (and later Belfast) at the age of eleven when her father&#x27;s job was relocated to Northern Ireland. As a teenager, her father encouraged her athletic career by building her home practice facilities as birthday gifts. She qualified as a teacher and worked while training.

==Athletics career==

After Ballymena, the family moved to Portadown where she attended Portadown College. The headmaster Donald Woodman and the PE teacher Kenneth McClelland introduced her to athletics, McClelland being her first coach. She was head girl of the school in 1956.

In the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Peters competing for Great Britain and Northern Ireland and won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s pentathlon. She had finished 4th in 1964 and 9th in 1968. To win the gold medal, she narrowly beat the local favourite, West Germany&#x27;s Heide Rosendahl, by 10 points, setting a world record score. After her victory, a death threat was phoned into the BBC by a man with an Irish accent: &quot;Mary Peters is a Protestant and has won a medal for Britain. An attempt will be made on her life and it will be blamed on the IRA ... Her home will be going up in the near future.&quot; But Peters insisted she would return home to Belfast. She was greeted by fans and a band at the airport and paraded through the city streets, but was not allowed back in her flat for three months. Turning down jobs in the US and Australia, where her father lived, she insisted on remaining in Northern Ireland.

In 1972, Peters won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award: &quot;Peters, a 33-year-old secretary from Belfast, won Britain&#x27;s only athletics gold at the Munich Olympics. The pentathlon competition was decided on the final event, the 200m, and Peters claimed the title by one-tenth of a second.&quot;

She represented Northern Ireland at every Commonwealth Games between 1958 and 1974. In these games she won two gold medals for the pentathlon, plus a gold and silver medal for the shot put.

==After athletics==
Peters became a Trustee of The Outward Bound Trust in May 2001 and is vice-president of the Northern Ireland Outward Bound Association. She is also Patron of Springhill Hospice in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. She now lives in Derriaghy, within the Lisburn and Castlereagh district, just outside Belfast.

==The Mary Peters Trust==
Peters established a charitable Sports Trust in 1975 (now known as the Mary Peters Trust) to support talented young sportsmen and -women, both able-bodied and disabled, from across Northern Ireland in a financial and advisory capacity. The trust has made a large number of awards, and has a list of well-known alumni that includes Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy, Jonathan Rea, Darren Clarke, David Humphreys, Bethany Firth, Ryan Burnett, Carl Frampton, Paddy Barnes, Michael Conlan, Kelly Gallagher, and Michael McKillop.

==Honours==
Peters was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to athletics in the 1973 New Year Honours. For services to sport, she was promoted in the same Order to Commander (CBE) in the 1990 Birthday Honours and again to Dame Commander (DBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours. In the 2015 New Year Honours, she was awarded as Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH), also for services to sport and the community in Northern Ireland, and in 2017, she was made a Dame of the Order of Saint John (DStJ). Peters was appointed a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG) on 27 February 2019, and therefore granted the title &quot;Lady&quot;. She represented the Order at the 2023 coronation.

Northern Ireland&#x27;s premier athletics track, on the outskirts of Belfast, is named after her. A statue of her stands within it.

In April 2009 she was named the Lord Lieutenant of the City of Belfast; she retired from the post in 2014, being succeeded by Fionnuala Jay-O&#x27;Boyle. Peters is a Freeman of the Cities of Lisburn and Belfast.

<doc id="939804" wikidata="Q140540" url="?curid=939804" title="Zahed Gilani">
<text>Taj Al-Din Ebrahim ibn Rushan Amir Al-Kurdi Al-Sanjani (or Sinjani; Persian:تاج الدين ابراهيم كردی سنجانی)‎ (1218 – 1301), titled Sheikh Zahed (or Zahid) Gilani (Persian: شیخ زاهد گیلانی), was an Iranian Grandmaster (murshid-i kamil) of the famed Zahediyeh Sufi order at Lahijan. He is also known as &quot;Sultân-ûl Khalwatiyya and Tadj’ad-Dīn Ebraheem Zāheed al-Geylānī&quot; as well.

According to Minorsky and Elwell-Sutton at the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, the tomb of Sheikh Zahed is situated a few miles to the south of the town of Lankaran. However, another tomb dedicated to him can be found in Lahijan.

==Life==

Zahed Gilani was probably a Talysh.

Since the mid-13th century, Sheikh Zahed has been revered as a spiritual authority and his tomb near Lahijan in Iran&#x27;s Gilan Province, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, draws numerous pilgrims to the village of &quot;Sheikhanvar&quot;. His ancestors came from the ancient Iranian city of Sanjan in Khorasan (located in present-day Turkmenistan). Fleeing the Seljuk invasion that would eventually conquer large parts of Iran, his ancestors settled in Gilan in the late 11th century. Taj Al-Din Zahed Gilani was able to attain cultural and religious influence on the Ilkhanid rulers (1256–1353), descendants of Genghis Khan, who followed Seljuq rule.

His most notable disciple was Safi-ad-Din Ardabili (1252–1334), the Eponym of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736). He wed Zahed&#x27;s daughter Bibi Fatima and, overgoing the interest of Zahed&#x27;s firstborn son, Gamal Al-Din Ali, was entrusted with the Grand Master&#x27;s Zahediyeh Sufi Order, which he transformed into his own, the Safaviyya (Sufi order) Order. Zahed Gilani&#x27;s second-born son, Sadr al-Dīn, wed Safi Al-Din&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage. 170 years after Safi Al-Din&#x27;s death (and 200 years after the death of Sheikh Zahed Gilani) Safaviyya had gained sufficient political and military power to claim the Throne of (Northern) Iran for the Safavid Heir, Shah Ismail I Safavi. The two families were to be intertwined for many centuries to come, by blood as well as mutual spiritual causes.

The Sil-silat-al-nasab-e Safaviyeh or &quot;Genealogy of the Safavids&quot;, was written by Pir Hossein Abdul Zahedi, a 17th-century descendant of Zahed Gilani. This hagiography in praise of the Safavid forebears, was devoted to the genealogy of the Safavid Sufi masters.

The Turkish Bayrami and Jelveti orders also had their origin in Zahed Gilani&#x27;s Zahediyeh Sufi Order.

<text>Antoine César Becquerel (; 7 March 178818 January 1878) was a French scientist and a pioneer in the study of electric and luminescent phenomena.

==Life==

He was born at Châtillon-sur-Loing (today Châtillon-Coligny). After passing through the École polytechnique he became engineer-officer in 1808, and saw active service with the imperial troops in Spain from 1810 to 1812, and again in France in 1814. He then resigned from the army and devoted the rest of his life to scientific investigation.

In 1820, following the work of René Just Haüy, he found that pressure can induce electricity in every material, attributing the effect to surface interactions (this is not piezoelectricity). In 1825 he invented a differential galvanometer for the accurate measurement of electrical resistance. In 1829 he invented a constant-current electrochemical cell, the forerunner of the Daniell cell. In 1839, working with his son A. E. Becquerel, he discovered the photovoltaic effect on an electrode immersed in a conductive liquid.

His earliest work was mineralogical in character, but he soon turned his attention to the study of electricity and especially of electrochemistry. In 1837 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and received its Copley Medal for his various memoirs on electricity, and particularly for those on the production of metallic sulphurets and sulphur by electrolysis. He was the first to prepare metallic elements from their ores by this method. It was hoped that this would lead to increased knowledge of the recomposition of crystallized bodies, and the processes which may have been employed by nature in the production of such bodies in the mineral kingdom.

In biochemistry he worked at the problems of animal heat and at the phenomena accompanying the growth of plants, and he also devoted much time to meteorological questions and observations. He was a prolific writer. He died in Paris, where from 1837 he had been professor of physics at the Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle.

He became a correspondent of the Royal Institute in 1836; when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he became a foreign member.

He was the father of the physicist A. E. Becquerel and grandfather of the physicist Henri Becquerel after whom the SI unit for radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named.

His surname is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="939814" wikidata="Q1423167" url="?curid=939814" title="Phlebitis">
<text>Phlebitis (or venitis) is inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called thrombophlebitis or superficial thrombophlebitis. Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Localized redness and swelling
* Pain or burning along the length of the vein
* Vein being hard and cord-like

There is usually a slow onset of a tender red area along the superficial veins on the skin. A long, thin red area may be seen as the inflammation follows a superficial vein. This area may feel hard, warm, and tender. The skin around the vein may be itchy and swollen. The area may begin to throb or burn. Symptoms may be worse when the leg is lowered, especially when first getting out of bed in the morning. A low-grade fever may occur. Sometimes phlebitis may occur where a peripheral intravenous line was started. The surrounding area may be sore and tender along the vein.

==Cause==
Phlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter. However, it can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine.

Superficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger&#x27;s disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking.

==Management==
Treatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress). If the phlebitis is associated with local bacterial infection, antibiotics may be used.

For acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis, not enough evidence exists as of 2015 to determine treatment.

<text>John Aidan Liddell, (3 August 1888 – 31 August 1915) was a British military pilot and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
Liddell was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 August 1888. He was educated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took the Honours Course in Zoology.

== Military career ==
Liddell, not wishing himself &quot;to be a slacker&quot;, joined the Officers&#x27; Special Reserve of the 3rd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s) of the British Army in 1912. He obtained his pilot&#x27;s certificate in May 1914 and, following the outbreak of the First World War, the now-Captain Liddell embarked with his battalion on 28 August for service in France. He spent 43 consecutive days in the trenches in command of the machine gun section and was awarded the Military Cross at Le Maisnil, France, before training as a pilot and joining No. 7 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps.

On 31 July 1915, while flying reconnaissance over Ostend-Bruges-Ghent, Belgium, Liddell&#x27;s aircraft was raked by machine gun fire and Liddell was severely wounded in his right thigh. This caused momentary unconsciousness, but by great effort he recovered partial control of his machine when it had dropped nearly 3,000 feet and succeeded, although fired on, in completing the course and brought the plane back into the Allied lines. The control wheel and throttle control were smashed, as was part of the undercarriage and cockpit, but the machine and life of the observer were saved. In recognition of his feat, Liddell was awarded the Victoria Cross.

== Death and legacy ==

After having his leg removed and septic poisoning setting in, Liddell died of his wounds a month later at De Panne, Flanders, Belgium, on 31 August 1915, aged 27. He is buried in the Holy Ghost Cemetery in Basingstoke with his sister Dorothy Liddell who went out to serve in the hospital where he died for the remainder of the war.

A brass &quot;In Memoriam&quot; tablet was erected to Aidan Liddell in the Scottish Naval and Military Residence, Edinburgh. The inscription on the brass tablet runs as follows:

A memorial to him was also erected at Balliol College, on the west wall of the Chapel passage. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

A plaque also exists in the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling, close to Stirling Castle, home of his regiment.

On 29 August 2017 a memorial was unveiled outside the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, where Liddell and Privates Edward Lawson and Adam Wakenshaw are commemorated.

<text>The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, also known by its acronym CHOP, is a children&#x27;s hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its primary campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. The hospital has 594 beds and more than one million outpatient and inpatient visits annually. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest and oldest children&#x27;s hospitals and the first hospital in the United States dedicated to the healthcare of children.

CHOP has been ranked as the best children&#x27;s hospital in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and &quot;Parents Magazine&quot; since 2020. it was ranked number one in the nation by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for three out of ten specialties. The hospital treats infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21.

The hospital also treats adults who would benefit from advanced pediatric care. The hospital is located next to the University of Pennsylvania, and most of its physicians serve in the pediatrics and other speciality departments of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

==History==
=== First hospital 1855–1966 ===
In 1855, Philadelphia had a population of about 460,000, and recorded 10,507 deaths. Leading causes of death were smallpox, typhoid, and scarlet fever. In the worst month of 1855, 300 children under 12 years old died, primarily of infectious diseases. A Philadelphia physician, Dr. Francis West Lewis, inspired by a visit to the new Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London (founded 1852), enlisted Drs. T. Hewson Bache and R. A. F. Penrose Sr. to found the first children&#x27;s hospital in North America.

On November 23, 1855, the following small advertisement appeared in the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot;:

The Children&#x27;s Hospital—located on Blight Street, running from Pine to Lombard, below Broad, is now open for the reception of Patients. Children suffering from Acute Diseases and Accidents will be received free of charge. A dispensary, for sick children, is also attached to the Hospital and will be open at the same place every day, (Sundays excepted from 11 to 12 o&#x27;clock, when advice and medicine will be given free of charge.)

The first location of the original Children&#x27;s Hospital was a small building on Blight Street (now Watts St). The hospital consisted of 12 beds and a dispensary. That year they recorded 67 inpatient admissions and 306 outpatient visits.

===Second hospital 1866–1916===
Children&#x27;s Hospital was relocated to 22nd Street between Locust and Walnut Sts after the American Civil War. This hospital consisted of 35 beds and a dispensary. The second hospital was the site of the first surgery at CHOP, which was first performed in 1870. In addition, the first resident physician at CHOP was appointed in 1873, and formal medical teaching in medical and surgical clinics began in 1877.

Early on in CHOP&#x27;s history, a long-term care (&quot;convalescent&quot;) facility was opened as a county branch near Overbrook. In 1899, the County Branch convalescent facility was closed, and the program and patients were transferred to the Seashore House near Atlantic City, New Jersey. CHOP later underwent an expansion, and capacity was increased to 94 beds by 1892.
* A nursing school, the Ingersoll Training School, was opened in 1894.
* In 1900, the Catherwood Milk Laboratory was established.
* In 1914, the first department for the Prevention of Disease in the nation was established.

===Third hospital 1916–1974===
Construction adjacent to the second hospital began in 1913, and the first unit was opened in 1916, extending toward 18th and Bainbridge Streets.

In 1919, the hospital became affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The affiliation became steadily closer over the next 17 years, with the Children&#x27;s Hospital becoming identical to the pediatric department of the school of medicine, with most of the attending physicians appointed jointly to both institutions.
* In 1925, the hospital became affiliated with the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
* The whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine was first developed.
* The first formal allocation of funds to research was recorded in 1937.
* The first closed incubator for newborns was used.
* The nursing school was disbanded in 1945 and converted into an affiliate training center.
* A six-story research building next to the hospital was dedicated in 1954.
* In 1962, under Dr. C. Everett Koop (later to be Surgeon General), the first neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the nation was opened, along with a new neonatal surgical unit.
* In 1965, the first home care program for children was established.
* A Clinical Research Center under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health was opened in 1965.
In 1967, after years of lobbying hospital physicians and anesthesiologists, Dr. John Downes finally opened up a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at CHOP, the first of its kind in the United States. Downes was inspired by pediatric and adult intensive care units in Europe and wanted to open a state-of-the-art unit in Philadelphia to care for the sickest of children. Before the creation of a PICU at CHOP, children who required advanced care were often cared for on the surgery wards and recovery rooms. Most of these children were cared for by anesthesiologists in the recovery room.

===Fourth hospital, since 1974===
Construction of the new hospital at a new site on the west side of the Schuylkill River at 34th Street and Civic Center Boulevard, adjacent to the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, began in 1969, and the first building was opened in 1974. This present Children&#x27;s Hospital complex occupies part of the site of the old Philadelphia General Hospital and Blockley Almshouse.

A helicopter transport system for critically ill and injured children was inaugurated in 1973.

Milestones and advances in pediatric care pioneered at CHOP include the first formal medical training in pediatrics, techniques for the correction of congenital heart malformations, incubators for newborn intensive care, home ventilator care, and vaccine development.

In October 2006, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia&#x27;s trauma center was one of the receiving hospitals&#x27; for victims of the West Nickel Mines School shooting, treating a few of the pediatric victims from the shooting who were medevaced to the hospital.
The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia is in Philadelphia&#x27;s University City neighborhood, and since 2001 has been undergoing a $1.5 billion expansion that has doubled the hospital&#x27;s size, while also building more than of new research and outpatient facilities on a large, site south of the main hospital on Civic Center Boulevard. The South Campus expansion includes the eleven-story Colket Translational Research Building, which provides lab space for the Center for Childhood Cancer Research and the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics. The new South Campus also includes an underground parking garage and an ambulatory care building with outpatient services.

This South Campus expansion adjoins the University of Pennsylvania Health System&#x27;s construction of the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine and Roberts Proton Therapy Center.

On July 1, 2015, Madeline Bell, previously CHOP&#x27;s president and chief operating officer, became president and chief executive officer. She succeeded Steven M. Altschuler, MD, who retired after 15 years as CEO. The board of trustees of Children&#x27;s Hospital made the announcement on May 14. Later that year, in October 2015, the expansion of the Brandywine Valley Specialty Care and Ambulatory Surgery Center was opened. This is a expansion.

In May 2020 amidst the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic CHOP started offering virtual pediatric urgent care visits to all children aged 0–21 throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware regardless of if the child was a patient at the hospital or not.

== Facilities ==
CHOP has 594 beds, almost 40 percent of which are allocated to neonatal, cardiac, and pediatric intensive care. Each year the hospital admits more than 28,000 children and more than 1.167 million are seen in the emergency and outpatient departments.

===Expansion plans===

The hospital has developed an expansion plan that includes four buildings along Schuylkill Avenue, on the east side of the Schuylkill River. The first building, a tower called the Roberts Center for Pediatric Research, or the CHOP Research Tower, was built between 2015 and 2017 on the 700 block of Schuylkill Avenue, with an address of 2716 South Street.

===Children&#x27;s Seashore House===

Children&#x27;s Seashore House was founded in 1872 near Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a place for children to receive rehabilitation treatment. The hospital moved to its current location next to CHOP in 1990, and was acquired by CHOP in 1998, whereas of which the hospital has 45 beds. It currently provides inpatient and outpatient care for children with developmental disabilities and chronic illnesses.

=== Buerger Center for Advanced Pediatric Care ===
In 2015, the Buerger Center for Advanced Pediatric Care opened and moved most outpatient services into the building. The addition is a 12-story, building with a five-story, 1500-space underground parking garage directly attached. Composed of stacked forms and a selection of primary colors, the twelve-story building and six-story wing offer an interactive setting for treatment.

=== Middleman Family Pavilion ===

In June 2018, CHOP announced their plans to build a second children&#x27;s hospital campus in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; the hospital, with an expected cost $298 million and consisting of seven floors and , would have a capacity of 52 beds, with a potential expansion to 108 beds. In September 2019, Swedish construction firm Skanska broke ground on the new building. The new hospital is built adjacent to CHOP&#x27;s specialty care and outpatient surgery center. In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, CHOP officials released that they were considering adding beds to the shell space to total 108 beds. The hospital opened on January 26, 2022.

On November 8, 2021, it was announced that CHOP had received a large donation from local businessman Stanley Middleman, provoking CHOP to name the new King of Prussia campus &quot;The Middleman Family Pavilion.&quot;

The hospital has 52 total beds with shell space reserved for future expansion.
* 16 pediatric intensive care unit beds
* 36 medical surgical unit beds
* pediatric emergency department

Pediatric care to the Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center (PMC) is provided by doctors from the &quot;Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia&quot; on PMC&#x27;s inpatient pediatric wards, pediatric emergency department, and pediatric specialty care center. Adjacent to the medical center is the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia Specialty Center that treats infants, children, adolescents, and young adults up to the age of 21.

=== Saint Peter&#x27;s University Hospital ===
In addition to all of their outpatient centers, hospitals and primary care offices, CHOP also maintains an affiliation with the New Jersey–based Saint Peter&#x27;s University Hospital. All pediatric cardiac care at The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Saint Peters is conducted from physicians affiliated with CHOP and complex cases are usually transferred to the hospital.

The Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House was the first of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and now stands at 39th and Chestnut Streets in West Philadelphia. The House opened with the help of Philadelphia Eagles manager Jimmy Murray and The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia&#x27;s Pediatric Oncologists Dr. Audrey Evans and Dr. Milton &#x27;Mickey&#x27; Donaldson. In the early 1970s, Evans and Donaldson saw families spending night after night in the hospital while their children received medical care. She knew there had to be a better way and envisioned a house where families could stay. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles were fundraising in support of player Fred Hill&#x27;s daughter, Kim, who was battling leukemia. In 2006, the first Ronald McDonald Family Room was opened at The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia in the Oncology Unit.

<doc id="939821" wikidata="Q753762" url="?curid=939821" title="The X-Files season 1">
<text>The first season of the science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on September 10, 1993, and concluded on the same channel on May 13, 1994, after airing all 24 episodes.

The first season introduced main characters of the series, including Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, respectively, and recurring characters Deep Throat, Walter Skinner, and Cigarette Smoking Man. The season introduced the series&#x27; main concept, revolving around the investigation of paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X-Files, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; it also began to lay the groundwork for the series&#x27; overarching mythology.

Initially influenced by &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, series creator Chris Carter pitched the idea for the series to Fox twice before it was accepted for production. The season saw the series quickly gaining popularity, with ratings rising steadily throughout its run; and garnered generally positive reviews from critics and the media. It helped to make stars of its two lead roles, and several of its taglines and catchphrases have since become cultural staples.

== Concept and themes ==

Although Carter initially conceived of the series based on the influence of &quot;Kolchak&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he has stated that the &quot;leaping-off point&quot; for the series&#x27; overall concept came from UFO lore. After being introduced to the works of John E. Mack—especially a study by Mack which had reported that three percent of Americans claimed to have been abducted by aliens—Carter believed he had found his central theme. It was decided that the series would focus on the FBI in order to avoid something Carter had seen as a failing in &quot;Kolchak&quot;, whereby mysterious events would continually occur in one locale and be accidentally uncovered by the same character—by creating a fictional FBI unit which actively uncovered these paranormal cases, it was felt that the series would be &quot;sustainable week after week without stretching the parameters of credibility&quot;. Early in the planning stages, Carter had envisioned that a significant proportion of the episodes would deal with investigations which uncovered hoaxes or cases which had been mistakenly viewed as paranormal. Although this decision never came to pass, the third-season episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; can be seen as a holdover from the idea.

The series revolves around its two main characters, which had been defined early in conception as the &quot;believer&quot; and the &quot;skeptic&quot;. Of these, the &quot;believer&quot;, Fox Mulder, was created with a character-defining personal motivation, involving the disappearance of his younger sister during his childhood, which he would believe to be a result of alien abduction. The creation of the &quot;skeptic&quot;, Dana Scully, was influenced by Jodie Foster&#x27;s portrayal of Clarice Starling in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, leading the crew to decide that the character needed to seem &quot;real&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;bombshell&quot; type of character the studio was pressing for.

Thematically, although the series focused heavily on alien abduction lore, the decision was made early on to allow the plots of individual episodes to branch out into different territories in order to prevent the overarching plot from running out of momentum, which led to standalone episodes such as &quot;Squeeze&quot; being developed. The variety of storylines which the series has shown has led director Daniel Sackheim to note that &quot;&quot;The X-Files&quot; has sort of found its own style in that it doesn&#x27;t have a confined style to it&quot;, adding that the series&#x27; &quot;fluid&quot; approach has meant that &quot;everybody who comes on the show attempt to make a little scary movie&quot;. To this end, several episodes feature varying plots, with alien-influenced storylines varying between &quot;Ice&quot;, a &quot;briskly-paced&quot; episode set in a single location, and the character-driven &quot;Conduit&quot;, which served to fill in background on the characters. Elsewhere, plots focused on soul transference or reincarnation, with the episodes &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Born Again&quot; and &quot;Lazarus&quot; sharing similar storylines. The plot of &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; featured a malevolent artificial intelligence; while &quot;Shapes&quot; introduced the first of what would become several Native American-themed episodes.

The first season also introduced a number of minor characters who would go on to become central figures to the series—The Lone Gunmen, first seen in &quot;E.B.E.&quot;, would become regular characters beginning the second season, eventually starring in the spin-off series &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;; whilst the episode &quot;Tooms&quot; introduced Walter Skinner, portrayed by Mitch Pileggi, who would go on to be billed as a series star by the ninth season. The abduction of Mulder&#x27;s sister Samantha was explored in the episodes &quot;Pilot&quot;, &quot;Conduit&quot;, and &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, and would go on to become one of the central themes of the series as a whole.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
California native Chris Carter was given the opportunity to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, inspired by a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, and recalling memories of Watergate and the 1970s horror series &quot;&quot;, Carter came up with the idea for &quot;The X-Files&quot; and wrote the pilot episode in 1992. He initially struggled over the untested concept—executives wanted a love interest for Scully—and casting. The network wanted either a more established or a &quot;taller, leggier, blonder and breastier&quot; actress for Scully than the 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience, who Carter felt was the only choice after auditions.

Carter&#x27;s initial pitch for &quot;The X-Files&quot; was rejected by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, and the English television series &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;. Inspiration was also taken from Carter&#x27;s memories of watching &quot;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in his youth; as well as from the then-recently released film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in &quot;Kolchak&quot;. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

During the early stages of production for the series, Carter founded Ten Thirteen Productions, and began to plan for filming the pilot in Los Angeles. However, unable to find suitable locations for many of the scenes, Ten Thirteen Productions made the decision to &quot;go where the good forests are&quot;, and moved production to Vancouver, where the series would remain for the next five seasons; production would eventually shift to Los Angeles beginning with the sixth season. It was soon realized by the production crew that since so much of the first season would require filming on location, rather than on sound stages, two location managers would be needed, rather than the usual one.

=== Casting ===
David Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles three years prior to &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and at first had wanted to base his acting career around films. But in 1993 his manager, Melanie Green, gave him a script for the pilot episode of series. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so Duchovny auditioned for the lead. When Duchovny was auditioning for the part of Fox Mulder, he made a &quot;terrific&quot; audition, but spoke rather slowly. Chris Carter thought at the beginning of the auditioning for the character, he was a &quot;good judge of character&quot;, and thought that Duchovny wasn&#x27;t rather &quot;bright&quot;. So he went and talked to Duchovny and asked him if he could &quot;please&quot; imagine himself as an FBI agent for the &quot;future&quot; week. The casting director of the show was very positive towards him. According to Carter, Duchovny turned out to be one of the best-read people he knew. Carter recalls being contractually obliged to provide Fox with a choice of two actors for the role; however, he was confident Duchovny was the right choice from the outset. After getting the role, Duchovny thought the show wouldn&#x27;t last for long or that it wouldn&#x27;t make much impact.

Gillian Anderson was cast due to insistence from Carter that she would fit the role perfectly; however, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous &quot;bombshell&quot; for the part, hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element. This led Carter to insist that he did not want the roles of Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved, citing the relationship between the lead roles in &quot;Moonlighting&quot; as an example to avoid. Anderson called her early work on the show &quot;a complete learning experience for me – the pilot was only the second time I&#x27;d been in front of a camera&quot;.

The series also introduced the character of Walter Skinner, played by Mitch Pileggi, who would go on to become a recurring, and later, main character in the show. The character had been conceived as playing against the stereotypical bureaucratic &quot;paper-pusher&quot;, being instead someone more &quot;quietly dynamic&quot;. Pileggi had auditioned unsuccessfully for several other parts on the series before being cast as Skinner. At first, the fact that he was asked back to audition for the role had puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not cast for the previous parts—Chris Carter had been unable to imagine Pileggi as any of those characters, due to the fact that the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi attended the audition for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back. Pileggi&#x27;s attitude fit well with the character of Skinner, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. After successfully auditioning for the role, Pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role of Walter Skinner.

Glen Morgan and James Wong&#x27;s early influence on &quot;The X-Files&quot; mythology led to their introduction of popular secondary characters who would continue for years in episodes written by others, such as the Scully family—Dana&#x27;s father William (Don S. Davis), mother Margaret (Sheila Larken) and sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw)—as well as conspiracy-buff trio The Lone Gunmen.

=== Writing ===
Initially, there was no certainty as to how long the series would go on, and as a result there was no long-term plan in the beginning to guide its writers. Although the initial impetus for the show was based on alien abduction lore, the crew believed that the series would not be able to maintain its momentum for long if it did not branch out into different plot ideas. The show&#x27;s first season thus featured numerous standalone stories involving monsters, and also diverse alien or governmental cover-ups, often with no apparent connection to each other—such as the Arctic space worms in &quot;Ice&quot;, and the conspiracy of genetically engineered twins in &quot;Eve&quot;. Carter himself wrote &quot;Space&quot;, an intended bottle episode about the manifestation of an alien &quot;ghost&quot; in the NASA space shuttle program, which was subject to cost overruns and became the most expensive of the first season.

By the end of the first season, Carter and his staff had come up with many of the general concepts of the mythology that would last throughout all nine seasons. The first season introduced the series&#x27; primary antagonist, Cigarette Smoking Man, and gave early insight into the disappearance of Mulder&#x27;s sister Samantha, whose abduction provided one of the main plot threads of the series as a whole. The emergent mythology was further solidified in the Carter-penned, Edgar Award-nominated season finale &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;. The episode was written in early 1994 before it was known whether or not the series would be renewed for a second season, and featured the closure of the X-Files unit and the reassignment of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to new jobs within the FBI. The finale was the first episode directed by R. W. Goodwin, who had served as producer for the series.

=== Crew ===
Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote nine episodes. Co-executive producers and writing team Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote six episodes. Supervising producers and writing team Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon wrote five episodes together, with Gordon co-writing an additional script with Carter. Co-producers and writing team Larry and Paul Barber wrote one episode. Executive script consultant Chris Ruppenthal wrote one episode. Kenneth Biller and Chris Brancato co-wrote a freelance script. Other freelance writers included Scott Kaufer and Marilyn Osborn, who each wrote one episode. Other producers included line producer Joseph Patrick Finn and co-producer Paul Rabwin.

David Nutter directed the most episodes of the first season, directing six. &quot;Pilot&quot; supervising producer Daniel Sackheim directed two episodes. Other directors that directed two episodes included Jerrold Freedman, William Graham, Michael Lange, Joe Napolitano and Larry Shaw. One-episode directors included Rob Bowman, Fred Gerber, co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin, Michael Katleman, Harry Longstreet and Robert Mandel who directed the pilot episode.

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===
From the outset, viewing figures for the series were good, with the initial broadcast of &quot;Pilot&quot; being watched by 7.4 million households, which constituted 15 percent of the viewing audience at the time. The series was broadcast directly after episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, and saw a decline in viewing figures when that series began to falter. The season—and series as a whole—reached a low with &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, which was viewed by only 5.1 million households. However, after the episode aired, the numbers began to rise steadily once again, reaching a peak for the season with &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;, which was viewed by 8.3 million households, 16 percent of the available audience. At the conclusion of the 1993–94 television season, &quot;The X-Files&quot; ranked 105th out of 128 shows. The ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to be classified as a &quot;cult hit&quot;, particularly by Fox standards, and was subsequently renewed for a second season.

=== Reviews ===
Reviews for the first season were mostly positive, with the series being described as &quot;the most paranoid, subversive show on TV&quot;, and the writing being called &quot;fresh without being self-conscious, and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV&quot;. The season as a whole currently holds an 83% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 35 reviews, with a critical consensus stating, &quot;A serious approach to its premise helps establish &quot;The X-Files&quot; as a sci-fi procedural with a genuinely creepy twist – and a thrilling drama that avoids devolving into pure camp.&quot; On Metacritic, the season scored 70 out of 100, based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;. Writing for IGN, Mike Miksch noted that &quot;some of the episodes were at a level of excellence that still hasn&#x27;t been matched since&quot;; adding that the series has &quot;become nearly as integral to pop culture today as any show in history&quot;. Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits gave the season an &quot;A&quot;, stating &quot;The X-Files is a show that dared to be different, and different it was&quot;. Hunt described the show&#x27;s cinematography as &quot;striking and noir-ish&quot;. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, called the season &quot;phenomenal&quot; and added that it contains &quot;many terrific episodes&quot;.

Several episodes were widely praised, including &quot;Squeeze&quot;, which has been called &quot;profoundly creepy&quot;; the &quot;taut and briskly paced&quot; Arctic-set &quot;Ice&quot;; and the &quot;remarkably chilling&quot; Scully-centered episode &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. However, not all episodes of the season were as well received. Despite the costly production of &quot;Space&quot;, the episode was derided as &quot;decidedly unscary&quot; and &quot;a little tasteless&quot; in its treatment of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. &quot;The Jersey Devil&quot; was described as &quot;pretty silly&quot;, whilst the plots for &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Born Again&quot;, and &quot;Roland&quot; were panned for being much too similar to each other.

=== Accolades ===
The first season received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with one win. Composer Mark Snow was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Main Title Theme Music, while title designers Bruce Bryant, James Castle and Carol Johnsen won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences.

<text>Sarah Frances Whiting (August 23, 1847 – September 12, 1927) was an American physicist and astronomer. She was the first professor of physics and astronomy at Wellesley College, where she taught for over 30 years. At Wellesley College, Whiting instructed several notable astronomers and physicists, including Annie Jump Cannon. Whiting was one of the founders and the first director of the Whitin Observatory. 

==Biography==
Whiting was interested from an early age in science by her father, who taught natural philosophy. Whiting graduated from Ingham University in 1865, after which she taught at a girls&#x27; secondary school in Brooklyn.

Whiting was appointed by Wellesley College president Henry Fowle Durant, one year after the College&#x27;s 1875 opening, as its first professor of physics. She established its physics department and the undergraduate experimental physics lab at Wellesley, the second of its kind to be started in the country. 
At the request of Durant, she attended lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology given by Edward Charles Pickering. Through attending Pickering&#x27;s classes, Whiting observed the techniques of teaching science through laboratory work, which was then new to the United States. Whiting adopted this pedagogy for her own classes, and so established the second undergraduate physics laboratory in the United States, after MIT.

Pickering also invited Whiting to observe some of the new techniques being applied to astronomy, such as spectroscopy. In 1880, Whiting started teaching a course of practical astronomy at Wellesley.

In February 1896, only a few weeks after the public announcement of the discovery of x-rays, Whiting conducted x-ray experiments with her students and other physics professors. She was among the first in the United States and likely the first woman to successfully replicate Wilhelm Röntgen&#x27;s x-rays. As told by biographer and former student Annie Jump Cannon, 

An especially exciting moment came when the Boston morning papers reported the discovery of the Rontgen or X-rays in 1895. The advanced students in physics of those days will always remember the zeal with which Miss Whiting immediately set up an old Crookes tube and the delight when she actually obtained some of the first photographs taken in this country of coins within a purse and bones within the flesh.In addition to Cannon, Whiting was also assisted or attended in the X-ray experiments by Mabel Augusta Chase and Grace Evangeline Davis. In these experiments, they played with the variables in the established set up to improve image quality and learn how x-rays could penetrate different materials. 
Between 1896 and 1900, Whiting helped Wellesley College trustee Sarah Elizabeth Whitin to establish the Whitin Observatory, of which Whiting became the first director.

During her time at Wellesley, Whiting kept up to date on scientific developments and shared the knowledge with her students. She met with Thomas Edison and learned of his incandescent bulbs. She then gave a demonstration at Wellesley of these bulbs to the board of trustees in the hopes of getting them to invest in the new technology. Additionally, she traveled and attended classes at universities all over the world and connected with scientists. 

Tufts College bestowed an honorary doctorate on Whiting in 1905.

Sarah Whiting was also known for supporting prohibition.

Whiting retired from her position as a professor of physics at Wellesley in 1912, but remained as Director of the Whitin Observatory until 1916. She held the title of Professor Emeritus until her death in 1927 in Wilbraham, Massachusetts. She is buried in Machpelah Cemetery in Le Roy, New York, near her now-defunct alma mater, Ingham University.

==Writings==

Whiting wrote the textbook &quot;Daytime and Evening Exercises in Astronomy, for Schools and Colleges&quot;.

She was an author of several articles in &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot;, including: 
*&quot;Use of Graphs in Teaching Astronomy&quot;,
*&quot;Use of Drawings in Orthographic Projection and of Globes in Teaching Astronomy&quot;,
*&quot;Spectroscopic Work for Classes in Astronomy&quot;,

<doc id="939852" wikidata="Q2267919" url="?curid=939852" title="Infantry tank">
<text>The infantry tank was a tank concept developed by the United Kingdom and France in the years leading up to World War II. Infantry tanks were designed to support infantrymen in an attack. To achieve this, the vehicles were generally heavily armoured to allow them to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armour came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow-moving foot soldiers.

Once an attack supported by infantry tanks had broken through heavily defended areas in the enemy lines, faster tanks such as cruiser or light tanks were expected to use their higher speed and longer range to operate far behind the front and cut lines of supply and communications.

The infantry tank was superseded by the &quot;Universal Tank&quot; concept which could adequately perform the roles of both infantry and cruiser tank, as represented by the Centurion which replaced both the Churchill and any medium or cruiser tanks then in service. This led to the main battle tank.

== Background ==
The experimental armoured formations of the British army were mostly equipped with the Vickers Medium Tank Mk I and Medium Mk II, which were judged obsolete by the 1930s; most of the vehicles were at the end of their mechanical life. It was impractical to build more because their road speed of only was too slow for manoeuvre warfare and their armament of a 3-pounder gun lacked the power to penetrate newer foreign tanks. By 1931, experience with the Experimental Mechanized Force led to the report of the Kirke Committee and specifications for three types of tank, a medium tank with a small-calibre anti-tank gun and a machine-gun, a light tank armed with machine-guns for reconnaissance and to co-operate with medium tanks by engaging anti-tank guns. A close support tank armed with a gun firing high explosive and smoke shells to give covering fire for tank attacks was also specified. The Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression led to big reductions in the funds made available for the army. Money spent on tracked vehicles fell from £357,000 in 1931–32 to £301,000 in the year 1932–33 and exceeded the 1931 figure only in 1934–35.

In May 1934, Lieutenant-General Hugh Elles was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance and Brigadier Percy Hobart, the Inspector, Royal Tank Corps, asked Vickers to design a tank for infantry co-operation, that could survive all existing anti-tank weapons and be cheap enough for mass production in peacetime. The next year, Vickers had a two-man tank design, with a machine-gun and powered by a civilian Ford V8 engine of . The prototype of October 1936 weighted had a maximum speed of only but carried of armour and was mechanically reliable. The A11, Infantry Tank Mk I, was the first Infantry tank (I tank) and the first practical expression of the decision to split design into I tanks and cruiser tanks, with different functions and tactics, supplied to separate units and formations.

The 1935 edition of the War Office publication, Field Service Regulations (FSR), containing the principles by which the army was to act to achieve objectives, was written by Major-General Archibald Wavell, made breakthrough the responsibility of infantry divisions with the support of Army Tank Battalions, equipped with specialised vehicles for infantry-artillery co-operation, the slow and heavy Infantry tanks. Once a breakthrough had been created, a Mobile Division containing a tank brigade with light and cruiser tanks, would advance through the gap and use the speed and range of its tanks to surprise the defender and attack flanks, headquarters and non-combatant units. By 1939, further amendments to FSR added counter-attacks on an enemy armoured breakthrough. (The codification of the difference between Infantry and cruiser tanks and their functions in FSR 1935, accidentally created an obstacle to all-arms co-operation that lasted long into the Second World War.) Defence against tanks could be achieved by troops finding physical obstacles and by controlling their own anti-tank guns. The obstacles could be woods and rivers or minefields as long as they were covered by fire from other weapons. In places lacking convenient terrain features, lines-of-communication troops would also need anti-tank guns and be trained to set up localities suitable for all-round defence

The need for economy in the design and production of the A11, which was too small for a radio, led to work on a successor, the A12, Infantry Tank Mk II in 1936. Capable of , the A12 was still slow but had of armour, making it almost invulnerable to tank guns and standard foreign guns like the German 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun. The tank had a four-man crew and a turret big enough for a radio and an Ordnance QF 2-pounder high-velocity gun, firing solid projectiles capable of penetrating all 1939–1940 German tanks. Vickers and government factories could not take on the work and it was farmed out to a civilian firm, which lacked experience, designers and draftsmen. It took until 1939 to bring the A12 into production as the &quot;Matilda II&quot; and it had not gone into service when the war began, only having been delivered. When the Matilda was supplied to Army Tank Battalions it was an effective tank in the Battle of France and in the Western Desert Campaign, where it outclassed Italian tanks and was effective against standard Italian and German anti-tank guns from 1940 to 1941 but was later found to be too slow for the fast tempo that German panzer units could achieve and unable to engage the more powerful German anti-tank guns from long range with high explosive shells.

== Other tank types ==
Using later terminology, the infantry tank has been compared to a heavy tank, while the cruisers were compared to mediums, lights, or even armoured cars. This comparison can be misleading; late Second World War heavy tanks were intended to have superior anti-tank capabilities, which wasn&#x27;t a focus of the traditional infantry tank.

The infantry tank was different from either the &quot;heavy tank&quot; or &quot;breakthrough tank&quot; concepts, although some pre-war multi-turreted heavy machines such as the Soviet T-35 and the German &quot;Neubaufahrzeug&quot; (both taking some of their inspiration from the 1926 Vickers A1E1 Independent – an idea which was abandoned by the War Office in the late 1920s for lack of funding), which were similar, and with similar doctrines for their use. The &quot;Neubaufahrzeug&quot; was considered too slow for Blitzkrieg tactics and fell from favour. German, and to some extent Soviet, wartime doctrine shifted towards faster medium and heavy tanks fighting large multi-tank battles, with the role of the infantry tank in the assault taken by simpler &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; assault guns.

An important difference, however, was that heavy tanks were generally very well armed, while infantry tanks were not necessarily better armed than other types. For example, the Soviet 45-ton KV-1 heavy tank and 25-ton British Matilda IЩяьО
I infantry tank were deployed at about the same time in 1940. These two models had similar levels of armour protection and mobility, but the KV&#x27;s 76.2 mm main gun was much larger than the Matilda&#x27;s 2-pounder (40 mm).
In British practice, the main armament of the infantry tank went in three phases. The pre-Dunkirk British Army Matilda I had only a single heavy Vickers machine gun, a compromise forced by the lightness of its chassis and its target cost. The Matilda II gained a capable anti-tank capacity for its time, with the 2-pounder, but these were only issued with solid-shot (i.e. non-explosive) for anti-tank use and had little effect as artillery when providing close support for the infantry. A separate variant of the Matilda was fitted with a 3-inch howitzer. The ultimate evolution of the British infantry tank concept began with the Churchill Mk I, where a hull-mounted 3-inch howitzer could support infantry assaults with high explosive shells while the turret had a 2-pounder for use against other tanks. As the increasing size of tanks, and their turret ring diameters, allowed such a howitzer to be turret-mounted in vehicles such as the Crusader Close Support (CS) and Centaur CS cruiser tanks.

==History==
=== Britain and France ===

Since infantry tanks were to work at the pace of infantry units which would be attacking on foot, high speed was not a requirement and they were able to carry heavier armour. The first two purpose-designed infantry tanks, the A.11 Matilda Mark I armed with a heavy machine-gun and A.12 Matilda Mark II with a heavy machine gun and 2-pounder anti-tank gun. The Mark I had been ordered in 1938, but it had become clear that a better-armed tank would be needed and the Mark II, was already under design and would be ordered in mid-1938.

The two saw action in the Battle of France where in the Battle of Arras they caused a shock to the German panzer units. Losses of the Mark I in France were not replaced but the Mark II Matilda remained in production.

Infantry and cruiser tanks were expected to engage enemy tanks, hence the use of both the 2-pounder and then 6-pounder on both.

They were followed into service by the Infantry tank Mk III Valentine tank and A.22 Infantry Tank Mk IV Churchill designs. The Valentine proved to be difficult to develop further but the Churchill went through successive variants and served up to the end of the war.
As British cruiser tank designs developed into larger vehicles with more powerful engines, they could carry bigger guns and more armour and yet still achieve high speeds. At the end of the war the cruiser tank lineage led to the &quot;universal tank&quot; in the form of the Centurion.

In practice the British did not operate only infantry and cruiser tanks. Lack of production capacity meant the large scale adoption of US medium tanks.

During the inter-war years, the French Army adopted three light tanks in the infantry tank role. These were the Hotchkiss H35, the Renault R35 and the FCM 36. All three had two–man crews and were similar to the Matilda I in terms of size, weight and armour. However, they were better armed, having 37mm guns as well as co-axial machine guns.

In practice, although able to resist hits from other tanks and anti-tank guns, and designed for good, albeit slow, cross-country performance, the separation of tank functions into specialised areas such as infantry and cruiser types was not effective. Invariably the cruisers ended up meeting enemy tanks in combat, while the infantry tanks were the only ones present when a breakthrough was accomplished. The infantry tank idea faded as tank design progressed during the war. It was eventually replaced outright with the general acceptance of the &#x27;universal tank&#x27; idea.

<doc id="939860" wikidata="Q1049383" url="?curid=939860" title="Orpington chicken">
<text>The Orpington is a British breed of chicken. It was bred in the late nineteenth century by William Cook of Orpington, at that time in Kent in south-east England. It was intended to be a dual-purpose breed, to be reared both for eggs and for meat, but soon became exclusively a show bird. The Australorp of Australia derives from it.

== History ==

The original Black Orpington was bred by William Cook in the 1880s in Orpington, which at that time was in Kent in south-east England. He crossed Minorcas, Langshans and Plymouth Rocks to create a new hybrid bird. It was bred as a dual-purpose utility chicken, to be reared both for eggs and for meat; Cook chose black as a colour that would not show the soot and grime of London. He was also the breeder of the Orpington Duck. 

Black Orpingtons were exhibited at the Dairy Show in Islington in 1886, and also at shows in The Crystal Palace in Sydenham and in Birmingham. A separate show class was created for them in 1888. From the early 1890s, large black Langshan–Cochin crosses were being exhibited and marketed as Orpingtons by Joseph Partington of Lytham in Lancashire and other breeders. These birds were unrelated to Cook&#x27;s and although similar in appearance, did not have the same productive qualities. They were larger and had fuller feathering, and won numerous prizes at poultry shows; some were sold for very large sums.
A bantam buff Orpington was bred by Herman Kuhn in Germany in about 1900.

A breed society, the Orpington Club, was started in 1887. Several clubs were later formed for individual colour varieties; in 1975 many of these merged with the Orpington Bantam Club to form a second Orpington Club.

The Australorp of Australia derives from – and resembles – Cook&#x27;s original black stock, and preserves its productive qualities.

In the United States four colours – black, blue, buff and white – were added to the &quot;Standard of Perfection&quot; of the American Poultry Association in 1960. 

== Characteristics ==

Seven colour varieties are recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain: black, blue, buff, cuckoo, jubilee, spangled and white. The Entente Européenne recognises thirteen colours, and lists two more. In the bantam, only the colours black, blue, buff and white are recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain, but several others have been bred; the Entente Européenne lists sixteen, of which eleven are recognised. The British poultry geneticist W.C. Carefoot bred a chocolate-coloured bantam in the 1990s, a colour previously unknown in chickens, caused by a sex-linked recessive gene. The bantam rarely takes flight.

Body weights for large fowl are approximately for hens and for cocks; average weights for bantams are and respectively.

== Use ==

Orpington hens lay about 180 light brown eggs per year, with an average weight of ; bantam hens lay about 110 eggs, with a weight of some .

It was said that at one time Orpingtons were capable of laying as many as 340 eggs per year. The decline in production was due to breeders selecting for looks over utility.

<doc id="939869" wikidata="Q983987" url="?curid=939869" title="Women's pentathlon">
<text>The pentathlon or women&#x27;s pentathlon is a combined track and field event in which each woman competes in five separate events over one day (formerly two days). The distance or time for each event is converted to points via scoring tables, with the overall ranking determined by total points. Since 1949 the events have been sprint hurdling, high jump, shot put, long jump, and a flat race. The sprint hurdles distance was 80 m outdoors until 1969 and thereafter 100 m; in indoor pentathlon the distance is 60 m. The flat race was 200 m until 1976 and thereafter 800 m. In elite-level outdoor competition, the pentathlon was superseded in 1981 by the heptathlon, which has seven events, with both 200 m and 800 m, as well as the javelin throw. Pentathlon is still contested at school and masters level and indoors.

==History==

The word &quot;pentathlon&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;pente&quot; (five) and &quot;athlon&quot; (contest). The ancient Olympic pentathlon comprised a sprint, the javelin and discus throws, long jump, and wrestling. The modern pentathlon is a multi-sport event. In men&#x27;s track and field, pentathlon competitions were held in the 20th century, but the ten-event decathlon became the standard multi-event contest.

The International Women&#x27;s Sports Federation was established in 1921 and the first reported pentathlon was in the 1922 Women&#x27;s Olympiad in Monte Carlo. The events were: 60 m, 300 m, high jump, two-hand javelin, and two-hand shot. In the late 1920s, the events were: shot and long jump on the first day, and 100 m, high jump, and javelin on the second day. The first world record recognised by the IAAF was set at the 1934 Women&#x27;s World Games by Gisela Mauermayer.

From 1949 the events were: shot, high jump, and 200 m on the first day; 80 m hurdles and long jump on the second. The scoring tables were changed in 1954, and again in 1971. In 1961, the order of the events was changed to: 80 m hurdles, shot, and high jump on the first day; long jump and 200 m on the second, in 1971 the 80 m hurdles were changed to 100 m hurdles. From 1977 all were contested in a single day. Pentathlon was contested at the European Athletics Championships from 1950 to 1978, and at the Olympics from 1964 until 1980. The IAAF has not ratified world records in outdoor pentathlon since replacing it in 1981 with the heptathlon.

==Indoors==

The pentathlon is still held indoors, where the heptathlon cannot be held as arenas are too small for the javelin throw. It was added to the IAAF World Indoor Championships as an unofficial event in 1993 and officially in 1995. The indoor pentathlon is held over a one-day period. Each athlete completes one event at the same time, then there is a 30-minute break until the next event. The current world record is 5055 points by Nafissatou Thiam at the 2023 European Athletics Indoor Championships.

==Contemporary outdoor pentathlon==
As well as indoor events at all levels, outdoor pentathlon is still common in high school athletics. It is simply a smaller version of the decathlon or a heptathlon. For girls, it is 100 m high hurdles, long jump, shot put, high jump, and an 800 m run. The pentathlon is used because it is less stressful on the athletes than a full multi and because many high school meets only last one day, it allows the event to be contested in the time limit.

<text>A pontifical university or athenaeum is an ecclesiastical university established or approved directly by the Holy See, composed of three main ecclesiastical faculties (Theology, Philosophy and Canon Law) and at least one other faculty. These academic institutes deal specifically with Christian revelation and related disciplines, and the Church&#x27;s mission of spreading the Gospel, as proclaimed in the apostolic constitution &quot;Sapientia&quot; &quot;christiana&quot;. As of 2018, they are governed by the apostolic constitution &quot;Veritatis gaudium&quot; issued by Pope Francis on 8 December 2017.

== Quality and ranking ==
Pontifical universities follow a European system of study hour calculation, granting the baccalaureate, the licentiate, and the ecclesiastical doctorate. These ecclesiastical degrees are prerequisites to certain offices in the Roman Catholic Church, especially considering that bishop candidates are selected mainly from priests who are doctors of sacred theology (S.T.D.) or canon law (J.C.D.) and that ecclesiastical judges and canon lawyers must have at least the Licentiate of Canon Law (J.C.L.).

In 2003 the Holy See took part in the Bologna Process, a series of meetings and agreements between European states designed to foster comparable quality standards in higher education, and in the &quot;Bologna Follow-up Group&quot;. Pope Benedict XVI established the Agency for the Evaluation and Promotion of Quality in Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties (AVEPRO), an attempt to promote and develop a culture of quality within the ecclesiastical institutions and enable them to aim in developing internationally valid quality criteria.

Compared to secular universities, which are academic institutions for the study and teaching of a broad range of disciplines, ecclesiastical or pontifical universities are &quot;usually composed of three principal ecclesiastical faculties, theology, philosophy, and canon law, and at least one other faculty. A pontifical university specifically addresses Christian revelation and disciplines correlative to the evangelical mission of the Church as set out in the apostolic constitution &quot;Sapientia christiana&quot;.

<doc id="939871" wikidata="Q781850" url="?curid=939871" title="Barber surgeon">
<text>The barber surgeon was one of the most common European medical practitioners of the Middle Ages, generally charged with caring for soldiers during and after battle. In this era, surgery was seldom conducted by physicians. Instead, barbers, who possessed razors and dexterity, were responsible for tasks ranging from cutting hair to pulling teeth to amputating limbs.

In this period, surgical mortality was very high due to blood loss, shock and infection. Yet, since doctors thought that bloodletting to balance &quot;humours&quot; would improve health, barbers also used bloodletting razors and applied leeches. Meanwhile, physicians considered themselves to be above surgery. Physicians mostly observed during surgery and offered consulting, but otherwise often chose academia or working in universities.

==Middle Ages in Europe==

Due to religious and sanitary monastic regulations, monks had to maintain their tonsure (the traditional baldness on the top of the head of Catholic monks). This created a market for barbers, because each monastery had to train or hire a barber. They would perform bloodletting and minor surgeries, pull teeth and prepare ointments. The first barber surgeons to be recognized as such worked in monasteries around 1000 AD.

Because physicians performed surgery so rarely, the Middle Ages saw a proliferation of barbers, among other medical &quot;paraprofessionals&quot;, including cataract couchers, herniotomists, lithotomists, midwives, and pig gelders. In 1254, Bruno da Longobucco, an Italian physician who wrote about surgery, expressed concern about barbers performing phlebotomies and scarifications.

==Barbers in France and Italy ==

In 16th century Paris, barber-surgery was divided into two categories: &quot;Surgeons of the Short Robe&quot; and &quot;Surgeons of the Long Robe.&quot; &quot;Surgeons of the Long Robe&quot;, a qualification offered in institutions such as the College of St. Cosme, required students to take a formal exam. This was opposed to &quot;Surgeons of the Short Robe&quot;, who did not need to take an exam to qualify and, alongside barbering, would perform minor surgical procedures. However, despite the different education requirements, both types of surgeons were called &quot;barber-surgeons&quot;. This distinction between &quot;short coat&quot; and &quot;long coat&quot; continued in surgery until relatively recently Eventually, in 1660, the barber surgeons recognized the physicians&#x27; dominance.
=== France ===
From the 1540s in France, the translation into French of the works of ancient authors allowed progress in the transmission of knowledge: barber-surgeons could add to their manual skills, and ancient surgical knowledge could be conformed to actual practice.

New problems arose in war surgery, without equivalents in the past: wounds caused by firearms and mutilations caused by artillery. The barber-surgeon was required to treat all the effects on the surface of the body, the doctor treating those on the inside.

There was already social mobility between surgeons and barber-surgeons. A surgeon&#x27;s apprenticeship began with the practice of shaving. The young surgeon could thus have a source of income before mastering the surgery of his time. In the context of Renaissance humanism, this practical experience took place outside of academic scholasticism. The action is clearly sanctioned by the results, visible to all. For Michel de Montaigne, compared to medicine:

=== Italy ===
In Italy, barbers were not as common. The Salerno medical school trained physicians to be competent surgeons, as did the schools in Bologna and Padua. In Florence, physicians and surgeons were separate, but the Florentine Statute concerning the Art of Physicians and Pharmacists in 1349 gave barbers an inferior legal status compared to surgeons.
== Barbers in Spain ==
Surgical practices in the Iberian Peninsula date back to the Megalithic era (2000 BC), with evidence of trepanation. Until the Renaissance, Spanish surgery followed Greek, Arab, and medieval traditions, with significant progress in the 16th century through anatomical studies. Despite this, military, naval, and barber-surgeons performed operations, as physicians distanced themselves from surgery. A royal decree regulated barber-surgeons in Spain. There were active barber surgeons operating in Valencia in the 15th century. One notable practitioner was Antonio Fernando de Medrano, a professional barber surgeon active in Madrid during the 17th century.

The establishment of surgical chairs in Spanish universities in the late 16th century gave surgery social and academic recognition, but a standardized system emerged only in the 18th century with the Reales Colegios de Cirugía (Royal Colleges of Surgeons), founded by military surgeons. The first institutions in Cádiz (1748) and Barcelona (1764), led by Virgili, were followed by Madrid (1780), founded by Antoni de Gimbernat. These colleges formally integrated surgery into medical education, solidifying its scientific status.

== Barbers in the British Isles in the early modern period ==
Formal recognition of surgeons&#x27; skills (in England at least) goes back to 1540, when the Fellowship of Surgeons (who existed as a distinct profession but were not &quot;Doctors/Physicians&quot; for reasons including that, as a trade, they were trained by apprenticeship rather than academically) merged with the Company of Barbers, a London livery company, to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. However, the trade was gradually put under pressure by the medical profession and in 1745, the surgeons split from the Barbers&#x27; Company (which still exists) to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 a royal charter was granted to this company and the Royal College of Surgeons in London came into being. Later it was renamed to cover all of England—equivalent colleges exist for Scotland and Ireland as well as many of the old UK colonies (e.g., Canada).

== Barbers in medieval Finland ==
There are few studies on barber surgeons in Finland. The first known account is that of Hinzikinus from 1324 to 1326, originating from Turku, a city in the southern region of the country, who provided medical preparation and wound care for Viceroy Matts Kettilmundson. The second barber surgeon documented was Henrik Bardskärare, who worked in the castle of Vyborg in Finland (currently a part of Russia). Each company of 400–500 men in the Swedish Army was assigned a barber during the rule of King Gustav I Vasa in the 16th century. A barber surgeon was available to tend to the injured in almost every division. In 1571, the barbers organized into a professional guild that governed their training, jobs, pay, and the number of barbers. Barbers from other countries could join the guild as well. The guild mandated that barber surgeons receive their training from established masters as apprentices, and in order to receive their degrees, the apprentices had to pass an exam. The guild provided guidelines for the barber surgeons&#x27; fees or pay, which varied and occasionally depended on how many patients were treated and surgeries were carried out.

== Traditions in the 21st century ==
Few traces of barbers&#x27; links with the surgical side of the medical profession remain. One is the traditional red and white barber&#x27;s pole, or a modified instrument from a blacksmith, which is said to represent the blood and bandages associated with their historical role.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, another vestige is the use of the titles &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Ms&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, or &quot;Miss&quot; rather than &quot;Dr&quot; by physicians when they complete their surgery qualifications by, for example, the award of an MRCS or FRCS diploma. This practice dates back to the days when surgeons were not required to obtain a university education in medicine, and is retained despite the fact that all surgeons in these countries 
must earn a medical degree and spend additional years in surgical training and certification.

<doc id="939872" wikidata="Q5794158" url="?curid=939872" title="William Hawley">
<text>Lieutenant colonel William Hawley (1851–1941) was a British archaeologist who undertook pioneering excavations at Stonehenge.

==Military career==
Hawley joined the Royal Engineers and was a captain of the Portsmouth division of the Royal Engineers Militia from March 1893. In late March 1902, he was seconded for active service in South Africa for the later stages of the Second Boer War, and after the end of this war he was back with his regiment from October 1902.

==Old Sarum==
Along with William Henry St John Hope and Duncan Hector Montgomerie, Hawley participated in the first major excavations of the Old Sarum hillfort between 1909 and 1915. These digs were organized by the Society of Antiquaries of London.

==Stonehenge==

Work at the Stonehenge prehistoric monument was carried out between 1919 and 1926, largely by Hawley alone, at times assisted by Robert Newall, a draughtsman from the Office of Works. The weather and the confusing stratigraphy of this site made work difficult, but Hawley was able to make numerous breakthroughs regarding the history of activity on the site.

The first task was the supervised righting of some of the fallen stones, late in 1919. Hawley dug out the foundations before the stones were replaced. Hawley was employed by the Office of Works, the antecedent of the Ministry of Works who had been passed responsibility for Stonehenge when it had been donated to the nation in 1918. They were primarily concerned with the danger of falling stones, but funds were made available for Hawley to continue his investigations long after the righting work was finished.

Hawley identified the Aubrey Holes for the first time, as well as the Y and Z Holes and a variety of other postholes and stone holes within the centre of the monument. He found many of the cremated and uncremated human remains which first indicated a funerary role for Stonehenge. Excavations of the Avenue, the ditch (Heelstone Ditch) around the Heelstone, and the trench (Arc Trench) leading up to the Heelstone were also undertaken.

Hawley proved, from a thin stratum of stone chip debris he called the Stonehenge Layer, that the earthwork features, the Aubrey Holes and some of the other postholes and burials constituted earlier phases of activity that predated the erection of the megaliths. He also found an antler pick embedded in a lump of chalk, indicating the construction method on site. Eventually he settled on three phases: the earthwork enclosure, a large stone circle now vanished that supposedly stood in the Aubrey Holes, and finally a larger megaliths phase involving the extant stones as Stonehenge 3. Hawley&#x27;s model of a multiphase site did not agree with the contemporary interpretation and was ignored until Richard Atkinson revived the idea in the 1950s. Although later considerably refined, his multi-phase interpretation is now fully accepted.

Certain of Hawley&#x27;s other ideas, such as Stonehenge being a fortified settlement, were further off the mark and he died before his work was recognised.

Artefacts excavated by Hawley at Stonehenge are displayed in the Wessex Gallery of Archaeology at the Salisbury Museum. Selected samples were also sent to the Ashmolean (Oxford), the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Cambridge), the National Museum of Wales (Cardiff), and the British Museum (London).

<doc id="939876" wikidata="Q423927" url="?curid=939876" title="Hypervitaminosis">
<text>Hypervitaminosis is a condition of abnormally high storage levels of vitamins, which can lead to various symptoms as over excitement, irritability, or even toxicity. Specific medical names of the different conditions are derived from the given vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called hypervitaminosis A. Hypervitaminoses are primarily caused by fat-soluble vitamins (D and A), as these are stored by the body for longer than the water-soluble vitamins.

Generally, toxic levels of vitamins stem from high supplement intake and not always from natural sources but rather the mix of natural, derived vitamins and enhancers (vitamin boosters). Toxicities of fat-soluble vitamins can also be caused by a large intake of highly fortified foods, but natural food in modest levels rarely deliver extreme or dangerous levels of fat-soluble vitamins. The Dietary Reference Intake recommendations from the United States Department of Agriculture define a &quot;tolerable upper intake level&quot; for most vitamins.

For those who are entirely healthy and do not experience long periods of avitaminosis, vitamin overdose can be avoided by not taking more than the normal or recommended amount of multi-vitamin supplement shown on the bottle and not ingesting multiple vitamin-containing supplements concurrently.

==Signs and symptoms==

A few described symptoms:

* Frequent urination and/or cloudy urine
* Increased urine amount
* Eye irritation and/or increased sensitivity to light
* Irregular and/or rapid heartbeat
* Bone and joint pain (associated with avitaminosis)
* Muscle pain
* Confusion and mood changes (e.g. irritability, inability to focus)
* Convulsions
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Flushing of skin (associated with niacin (vitamin B3) overdose)
* Skin disturbances (e.g. dryness, itching, cracking of skin, rashes, increased sensitivity to sun)
* Changes of hair texture (e.g. thickening and/or clumping of hair)
* Appetite loss
* Constipation (associated with iron or calcium overdose)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhoea
* Moderate weight loss (more commonly seen in long-term overdose cases)
==Causes==
With few exceptions, like some vitamins from B-complex, hypervitaminosis usually occurs with the fat-soluble vitamins A and D, which are stored, respectively, in the liver and fatty tissues of the body. These vitamins build up and remain for a longer time in the body than water-soluble vitamins. Conditions include:
* Hypervitaminosis A
* Hypervitaminosis D
* Vitamin B3 § Toxicity
* Megavitamin-B6 syndrome
* Vitamin E toxicity

==Prevention==

Prevention in healthy individuals not having any periods of avitaminosis or vitamin (vegetables) lack for 2 years at least is by not taking more than the expected normal or recommended amount of vitamin supplements.

== Epidemiology ==
In the United States, overdose exposure to all formulations of &quot;vitamins&quot; (which includes multi-vitamin/mineral products) was reported by 62,562 individuals in 2004 with nearly 80% of these exposures in children under the age of 6, leading to 53 &quot;major&quot; life-threatening outcomes and 3 deaths (2 from vitamins D and E; 1 from a multivitamin with iron). This may be compared to the 19,250 people who died of unintentional poisoning of all kinds in the U.S. in the same year (2004). In 2016, overdose exposure to all formulations of vitamins and multi-vitamin/mineral formulations was reported by 63,931 individuals to the American Association of Poison Control Centers with 72% of these exposures in children under the age of five. No deaths were reported.

<text>The Office of Works was an organisation responsible for structures and exterior spaces, first established as part of the English royal household in 1378 to oversee the building and maintenance of the royal castles and residences.

In 1832 it became the Works Department within the Office of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings. It was reconstituted as a government department in 1851, which in 1940 became part of the Ministry of Works.

==Organisation and key positions==

===Surveyor, Comptroller and Architect===
The organisation of the office varied; senior posts included Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works (1578–1782) and Comptroller of the King&#x27;s Works (1423–1782). In 1782 these offices were merged into Surveyor-General and Comptroller. 

After the death of the Surveyor-General and Comptroller James Wyatt in 1813, a non-professional Surveyor-General was appointed: Major-General Sir Benjamin Stephenson. He was assisted by three &quot;Attached Architects&quot;: Sir John Soane, John Nash and Sir Robert Smirke. This arrangement ended in 1832 with the formation of the Works Department, when architect Henry Hake Seward was appointed Surveyor of Works and Buildings.

Other positions included Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Private Roads, various roles with responsibility for gardens, and later, Deputy Surveyor.


=== Administrative positions ===

The office also had posts of Secretary, Master Mason and Master Carpenter.

<doc id="939898" wikidata="Q1663777" url="?curid=939898" title="Safavid order">
<text>The Safavid order, () also called the Safaviyya (), was a Kurdish Sufi Shia order (Tariqa) founded by the mystic Safi-ad-Din Ardabili (1252–1334 AD). It held a prominent place in the society and politics of North Western Iran in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but today it is best known for having given rise to the Safavid dynasty.

==Foundation and evolution==
The Safaviyya, while initially founded Safi-ad-Din Ardabili under the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islam, later adoptions of Shia concepts by the children and grandchildren of Safi-ad-Din Ardabili resulted in the order becoming associated with Twelverism. Safī al-Din&#x27;s importance in the order is attested in two letters by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani. In one, Rashid al-Din pledges an annual offering of foodstuffs to Safī al-Din&#x27; and in the other, Rashid al-Din writes to his son, the governor of Ardabil, advising him to show proper respect and comportment to the mystic.

After Safī al-Din&#x27;s death, leadership of the order passed to his son, Sadr al-Dīn Mūsā, and subsequently passed down from father to son, and by the mid-fifteenth century, the Twelver Safawiyya changed in character, evolving into an extreme and intolerant form of Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, becoming militant under Shaykh Junayd and Shaykh Haydar by proclaiming Jihad against the Christians of Georgia, and becoming exaggerative by adopting messianic beliefs about its leadership and antinomian practices outside of the norm of Twelver Islam at the time.

Junayd&#x27;s grandson, Ismail, further altered the nature of the order when he founded the Safavid empire in 1501 and proclaimed Twelver Shi&#x27;ism as the state religion, at which point he imported Twelver Shia Ulama largely from Lebanon and Syria to transform the order into a Twelver Shi&#x27;i dynasty.

<text>Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment studio conglomerate that produces, acquires, and distributes filmed entertainment (theatrical motion pictures, television programs, and recorded videos) through multiple platforms. Through an intermediate holding company called Sony Film Holding Inc., it is operated as a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment Inc., which is itself a subsidiary of the multinational holding conglomerate Sony Group Corporation.

Based at the Sony Pictures Studios lot in Culver City, California, as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; major American film studios, it encompasses Sony&#x27;s motion picture, television production and distribution units. All of SPE&#x27;s divisions are members of the Motion Picture Association (MPA). Sony&#x27;s film franchises include &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Jumanji&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, and Sony&#x27;s &quot;Spider Man&quot; universe.

== History ==

=== 1987–1989 ===
On September 1, 1987, the Coca-Cola Company announced plans to spin off Columbia Pictures, which it had owned since 1982. Under this arrangement, Coca-Cola would sell its entertainment assets (Coca-Cola&#x27;s Entertainment Business Sector) to TriStar Pictures, of which it owned 39.6%. Tri-Star would be renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coca-Cola owning 49%, its shareholders owning 31%, and Tri-Star&#x27;s shareholders owning 20%. As part of a merger plan, the two television businesses, comprising Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television, merged altogether to form a new incarnation of the original Columbia Pictures Television.

The merger enabled three top Tri-Star executives, namely Arnold Messner, who ran Tri-Star Telecommunications, Victor A. Kaufman, who ran the main Tri-Star Pictures studio, and Scott Siegler, who ran Tri-Star Television to stay on, while four of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector departed, namely Barbara Corday, who ran Columbia/Embassy Television as president, Herman Rush and Peter Seale, who ran Coca-Cola Telecommunications, and Brian McGrath, who was the president of the Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector. In early December 1987, former Coke EBS vice president Kenneth Lemberger exited the post to join Tri-Star Pictures, displacing Roger Faxon, who had joined Columbia Pictures as senior vice president of the studio.

The merger was approved by shareholders on December 15, 1987, and it was completed two days later. Columbia and Tri-Star brands would be used as separate and autonomous production entities, and would be part of CPE whole, along with the prior assets, units and commitments of the former Coca-Cola Entertainment Business Sector, which included all feature, TV, home video, and pay cable operations as well as the Entertainment Sector&#x27;s feature production deal with Nelson Entertainment and its investment in Castle Rock Entertainment, and TeleVentures; a company it continues to own, which was linked to three independent companies: Tri-Star Pictures, Stephen J. Cannell Productions and Witt/Thomas Productions. Merv Griffin Enterprises continue to function as a separate operation. A new company was formed in early 1988 with the Tri-Star name to take over the studio&#x27;s operations.

In early January 1988, CPE announced that they would revive the Triumph branding for the new worldwide subsidiary, Triumph Releasing Corporation, which was functioned as a theatrical distributor, marketing and promotion for Columbia and Tri-Star films, and named Patrick N. Williamson as president of the unit and the company provided administrative services related to distribution of its films in North America, while internationally, would be responsible for the direction of each studio.

On September 28, 1989, Sony obtained an option to purchase all of The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s stock (approximately 54 million shares or 49% of the outstanding shares) in CPE for $27 per share. The next day, Sony also announced that it reached an agreement with Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPEC; formerly Barris Industries, Inc.) to acquire CPE for $200 million when Sony hired Peter Guber and Jon Peters to be its co-chairmen. This was all led by Norio Ohga, who was the president and CEO of Sony during that time.

The hiring of Guber and Peters by Sony to run Columbia was conflicted by a previous contract the producers had signed at Warner Bros. Time Warner&#x27;s chairman, Steve Ross, threatened Sony with a lawsuit for breach of contract. The lawsuit would be subsequently dropped when Sony sold half-interest in Columbia House and cable distribution rights to Columbia&#x27;s feature films, TV movies, and miniseries to Warner Bros. That same agreement also saw Columbia sell its 35% interest in the Burbank Studios and acquired Lorimar Studios, previously the MGM lot, from Warner Bros.

On October 31, 1989, Sony completed a friendly takeover bid for the rest of shares (51%) of CPE, which was a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: KPE), and acquired 99.3% of the common stock of the company. On November 8, 1989, Sony completed the acquisition by a &quot;short-form&quot; merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Sony Columbia Acquisition Corporation into CPE under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Sony also completed a tender offer for shares of common stock of the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company on November 6, 1989, and acquired the company 3 days later. The acquisition cost Sony $4.9 billion ($3.55 billion for shares and $1.4 billion of long-term debt) and was backed (financed) by five major Japanese banks Mitsui, Tokyo, Fuji, Mitsubishi and Industrial Bank of Japan.

=== 1990–1999 ===
The company was renamed as Sony Pictures Entertainment on August 7, 1991. Also that year, Jon Peters left Columbia to start Peters Entertainment with a three-year exclusive production agreement at the studio at first, before transitioning to a non-exclusive deal at the studio. Longtime CPE employee Laurie MacDonald also left to start Aerial Pictures at the studio, first for a two-year deal, before going to 20th Century Fox in 1993, and being swallowed up by Amblin Entertainment later that year, eventually setting up DreamWorks.

Sony has since created numerous other film production and distribution units, such as creating Sony Pictures Classics for art-house fare, by forming Columbia TriStar Pictures (also known as the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group) by merging Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures in 1998, revitalizing Columbia&#x27;s former television division Screen Gems.

This in effect re-united the MGM studio name, with the MGM main studio lot, although somewhat confusingly, the bulk of the pre-May 1986 original MGM library ended up at Time Warner via the Ted Turner-Kirk Kerkorian &quot;Turner Entertainment Co.&quot; transactions. The post-April 1986 MGM library consists of acquisitions of various third-party libraries, such as the Orion Pictures catalogue, leading to MGM&#x27;s 2014 remake of &quot;RoboCop&quot;.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In July 2000, a marketing executive working for Sony Corporation created a fictitious film critic, David Manning, who gave consistently good reviews for releases from Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures that generally received poor reviews amongst real critics. Sony later pulled the ads, suspended Manning&#x27;s creator and his supervisor and paid fines to the state of Connecticut and to fans who saw the reviewed films in the US.

It expanded its operations on April 8, 2005, when a Sony-led consortium acquired the legendary Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), in a US$4.8 billion leveraged buyout, through the holding company MGM Holdings Inc.

On June 4, 2008, SPE&#x27;s wholly owned group 2JS Productions B.V. acquired Dutch production company 2waytraffic N.V., famous for &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, acquired from the original production company Celador, and &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot; for £114.3 million ($223.2 million in US dollars).

=== 2010–2019 ===
In 2011, the Sony Pictures computer network was breached and approximately one million user accounts associated with the SonyPictures.com website were leaked.

On November 18, 2012, Sony Pictures announced it has passed $4 billion with the success of releases: &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Vow&quot;, and &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;. On November 21, 2013, SPE and Sony Entertainment&#x27;s CEO Michael Lynton announced that SPE will shift emphasis from movies to television by cutting its 2014 film slate. It was also announced on the same day, that there would be more &quot;Spider-Man&quot; sequels and spin-offs, though on February 10, 2015, Sony Pictures eventually signed a deal with Disney&#x27;s Marvel Studios to allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, before appearing in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; which was released on July 7, 2017. The deal also allowed Sony to distribute and have creative control on any MCU film where Spider-Man is the main character (such as &quot;Homecoming&quot; and its sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;), while Disney would distribute MCU films where Spider-Man appears without being the main character.

On January 22, 2014, SPE folded its technology unit into the various cores of its businesses. In April, Sony Pictures arranged a film financing deal worth $200 million with LStar Capital, the credit venture of Lone Star Capital and Citibank, half in debt and the other in equity to fund most of SPE&#x27;s film slate for several years. SPE was originally considering a $300 million deal with Blue Anchor Entertainment, led by Bloom Hergott partner John LaViolette and former investment banker &amp; producer Joseph M. Singer, and backed by Longhorn Capital Management and Deutsche Bank, which was held up by regulatory matters.

In November 2019, Sony purchased the remaining 42% stake in GSN from AT&amp;T, placing it under the direction of its television division.

===2020–present===

In April 2021, Sony signed a first-look deal with Netflix, allowing the streaming service to host their films following their theatrical runs and home media releases. That same month, the company also entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with The Walt Disney Company for its films to stream across Disney&#x27;s streaming and linear platforms, including Disney+ and Hulu.

In February 2022, Sony signed a deal with WarnerMedia Europe to stream its theatrical films on HBO Max for Central and Eastern Europe countries.

On November 28, 2022, it was announced that Legendary Entertainment reached a distribution deal with Sony to distribute its future slate of films. However, this deal does not include the Dune and MonsterVerse films as they will remain at Warner Bros. The deal came after the negative impact of the merger of Warner Bros.&#x27; parent company WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery.

On November 14, 2023, Sony Pictures unveiled a special centennial anniversary logo for its Columbia Pictures unit ahead of its 100th anniversary of its founding on January 10, 2024.

On April 18, 2024, it was reported that Sony was interested in acquiring Paramount Global through a joint buyout with Apollo Global Management. Sony and Apollo submitted a $26 billion all-cash offer to acquire Paramount Global on May 2, 2024. A special committee of Paramount&#x27;s board of directors met on May 5, 2024, and signed off on beginning deal talks with Sony and Apollo. Sony would drop the deal when Paramount announced a merger with Skydance Media in July of this year.

On June 12, 2024, Sony Pictures acquired Alamo Drafthouse Cinema for a sum which are yet-to-be disclosed. This marked the first time in more than 75 years that a major Hollywood studio would own a theater chain, as the 1948 federal ruling from &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; prevented them from owning exhibition companies until 2020. Alamo Drafthouse will continue to operate their film festival Fantastic Fest, which is included in the acquisition.

In September 2024, Sony Group announced the appointment of SPE president and COO Ravi Ahuja as CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment effective January 2, 2025, succeeding Tony Vinciquerra, who will remain chairman until December 31, 2025.

== 2014 hack ==
In November 2014, the Sony Pictures computer network was compromised by a group of hackers named Guardians of Peace, disabling many computers. Later the same week, five of Sony Pictures&#x27; movies were leaked, including some not yet released (such as &quot;Fury&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;), as well as confidential data about 47,000 current and former Sony employees. Film historian Wheeler Winston Dixon suggested that the hack, which exposed the inner workings of the studio, was &quot;not a pretty picture,&quot; and served as a &quot;wake-up call to the entire industry.&quot; The hack also revealed some other documents, emails between Hollywood moguls referring to Barack Obama&#x27;s cinematic tastes, a possible partnership with Marvel Studios for the inclusion of the superhero Spider-Man in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, which was later confirmed in February 2015, amongst others. On December 16, the hackers issued a warning to moviegoers, threatening to attack anyone who sees &quot;The Interview&quot; during the holidays and urging people to &quot;remember the 11th of September 2001&quot;. On December 17, 2014, Sony cancelled the previously planned December 25 release of &quot;The Interview&quot; in response to hacker threats.

On February 24, 2015, Tom Rothman was named chairman of SPE&#x27;s motion picture group to replace Amy Pascal.

On April 16, 2015, WikiLeaks published over 30,287 documents, 173 e-mails, and 2,200 corporate e-mail addresses of Sony Pictures&#x27; employees. WikiLeaks said in a press release that the content of the leaks were &quot;newsworthy and at the center of a geo-political conflict&quot; and belonged &quot;in the public domain&quot;. Sony Pictures later condemned the hack and subsequent leaks, calling it a &quot;malicious criminal act&quot;, while also criticizing WikiLeaks for describing the leaked content as public domain.

Seth Rogen has expressed doubts about North Korea being responsible for the 2014 Sony hack. Based on the timeline of events and the amount of information hacked, he believes the hack may have been conducted by a Sony employee.

==Sale of headquarters==

In 2014, the eight-story, 260,000sq ft building originally designed by architect Maxwell Starkman and known as Sony Pictures Plaza, which was originally the headquarters of MGM Studios and later Sony Pictures Studios, was sold to Runyon Group and fellow developer LBA Realty for $159 million.

<text>Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives (, literally &quot;Saint-Pierre on Dives&quot;) is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Saint-Pierre-en-Auge.

The abbey church was rebuilt during the 12th and 13th centuries and restored and modified in the 16th and 17th centuries, replacing the former abbey church built in 1011 by William the Conqueror&#x27;s aunt, Countess Lesceline. The church was entirely restored in the 16th century. By that time it got its general current appearance: a long main nave with two aisles and five radiating chapels, in the Gothic style.

==11th-century market hall==

The market hall () is an example of Norman medieval architecture and dates from the 11th century. It was originally used by the Benedictine monks of the abbey to sell their goods to the locals. The structure was listed as a historical monument the 6 March 1889. The hall was completely destroyed by fire during the German withdrawal from the area in the summer of 1944. The halls were rebuilt using chestnut wood (same as the original).

==Events==

Weekly open-air market every Monday morning in the square which surrounds the 11th-century market hall. Cattle market every Monday in the market square. About a hundred calves are sold to the breeders every week as well as sheep, pigs and some goats. There is also an antiques market the first Sunday of each month at the market hall. Opposite the main hall is La Cour des Brocanteurs - a small courtyard selling second hand items, antiques, design, vintage, jewellery and outdoor furniture.

==Sights==
The Protective Botanical Garden collects old varieties of flowers and vegetables.

==International relations==
The commune is twinned with the following towns.

<text>Alyxia is a genus of flowering plants in the family, Apocynaceae. It contains at present 106 species, but &quot;Alyxia stellata&quot; and &quot;A. tisserantii&quot; are very variable, might be cryptic species complexes, and are need of further study. It consists of shrubby, climbing or scrambling plants. This genus occurs in China, the Himalayas, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Caledonia and the Pacific Islands. There are 14 species in Australia, 21 in New Caledonia and 7 in the other Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.

The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three to seven. There are colleters (groups or tufts of mucilaginous secretory hairs) present in the leaf axils. The inflorescence is axillary or terminal with solitary flowers or simple cymes. Flowers consist of five petals and five sepals. The flowers have a slender tube which expands abruptly. The stamens have short filaments and are inserted in the upper half of the corolla. The fruit is a pair of drupes, originating from each flower.

Dysentery bush (&quot;A. buxifolia&quot;) is used in herbalism and was made into a patented remedy by Albert Aspinall. &quot;Maile&quot; (&quot;A. oliviformis&quot;), endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, has sweet-smelling leaves and is much used for lei; formerly it was reserved for &quot;alii&quot; (nobility), but today it can be used by anyone and is a popular wedding decoration on the islands. &quot;Maile&quot; also provides food for &quot;Thyrocopa&quot; caterpillars and weevils of the genus &quot;Proterhinus&quot;. Alyxia spp. are also used in Jamu.

<doc id="939926" wikidata="Q157972" url="?curid=939926" title="Symphoricarpos">
<text>Symphoricarpos is a small genus of about 15 species of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae. With the exception of the Chinese coralberry, &quot;S. sinensis&quot;, which is indigenous to western China, all species are native to North and Central America. The name of the genus is derived from the Ancient Greek words (), meaning &quot;to bear together&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;fruit&quot;. It refers to the closely packed clusters of berries the species produces. Species in the genus are known by several common names, including snowberry, waxberry and ghostberry.

Snowberry is a resilient plant able to withstand a variety of conditions. Their deep roots allow them to survive dry seasons,  and they have been known to grow in a variety of soil types such as light sandy soil, medium loamy soil and heavier clay soil. Snowberry plants are most commonly found low-to mid elevations, in forests, dry or moist openings, rocky hillsides or near riverbanks and streams. Snowberry plants are also able to grow in a wide range of acidic and basic pHs and sunlight conditions.

==Description==
&quot;Symphoricarpos&quot; leaves are long, rounded, entire or with one or two lobes at the base. The flowers are small, greenish-white to pink, in small clusters of 5–15 together in most species, solitary or in pairs in some (e.g. &quot;S. microphyllus&quot;). The fruit is conspicuous, in diameter, soft, varying from white (e.g. &quot;S. albus&quot;) to pink (&quot;S. microphyllus&quot;) to red (&quot;S. orbiculatus&quot;) and in one species (&quot;S. sinensis&quot;), blackish purple. When the white berries are broken open, the interior looks like fine, sparkling granular snow. The flesh is spongy and contains two 2–5 mm long, whitish stone seeds. The seeds, which contain endosperm and a small embryo, are egg-shaped and more or less flattened. They have a very tough, hard, impermeable covering, and so are very hard to germinate and may lie dormant for up to ten years.

The berries are not edible but have a wintergreen flavor, similar to the related wintergreen plant (&quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot;).

The white berries create a cracking sound when they are stepped into firm ground.

==Ecology==
Snowberry is a hermaphroditic species meaning it contains both male and female reproductive organs. It has the ability to grow via seeds but typically reproduces by releasing shoots from a rhizome. This method of shoot dispersal allows snowberry to grow in dense populations of bushes and trees. Snowberry plants also tend to use a reproductive method called layering in which the plant&#x27;s vertical stems will wilt and droop until they touch surrounding soil. Upon making contact with soil, roots will begin to form. Snowberry plants are resilient and studies have proved they are able to tolerate dormant seasonal fires. These fires actually encourage the snowberry plant&#x27;s layering reproductive method, as the regeneration of new plants results in an increased number of stems and therefore more opportunities for layering to occur.

Common snowberry (&quot;S. albus&quot;) is a resilient plant that thrives in dry woodland conditions. Its berries ripen during fall and last through winter, making it an important winter food source for quail and grouse. However, the berries are considered poisonous to humans. The berries contain the isoquinoline alkaloid chelidonine, as well as other alkaloids. Ingesting the berries causes mild symptoms of vomiting, dizziness, and slight sedation in children.

==Cultivation==
Common snowberry is a popular ornamental shrub in gardens, grown for its decorative white fruit and wildlife gardening. It is also a useful landscaping plant due to its extreme versatility—tolerating sun, shade, heat, cold, drought, and inundation.

==Medicinal uses==
Due to their low saponin content, snowberry was a common medicinal treatment used by several North American Indigenous tribes. Snowberry contains low concentrations of saponins, which are anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory. Saponins have also been proven to help with immune function and decrease cholesterol. Saponins can be extremely toxic if consumed in excess, but are typically applied externally or consumed in concentrations too low to inflict damage. Its toxic effects can also be reduced through cooking.

The snowberry plant is known to be disinfectant, laxative, diuretic and has the ability to reduce fever. Native Americans found several uses for the snowberry plant. Snowberry leaves were chewed up and used in a poultice to treat external wounds. Its berries were used for a number of applications including as an eyewash, as an antiperspirant, a diarrhea remedy, and was also rubbed on the skin as a treatment for burns, rashes, warts, sores, cuts and other external wounds. Snowberry stems were boiled and their essence was extracted to be used for stomach problems, menstrual pain, and as a soap. Weaker dilutions were used for children, meanwhile stronger concentrations were used as a disinfectant to clean open sores. Snowberry bark was also boiled, its essence extracted and used to treat sexually transmitted diseases and urinary dysfunction issues. Its roots were commonly used in the treatment of fever, stomach ache, common cold, and even tuberculosis. In California, the Coastal Miwok used pounded snowberry root to treat ailments as the cold.

Due to the content of saponins in the berries, some tribes of the Pacific Northwest used the crushed fruits to stun fish in lakes and rivers in order to facilitate the harvesting of fish. The saponins, which are not toxic to humans interfere with oxygen absorption in the gills.&quot;&quot;

==Other uses==
In Ireland, children use the berries for play, bursting the berries close to each other&#x27;s ears. The berries are known as &quot;billy busters&quot;.

<doc id="939928" wikidata="Q631972" url="?curid=939928" title="Safi-ad-Din Ardabili">
<text>Safi-ad-Din Ardabili ( &quot;Ṣāfī ad-Dīn Isḥāq Ardabīlī&quot;; 1252/3 – 1334) was a poet, mystic, teacher and Sufi master. He was the son-in-law and spiritual heir of the Sufi master Zahed Gilani, whose order—the Zahediyeh—he reformed and renamed the Safaviyya, which he led from 1301 to 1334.

Safi was the eponymous ancestor of the Safavid dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1501 to 1736.

==Background==
Safi was born in 1252/3 in the town of Ardabil, located in Azerbaijan—a region corresponding to the northwestern part of Iran—then under Mongol rule. The town—a commercial centre during this period—was situated in a mountainous area, near the Caspian Sea. Safi&#x27;s father was Amin al-Din Jibrail, while his mother was named Dawlati. The family was of Kurdish origin, and spoke Persian as their primary language. The life of Safi&#x27;s father is obscure; Ibn Bazzaz, whose report is distorted, states that Amin al-Din Jibrail died when Safi was six, while Hayati Tabrizi reports that he was born in 1216 and died in 1287. 

==Life==
According to hagiographical chronicles, Safi was bound to eminence since his birth. As a child, he was taught in religion, and saw visions of angels and met the &quot;abdal&quot; and &quot;awtad&quot;. When he reached adulthood, he was unable to find a &quot;murshid&quot; (spiritual guide) that would appease him, and thus left for Shiraz at the age of 20, in 1271/2. There he was to meet Shaykh Najib al-Din Buzghush, but the latter died before Safi reached him. He then continued his search in the Caspian region, where he met Zahed Gilani at the village of Hilya Karin in 1276/7. There he became a disciple of the latter, and enjoyed close relations with him; Safi was married to Zahed&#x27;s daughter Bibi Fatima, while Zahed&#x27;s son Hajji Shams al-Din Muhammad was married to Safi&#x27;s daughter. 

Safi and Bibi Fatima had three sons; Muhyi al-Din, Sadr al-Din Musa (who later succeeded him), and Abu Sa&#x27;id. Safi was appointed the next-in-line of the Zahediyeh order by Zahed, whom he succeeded in 1301 after the latter&#x27;s death. Safi&#x27;s succession to the Zahediyeh was met with animosity by Zahedi&#x27;s family and some of the latter&#x27;s followers. Safi renamed the order as the Safaviyya, and started implementing reforms to it, transforming it from a local Sufi order to that of a religious movement, who circulated propaganda around Iran, Syria, Asia Minor, and even as far as Sri Lanka. He amassed a substantial amount of political influence, and appointed his son Sadr al-Din Musa as his heir, which demonstrates that he was resolute on keeping his family in power.

Safi died on 12 September, 1334, where he was buried.

==Lineage==
Safi-ad-Din was of Kurdish origins. According to Minorsky, Sheykh Safi al-Din&#x27;s ancestor Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah was a rich man, lived in Gilan and then Kurdish kings gave him Ardabil and its dependencies. Vladimir Minorsky refers to Sheykh Safi al-Din&#x27;s claims tracing back his origins to Ali ibn Abu Talib, but expresses uncertainty about this.

The male lineage of the Safavid family given by the oldest manuscript of the Safwat as-Safa is:&quot;(Shaykh) Safi al-Din Abul-Fatah Ishaaq the son of Al-Shaykh Amin al-Din Jebrail the son of al-Saaleh Qutb al-Din Abu Bakr the son of Salaah al-Din Rashid the son of Muhammad al-Hafiz al-Kalaam Allah the son of Javaad the son of Pirooz al-Kurdi al-Sanjani (Piruz Shah Zarin Kolah the Kurd of Sanjan)&quot; similar to the ancestry of Sheykh Safi al-Din&#x27;s father-in-law, Sheikh Zahed Gilani, who also hailed from Sanjan, in Greater Khorasan.

==Ascension as Murshid==

Safi al-Din inherited Sheikh Zahed Gilani&#x27;s Sufi order, the &quot;Zahediyeh&quot;, which he later transformed into his own, the &quot;Safaviyya&quot;. Zahed Gilani also gave his daughter Bibi Fatemeh in wedlock to his favorite disciple. Safi al-Din, in turn, gave a daughter from a previous marriage in wedlock to Zahed Gilani&#x27;s second-born son. Over the following 170 years, the Safaviyya Order gained political and military power, finally culminating in the foundation of the Safavid dynasty which established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.

==Poetry==
Safi al-Din has composed poems in the Iranian dialect of Old Azeri. He was a seventh-generation descendant of Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah, a local Iranian dignitary.
Eleven quatrains of Sheikh Safi ad-Din Ardabili, recorded by Pirzada, are listed under the title &quot;Talysh poems of Razhi&quot;.
The Azeri language of the quatrains of Sheikh Sefi ad-Din was studied by B. V. Miller, who, in the course of his research, concluded that the dialect of the Ardebil people and the Ardabil region is the language of the ancestors of the modern Talysh, but already in the first half of the 14th century.
Only a very few verses of Safi al-Din&#x27;s poetry, called &quot;Dobayti&quot;s (&quot;double verses&quot;), have survived. Written in Old Azeri and Persian, they have linguistic importance today.

<doc id="939950" wikidata="Q2778973" url="?curid=939950" title="River Darent">
<text>The Darent is a Kentish tributary of the River Thames and takes the waters of the River Cray as a tributary in the tidal portion of the Darent near Crayford. &#x27;Darenth&#x27; is frequently found as the spelling of the river&#x27;s name in older books and maps, Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Canals and River of England&quot; being one example. Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer&quot; (1954) demonstrates that &quot;Darent&quot; means &quot;clear water&quot;, a result of it springing from and running through chalk. The purity of the water was a major factor in the development of paper and pharmaceuticals in the area.

Darenth Parish (through which the river flows) derives from a Celtic phrase &#x27;stream where oak-trees grow&#x27; (Irish: &quot;dair&quot; = &#x27;oak-tree&#x27;, &quot;abha&quot; = river)(compare e.g.&quot;Derwent&quot;). The landscapes of the valley were painted in a visionary manner by the Victorian artist Samuel Palmer during the mid-1800s.

Fed by springs from the greensand hills south of Westerham in Kent and below Limpsfield Chart in Surrey, the Darent flows east then north by Otford and Shoreham, past the castle and the ruined Roman villa at Lullingstone, then by Eynsford, Farningham, Horton Kirby, South Darenth, Sutton-at-Hone, Darenth, and eventually to Dartford, whence it proceeds a final two miles as a tidal estuary until it drops into the Thames at Long Reach.

North of Dartford, the Darent is tidal and, just before entering the Thames, receives the waters of the River Cray at Dartford &amp; Crayford Marshes where the rivers form administrative boundaries between Greater London and Kent, (specifically, the London Borough of Bexley and the Kentish borough of Dartford). The Darent enters Long Reach to the east of Crayford Ness.

Kent County Council has signposted a walking route along the Darent between the Greensand Hills above Sevenoaks and the Thames and named it the Darent Valley Path. The route receives no obvious attention from councils or &#x27;focus&#x27; groups although all or part is used by joggers, cyclists, walkers, dog walkers and curious adventurers, availing themselves of the Darent Valley Path to access or view the river&#x27;s amenities, such as they are. This lack of attention is being addressed in the tidal section by a group of concerned locals, the &quot;Friends of Dartford and Crayford Creeks&quot;. , a trust was being formed to promote regeneration and give formal recognition to the protection of this valuable public amenity.

==Dartford and Crayford Creek==
Currently the tidal section is being furbished and improved by volunteers of &quot;Friends of Dartford and Crayford Creek&quot; to permit marine traffic, such as narrowboats and leisure cruisers to sail up to Steam Crane Wharf and beyond, to overnight or stay awhile. Much mud was laid down by river and tide from 1986 when the Creek was effectively abandoned. The tops of some mudbanks are now some two metres high; while others would need only minimal adjustment to accommodate the movement and docking of largish craft with no impact on the nature of the river. Work parties surveyed, cleared and removed hazardous debris from the river bed to permit safe passage of all types of craft during low water. Volunteers and lengthsmen removed a number of self-seeded trees, lopped others and removed debris from the banks. The trust (termed Dartford and Crayford Restoration Trust) is an offshoot of the Northfleet Harbour Restoration Trust.

==Boats in the Creek==

In April 2015 a narrowboat arrived in Dartford Creek, with a crew of four canal skippers, to establish the feasibility of canal-boats visiting and by extension boats from the Medway, the non-tidal Thames and various sailing clubs along the Thames estuary. This was the first time in over forty years that a registered ship lay over in Dartford Creek.

&quot;Pentargon&quot; (SSR160910) returned in June 2015, familiarising more canalboat skippers, and stayed until October. Weeks of tide-waiting established a &#x27;sailor&#x27;s knowledge base&#x27; for future visits. During the period, the boat rested on a berm near the lock, accessible only at spring tides. Upon its departure, the feasibility of both creeks for access and dallying by a range of craft had been established.

&quot;Pentargon&quot; was the first boat to undertake an overnight stay in the creek with crew on board since the late 1970s. To facilitate her tying up on first arrival volunteers dug away forty years of neglect and inertia to provide a clean quayside and temporary mooring in the lock. This work was extended in 2016 by a volunteer lengthsman Hugh Nesbitt. who is a skilled amateur archaeologist. In February 2016, Network Rail engineers removed trees at the top of Crayford Creek, re-establishing access to the &quot;End of Navigation&quot;. Crayford Creek is considered capable of development for masted craft unable to proceed to Dartford because of Bob Dunn Bridge.

Dartford library and museum provides a wealth of evidence that both creeks have been used for trade since pre-Roman times. Trade reached a modern zenith during the Industrial revolution and beyond. In 1835, almost was carried in or out, servicing and supporting considerable industrial activity. Navigational factors meant that single cargoes were limited to even on spring tides. A ship canal was proposed in the early 1800s but failed to achieve momentum. In 1839 a new proposal achieved an Act of Parliament allowing development to proceed and tolls were levied from completion in 1844. The work included straightening, dredging and shortening the navigation.


== Dartford Creek Tidal Flood Barrier ==
On Dartford Creek, close to its junction with the Thames, is the Dartford Creek Tidal Flood Barrier with two drop-leaf gates, which may be lowered if the sea threatens to inundate the land. The barrier is managed by the Environment Agency.

== Roman Connection ==
Dartford (Domesday Book &quot;Tarentefort&quot;) was a major fording place on Watling Street. Research by Woodlands Junior School indicates that the ford existed even before the Roman period. Tarentefort itself flourished through the Roman period AD50 - AD 450. A ferry controlled by a hermit was established c.1235 and survived until 1518, long after the first bridge was constructed during the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413). That bridge survived into the 1700s.

== Historic and pre-historic ==
Today&#x27;s river is not much more than a stream apart from in conditions of spate, a surprise given the breadth of the valley it runs through. The &quot;proto-Darent&quot; was much larger than today&#x27;s trickle but the River Medway, through erosion of the soft chalk and clays of the North Downs/Western Weald, has captured much of the headwaters which once supplied the Darent.

== Modern neglect ==

In 1989, concerned individuals realised that almost all flow through Dartford had ceased. The River Darent was later recognised officially as the &#x27;lowest flowing&#x27; river in the country. Wildlife was decimated but the reason became apparent as soon as the problem was addressed. Increasing quantities of water were being diverted by the then Rivers Authority to supply the growing greeds of adjacent towns and even London Boroughs. Since 1989, much work has been [claimed to have been] carried out to rectify this situation, including the shutting down of a number of boreholes by the Environment Agency. This is documented in Dartford Library by Environment Agency documents lodged there.

A sculpture, unveiled in 2004, celebrated the renewed life of the river, depicting the wildlife which has been saved.

==Watermills==
The River Darent powered a number of watermills. From source to mouth they are:

===Westerham (Elm View) Mill===
The miller at this corn mill in 1771 was James Marchane, who was joined by his son James. James Jr died in 1805 and James Sr died c. 1812. The mill was sketched by G. Samuel in 1818. It had an overshot waterwheel. The cast iron overshot waterwheel was by . It was fitted in 1868, replacing a wooden wheel which may have been breast shot. In 1890, the waterwheel was adapted to drive a set of pumps to supply Westerham. An average of could be supplied. The milling machinery was removed in 1936 and during the Second World War a doodlebug landed nearby and blew the roof of the mill off. The derelict building stood in April 1954, but had been demolished by July 1960.

===Darenth (Tower Wood) Mill===

This corn mill had an external cast iron overshot waterwheel carried on a wooden axle. The mill was working up to the outbreak of the First World War and demolished in the 1930s. It had two pairs of millstones.

===Squerryes (Spring Shaw) Mill, Westerham===

Squerryes, or Spring Shaw Mill was a corn mill with a cast iron overshot waterwheel some diameter and wide. The mill was marked as disused on the 1895 6&quot; Ordnance Survey map. It was a small building of square and had been demolished by 1955. Little is known of the machinery except that the upright shaft was wooden and of diameter. The wooden great spur wheel was of compass arm construction.

===Valence Pump, Brasted===

This water powered pump was driven by a cast iron high breast shot waterwheel of by . A diameter cast iron spur geared pitwheel drove two ram pumps. The pump dated from 1858 and was still in existence in 1980.

===Brasted Mill===
This was a corn mill, now converted to a dwelling. The cast iron breast shot waterwheel was by . In September 1812, James Weight, miller of Brasted, was claiming relief for himself, his wife and five children. A man by the name of Staples who went by the name of Chapman had leased the mill in Brasted in 1812; he claimed relief in January 1815. The mill ceased work in the 1920s and the machinery was removed c. 1934.

===Sundridge Mill===

This was a paper mill. In December 1822 Nicholas Tapsfield, papermaker of Sundridge was claiming relief for himself and his wife Mary. He had been apprenticed at a paper mill at East Malling. In December 1831, Thomas Green, papermaker of Sundridge was claiming relief for himself, his wife and five children. He had been apprenticed in 1804 to William Dacie at a paper mill in Bermondsey, then to a Mr Hall in St. Mary Cray when Dacie retired. In March 1832, Henry Sparks, papermaker of Sundridge was claiming relief for himself, wife Susanna and five children. He had been apprenticed to Messrs. Smith &amp; Knight at Godalming in 1796, serving only four years. In May 1839, Henry Thomas, papermaker of Sundridge was claiming relief for himself. He had been a papermaker all his working life. The internal overshot waterwheel was by , carried on an oak axle. Sundridge Mill produced paper for the Bank of England until its closure in 1901, business being transferred to Eynsford Paper Mill. The mill buildings were converted to a laundry, and the waterwheel was removed c. 1914 to be replaced by steam power. The mill was demolished in October 1969.

===Chipstead Mill, Chevening===

Chipstead Mill was a four-storey building which had been enlarged in the late 19th century. It worked until after the Second World War, but the machinery had been removed by 1950. The waterwheel was overshot and drove two pairs of French Burr millstones. A steam engine provided auxiliary power until it was replaced by a suction gas engine. Roller milling plant had been installed in the 1890s but milling ceased in the 1920s. The mill building was standing in the 1980s.

===Longford Mill, Dunton Green===

This was a corn mill rebuilt by Weeks of Maidstone in 1859, it had an internal cast iron overshot waterwheel by , which had probably replaced a breast shot waterwheel of larger diameter. The waterwheel drove three pairs of millstones. Electricity replaced water power between the wars, and the mill last worked in 1947. The stones of the mill were said to have been caused to run backwards at one time through the mill being bewitched. The mill drove three pairs of millstones, the machinery being mostly of cast iron. The mill building survived until 1987 when the site was redeveloped.

===Otford Mill===

There was a watermill in Otford in 1541. The last mill on this site was a corn mill with two waterwheels. It was latterly used as a saw mill and burnt down on 7 January 1924. A picture of the mill can be seen here. The breastshot waterwheel remained in 1930. One waterwheel was of wood construction, driving three pairs of French Burr millstones and one pair of Peak millstones. The machinery was all wooden. The second waterwheel was of cast iron, driving two pairs of French Burr stones vis cast iron machinery.

===Upper Mill, Shoreham===

This was a corn mill. Originally powered by an internal breast shot waterwheel of some by driving one pair of French Burr millstones and one pair of Peak millstones. The great spur wheel was a cast iron wheel with wooden cogs. The waterwheel had been replaced by a turbine which drove the millstones via a great spur wheel that was only diameter. The mill was house converted in 1971.

===Lower (Shoreham Paper) Mill, Shoreham===

This was the site of a fulling mill belonging to Palsters Manor. It was bought by the Passele family in the 14th century. The manor passed to Francis Sandbach in 1578 and was willed to John Polhill. He bought the fulling mill in 1602. The last mill on the site was a paper mill; it was demolished in 1936. The low breast shot waterwheel was by . It drove machinery via a layshaft driven from the spur geared pitwheel. The mill was demolished in the 1930s. The paper mill had been run for over 200 years by the Wilmot family.

===Wood Mill, Eynsford===

Although it is said that this mill, which stood just downstream of Eynsford Bridge, was a corn mill with an undershot waterwheel other evidence shows this to have been a water powered saw mill which had been erected c. 1853. It may have stood on the site of an earlier mill.

===Old Mill, Eynsford===

This was a corn mill. It stands immediately downstream of the bridge by Eynsford ford. The low breast shot waterwheel was diameter in 1887, being replaced by one of at least diameter. It was wide. The millstones were only diameter, suggesting that only a limited amount of flour was available. The mill was working until 1911, no auxiliary power being used. The building was house converted in the 1920s and survives today.

===Eynsford Paper Mill===

This paper mill was founded in 1648 by Huguenot refugees. The paper mill replaced an earlier corn mill. In 1882, it is recorded as having a waterwheel by . The mill suffered two fires in the 20th century but was rebuilt. It was working until 1952 but has now been demolished.

===Farningham Mill===

A mill has been on this site since Domesday. In the 15th century the mill was in the possession of the Roper family, Sir Anthony Roper being charged with &quot;pulling down and allowing the watermill to decay and become uninhabited&quot; in 1636. He was ordered to rebuild the mill within two years. The present building built by the Colyers dates to c.1780. The mill was a corn mill; the converted building survives. A curious feature is that the door on the north side of the east face is painted on, to look symmetrical with the real door. The mill was latterly worked by a turbine which drove a saw mill in its final years of operation. The mill last worked for trade in 1900.

===Franks Generating Station, Horton Kirby===

This installation was of the late 19th century. A turbine drove a generating plant to provide electricity to Franks Hall. After it ceased to be used, the turbine is said to have been installed in Westminster Mill.

===Westminster Mill, Horton Kirby===
This was a corn mill which stood upstream of the paper mill. Henry Knight was a miller in Horton who died in 1724 and Thomas Welch was a miller in Horton who died in 1734. George Cannon took the mill in the early 1830s. In 1843 he was bankrupt as a common brewer, an occupation he carried on along with the mill. Ill health forced his retirement in 1852, and the mill was bought by his brother Stephen. His son, also Stephen, was running Old Mill from 1850, then being 14 years old. Stephen Cannon (father) died in 1872 and Stephen Cannon (son) sold Westminster Mill and Old Mill in order to concentrate the milling business at a mill in Bexley. Latterly the waterwheel was replaced by a turbine and the mill generated electricity. The mill burnt down when struck by lightning in 1908 and was rebuilt as a factory which made shoe laces. The factory closed down in 1991 and the mill has been demolished and the site redeveloped as housing.

===Hawley Mills, Sutton at Hone===

A site mentioned in Domesday, the mills here were held by the manor of Bignoures and belonged to the Knights of St. John in the Middle Ages, being let at a peppercorn rent to the Prioress of Dartford Nunnery. A wheat mill and a malt mill were released to one George Tasser in 1534. William Vaughan received them from the Crown in 1546 and the mills reverted to the Crown when he died in 1580. The two mills were granted to John Spilman (later Sir John Spilman) by the Crown in 1581.

In 1588, Spilman converted the corn mill into a paper mill, and obtained a monopoly for his paper by manipulating the favour and patronage of successive monarchs. Thomas Churchyard wrote a long poem in 1588, the first description of the papermaking process. Spielman employed 600 men, mainly Germans. The mills remained in the Spilman family until 1679, then a Mr Blackman was the owner in 1686 but he was bankrupt by 1739. Messrs. Pike and Edsall purchased the mill and converted it into a gunpowder mill.There were explosions here in 1745, 1790, 1795, 1796, 1799 and 1833. These killed at least forty people. Edsall went bankrupt in 1778 and the mills were purchased by Messrs Pigou and Andrews. The mill was a papermill by 1840, when William Wiggins was the owner.

The malt mill was not required by Spilman, and he leased it to Godfrey Box of Liège. He erected an iron rolling and slitting mill (for the manufacture of nails; the first in England) between 1590 and 1595, which by 1758 had two waterwheels, one working the upper roller, the other working the lower rollers and a guillotine.

== Early life ==
Menounos was born to Greek immigrants on June 8, 1978, in Medford, a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Her father, Constantinos &quot;Costas&quot; Menounos, is originally from Akovos, and her mother, Stavroula &quot;Litsa&quot; (; 1954–2021), was originally from Kalamata. Menounos later worked as a janitor in the nightclub The Channel with her parents. She has a younger brother. She graduated from Medford High School in 1996.

In 1995, Menounos began to compete in beauty pageants. The following year, she won the title of Miss Massachusetts Teen USA and competed at Miss Teen USA—where she placed in the top 15, receiving an honorary mention, during the preliminary competition. She placed 13th in the preliminaries. She competed for the title of Miss Massachusetts USA 2000 and was the first runner-up.

Menounos attended Emerson College, participating there in the organization Emerson Independent Video; she graduated in 2000.

== Career ==
=== Film, television, and radio ===
During her senior year at Emerson, Menounos worked as a reporter for Channel One News. For her 10-minute segments, she traveled to El Salvador to report on the January 2001 and February 2001 earthquakes, interviewed NATO aircrew members aboard an E-3 AWACS plane during the military alliance&#x27;s Operation Eagle Assist, and interviewed President George W. Bush.

&quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; hired Menounos as a correspondent in 2002; she reported on movies, music, and fashion. She left the program in 2005 to focus on her acting career, although she joined rival program &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that fall as a correspondent. 

She went on to co-host a few episodes of the &quot;Today&quot; show in the late summer and fall of 2006 as well as in April 2007. In 2003, she appeared on the November 30 episode of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; as one of many celebrities caught in the awkward and embarrassing &quot;Red Carpet Interviews&quot;.
In 2004, Menounos appeared in an episode of the UPN series &quot;One on One&quot; as Glenda, an eccentric, self-proclaimed &quot;Fairy Godmother to the Stars&quot;. In the summer of 2005, she appeared in the comic book film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; playing a nurse romanced by the Human Torch (Chris Evans). Her likeness and voice was featured in the 2005 Electronic Arts video game &quot;James Bond 007: From Russia with Love&quot; as Eva Adara, Red Grant&#x27;s henchwoman, which stars Sean Connery as James Bond.

At the age of 17, Menounos produced &quot;In the Land of Merry Misfits&quot;, an independent film fairy tale. The 35 mm feature film was produced by Menounos while attending Emerson College with director Keven Undergaro, then head writer for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Singled Out&quot;. The negative of the film was stolen and the film was never completed but her work on the film, and the film&#x27;s director, helped her land her reporting job at Channel One News and at MTV (&quot;ET on MTV&quot;). In 2005, she personally funded the recovery and restoration of the film, which was narrated by John Waters and starred an eclectic group in the Waters vein — including former WWE champion Bob Backlund, actress Josie Davis from the TV show &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, and B-movie icon Randal Malone. The film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.

Menounos also maintains AfterBuzzTV, an online entertainment network she founded with Undergaro, for which she was named the 2014 CES Entertainment Matters Ambassador. As an actress, she had recurring roles on the CBS-TV program &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and as Jules in the second season of The CW&#x27;s &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (during its run on The WB).

For her work on &quot;Extra,&quot; Menounos won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment News Program. She was a contestant on the 14th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; partnering with Derek Hough. The couple was eliminated on May 15, 2012 placing fourth in the competition.

On March 18, 2014, Menounos&#x27; reality TV series &quot;Chasing Maria Menounos&quot; premiered on the Oxygen Network.

In May 2014, after three years of hosting &quot;Extra&quot;, Menounos left the show signing a multi-year contract with E! Entertainment to host and produce several programs. In July 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that she would replace Giuliana Rancic as the co-anchor of &quot;E! News&quot;.

<doc id="939959" wikidata="Q5091972" url="?curid=939959" title="Cherish (David Cassidy album)">
<text>Cherish is the debut solo album by American singer David Cassidy, produced by Wes Farrell and released by Bell Records in early 1972.

== Recording ==
Cassidy had come to prominence via the TV series &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and had sung lead on several hit singles and successful albums under the group moniker. Being underage at 19 upon being signed to &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and during the first season of the show, Cassidy was on a flat-rate contract with Columbia Pictures and earned no royalties from recordings issued under the Partridge Family name on the Columbia-owned Bell label. However, upon reaching the age of 21 during the hiatus before Season 2 began production in April 1971, Cassidy was able to renegotiate his contract to include payment of royalties for sales of recordings and merchandise, as well as gaining a degree of input into, and control over, his recording career.

&quot;Cherish&quot; was designed as a project by Partridge Family musical producer Wes Farrell to break Cassidy out as a solo star via material not directly connected to the TV series. The album was recorded during the second half of 1971 with essentially the same musicians and technicians who had worked on earlier Partridge Family recordings, but with the aim of giving Cassidy a more mature sound than he had been able to display via the Partridge Family, and more personal material with which to work. Regular Farrell associates Tony Romeo and Adam Miller contributed three tracks each, while Kin Vassy – at the time a member of The First Edition featuring Kenny Rogers – penned the dramatic ballad &quot;My First Night Alone Without You&quot;, a track which was subsequently covered by a number of other artists including Dionne Warwick and Bonnie Raitt. The album also includes the Cassidy-penned track &quot;Ricky&#x27;s Tune&quot;, reportedly a homage to a recently deceased pet dog.

== Release ==
Cassidy&#x27;s first solo single, released in October 1971 while recording of the album was still in progress, was the title track, a cover of The Association&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart topper, said to have been chosen as the lead single by Farrell after a search for a song which would be instantly familiar to audiences, but had not yet been the subject of any widely known cover version. The single peaked at No.9 in December 1971 (No.1 Adult Contemporary), and was followed by the U.S. release of the album in early February 1972, along with a second single &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot;. The single stalled at No.37, but the album was generally favorably received and sold well, reaching No.15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In the United Kingdom, where the Partridge Family was just beginning to catch on (the TV series did not start to air there until December 1971), &quot;Cherish&quot; was released in March 1972. It was decided to release &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot; as a Double A-side, which quickly rose to No.2, with &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot; receiving the majority of airplay on radio stations. The album also took off. It climbed to No.2 and remained in the Top 40 for 43 weeks. This marked the start of a 3-year period in which Cassidy became one of the biggest record-sellers and a pre-eminent teen idol in the U.K. and Australia (where &quot;Cherish&quot; hit No.1) at the same time as his sales in the U.S. were falling. In March 1973 (following two successful singles from Cassidy&#x27;s second album &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;) the UK fan-favorite &quot;I Am a Clown&quot; with its memorable spoken introduction was belatedly issued as a single, and reached No.3.

&quot;Cherish&quot; was deleted from catalogs in the late 1970s, and for many years remained available only via second-hand markets. The album was finally remastered and issued on CD through Arista in 2000, and remains in print. The reputation of &quot;Cherish&quot; is largely positive, with Allmusic&#x27;s Lindsay Planer describing the album as &quot; Overall...an admirable first time out and, above all, [it] continues to display the vocalist&#x27;s theatrical sensibilities and performance style.&quot;.

<text>New Zealand Idol, also known as NZ Idol, was the New Zealand version of the &quot;Idol&quot; series which originated in the United Kingdom as &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. New Zealand first saw the &quot;Idol&quot; format when TV2 aired &quot;American Idol 2&quot;, which garnered impressive ratings. After &quot;Australian Idol&quot; also received good ratings in New Zealand, TVNZ decided to order the first season of &quot;NZ Idol&quot;, which was broadcast on TV2. After the third season in 2006, TVNZ made a decision not to fund or broadcast a fourth season.

NZ Idol was produced by South Pacific Pictures in association with Grundy Television and developed by Fremantle Media.

==Season one==
The show was hosted by TV presenter Dominic Bowden and the panel of judges consisted of Frankie Stevens, Fiona McDonald and Paul Ellis. The first episode was watched by over 1.15 million viewers.

The competition was tough in the final few rounds of NZ Idol but it was finally whittled down to the top ten. Nine of these were voted in by the public through three heats (Camillia Temple, Ben Lummis and Filipo Saipani; Michael Murphy, Luke Whaanga and &#x27;Big&#x27; Dave Houma; Robin Johnson, Sela Mahe and Eddie Gaiger). Jessie Cassin was added by the judges as a wildcard. Ben Lummis eventually won the competition despite being in the bottom 3 in the first, third and fourth round of the competition, while Michael Murphy who eventually came second in the season had not been in the bottom 3 at all. Camillia Temple, the oldest contestant at 28, who had been a favourite to win, ended up in third place.

Ben Lummis released his idol-winning single &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away&quot; which spent 7 weeks at #1, selling over 40,000 units. His Album &#x27;One Road&#x27; debuted at #1 on the album charts, selling over 30,000 copies. His second single, &quot;I Love You Love Me&quot; failed to make radio playlists and the single was shelved. His video for the single, however, did play on video music channels.

==Season two==
Auditions for the second series of &quot;NZ Idol&quot; began in June 2005. The show was once again hosted by Dominic Bowden, with Jackie Clarke replacing Fiona McDonald, who was pregnant with her first child, as one of the three judges. The nine that got in by public vote were: Nik Carlson, Frank Andrews, Jesse O&#x27;Brien, Rosita Vai, Rongo Brightwell, Keshia Paulse and Shelley Paikea. Teresa Bergman, failed to make the top nine, eventually being asked back by the judges in the wildcard, and winning the wildcard vote. Keshia Paulse, who was one of the favourites to win the competition, was voted out unexpectedly in the second round. Rosita Vai was the eventual winner of &quot;NZ Idol&quot; 2 and the first female contestant to win the competition. Rosita had not been in the bottom 3 in the whole season. Nik Carlson from Masterton came second, while Steven Broad finished in third place.

Rosita released her single &quot;All I Ask&quot; which spent two weeks at #1 and went platinum. However her debut album &quot;Golden&quot; only reached #15 without being certified and spent only three weeks in the top 40 album chart.

In 2006 Ashley Cooper has enjoyed success with her single &quot;I Want You&quot; debuting at #19, eventually peaking at #11 on physical sales and very little airplay. Also in 2006, Robert Arnold, who had auditioned unsuccessfully for all three seasons made it to #1 in the New Zealand charts as part of Boyband – a radio station stunt – three weeks before Matt Saunoa hit the top.

While these singers got to high places, there were many wannabe applicants that did poorly. One of note was a certain Liz Shaw, who came not just to audition but to also try to take over host Dominic Bowden&#x27;s presenting job, only to spectacularly fail.

The series once again proved a ratings hit in New Zealand, but Sony BMG were reportedly unhappy with the format and reviewed their role in the program.

==Season three==

The third (and to date, last) season of &quot;NZ Idol&quot; began screening in July 2006. Dominic Bowden returned as host, and judges Paul Ellis and Jackie Clarke were replaced by Iain Stables, a popular radio DJ from the ZM radio station, and Megan Alatini, a former member of girlgroup TrueBliss, the first band created from the popular TV show Popstars. This left Frankie Stevens as the only original judge. In addition to a recording contract, in series 3 contestestants are also in the running for a cash prize of $50,000 and a Daihatsu SUV. The maximum age limit to enter was increased from 28 to 30. Another key difference in the third season is the inclusion of a live band in the top ten shows. On 31 May 2006, South Pacific Pictures announced that SonyBMG was to discontinue its association with &quot;NZ Idol&quot;.

On 21 August the top 9 was officially announced. Aroha Robinson, Ashlee Fisher, Clinton Randell, Indira Moala, Kali Kopae, Matthew Saunoa, Rebecca Wright, Victor Sulfa and Toni Baird. On the same night the 3 wildcards were announced. The host, Dominic Bowden stated that the viewers had 12 hours to choice their 10th person to make up the final 10. The 3 wildcards were: Ben Hazlewood, Lenken Isaac and Wiremu Hohaia. On 22 August Ben Hazlewood won the wildcard vote. It had been announced that the top 10 was not going to release a single, like previous seasons.

On 29 October Matt Saunoa won the competition without falling into the bottom 2/ 3 throughout the whole season. Although betting agency Centrebet had Indira Moala favourite to win . His debut single &quot;Hold Out&quot; was written by James Reid from The Feelers. The single charted at #1 in the first week, but failed to reach gold status (at least 5,000 copies sold), and dropped the following week to #3.

==Pop&#x27;s Ultimate Star==
Many previous contestants later appeared on &quot;Pop&#x27;s Ultimate Star&quot;, along with other New Zealand celebrities.

==Criticism==
Critics have suggested that contestants in all seasons have not been as musically strong as Idol performers from American Idol or Australian Idol, and have referred to the performances as &#x27;karaoke&#x27;.

Complaints have been made in regards to a variety of production issues including the lack of a live band in seasons one and two, the lighting and the sound quality.

Concerns have also been expressed about the apparent lack of ongoing opportunities for Idols after the show. Three months after winning New Zealand Idol, Lummis&#x27; music label, Sony BMG dropped him.

Various New Zealand musicians have openly criticised the show, and refused invitations to appear on it. Boh Runga stated that she &quot;would rather lick the inside of a toilet bowl than appear on Idol.&quot; TV Guide stated after the third series aired that the show had lost around 100,000 viewers since the first series, and that &quot;if NZ Idol was a horse, you would have to shoot it. It really is that lame.&quot;

<text>Prakriti ( ) is &quot;the original or natural form or condition of anything, original or primary substance&quot;. It is a key concept in Hinduism, formulated by its &quot;Sāṅkhya&quot; school, where it does not refer to matter or nature, but &quot;includes all the cognitive, moral, psychological, emotional, sensorial and physical aspects of reality&quot;, stressing &quot;&quot;Prakṛti&quot;&#x27;s cognitive, mental, psychological and sensorial activities&quot;. &quot;Prakriti&quot; has three different innate qualities (&quot;guṇas&quot;), whose equilibrium is the basis of all observed empirical reality as the five panchamahabhootas namely Akasha, Vayu, Agni, Jala, Pruthvi. &quot;Prakriti&quot;, in this school, contrasts with &quot;Puruṣa&quot;, which is pure awareness and metaphysical consciousness. The term is also found in the texts of other Indian religions such as Jainism and Buddhism.

==Etymology and meaning==
&quot;Prakriti&quot; (Sanskrit: प्रकृति) is an early Indic concept meaning &quot;making or placing before or at first, the original or natural form or condition of anything, original or primary substance&quot;. The term is discussed by Yāska (~600 BCE) in &quot;Nirukta&quot;, and is found in numerous Hindu texts. It connotes &quot;nature, body, matter, phenomenal universe&quot; in Hindu texts.

According to Dan Lusthaus,
== &quot;Pancha Prakriti&quot; ==
In Indian languages derived from Sanskrit roots, &quot;Prakriti&quot; refers to the feminine aspect of all life forms, and more specifically a woman is seen as a symbol of &quot;Prakriti&quot;.

In Hinduism, the concept of &quot;Prakriti&quot; is thoroughly mentioned. According to Sanskrit scriptures, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Devi Mahatmya and Devi Bhagavata Purana, five Hindu goddesses are considered as the complete feminine personification of &quot;Prakriti&quot; – Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati, Gayatri and Radha. Together these five goddesses are worshiped as &quot;Pancha Prakriti&quot;.

==Application in Indian philosophy==

In the &quot;Sāṅkhya&quot; and Yoga philosophical literatures, it is contrasted with &quot;Purusha&quot; (spirit, consciousness), and &quot;Prakriti&quot; refers to &quot;the material world, nature, matter, physical and psychological character, constitution, temper, disposition&quot;. According to Knut Jacobsen, in the dualistic system of the Samkhya school, &quot;&quot;Purusha&quot; is the principle of pure consciousness, while &quot;Prakriti&quot; is the principle of matter&quot;, where &quot;Purusha&quot; is the conscious witness in every living being, while &quot;Prakriti&quot; is the manifest world.

In Hindu cosmology, &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is the feminine aspect of existence, the personified will and energy of the Supreme (Brahman); while in Shaktism, the Goddess is presented as both the Brahman and the &quot;Prakṛti&quot;. In Samkhya-Yoga texts, &quot;Prakriti&quot; is the potency that brings about evolution and change in the empirical universe. It is described in &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; as the &quot;primal motive force&quot;. It is the essential constituent of the universe and is at the basis of all the activity of the creation.

In Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is one of the six substances &quot;(dravya)&quot;. The &quot;guṇas&quot; (qualities) are the attributes of primordial Nature (&quot;Prakṛti&quot;), and not its constituents, unlike &quot;Sāṅkhya&quot;. These qualities are inseparable from &quot;Prakṛti&quot;, but not identical with it and inextricably related to Ishvara. &quot;Prakṛti&quot; in Vishishtadvaita Vedanta is limited above by the eternal manifestation (&quot;nityavibhuti&quot;) whereas it&#x27;s infinite in &quot;Sāṅkhya&quot;.

According to Dvaita Vedanta, &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is the material cause (Satkaryavada) of the world.

Prakriti is closely associated with the concept of &quot;Maya&quot; within Hindu texts.

In Jainism the term &quot;Prakriti&quot; is used in its theory of Karma, and is considered &quot;that form of matter which covers the perfections of the soul (jiva) and prevents its liberation&quot;.

According to Samkhya and the Bhagavad Gita Prakrti or Nature is composed of the three &quot;guṇas&quot; which are tendencies or modes of operation, known as &quot;rajas&quot; (creation), &quot;sattva&quot; (preservation), and &quot;tamas&quot; (destruction). &quot;Sattva&quot; encompasses qualities of goodness, light, and harmony. &quot;Rajas&quot; is associated with concepts of energy, activity, and passion; so that, depending on how it is used, it can either have a supportive or hindering effect on the evolution of the soul. &quot;Tamas&quot; is commonly associated with inertia, darkness, insensitivity. Souls who are more Tamasic are considered imbued in darkness and take the longest to reach liberation.

In Samkhya, &quot;prakriti&quot;, comprising the three &quot;gunas&quot;, exists in equilibrium before the cosmos manifests, neutralizing each other&#x27;s properties. Samkhya argues that the complex and purposeful nature of the world suggests that it exists for the sake of something else, particularly the conscious souls. This view suggests that &quot;prakriti&quot;, though unconscious, serves to aid the liberation of the soul, similar to how milk nourishes a calf.

== Bhagavad Gita ==
The Bhagavad Gita emphasize the role of &quot;prakriti&quot; as the material energy of the universe, created and controlled by God (Krishna), and its distinction from &quot;purusha&quot; in different verses. In Chapter 4 verse 6, Krishna describes &quot;prakriti&quot; as His own power, through which He manifests in the world. In Chapter 7 verse 4 and 5, Krishna mentions two types of &quot;prakriti&quot;:

In Chapter 13 verses 19–23, Krishna discusses the eternal nature of both &quot;prakriti&quot; and &quot;purusha,&quot; as well as their distinction.
== Yoga Sutras ==
In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, &quot;prakriti&quot; is described as encompassing the entire cosmos including its physical aspects. It is characterized by the three &quot;gunas&quot; - sattva, rajas, and tamas. However, the emphasis within the text primarily is on the psychological manifestations of these guṇas. &quot;Sattva&quot;, the purest &quot;guna&quot;, is associated with qualities like lucidity, tranquility, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, happiness, and peacefulness when expressed in the mind (citta). Rajas is characterized by traits like hankering, power, and various forms of movement and creative activity. Tamas is marked by qualities such as ignorance, delusion, lethargy, and disinclination toward constructive activity. These psychological attributes reveal the nature of the &quot;gunas&quot; in Yoga.

<doc id="939966" wikidata="Q49909" url="?curid=939966" title="Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer">
<text>Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE, Explorer 77, and MIDEX-0) represented the next generation, high-orbit, ultraviolet space observatory covering the wavelength range of 90.5–119.5 nanometre (nm) of the NASA operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. FUSE was launched on a Delta II launch vehicle on 24 June 1999, at 15:44:00 UTC, as a part of NASA&#x27;s Origins Program. FUSE detected light in the far ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is mostly unobservable by other telescopes. Its primary mission was to characterize universal deuterium in an effort to learn about the stellar processing times of deuterium left over from the Big Bang. FUSE resides in a low Earth orbit, approximately in altitude, with an inclination of 24.98° and a 99.80 minutes orbital period. Its Explorer program designation is Explorer 77.

== Mission ==
The primary objective of FUSE was to use high-resolution spectroscopy at far ultraviolet wavelengths to study the origin and evolution of the lightest elements (hydrogen and deuterium) created shortly after the Big Bang, and the forces and processes involved in the evolution of galaxies, stars and planetary systems. The spacecraft was launched as a joint NASA-Canada–France project. Only one previous mission, Copernicus (OAO-3), has given this far-ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, FUSE will provide sensitivity some ten thousand times greater than Copernicus.

=== FUSE primary and extended missions ===
The first 3.5 years of FUSE operations were dubbed the Primary Mission. During this period, the observing time on FUSE was shared roughly 50–50 between the FUSE science team and a host of Guest investigators, astronomers from around the world selected by NASA to participate in the FUSE program. Starting 1 April 2003, the FUSE project entered an extended phase of operations which lasted until mid-2007. With funding from NASA, the FUSE satellite continued to be operated as an observatory for the broad astronomical community, with 100% of on-orbit observing time selected by NASA peer review. Some 29 million seconds of science data were obtained during the Primary Mission phase, and a total of nearly 65 million seconds of data were archived from the entire mission. The Extended Mission period presented a number of challenges, especially for satellite operations. Many procedures had to be automated, allowing the project to cut back on staffing and minimize operations costs. As one example, the Satellite Control Center was staffed around the clock during the Prime Mission but transitioned to a 16-hour per day, Monday through Friday staffing profile in the Extended Mission. Less redundancy and less access to ongoing engineering support were consistent with NASA policy for missions in their extended phase, where a higher level of risk is allowed.

== Spacecraft ==
The FUSE satellite consists of two primary sections, the spacecraft and the science instrument. The spacecraft contains all of the elements necessary for powering and pointing the satellite, including the Attitude Control System, the solar panels, and communications-electronics and antennas. The observatory is approximately long with a baffle fully deployed.

== Instrument ==
The FUSE science instrument consists of four co-aligned telescope mirrors (~ clear aperture) based on a Rowland circle design. The light from the four optical channels is dispersed by four spherical, aberration-corrected holographic diffraction gratings, and recorded by two delay-line microchannel plate detectors. Two channels with silicon carbide (SiC) coatings cover the range 90.5–110 nm and two channels with lithium fluoride (LiF) coatings cover the range 100–119.5 nm. Actuators on the mirror mountings kept the focus to 90% encircled energy within 1.5&quot;. A Fine Error Sensor (FES) with a 21&#x27; square field maintained the spacecraft pointing stability to 0.5 arcseconds.

Each mirror has a corresponding astigmatism-corrected, holographically-ruled diffraction grating, each one on a curved substrate so as to produce four Rowland circle spectrographs. The dispersed ultraviolet light is detected by two microchannel plate detector intensified double delay-line detectors, whose surfaces are curved to match the curvature of the focal plane.

== Operations ==
The FUSE observatory was designed for an operational lifetime of three years, although it was hoped that it might remain operational for as long as ten years. NASA since recommended an additional two-year extension beyond the prime mission. FUSE was controlled through a primary ground station antenna located at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. FUSE brought it over the ground station for less than 10 minutes at a time (on average) for about six or seven orbits in a row, followed by roughly seven or eight orbits without contact. Hence, the satellite had to operate on its own most of the time, moving from target to target, identifying star fields, centering objects in the spectrograph apertures, and performing the observations. The scientific data, which was stored in digital form, was radioed to the ground during contact with the ground station.

FUSE Science Operations were on hold from 10 December 2001, to approximately the end of January 2002, due to a problem with the pointing system. The last operational reaction wheel on FUSE stopped on 12 July 2007. Attempts to restart any of the reaction wheels were unsuccessful. Although the telescope itself remained in excellent condition, the satellite was incapable thereafter of the fine pointing control required to acquire useful science data, and the mission was terminated.

== Science results ==
Over 400 scientific papers have been written using data from FUSE, with subjects ranging from cool stars to the intergalactic medium. One of the primary science goals of FUSE was to study the abundance of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. Because of the large number of atomic absorption and emission lines in the far-ultraviolet, FUSE enabled many studies of galactic, extragalactic, and intergalactic chemistry and chemical evolution.

== Impacts ==
Canada credits work on the FUSE as helping them prepare for making the fine guidance sensors instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. Canada&#x27;s contribution is called FGS/NIRISS and is a combined Fine Guidance Sensor, spectrograph, and Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph.

==Results==
===Bracket===
===First round===


===Semi-finals===
There were no playoffs for third place, so the losers of the semi-finals received bronze medals.
----
===Extra match===
A match between the two continental teams took place between the semifinals and the final. 

Given both France and Germany had lost in the first round, this extra match was a &quot;de facto&quot; fifth and sixth place playoff match, though the official report makes no mention of this.

===Final===
The official report ceases its description of the game after England took the lead 5–1, saying only that &quot;by this time England had taken control of the game and won with eight goals to one&quot;.

<doc id="939972" wikidata="Q7354572" url="?curid=939972" title="Rock Me Baby (album)">
<text>Rock Me Baby is the second solo album release from David Cassidy. It was produced by Wes Farrell for Bell Records, and released in 1972. The album introduced some rock, soul and R&amp;B flavors in a calculated move by Cassidy to expand beyond his teen idol image. AllMusic&#x27;s Al Campbell wrote that the blue-eyed soul album was officially produced by Farrell, but the song selections and styles showed that Cassidy was also making decisions.

Cassidy&#x27;s cover of the Young Rascals song &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot; was included in the album, having peaked at number 3 on the US Adult Contemporary chart in June 1972 and #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It enjoyed greater success in the UK, holding number 1 status for two weeks in September.

The album&#x27;s title track gained US airplay in early September 1972, rising to number 38 in mid-October. It was the album&#x27;s high-energy opening track, a dip into brash glam rock. Following on &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; heels, the album climbed to number 41 in the US through November–December, and then it entered the UK album charts very strongly at number 2 in late February 1973, starting a 17-week run for a total of 20 weeks on the chart.

The album contains one song written by Cassidy called &quot;Two Time Loser&quot;, and a song he co-wrote with Kim Carnes titled &quot;Song for a Rainy Day&quot;. The song &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; was recorded around the same time by UK group Brotherhood of Man, but they shelved their release when Cassidy had a hit with it.

The album was reissued on Compact Disc by Arista Records in 2003.

<doc id="939983" wikidata="Q285286" url="?curid=939983" title="Bran Van 3000">
<text>Bran Van 3000 (also known as BV3) is a Canadian alternative rock and hip hop collective from Montreal, Quebec. Founded by James Di Salvio and E.P. Bergen, they collaborated on a number of songs with Stéphane Moraille, Sara Johnston, Steve &quot;Liquid&quot; Hawley, Jayne Hill, Jean Leloup, Kim Bingham, Pierre-Luc Cerat and many other musicians.

The name of the group is derived etymologically from Swedish liquor Brännvin, a general term referring to any type of distilled spirit. The name originated as a joke associated with the taupe-coloured Volkswagen Camper Van owned by Bergen in the mid-1990s which was said to run solely on bran flakes, brännvin and brand recognition when carrying the artists on tour around Canada.

Between 1996 and 2016, Bran Van 3000 was among the Top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada.

==History==
===1994–1996: Formation===
In 1994, James Di Salvio had received a royalty cheque for work on a remix he had done on a track for Quebec songwriter Jean Leloup, and invited his friend E.P. Bergen to &quot;come help him spend the money&quot; in New York. Di Salvio was a video director and asked E.P. to teach him how to produce tracks with a sampler and turntables; in the process, they created Bran Van 3000. E.P. returned to Montreal and co-wrote/produced a single with Leloup called &quot;Johnny Go&quot;; E.P. invited James to record his first ever rap on that song. It later went to number one on the Quebec charts. Di Salvio also directed the music video.

James and E.P. went back to New York to record &quot;Forest&quot; and &quot;La Chambre&quot; for Leloup&#x27;s album &quot;Le Dôme&quot;. These tracks were very successful (the album went platinum); for BV3, this led to a record deal with Audiogram Records. Together with Haig V, they co-produced the first BV3 album, for which Leloup donated the song &quot;Forest&quot;. Bergen started a cover of Cum On Feel the Noize with plans to have Sara Johnston sing on it, but Di Salvio discovered Steve &quot;Liquid&quot; Hawley. In 1996, when the album was almost finished, James and E.P. sent a demo of the songs &quot;Drinking In LA&quot;, &quot;Couch Surfer&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot; to the Canadian Music Week contest. Bran Van 3000 tied for first place with Jack Rustle, but was disqualified because there was no real band to perform the showcase. They finished the album and put together a touring band that included Gary Mackenzie, Nick Hynes and Rob Joanisse.

===1996–1999: &quot;Glee&quot;===
Bran Van 3000 finally released their first single, &quot;Drinking in L.A.&quot;, in February 1997 in Canada. It peaked at number 35 on Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart on July 28. In April of that year, the band released their first album, &quot;Glee&quot;. The record went gold and at the Juno Awards of 1998, won a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album. BV3 was nominated for Best New Group and &quot;Drinking in L.A.&quot; was nominated for Single of the Year. &quot;Glee&quot; contained 17 tracks, with &quot;Forest&quot; in French and featuring Leloup. &quot;Afrodiziak&quot;, produced by E.P. Bergen. sold 100,000 copies in Germany and appeared in the movie XChange. The song &quot;Everywhere&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and &quot;Drinking in L.A.&quot; was featured in the soundtrack to &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;. &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une chanson&quot; (later &quot;Une chanson&quot;) contains the main melody of &quot;Perfect&quot;, a song from The The.

In March 1998, &quot;Glee&quot; was released internationally, albeit with some changes: &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une chanson&quot; became an instrumental simply called &quot;Une chanson&quot;; the French song, &quot;Forest&quot;, was reworked with several English verses. The international version has 19 tracks. Previously unreleased songs were &quot;Rainshine&quot;, &quot;Carry On&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot;.

After signing with Capitol Records, Bran Van 3000 began a massive touring schedule. It started across Canada, then zigzagged across the United States. The played the H.O.R.D.E. festival, Endfest; in Europe, they opened for Massive Attack, Björk and Pulp and, back in Quebec, for Moby.

In May 1998, &quot;Drinking in L.A.&quot; reached number 34 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming their first transatlantic hit. In August 1999 the single was re-released after the song was featured in a popular TV commercial for Rolling Rock and peaked at number 3 in the UK.

===2000–2002: &quot;Discosis&quot;===
In the summer of 2001, Bran Van 3000 released the album &quot;Discosis&quot;. The song &quot;Astounded&quot; featured the final recorded performance from soul legend Curtis Mayfield and became the most successful Canadian single by the collective, reaching number 3 on the Canadian Singles Chart. Other collaborators on the album were Senegalese singer Youssou N&#x27;Dour and reggae artist Eek-a-Mouse. The song &quot;Go Shopping&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the Mexican film &quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot;. A remix of the song &quot;The Answer&quot; was done by the Latch Brothers and was featured in the 2002 video game, &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;.

===2006–2007: &quot;Rosé&quot;===
BV3&#x27;s third album, &quot;Rosé&quot;, was released in Canada on October 30 and in the US on November 27, 2007. &quot;Rosé&quot; was co-produced by James Di Salvio and Sara Johnston with the collaboration of Fatlip, Max-A-Million, Swanza, Chris Opperman, Noel Osborne and others. The album was written in Los Angeles and was recorded at Depeche Mode&#x27;s studio and in Hollywood at Steve Vai&#x27;s Studio. On July 1, 2008, the original group got back together to perform at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, in front of a crowd numbering around 180,000.

===2010–2012: &quot;The Garden&quot;===
After the death of his friend and father, Bobby Di Salvio, James got the collective back together. The album &quot;The Garden&quot; was released on October 19, 2010.

Di Salvio and parts of the group then toured through Canada, collaborating with different singers and instrumentalists like Pierre-Luc Cérat, Nick Hynes, Pascal Lepage and Stéphane Moraille. In 2015, they released the album &quot;French Garden&quot;.

On May 3, 2022, on its Facebook page, Bran Van 3000 announced an upcoming 25th anniversary tour of Canada, the US, the UK and Europe.

<text>Dreams are Nuthin&#x27; More than Wishes was David Cassidy&#x27;s third solo album release. It was released in 1973 and produced by Rick Jarrard on Bell Records. It contains some cover versions, including John Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot;, Peggy Lee&#x27;s &quot;Fever&quot; and Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Puppy Song&quot;—whose lyrics make up the album title. David Cassidy also did his version of the Partridge Family song, &quot;Summer Days&quot;.

Unique to this album is the fold out cover and the hand-written cover notes by Cassidy commenting on why he chose each song. The album made #1 on the UK album charts in 1973 and the top 20 in Australia in 1974 during Cassidy&#x27;s hectic concert tour of the continent.

<text>In cryptography, the simple XOR cipher is a type of &quot;additive cipher&quot;, an encryption algorithm that operates according to the principles:

:A formula_1 0 = A,
:A formula_1 A = 0,
:A formula_1 B = B formula_1 A,
:(A formula_1 B) formula_1 C = A formula_1 (B formula_1 C),
:(B formula_1 A) formula_1 A = B formula_1 0 = B

For example where formula_1 denotes the exclusive disjunction (XOR) operation. This operation is sometimes called modulus 2 addition (or subtraction, which is identical). With this logic, a string of text can be encrypted by applying the bitwise XOR operator to every character using a given key. To decrypt the output, merely reapplying the XOR function with the key will remove the cipher.

==Example==
The string &quot;Wiki&quot; ( in 8-bit ASCII) can be encrypted with the repeating key as follows:

And conversely, for decryption:

== Use and security ==
The XOR operator is extremely common as a component in more complex ciphers. By itself, using a constant repeating key, a simple XOR cipher can trivially be broken using frequency analysis. If the content of any message can be guessed or otherwise known then the key can be revealed. Its primary merit is that it is simple to implement, and that the XOR operation is computationally inexpensive. A simple repeating XOR (i.e. using the same key for xor operation on the whole data) cipher is therefore sometimes used for hiding information in cases where no particular security is required. The XOR cipher is often used in computer malware to make reverse engineering more difficult.

If the key is random and is at least as long as the message, the XOR cipher is much more secure than when there is key repetition within a message. When the keystream is generated by a pseudo-random number generator, the result is a stream cipher. With a key that is truly random, the result is a one-time pad, which is unbreakable in theory.

The XOR operator in any of these ciphers is vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack, since &quot;plaintext&quot; formula_1 &quot;ciphertext&quot; = &quot;key&quot;.
It is also trivial to flip arbitrary bits in the decrypted plaintext by manipulating the ciphertext.
This is called malleability.

== Usefulness in cryptography ==
The primary reason XOR is so useful in cryptography is because it is &quot;perfectly balanced&quot;; for a given plaintext input 0 or 1, the ciphertext result is equally likely to be either 0 or 1 for a truly random key bit.

The table below shows all four possible pairs of plaintext and key bits. It is clear that if nothing is known about the key or plaintext, nothing can be determined from the ciphertext alone.

Other logical operations such and AND or OR do not have such a mapping (for example, AND would produce three 0&#x27;s and one 1, so knowing that a given ciphertext bit is a 0 implies that there is a 2/3 chance that the original plaintext bit was a 0, as opposed to the ideal 1/2 chance in the case of XOR)

==Example implementation==
Example using the Python programming language.

from os import urandom
def generate_key(length: int) -&gt; bytes:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Generate encryption key.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 return urandom(length)
def xor_strings(s, t) -&gt; bytes:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Concatenate xor two strings together.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if isinstance(s, str):
 # Text strings contain single characters
 return &quot;&quot;.join(chr(ord(a) ^ b) for a, b in zip(s, t)).encode(&quot;utf8&quot;)
 else:
 # Bytes objects contain integer values in the range 0-255
 return bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(s, t)])
message = &quot;This is a secret message&quot;
print(&quot;Message:&quot;, message)

key = generate_key(len(message))
print(&quot;Key:&quot;, key)

cipherText = xor_strings(message.encode(&quot;utf8&quot;), key)
print(&quot;cipherText:&quot;, cipherText)
print(&quot;decrypted:&quot;, xor_strings(cipherText, key).decode(&quot;utf8&quot;))

# Verify
if xor_strings(cipherText, key).decode(&quot;utf8&quot;) == message:
 print(&quot;Unit test passed&quot;)
else:
 print(&quot;Unit test failed&quot;)
A shorter example using the R programming language, based on a puzzle posted on Instagram by GCHQ.

secret_key &lt;- c(0xc6, 0xb5, 0xca, 0x01) |&gt; as.raw()

secret_message &lt;- &quot;I &lt;3 Wikipedia&quot; |&gt;
 charToRaw() |&gt;
 xor(secret_key) |&gt;
 base64enc::base64encode()
secret_message_bytes &lt;- secret_message |&gt;
 base64enc::base64decode()
xor(secret_message_bytes, secret_key) |&gt; rawToChar()

<text>Aldrin is a small impact crater located on the southern part of the Mare Tranquillitatis, to the east of Sabine. It is located about 50 kilometers to the northwest of the Apollo 11 landing site, Tranquility Base. Named after Edwin Buzz Aldrin, the crater is the westernmost of a row of three craters named in honor of the Apollo 11 crew members. About 30 kilometers to the east is the landing site of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe.

This crater was previously identified as Sabine B before being named by the IAU. Sabine itself is to the west of Aldrin.

<doc id="939995" wikidata="Q5049381" url="?curid=939995" title="Cassidy Live!">
<text>Cassidy Live! was David Cassidy&#x27;s fourth solo album and final album released on Bell Records. It was released in 1974 and was recorded live in Britain. It was produced by Cassidy and Barry Ainsworth on Bell Records. The recording captures some of the mass hysteria that surrounded Cassidy&#x27;s live performances at that time. The album peaked at #9 on the UK album charts. 

&quot;Please Please Me&quot; was released as single from this album in the UK where it reached #16 on the British singles chart. The album failed to have much of an impact in the U.S. partially due to Bell Records&#x27; mid-1970s slump and that label&#x27;s scheduled transition into Arista Records the following year.

==Reception==
Writing for Allmusic, critic Dave Thompson wrote, &quot;Recorded live on his 1974 world tour, at the height (and, though nobody knew it, in the final days) of Cassidy-mania, Cassidy Live is a peculiar document, on the one hand standing as an indication of just how fierce the hysteria around the lad was, but, on the other, living proof of what a sensational showman he was.&quot; Thompson summed up his review by saying, &quot;Rock history has sidelined Cassidy with a finality that seems almost personal, shovelling him up a teen idol side street from which the only escape was retirement and resignation. Cassidy Live, however, was recorded while he still thought he had a chance of advancing -- and few period live albums come even close to capturing its excitement.&quot;

<text>Pembury is a large village in Kent, in the south east of England, with a population of 6,128 at the 2011 census. It lies just to the north-east of Royal Tunbridge Wells.

The village centre, including the village green and High Street area is a conservation area.

==History==

A settlement in Pembury almost certainly predates the Norman Conquest, as the village church of St Peter is of Norman origin. It is thought to have been built in the early 12th or late 11th century, though the earliest it can be dated with certainty is to 1337, when John Culpeper of Bayhall carried out building work to the church.

The first recorded mention of Pembury is as &quot;Peppingeberia&quot; in the 12th-century &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;, though Edward Hasted states that it was also known in ancient deeds as &quot;Pepenbery&quot;.

With the widespread introduction of the motor vehicle in the early 20th century, Pembury Hospital hosted a centre of groundbreaking research and treatment for hodophobia (fear of road travel). Some of the original test subjects settled in Pembury, and many of their descendants still live in the village today. 

In late January 2010, the remains of an Iron Age settlement were discovered along the route of South East Water&#x27;s planned 2.9 miles of pipes between Pembury and Kipping&#x27;s Cross Service Reservoir. Tim Allen from Kent Archaeological Project said:
&quot;We have found evidence of postholes, pits and ditches, probably part of an Iron Age dwelling, along with pieces of pottery that we can date to the late Iron Age. We also found evidence of a medieval enclosure further along the route and five circular, fire-scorched pits, probably parts of ancient hearths or kilns or evidence of charcoal production.&quot; 

==Government==

Pembury forms part of Tunbridge Wells Borough and is represented on the Borough Council by one Conservative party councillor and one Tunbridge Wells Alliance (TWA) councillor. Pembury falls within the Tunbridge Wells East ward of Kent County Council, where it is also represented by a Conservative councillor. It forms part of the Tunbridge Wells parliamentary constituency which is represented in the House of Commons by Greg Clark MP.

Pembury Parish Council was founded in 1895.

==Geography==

Pembury is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of London and just over north-east of the nearest town, Tunbridge Wells.

===Landscape===
The village is within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The landscape around Pembury is dominated by steep-sided valleys and undulating slopes. The area is predominantly agricultural, with scattered and more extensive, usually deciduous woodland. Many local woodlands are used for coppicing.

With soils in the High Weald being relatively poor, early farming in the area would have been dominated by grazing. Between 1600 and 1800, agriculture grew to be the primary activity, with top fruits, cereals, coppicing and hops being the main products. Few hops are grown today, although the landscape continues to be dominated by fruit orchards.

===Evolution of the village===
Until the early 20th century, Pembury remained a small rural village, with five distinct hamlets: Upper Green, Lower Green, Hawkwell, Bo-Peep and Romford. These merged during the 20th century, particularly the latter half, when several large private housing estates were developed including Woodhill Park, Ridgeway and Beagleswood.

===Village green===
The village green, originally known as Copingcrouch Green, was first recorded on a map in 1629. The green was until recently dominated by a large horse chestnut tree and has developed as the focal point of the village. The Camden Arms hotel, which overlooks the green from its south side, was developed as a coaching inn to meet the needs of travellers along the London to Hastings road.

==Tunbridge Wells Hospital==
The village is home to Tunbridge Wells Hospital, a large general hospital run by Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. The hospital is located on the site of the former Pembury Hospital north-west of the main village on Tonbridge Road.

The new hospital was built by Laing O&#x27;Rourke at a cost of around £226 million. It opened in September 2011. The new hospital was the first acute NHS hospital in Britain where every inpatient has their own room with en-suite facilities, with ceiling to floor windows revealing views over surrounding woodland.

==Kent College==
Kent College, Pembury is a girls&#x27; independent boarding and day school. It was established in Folkestone in 1886 by the Wesleyan Methodist Schools&#x27; Association, but moved to Pembury in 1939 and is now an interdenominational Christian school. The school occupies a Victorian manor house, set in a 75-acre estate, adjacent to Pembury Old Church.

==War memorial==
In January 2012, it was discovered by local historian Richard Snow that several of the names on the war memorial were misspelled.

The War Memorial in Hastings Road was unveiled and dedicated on Sunday 25 September 1921 by Rev. Sinclair Brooke, M.A., Vicar of Pembury 1898–1918. The site was given by the Marquis Camden, and the Portland Stone Memorial stands 16 feet high and cost £365 19/4d, which apparently took quite a long time to raise. It was designed by well-known local Architects Ashley S. Kilby and the work was carried out by Messrs. Burslem and Sons of Tunbridge Wells. The Service included the Last Post and Reveille and the National Anthem at the end of the Service. The Roll of Honour was read by Mr C.R. Bosanquet.

In 1949 a metal plaque was placed over the original stone-carved names for the WW1 names and a new metal plaque below recorded the WW2 names. Local historian Richard Snow discovered 8 spelling errors and on 11 November 2018 the newly refurbished War Memorial stone-carved plaques were unveiled by the Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Kent, Lord Colgrain. The metal plaques were removed and replaced by newly carved stone plaques carried out by Burslems of Tunbridge Wells, who created the original plaques. The full story is told on a local DVD &quot;Pembury Remembers&quot; made by David Doré available from Pembury Library.

The old stone plaques were mounted on the playground wall of Pembury Primary School in February 2019.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the Pembury electoral ward had a population of 6,005. The ethnicity was 97.5% white, 0.8% mixed race, 1.2% Asian, 0.3% black and 0.2% other. The place of birth of residents was 94.3% United Kingdom, 0.5% Republic of Ireland, 1.5% other Western European countries, and 3.7% elsewhere. Religion was recorded as 76.3% Christian, 0.1% Buddhist, 0.4% Hindu, 0.1% Sikh, 0.1% Jewish, and 0.4% Muslim. 15.3% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 7.2% did not state their religion.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 41.7% in full-time employment, 14.3% in part-time employment, 11.1% self-employed, 1.6% unemployed, 2.6% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 14.1% retired, 6.8% looking after home or family, 3.1% permanently sick or disabled and 1.8% economically inactive for other reasons. The industry of employment of residents was 16.2% retail, 10.4% manufacturing, 7.8% construction, 13.4% real estate, 15.2% health and social work, 8.3% education, 6% transport and communications, 4.8% public administration, 3% hotels and restaurants, 7.9% finance, 1.8% agriculture and 5.2% other.
Compared with national figures, the ward had a relatively high proportion of workers in finance, and health and social work. There were a relatively low proportion in manufacturing, and hotels and restaurants. Of the ward&#x27;s residents aged 16–74, 22.2% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 19.9% nationwide.

==Religious sites==

===The parish church of St Peter===
Usually referred to as the &quot;Old Church&quot;, the parish church is located in woods outside the village, near Kent College and the waterworks north of the A228. It was first built in the late 11th or early 12th century, although most of the present church was added in 1337.

===The district church of St Peter===

The District Church of St Peter, usually referred to as the &quot;Upper Church&quot; was built in 1847 on land donated by the Marquess Camden of Bayham. Built from local sandstone, also donated by the Marquess, it was erected on one of the highest points in the village. The church was built as a &quot;Chapel of Ease&quot; to serve the expanding communities around the village green who were some distance away from the old church.

The clock on the tower was added in 1872 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the church. A 92 foot high spire was added to the tower in 1886 but was removed exactly one hundred years later as it had become unsafe.

===Other churches===

Pembury Baptist Church is located in Romford Road.

St Anselm Roman Catholic church is located on Lower Green Road, near the village green. A parish within the Archdiocese of Southwark, in 2011 it also became home to a group from the Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.

==Transport==
Pembury has two bypasses, both constructed in the mid-1980s. The A21 bypass is a dual-carriageway road running through lower ground to the south of the village between the Longfield Road roundabout near North Farm, Tunbridge Wells and the Kippings Cross roundabout to the east of the village. Prior to the construction of this bypass, vehicles travelling between London and Hastings had to drive through the village centre via the High Street and Hastings Road.

The A228 bypass is a single-carriageway road passing through woodland to the north and west of the village, linking Woodsgate Corner and the A264 with Maidstone Road at the northern end of the village near Pippins Farm and Downingbury Farm.

Pembury is not directly served by rail, the nearest stations being at Tunbridge Wells, High Brooms, Tonbridge and Paddock Wood.

A segregated cycle route links Pembury to Tunbridge Wells town centre.

<text>Ångström is a small lunar impact crater located on the border between Oceanus Procellarum to the west and Mare Imbrium to the east. To the south is a formation of mountains rising out of the mare named the Montes Harbinger. To the east are some wrinkle ridges named the Dorsum Bucher and Dorsa Argand. This crater is bowl-shaped, with a circular rim and inner walls that slope down to the small central floor. It has a higher albedo than the surrounding &quot;maria&quot;. The crater halo is radar dark, indicating a lack of larger blocks among the fine ejecta.

Ångström crater is named after Anders Jonas Ångström, a Swedish physicist and one of the founders of the science of spectroscopy.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ångström.

<doc id="940009" wikidata="Q674824" url="?curid=940009" title="Cenobitic monasticism">
<text>Cenobitic (or coenobitic) monasticism is a monastic tradition that stresses community life. Often in the West the community belongs to a religious order, and the life of the cenobitic monk is regulated by a religious rule, a collection of precepts. The older style of monasticism, to live as a hermit, is called eremitic. A third form of monasticism, found primarily in Eastern Christianity, is the skete.

The English words &quot;cenobite&quot; and &quot;cenobitic&quot; are derived, via Latin, from the Greek words (, ), and (, ). The adjective can also be cenobiac () or cœnobitic (obsolete). A group of monks living in community is often referred to as a cenobium (Latin, from Greek &quot;koinobion&quot;). Cenobitic monasticism appears in several religious traditions, though most commonly in Buddhism and Christianity.

==Origins==
The word &quot;cenobites&quot; was initially applied to the followers of Pythagoras in Crotone, Italy, who founded a commune not just for philosophical study but also for the &quot;amicable sharing of worldly goods.&quot;

==Judaic monasticism==
In the 1st century AD, Philo of Alexandria () describes a Jewish ascetic community of men and women on the shores of Lake Mareotis in the vicinity of Alexandria, Egypt which he calls the Therapeutae. Members of the community lived apart from one another during six days of the week, studying the Hebrew Bible during the daytime and eating during the evening, whereafter on the Sabbath they hoped to dream visions informed by their studies. Members of the community composed books of midrash, an allegorical method of interpreting scripture. Only on the Sabbath would the Therapeutae meet, share their learning, eat a common, albeit simple, meal of bread and spring water, and listen to a lecture on the Torah given by one of the venerable members of the community. Every seventh Sabbath, or High Sabbath, was accorded a festival of learning and singing, which climaxed in an egalitarian dance.

The 3rd-century Christian writer Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263–339), in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, identified Philo&#x27;s Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, and solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks.

==Christian monasticism==

The organized version of Christian cenobitic monasticism is commonly thought to have started in Egypt in the 4th century AD. Christian monks of previous centuries were usually hermits, especially in the Middle East; this continued to be very common until the decline of Aramean Christianity in the Late Middle Ages. This form of solitary living, however, did not suit everyone. Some monks found the eremitic style to be too lonely and difficult; and if one was not spiritually prepared, the life could lead to mental breakdowns.

For this reason, organized monastic communities were established so that monks could have more support in their spiritual struggle. While eremitic monks did have an element of socializing, since they would meet once a week to pray together, cenobitic monks came together for common prayer on a more regular basis. The cenobitic monks also practised more socializing because the monasteries where they lived were often located in or near inhabited villages. For example, the Bohairic version of Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; &quot;The Life of Saint Pachomius&quot; states that the monks of the monastery of Tabenna built a church for the villagers of the nearby town of the same name even &quot;before they constructed one for themselves.&quot; This means that cenobitic monks did find themselves in contact with other people, including lay people, whereas the eremitic monks tried to keep to themselves, only meeting for prayer occasionally.

==Saint Pachomius==

Cenobitic monks were also different from their eremitic predecessors and counterparts in their living arrangements. Whereas eremitic monks (hermits) lived alone in a monastery consisting of merely a hut or cave (cell), cenobitic monks lived together in monasteries comprising one or a complex of several buildings. In the latter case, each dwelling would house about twenty monks, and within the house there were separate rooms or cells that would be inhabited by two or three monks. To early generations of historians, the style of housing maintained by cenobitic monks was attributed to the man usually hailed the &quot;father of cenobitic monasticism,&quot; Saint Pachomius, who was believed to have found the idea for such quarters during the time he spent in the Roman army, as the style was &quot;reminiscent of army barracks.&quot; While this impression may have been to some extent mythologized by the bishop and historian Palladius of Galatia, communal barracks-like desert dwellings known as &quot;cenobia&quot; came to exist around the early 4th century.

Though Pachomius is often credited as the &quot;father of cenobitic monasticism,&quot; it is more accurate to think of him as the &quot;father of &quot;organized&quot; cenobitic monasticism&quot;, as he was the first monk to take smaller communal groups that often already existed and bring them together into a federation of monasteries. He continued this work until his death in 347 at Pbow, a monastic center that he had founded ten years before.

Palladius&#x27; &quot;Lausiac History&quot; claims that Pachomius was given the idea to start a cenobitic monastery from an angel. Though this is an explanation of his reasoning for initiating the cenobitic tradition, there are sources that indicate there were already other communal monastic groups around at that time and possibly before him. Three of the nine monasteries that joined Pachomius&#x27; federation &quot;clearly had an independent origin&quot;, meaning he was not the first to have such an idea.

==Melitians and Manichaeans==

Besides the monasteries that joined Pachomius&#x27; federation of cenobitic monasteries, there were both Christian and non-Christian cenobitic groups who decided not to join him, such as the Melitians and Manichaeans.

Before Pachomius had begun organizing monastic communities, the Melitians as a group were already recruiting members. They were a heretical Christian sect founded by Melitius of Lycopolis. They &quot;heard of Pachomius&#x27; monastic aspirations and tried to recruit him&quot; to join their community.

Some scholars believe the Manichaeans, founded by Mani, were the &quot;pioneers of communal asceticism in Egypt,&quot; rather than Pachomius. Mani himself was influenced to begin cenobitic monasticism from other groups, including Buddhists and Jewish-Christian Elkasites.

==Later cenobitic communities==
The cenobitic monastic idea did not end with these early groups, and inspired future groups and individuals:

*Mar Awgin founded a monastery on Mount Izla above Nisibis in Mesopotamia (c. 350), and from this monastery the cenobitic tradition spread in Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, Georgia, India and China.
*St. Basil of Caesarea founded a monastery at Annesi, Pontus (c. 364) after witnessing the Egyptian monasteries. The Rule of St Basil would go on to become the standard monastic rule in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
*Mar Saba organized the monks of the Judaean Desert in a monastery close to Bethlehem in 483, which is considered the mother of all monasteries of the Eastern Orthodox churches.
*St. Benedict of Nursia founded the monastery of Monte Cassino in Italy (529), which was the seed of Roman Catholic monasticism in general, and of the order of Benedict in particular.
*St. Bruno of Carthusia, prompted by the spectre of the damnation of the Good Doctor of Paris Cenodoxus, founded a monastery just outside Paris in the 11th century.

In both the East and the West, cenobiticism established itself as the primary form of monasticism, with many foundations being richly endowed by rulers and nobles. The excessive acquisition of wealth and property led to several attempts at reform, such as Bernard of Clairvaux in the West and Nilus of Sora in the East.

<text>The Higher They Climb or The Higher They Climb, the Harder They Fall is an album by David Cassidy. It was his fifth solo release and the first of three albums on RCA Records. It was released in 1975 and was produced by Cassidy and Bruce Johnston.

The title of the album alludes to David Cassidy&#x27;s one-time dominance of the pop charts as a teen-idol (see The Partridge Family) and the eventual drop of his superstar status. The album only reached the charts in the UK, where it peaked at number 22.

The album features the track &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, a song from Bruce Johnston&#x27;s band, The Beach Boys. Cassidy&#x27;s version reached #16 on the UK charts. It was a #1 hit in South Africa and was the 6th best selling single of the year in that country. Johnston also recruited Beach Boys singer, Carl Wilson; however, Wilson&#x27;s vocals appeared on the Johnston-penned song, &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;. &quot;I Write the Songs&quot; was a #11 hit in the UK for Cassidy and was later recorded by Barry Manilow, who made it a hit in the U.S.

Some tracks from this collection are compiled onto the 1996 release &quot;When I&#x27;m a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;.

The album also includes some of David Cassidy&#x27;s own songwriting, including &quot;When I&#x27;m a Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Star&quot;.

Duff joined Blackburn Rovers as a trainee in 1996 after playing for Leicester Celtic, Lourdes Celtic and St. Kevin&#x27;s Boys as a schoolboy in Dublin. He made his Blackburn debut at the age of 18 against Leicester City on the final day of the 1996–97 season for which he won the Man of the match award. In his first full season, he scored five goals. Blackburn were relegated the following season.

Duff helped Blackburn achieve promotion back to the Premier League in 2001 and then win the League Cup in 2002, beating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium in a season where he was Player of the Year. Following the 2002 World Cup, Duff signed a new four-year contract with Rovers. Despite injury problems in the 2002–03 season, he finished as Blackburn&#x27;s top goalscorer with 9 league goals, which helped his team finish sixth and qualify for the UEFA Cup.

===Chelsea===
In the run up to the 2003–04 season, Chelsea made a series of bids for Duff, with a £17 million offer, eventually triggering a release clause in the player&#x27;s contract. Duff chose to move to West London in July. Signed by manager Claudio Ranieri as part of the development of Chelsea financed by new owner Roman Abramovich, Duff made his debut in August 2003 in the Champions League against Slovakian side MŠK Žilina. Chelsea won 2–0 and Duff was described as the &quot;star of the show&quot;. He scored his first Chelsea goal on 20 September 2003 in a 5–0 away win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Duff scored the third Chelsea goal and was named as Man of the match. Duff played 23 games in all competitions for Chelsea in the 2003–04 season scoring five goals. He missed the Champions League semi-finals as Chelsea lost to AS Monaco but was instrumental in securing for Chelsea second place in the Premier League, the club&#x27;s highest league finish for 49 years as well as being part of the Champions League run, but the season ultimately ended trophyless and with the sacking of manager Claudio Ranieri.

The arrival of Dutch winger Arjen Robben and new manager José Mourinho posed a threat to Duff&#x27;s place in the starting line-up for the 2004–05 season, but an injury to Robben at the start of the season saw Duff as the only available winger. Mourinho, however, did not play Duff in the early part of the 2004–05 season, preferring a more narrow approach. Duff eventually got into the side after four games and, when Robben returned to the side, Duff&#x27;s versatility saw him move to the right wing and form a wing partnership with Robben. The season proved to be successful for both Duff and Chelsea. He scored ten goals, including a crucial strike in a 4–2 win against Barcelona in the Champions League, while the team won the Premier League title by 12 points from second placed Arsenal, and the League Cup, in which Duff scored the winning goal in the semi-final against Manchester United. He scored three goals in 28 league appearances in the following season as the club retained their Premier League title.

===Newcastle United===
In July 2006, Duff agreed terms over a £5 million move to Newcastle United, signing a five-year contract. Duff made his competitive debut in a UEFA Cup second round qualifying first leg match against Latvian side Ventspils on 10 August 2006. He scored his first goal for Newcastle in September that year in a 2–0 victory over West Ham United away at the Boleyn Ground. Duff suffered a knee injury in November that kept him out for four months, during which Newcastle had a bad run of defeats. He returned but was then ruled out for the rest of the season due to an ankle injury in a 2–1 loss to Portsmouth in April 2007. Sam Allardyce later described Duff&#x27;s injury as &#x27;career threatening&#x27;. During Alan Shearer&#x27;s short stint as interim manager, Duff was asked to play as left back.

In the final match of the 2008–09 season, against Aston Villa in a crucial relegation decider, Duff unluckily scored the deciding own goal by deflecting in a 20-yard shot by Villa&#x27;s Gareth Barry which sent Newcastle down. Duff confirmed his intention to stay at the relegated club and help them back into the Premier League. On 8 August 2009, Duff scored Newcastle&#x27;s first goal of the 2009–10 season in a 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion.

===Fulham===

After playing one game for Newcastle in 2009–10, Duff returned to the Premier League, signing for Fulham on a three-year contract for £4 million, and re-joining Roy Hodgson, his first manager at Blackburn Rovers. He made his Fulham debut coming on as a substitute against Amkar Perm in the Cottagers&#x27; UEFA Europa League qualifier match, setting up the third goal in a 3–1 win. Duff scored his first league goal for Fulham on 13 September 2009 in a 2–1 victory over Everton, scoring in the 79th minute. On 19 December 2009, Duff scored in the 75th minute in a 3–0 victory over Manchester United. On 17 January 2010, Duff started the game against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park and also completed the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 defeat.
On 22 August 2010, he started and played the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Craven Cottage in a 2–2 draw and also picked up a booking. On 18 September 2010, he started and played the entire match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in a 1–1 draw. On 15 January 2011, Duff made his 500th career appearance in English football when he lined up against Wigan Athletic playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw at the DW Stadium. On 5 February 2011, he started the Premier League game against Aston Villa in a 2–2 draw at Villa Park, but was replaced on 67 minutes by Simon Davies. On 27 February 2011, he played the full 90 minutes and also scored a goal in the match with Manchester City at Eastlands in a 1–1 draw.

On 5 March 2011, Duff scored a brace in a 3–2 win against former side Blackburn Rovers at Craven Cottage.
With the two goals, he continued a run of four goals in five matches.

About Fulham and his time at the football club, Duff stated: &quot;I like to think that I have found my feet again here at Fulham. It&#x27;s a good environment and one that players feel very comfortable in. This is a club with so much character and I&#x27;m very happy to be helping move it forward.&quot; At the end of the 2010–11 season, Duff made 27 appearances and scored 4 goals in all competitions, including making 24 Premier League appearances. On 19 August 2011, Duff signed a one-year extension to his current deal.

After nine goalless matches, Duff scored in Fulham&#x27;s 2–1 win over Norwich City on 31 March 2012.
A week later, on 7 April 2012, he starred in Fulham&#x27;s 0–3 away win over Bolton Wanderers, setting up Clint Dempsey for the second goal of the match. During the match, which marked his 350th league appearance, he was a constant threat on the right wing. On 18 August 2012, Duff scored the opening goal in Fulham&#x27;s 5–0 win over Norwich City on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League. He scored again in the following game, a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.

On 22 February 2013, Duff signed a new contract with Fulham, keeping him at the club until summer 2014. On 16 April 2014, Duff confirmed his intention to leave Fulham at the end of the 2013–14 season. Duff told &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll be leaving Fulham. The club haven&#x27;t spoken to me and I haven&#x27;t spoken to the club but we don&#x27;t need to speak.&quot; He was released from the club on 23 May.

=== Melbourne City ===
In June 2014, Duff joined Australian A-League club Melbourne City as a free transfer in a one-year deal. Duff made his debut against Sydney FC on match day one, assisting David Villa for his first goal in the A-League. Duff scored his first goal against the Newcastle Jets in a 5–2 win. In March 2015, Duff confirmed that he would leave Melbourne City to return to his homeland, with the intention of finishing his career in the League of Ireland.

===Shamrock Rovers===
On 14 July 2015, Duff signed for League of Ireland Premier Division club Shamrock Rovers, and revealed he would be donating his wages to charity. After nine games for the Dublin-based side, on 21 December 2015 he announced his retirement from football.

==International career==

Duff played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team in the 1997 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship finals in Iceland, the 1997 and 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. In Malaysia, he scored the first ever Golden Goal in a World Cup match.

He made his senior début for the Republic of Ireland in 1998 against the Czech Republic. He won 100 caps, making him the fifth most capped player in Irish history. He started a total of 82 times for the Republic of Ireland senior squad, scoring eight goals.

He played every game for Republic of Ireland at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and was voted the team&#x27;s player of the tournament. After scoring against Saudi Arabia, en route to the second round of the FIFA World Cup, Duff marked his goal with an oriental bow, in retrospect often referred to as one of the most memorable moments of his international career. He was named as the FAI Senior International Player of the Year in 2002.

After a poor campaign, failing to qualify and a change of managers during the qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2004, he still scored two goals during the qualifiers against Georgia and Russia.

He was ever present for the Republic of Ireland in their qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but yet again, they failed to qualify. Duff&#x27;s former teammate Steve Staunton took over as manager but early defeats to Germany and a humiliating 5–2 loss to Cyprus saw the Irish fail to qualify again for a major tournament, followed by another change of manager.

Under the new manager Giovanni Trapattoni, Duff started the manager&#x27;s first game in charge against Serbia on 24 May 2008, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Duff became a key member of the squad proving assists for many of the goals. He started the matches in both legs against France as the Irish were controversially knocked out 2–1 on aggregate after extra-time.

Duff was ever-present on the wings for the Republic of Ireland in their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign and he was part of the team that secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with an unprecedented 5–1 aggregate play-off win over Estonia. He was named in Trapattoni&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and was given the number 11 jersey. On 18 June 2012, he captained the Republic of Ireland on his 100th cap against Italy, their final group game of the tournament. This turned out to be the last match he played representing his country.

He announced his retirement from international football on 24 August 2012.

==Coaching career==
During his last playing season at Shamrock Rovers, Duff coached the club&#x27;s under-15 team. On 16 April 2016, it was announced that he would take on a coaching role with the Republic of Ireland under-15s, in line with the recommendation from FAI High Performance Director, Ruud Dokter, that more ex-internationals get involved in coaching roles with the national team setup. On 31 July 2016, Duff joined the Shamrock Rovers first-team coaching staff until the end of the season, with the intention that he would then take control of the under-15 group he previously managed, then competing in the League of Ireland U17 Division.

Duff was appointed to a reserve team coaching position with Celtic in January 2019. When Neil Lennon became interim manager at Celtic in February 2019, Duff was promoted to first team coach, with John Kennedy promoted to assistant manager. After the club completed a third successive domestic treble, Lennon was made permanent manager, with Duff and Kennedy retaining their roles. Celtic secured a ninth league title in-a-row and fourth straight League Cup in 2019–20. On 5 April 2020, Duff was announced as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland senior team to Stephen Kenny, who replaced Mick McCarthy. On 24 June 2020 it was announced that in conjunction with his role as assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland senior team, Duff would also become head coach of the under 17 team at League of Ireland club Shelbourne. On 8 January 2021, Duff stepped down as Kenny&#x27;s assistant.

===Shelbourne===
On 3 November 2021, Duff was appointed as the first team manager of League of Ireland Premier Division club, Shelbourne. His first match in senior management was a 3–0 loss at home to rivals St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on 18 February 2022. Duff led Shels to a FAI Cup Final in his first season.

While coaching for Shelbourne, Duff has criticised the English Football Leagues for not taking the League of Ireland, and Irish teams seriously, mainly in not valuing Irish League players at their true value. Duff stated &quot;Do they think we’re cavemen over here? That’s the stuff you’re dealing with. I think we’re disrespected in terms of what we offer. It’s ‘ah Ireland, why would you loan players to Ireland?’ That’s the UK club mentality.&quot;

At the end of Duff&#x27;s second season in charge, he guided Shels in to UEFA Conference League qualifiers with a fourth place finish. Following the final match of the season in Drogheda, Duff spoke of his uncertainty of staying at Tolka Park as a result of the takeover by Turkish mogul Acun Ilıcalı and a difference in opinion in the club&#x27;s future. Following a &quot;concerted campaign&quot; by Shels fans for Duff to remain at the club, Ilicali relinquished his ownership of Shels. 

On 1 November 2024, Duff guided Shelbourne to the title for the first time since 2006 after a 1-0 win against Derry City with the goal coming five minutes from time on the last day of the season at the Brandywell. Duff described the title win as &quot;Hollywood&quot; and said it was the &quot;pinnacle of his career&quot;. Shels had been 25/1 outsiders to win the league at the start of the season.

==Personal life==
Duff was born in Ballyboden, County Dublin.

Duff married Elaine in June 2010 at Babington House near Frome in Somerset. The couple&#x27;s first child, Woody, was born a year later in the county. Duff is also a rugby fan, and is personally acquainted with some of Ireland&#x27;s international rugby players.

According to the February 2009 issue of &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine Duff was worth £14 million, placing him 92nd in the magazine&#x27;s 2009 Football Rich List.

Duff was referenced in the song Summertime Shootout (featuring T-Pain) by AJ Tracey from his album Flu Game.

==Media work==
Duff was part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of UEFA Euro 2016, UEFA Euro 2020 and FIFA World Cup 2022.

<doc id="940014" wikidata="Q5492235" url="?curid=940014" title="Frankpledge">
<text>Frankpledge was a system of joint suretyship common in England throughout the Early Middle Ages and High Middle Ages. The essential characteristic was the compulsory sharing of responsibility among persons connected in tithings. This unit, under a leader known as the chief-pledge or tithing-man, was then responsible for producing any man of that tithing suspected of a crime. If the man did not appear, the entire group could be fined.

While women, clergy, and the richer freemen were exempt, otherwise all men over 12 years of age were organised in the system for mutual surety.

==Origins==
The first mention of frankpledge comes in 1114–1118, with the &quot;Leges Henrici Primi&quot;; but 12th-century figures like William of Malmesbury were keen to link it to pre-Norman times, and to the laws of Canute the Great. Some historians have indeed seen in the Anglo-Saxon frith-borh (literally &quot;peace-pledge&quot;) the clear anticipation of frankpledge; others consider the 12th-century commentators were reading back into earlier times the later concept, and that the borh system was much less rigid and comprehensive than frankpledge. On this view, William the Conqueror, with the revival of murdrum with respect to the French invaders, played an important role in systematically and universally making the tithing adopt compulsory frankpledge, so as to increase and consolidate the power of the Normans and to establish a more stringent policy.

==Anglo-Saxon sureties==
The borh was a system of surety whereby individuals – a family member, a master for servants, a lord for dependents – became responsible for producing others in court in event of misdemeanors. At the same time, late Anglo-Saxon society increasingly shared responsibility in legal matters in groups of ten. The group was referred to as a &quot;teothung&quot; or &quot;tything&quot;, i.e. a &quot;thing (assembly) of ten men&quot;.

The tything was under the leadership of a tythingman chosen from among them, with the responsibility of producing in the court of justice any man of their number who was summoned. The first tythings were entirely voluntary associations, being groups formed through the mutual consent of their free members. The aspect of the system which initially prevented its being made universally compulsory was that only landed individuals could be forced to pay any fines which might be put upon the group:

The tithing eventually became a territorial unit, part of the vill, while the eventual merger of borh and tithing underpinned the Norman frankpledge system. In its ultimate form, if an individual did not appear when summoned to court the remaining members of the tithing could swear an oath to the effect that they had no hand in the escape of the summoned man: they would otherwise be held responsible for the deeds of the fugitive and could be forced to pay any fines his actions had incurred. This examination of the members of the tything before the court is the origin of the phrase &quot;view of frankpledge&quot;.

==Geography and profits of frankpledge==
Frankpledge did not at first take place in Wales or eight Northern and border counties, but elsewhere was common in the area under the Danelaw, and in the south and southwest of England. By the time of Edward I, however, the sheriff&#x27;s tourn also began to appear in shires like Northumberland and Cumberland.

The bi-annual view of frankpledge which was carried out by the sheriff involved payment of a tithing penny to the sheriff, as well as other opportunities for profit including fines: for this reason exemption from the tourn, or the private takeover of view of frankpledge by lords or boroughs, were valued privileges; while conversely the 1217 Magna Carta sought explicitly to restrict what the sheriff could legitimately demand of frankpledge.

==Later historical development==
The frankpledge system began to decline in the 14th century. The extension of centralised royal administration on the one hand, and the increasing appropriation of view of frankpledge by private landlords of the other, both served to undermine the local system; as too did greater agrarian differentiation and mobility – a process exacerbated by the impact of the Black Death. Nevertheless, the system survived in places into the 15th century, although increasingly superseded by local constables – the former &quot;chief pledges&quot; – operating under the justices of the peace: their oversight represented the remains of &quot;view of frankpledge&quot;.

Ultimately, the principle behind frankpledge still remains in force, in England and Wales, with regard to riots. Until the Riot (Damages) Act 1886, members of each civil parish were, collectively, directly responsible for repaying any damages due to a riot within their area. Under the Act (and its 2016 replacement), the damages are indirectly levied on the local population via the police rate (now a component in council tax) in the relevant local authority area.

<text>Home Is Where the Heart Is is the second album released on RCA Records by David Cassidy. It was released in 1976 and was produced by Cassidy and Bruce Johnston. Although critically well received, the album did not chart in any country. The album is noted in particular for Cassidy&#x27;s recording of Paul McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; which McCartney rated as taking the song to its ultimate potential.

The album includes vocals of Carl Wilson, The Hudson Brothers and a composing contribution from Gerry Beckley, who also sings. Some tracks from this album are compiled in the 1996 collection, &quot;When I&#x27;m a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;.

<text>Cogeco Inc. is a Canadian telecommunications and media company. Its corporate offices are located at 1 Place Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec. The company is structured into three strategic business units (SBU); Cogeco Connexion, Breezeline (previously known as Atlantic Broadband), and Cogeco Media. The company provides a range of telecommunication products and services including cable television, radio and television broadcasting, telephony, and Internet services in Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in thirteen states along the east coast of the United States.

Cogeco Inc. is a publicly traded company () and is controlled through multiple voting shares (accounting for 71.29% of votes) by the Audet family&#x27;s holding company Gestion Audem Inc. In turn, Cogeco Inc. fully owns Cogeco Media, and owns 82.96% of the voting rights in Cogeco Communications Inc., a separate publicly traded company () which owns the Canadian and U.S. cable and telecom operations. The name Cogeco is an acronym for Compagnie Générale de Communication (&quot;General Communications Company&quot;).

==History==
In June 1957, Henri Audet (1918-2012) left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), became president and managing director of Télévision St. Maurice Inc., and was awarded a broadcasting license by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) to operate a television station in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. The call sign would be CKTM-TV, and it would become an affiliate of the CBC&#x27;s French-language network. Télévision St. Maurice Inc&quot;.&quot; was later renamed Cogéco Radio-Télévision Inc&quot;.&quot;, a subsidiary of Cogeco Inc. He would also become chairman and president of La Belle Vision Inc&quot;.&quot;, which was in 1972, Cogeco&#x27;s first acquisition. Henri Audet was chairman and CEO of Cogeco Inc. between 1976 and 1993, and later in 1996, was named President Emeritus of Cogeco Inc. and Cogeco Cable Inc.
Over time, the company divested itself of all its on-air broadcast television assets. In 1989, the company obtained its initial presence in Ontario by acquiring cable systems in Burlington and Oakville and in 1996 expanded further in Ontario by acquiring an additional 25 cable systems (303,000 customers for CA$350 million) from Rogers Communications. Between 1998 and 2001, Cogeco increased its footprint in both Quebec and Ontario with the acquisition of an additional 19 cable systems. In a turn of events, in 2009, and again in 2010, Rogers invested substantially in both Cogeco Inc. and Cogeco Cable Inc., resulting in some speculation surrounding the two rivals.

In 2011, the company increased its radio station assets by acquiring Corus Québec, a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment, and in 2018 acquired additional radio stations from RNC Média, giving it a total of twenty-two radio stations in Quebec and one in Ontario. Also that year, the company purchased Métromédia for CA$41 million to later sell it in 2018 to Bell Media for an undisclosed amount.

In February 2012, the company also sold its cable system Cabovisão in Portugal to the European media group Altice.

In July 2012, the company expanded into the U.S. market by acquiring the cable system operator Atlantic Broadband. In December that same year, it acquired Peer 1 Hosting, an internet infrastructure provider, and later in October 2015, merged it with its Cogeco Data Services, forming a new subsidiary called Cogeco Peer 1.

In January 2018, Cogeco Communications Inc. announced that its US subsidiary Atlantic Broadband had completed the acquisition of the cable systems owned by Harron Communications which were operating under the brand name MetroCast for US$1.4 billion, making the company the eight largest hybrid fibre coaxial cable operator in North America.

In February 2019, the company announced it sold Cogeco Peer 1 to private equity firm Digital Colony for CA$720 million. Cogeco Peer 1 later changed its name to Aptum Technologies.

On 2 September 2020, Altice USA announced an unsolicited offer to purchase both Cogeco and Cogeco Communications. Altice announced it would immediately resell Cogeco&#x27;s Canadian assets to Rogers, which retains large minority interests in both Cogeco companies, while Altice would keep Cogeco&#x27;s U.S. assets including Atlantic Broadband. Cogeco&#x27;s controlling shareholders, the Audet family, indicated shortly thereafter that they would not support the offer. It was also rejected by the companies&#x27; boards of directors, and Quebec Premier François Legault had also signalled his opposition to losing another major Quebec-based company. Altice and Rogers said they would continue to pursue a purchase, with Rogers promising to maintain a separate management team and regional headquarters for its Quebec operations. In October 2020, Altice made a second offer, increasing it to CA$11.1 billion in cash, which was again rejected by the Audet family. The offer expired that November. Rogers subsequently sold its remaining stakes in the Cogeco companies to the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec in December 2023.

Following the acquisition of systems in Ohio in 2021, Atlantic Broadband rebranded as Breezeline in early 2022.

On 21 October 2020, Cogeco Communications announced an agreement for the acquisition of DERYTelecom by its subsidiary Cogeco Connexion for $405 million. Founded in Saguenay, DERYTelecom is the third largest cable company in Quebec. The closing of the transaction is announced on 14 December 2020.

In February 2023, the company announced that it had acquired the telecommunications operation of Internet service provider oxio 

==Digital services==

===Digital cable television===
Within its Canadian cable operations in Ontario and Quebec, 98% of all homes passed by Cogeco Cable-owned plant are able to access digital cable services.

In August 2018, Cogeco announced that it would convert its cablesystems to IPTV using MediaKind platforms.

===Internet access===

Cogeco Cable was one of the first major cable operators to deploy its network compliant with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard to provide all of its Internet Protocol (IP) based services, such as internet access and VoIP as early as 2002.

In April 2009, Cogeco implemented a penalty for surpassing the bandwidth limits for each tier.
As of August 2021, Cogeco offers up to gigabit download speeds (30 Mbit/s upload) in certain areas which takes advantage of its DOCSIS 3.1 platform upgrades and 180 Mbit/s download (10 Mbit/s upload) most of its footprint on DOCSIS 3.0.

===VoIP digital telephony===
Cogeco Cable launched its digital phone service in June 2005, a VoIP-based telephony service offering customers unlimited local &amp; long distance calling within Canada and to the United States, voice mail, call display, call waiting, visual call waiting, call forwarding, 411-directory assistance, 911-emergency assistance, 611-technical support assistance, 711-message relay services and 0-operator services.

<doc id="940026" wikidata="Q7260156" url="?curid=940026" title="Punggol">
<text>Punggol ( or ) is a planning area and new town situated on the Tanjong Punggol peninsula in the North-East Region of Singapore. The town directly borders Sengkang to the south and shares riverine boundaries with the planning area of Seletar, as well as Yishun to the west and Pasir Ris to the east. Bounding the town to the north and north-east is the Straits of Johor, with Coney Island included as a part of the Punggol planning area.

Under the Pungool 21 initiative, plans to turn the area into a new residential town were announced in 1996 and development of the town started in 1998. Due to the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the financial troubles within the construction industry in 2003, the plan did not fully materialise. In 2007, a new initiative, the Punggol 21-plus plan, was introduced to redevelop the area into a waterfront town.

Punggol is divided into 11 districts: Canal, Coney Island, Crescent, Matilda, Northshore, Punggol Central, Punggol Field East, Punggol Field West, Punggol Downtown, Punggol Point and Waterway West.

==Etymology==
Punggol Point or Tanjong Punggol appears as Tanjong Rangon on Franklin and Jackson&#x27;s 1828 map of Singapore. &quot;Punggol&quot;, also spelled Ponggol, means &quot;hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the ground&quot; in Malay. It could also refer to a place where fruits and forest produce are offered wholesale and carried away. These possible names suggest that Punggol was a fruit-growing district. The place is said to take its name from the river Sungei Ponggol.

Ponggol also means &quot;a stump of a tree&quot;, especially &quot;a high stump&quot;. There are suggestions that the district&#x27;s name is based on Tamil (Pongal, &quot;the feast of the boiling rice&quot;, celebrated when the sun enters the sign of Capricorn). However, the word &quot;Ponggol&quot; or &quot;Punggol&quot; is definitely Malay.

==History==

===Early history===
Located in the vicinity of the Punggol Jetty, Punggol was believed to have existed 200 years ago before Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore. The Punggol area used to be a well-established rural district dotted with farmhouses and farm structures, which were serviced by roads and dirt tracks. It was one of the oldest settlements in Singapore. The original settlers were predominantly Malays. The early Chinese immigrants, who settled in Punggol from the mid 19th century onwards, were engaged in plantation work, mainly rubber. As the population of the Chinese increased, many Chinese villagers were then engaged in poultry, pig or fish farming, as well as farm produce. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. Hydroponic non-pollutive vegetable farms and orchid farms used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways, along with old kampongs and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms have given way to the high-rise HDB flats of Sengkang New Town and Punggol New Town.

Historically, Punggol was populated mostly by Teochews and Catholics. However, the original settlers were predominantly Malays. The end of Upper Serangoon Road is known to Teochews as &quot;kangkar&quot; or &quot;river bank&quot; or &quot;river mouth&quot;. Ferries were used on the Serangoon River as transport. An old market was also located here. The Catholic missionaries arrived here 140 years ago and set up churches and schools. A Malay kampong, which has since been cleared, could also be found at Tanjong Punggol. At the end of Punggol Port Road, Indonesian and Malaysian fishermen auctioned their catch at the wholesale fish market.

===World War II===
Between 18 February to 4 March 1942, during World War II, the Hojo Kempei (auxiliary military police), under the supervision of the Kempeitai in Singapore, rounded up suspected anti-Japanese civilians within the Singapore Chinese population during Sook Ching. On 28 February 1942, around 300-400 Chinese civilians were killed at Punggol Point by the Hojo Kempei firing squads. The victims were part of around 1,000 Chinese males who were previously rounded up during a search of the Chinese community living at Upper Serangoon Road.

The location was declared as a national heritage site with a plaque commemorating the victims of the massacre.

===Post-war Punggol===
In the 1960s, basic amenities like piped water, electricity, paved roads, and drainage systems were introduced through government and self-help programmes. It was also at this time that television became popular and antennas could be seen installed on many kampong rooftops.

Punggol was also known for its sumptuous seafood and boatels that provided services like docking and renting of boats for boating, water skiing and skindiving lessons. These seafood restaurants and boatels have since been relocated in the mid-1990s to facilitate land reclamation works. Poultry and pig farms were also gradually phased out when redevelopment commenced in the 1970s. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. Land vacated by resettled farmers were then tendered out on short-term leases for non-pollutive agricultural activities, which included hydroponic non-pollutive vegetable and orchid farms that used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways. These farms existed along with old kampongs and low-rise residential areas. All of these farms have given way to the high-rise HDB flats of Sengkang New Town and Punggol New Town.

===Punggol 21===

In his National Day Rally speech on 18 August 1996, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced the Singapore Government&#x27;s plan to develop Punggol, known as &quot;Punggol 21&quot;. Punggol 21 was a new model for housing, which would feature a new concept in housing as a model for new towns in the 21st century. It would have a mix of private houses and high-grade HDB flats grouped into smaller, distinctly designed estates. Each estate would contain between 1,200 and 2,800 units, with a common neighbourhood green. Every housing unit would be located within 300 metres of the nearest LRT station. Schools, libraries, and community clubs would be clustered for convenience, and there would be three commercial centres, including shopping centres.

A few months after the speech, Punggol 21, which was part of Cheng San Group Representation Constituency then, became an election carrot for the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) to beat a Workers&#x27; Party team led by J.B. Jeyaretnam and Tang Liang Hong. At the general election in 1997, the five-man PAP team managed to retain Cheng San GRC with 54.8% of the valid votes.

However, Punggol 21 did not materialise fully as Singapore&#x27;s economy was affected by the Asian economic crisis in 1997. Although construction began the next year, it was stopped when demand for new flats fell sharply. Plans were again delayed when the construction industry in Singapore experienced financial troubles in 2003. As a result, only some 16,000 flats, out of the 80,000 planned units, have been built as at 2007. There was only one shopping mall in the estate, Punggol Plaza, and there were no recreational facilities like cinemas or swimming pools. As of January 2016, a second shopping mall in the estate, Waterway Point, has opened, and recreational facilities have since been planned within the estate.

====Punggol 21-plus==== 
In his National Day Rally speech on 19 August 2007, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong offered a new vision for Punggol New Town, and introduced the &quot;Punggol 21-plus&quot; plan to re-vitalise the town.

Under the new plan, Sungei Punggol and Sungei Serangoon, which flank the town, will be dammed up to create a freshwater lake and serve as a reservoir. A 4.2-kilometre long, 20-30-metre wide man-made waterway was planned to run through the estate, linking both rivers. Work on it started in 2009, and was completed on 26 October 2011.

<text>Evolution strategy (ES) from computer science is a subclass of evolutionary algorithms, which serves as an optimization technique. It uses the major genetic operators mutation, recombination and selection of parents.

==History==
The &#x27;evolution strategy&#x27; optimization technique was created in the early 1960s and developed further in the 1970s and later by Ingo Rechenberg, Hans-Paul Schwefel and their co-workers.
==Methods==
Evolution strategies use natural problem-dependent representations, so problem space and search space are identical. In common with evolutionary algorithms, the operators are applied in a loop. An iteration of the loop is called a generation. The sequence of generations is continued until a termination criterion is met.

The special feature of the ES is the self-adaptation of mutation step sizes and the coevolution associated with it. The ES is briefly presented using the standard form, pointing out that there are many variants. The real-valued chromosome contains, in addition to the formula_1 decision variables, formula_2 mutation step sizes formula_3, where: formula_4. Often one mutation step size is used for all decision variables or each has its own step size. Mate selection to produce formula_5 offspring is random, i.e. independent of fitness. First, new mutation step sizes are generated per mating by intermediate recombination of the parental formula_6 with subsequent mutation as follows:
: formula_7
where formula_8 is a normally distributed random variable with mean formula_9 and standard deviation formula_10. formula_8 applies to all formula_12, while formula_13 is newly determined for each formula_12. Next, discrete recombination of the decision variables is followed by a mutation using the new mutation step sizes as standard deviations of the normal distribution. The new decision variables formula_15 are calculated as follows:
:formula_16 
This results in an evolutionary search on two levels: First, at the problem level itself and second, at the mutation step size level. In this way, it can be ensured that the ES searches for its target in ever finer steps. However, there is also the danger of being able to skip larger invalid areas in the search space only with difficulty.
==Variants==
The ES knows two variants of best selection for the generation of the next parent population (formula_17 - number of parents, formula_5 - number of offspring): 
* formula_19: The formula_17 best offspring are used for the next generation (usually formula_21).
* formula_22: The best are selected from a union of formula_17 parents and formula_5 offspring.

Bäck and Schwefel recommend that the value of formula_5 should be approximately seven times the formula_17, whereby formula_17 must not be chosen too small because of the strong selection pressure. Suitable values for formula_17 are application-dependent and must be determined experimentally. The selection of the next generation in evolution strategies is deterministic and only based on the fitness rankings, not on the actual fitness values. The resulting algorithm is therefore invariant with respect to monotonic transformations of the objective function. 

The simplest and oldest evolution strategy formula_29 operates on a population of size two: the current point (parent) and the result of its mutation. Only if the mutant&#x27;s fitness is at least as good as the parent one, it becomes the parent of the next generation. Otherwise the mutant is disregarded. More generally, formula_5 mutants can be generated and compete with the parent, called &quot;formula_31&quot;. In formula_32 the best mutant becomes the parent of the next generation while the current parent is always disregarded. For some of these variants, proofs of linear convergence (in a stochastic sense) have been derived on unimodal objective functions.

Individual step sizes for each coordinate, or correlations between coordinates, which are essentially defined by an underlying covariance matrix, are controlled in practice either by self-adaptation or by covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES). When the mutation step is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution using an evolving covariance matrix, it has been hypothesized that this adapted matrix approximates the inverse Hessian of the search landscape. This hypothesis has been proven for a static model relying on a quadratic approximation.

<text>110 in the Shade is a musical with a book by N. Richard Nash, lyrics by Tom Jones, and music by Harvey Schmidt.

Based on Nash&#x27;s 1954 play &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, it focuses on Lizzie Curry, a spinster living on a ranch in the American southwest, and her relationships with local sheriff File, a cautious divorcé who fears being hurt again, and charismatic con man Bill Starbuck, posing as a rainmaker who promises the locals he can bring relief to the drought-stricken area. Nash&#x27;s book is faithful to his original play, although all the interior scenes were moved outdoors to allow for the addition of townspeople for ensemble numbers and dances. Many of Jones&#x27; lyrics come directly from Nash&#x27;s play.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway Production===
Following the success of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, the project was the composing team&#x27;s first for Broadway. The original score was almost operatic in scope, and when the show&#x27;s running time in Boston proved to be too long, the creative team began trimming numbers, eventually discarding nearly as many as were heard in the finished product. After two previews, the production, directed by Joseph Anthony and choreographed by Agnes de Mille, opened on October 24, 1963, at the Broadhurst Theatre, where it ran for 330 performances. The cast included Robert Horton as Starbuck, Inga Swenson as Lizzie, and Stephen Douglass as File, with Will Geer, Lesley Ann Warren, and Gretchen Cryer in supporting roles. The sets were by Oliver Smith and costumes by Motley. The show received four Tony Award nominations but won none. RCA Victor released an original Broadway cast recording of this production on November 3, 1963, with one recording in stereo and one in mono. Both recordings were identical, each having 16 tracks. RCA Victor also released the recording on Compact Disc on June 12, 1990, with one track--&quot;Overture&quot; not heard on the previous LP recordings.

===Original London Production===
The first and only West End production, directed by Charles Blackwell, recreated the original Broadway production closely and opened on February 8, 1967, at the Palace Theatre, where it ran for 101 performances.

===1992 New York City Opera Revival===
A 1992 New York City Opera production, directed by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Susan Stroman, starred Karen Ziemba as Lizzie. The score was heard to particular advantage here, as the opera company orchestra was appreciably larger than the conventional Broadway pit orchestra. A 2-CD studio recording released by Jay Records on October 21, 1997, features Ziemba, Walter Charles, Ron Raines, Kristin Chenoweth, and Schmidt and Jones. The recording was based on the 1992 New York City Opera production, and includes five bonus tracks from the New York City Opera production.

===1999 Concert Production===
In 1999, a concert version was staged at the Fortune Theatre in London by Ian Marshall Fisher for the &quot;Discovering Lost Musicals Charitable Trust&quot;, with Louise Gold as Lizzie. For this production only a piano accompaniment was used, and the cast was unmiked.

===2007 Broadway Revival===
The Roundabout Theater Company presented a new production of the show, which opened on May 9, 2007, at Studio 54, and closed on July 29, 2007, after 94 performances and 27 previews. The production team was headed by director Lonny Price and designer Santo Loquasto. They were joined by lighting designer Christopher Akerlind, sound designer Dan Moses Schreier, and musical arranger David Krane along with musical supervisor/director, Paul Gemignani, who has worked closely with Price on various stage projects in the past. The cast featured Audra McDonald as Lizzie, Steve Kazee as Bill Starbuck, and John Cullum as H.C. Curry. McDonald won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance. Ben Brantley wrote of McDonald: &quot;Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to the Roundabout Theater Company revival of &#x27;110 in the Shade&#x27; that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. Ravishing of voice and Olympian of stature, she&#x27;s an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show.&quot;

The revival also garnered four additional Tony nominations, but failed to win any. In June 2010, McDonald reprised her Tony-nominated role in a two-week fundraising production of the show for the Hale Center Theater in Orem, Utah. A recording of this production was released on June 12, 2007, by PS Classics. It drops the &quot;Overture&quot; but adds two tracks of dialogue.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
It&#x27;s the Fourth of July in 1936, in the small town of Three Point in the Southwestern U.S., where a blistering heat wave has the local sheriff, File, and the other townsfolk forever eyeing the sky (&quot;Another Hot Day&quot;). Elsewhere in town, on the ranch of widower H.C. Curry, the air is also charged with anticipation, due to the imminent arrival of H.C.&#x27;s daughter (&quot;Lizzie&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;), who&#x27;s been off visiting friends of the family (pseudo-relatives &quot;Uncle&quot; Ned and &quot;Aunt&quot; Marabelle and their sons) in [Sweetwater]. The trip was designed to find Lizzie a husband, but to no avail: as at home, her intelligence, sharp wit, and insecurities proved her undoing. H.C. and his sons, Jim and Noah, hatch a plan to invite Sheriff File to the annual picnic lunch, where Lizzie can impress him with her prettiest party dress and tastiest picnic basket. Reluctant at first, but then allowing herself to dream just a bit, Lizzie agrees (&quot;Love Don&#x27;t Turn Away&quot;).

Sheriff File, unfortunately, proves immune to every enticement the Curry boys offer (&quot;Poker Polka&quot;). His mind is more on &quot;some sort of outlaw&quot; heading into town, a fellow named Tornado Johnson; besides, he knows a fix-up when he sees one, and as he puts it, &quot;I can mend my own shirts.&quot; Jim and Noah depart, but H.C. stays behind to tell File he knows the lie File&#x27;s been living: that File&#x27;s not a widower, as he claims to be—that his wife ran out on him. H.C. sees a man who&#x27;s lonely and shut off, one who needs &quot;a lot more mendin&#x27; than shirts,&quot; but File grows angry and defensive, and H.C. leaves him be.

As the ladies at the picnic grounds await the arrival of &quot;The Hungry Men&quot;, File is noticeably not among them, and although her father and brothers do their best to console her, Lizzie feels the sting of File&#x27;s rejection. Jim suggests she&#x27;d have more luck if she flirted more—played down her intelligence and told men what they wanted to hear like Lily Ann Beasley, who has all the men in town weak in the knees. But Lizzie is resolute in her vision of a husband: &quot;I want him to stand up straight—and I want to be able to stand up straight &quot;to&quot; him!&quot;

Suddenly, something sounds like a dry, rattling crack of summer thunder, and with it appears a handsome stranger who introduces himself as &quot;Starbuck—Rainmaker.&quot; His bold promises induce the town into a revivalist frenzy (&quot;The Rain Song&quot;), and H.C. plunks down a hundred dollars for the promise of rain within twenty-four hours. But Lizzie sees through Starbuck&#x27;s pretenses, and he instantly sees through hers (&quot;You&#x27;re Not Foolin&#x27; Me&quot;). His accusations touch a nerve, and as he exits, a childhood song runs through her head (&quot;Cinderella&quot;) that darkens her mood further. Feeling a need to &quot;get out of me for a while,&quot; she imagines a different sort of Lizzie Curry (&quot;Raunchy&quot;).

File appears unexpectedly at the picnic grounds and, still insistent that he has a right to be alone, nonetheless reaches out to Lizzie, coming clean about his past and, almost despite himself, revealing old wounds (&quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;). But as they start to open up to each other, Lizzie&#x27;s candid comments—and her feeble attempts to retract them—drive File away in a fury. Her family appears instantly to grill her, and Noah lashes out at her father&#x27;s efforts to console her, insisting she accept the reality that she&#x27;s going to end up alone. Lizzie, with terror in her heart, faces her future (&quot;Old Maid&quot;).

===Act II===
As twilight approaches, lovers still haunt the picnic grounds. Starbuck is there as well, alone and quiet, doing a bit of soul-searching (&quot;Evenin&#x27; Star&quot;, added for the 2007 revival). The others merely admire the majesty of the night sky (&quot;Everything Beautiful Happens At Night&quot;). For Lizzie, though, twilight means putting an end to her daydreams, and yet, still in search of something she can&#x27;t quite define, she finds herself drawn to Starbuck&#x27;s camp. Sensing her discontent, he encourages her to dream again—this time far beyond her small-town horizons (&quot;Melisande&quot;). Instinctively defensive, as before, Lizzie counters that her dreams are just a different kind (&quot;Simple Little Things&quot;), but feeling that she&#x27;ll never get what she wants, she breaks down. Starbuck grabs her, encouraging her to see herself through her own eyes, and not as she fears others view her; he takes the pins out of her hair and insists she recognize her own beauty. The lights fade as they begin to make love.

Back at the picnic area, Jim is boasting of his own Fourth of July adventures (&quot;Little Red Hat&quot;) when File arrives to tell the Curry clan that he&#x27;s on the lookout for Tornado Johnson—aka rainmaker Starbuck. He understands that H.C. gave him a hundred dollars for the promise of rain, but H.C., well aware that Lizzie is with Starbuck, refuses to reveal his whereabouts. Noah is shocked that his father is willing to leave Lizzie alone with a conman, but H.C. understands his daughter&#x27;s needs, &quot;even if it&#x27;s only one minute—with a man talkin&#x27; quiet and his hand touchin&#x27; her face.&quot; Back at Starbuck&#x27;s tent, that&#x27;s precisely what&#x27;s happening, as Starbuck shares a difficult secret: &quot;I never made rain in my life! Not a single raindrop!&quot; Lizzie counsels him that &quot;it&#x27;s not good to live in your dreams,&quot; but he notes that it&#x27;s not good to live &quot;outside&quot; of them, either. She concludes that the best way to live is &quot;somewhere between the two&quot; (&quot;Is It Really Me?&quot;).

As the Curry family awaits Lizzie&#x27;s arrival, the mood is silent and tense. But she appears joyous and transformed (&quot;I&#x27;ve got a new beau!&quot;), and when File arrives to arrest Starbuck, the entire Curry clan defends him. Starbuck implores Lizzie to join him in his travels, and File—suddenly aware of what he needs and what he might lose—steps forward to plead his &quot;own&quot; case (&quot;Wonderful Music&quot;). Lizzie, with a new sense of her own worth, makes her decision. As Starbuck exits for parts unknown, a low rumble of thunder ushers in a sudden cloudburst, less than twenty-four hours after his arrival. And as the townspeople revel at the heavy downpour (&quot;The Rain Song&quot; reprise), Lizzie and File rejoice in the promise of hope and renewal that rainfall brings.

<text>Getting It in the Street is the third and final release by David Cassidy on RCA Records. This would also be the last album David released in the United States until 1990 (with the release of &quot;David Cassidy&quot;) and his last all new album until 1985 (with the release of &quot;Romance&quot;). &quot;Gettin&#x27; It in the Street&quot; was released in Germany and Japan in November 1976, but did not reach the album charts. The few copies that were pressed for the U.S. were released in July 1979.

Rocker Mick Ronson played lead guitar on the title track which was released as a single. It reached number 105 in the Billboard &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; chart and climbed to number seven in the weekly Top 20 compiled by readers of the German teen magazine &quot;Bravo&quot;. The album was not an &quot;official&quot; release by the record company and is very hard to find. Some tracks from this album are compiled on the 1996 collection, &quot;When I&#x27;m a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;.

The track &quot;Cruise To Harlem&quot; was co-written by former (founding) Beach Boys member, Brian Wilson, and America member, Gerry Beckley.

<text>Green Cross International is an environmentalist organisation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1993. Today, member organisations are in 30 countries. Its primary mission is to &quot;respond to the combined challenges of security, poverty, and environmental degradation to ensure a sustainable and secure future&quot;.

William Bridge serves both as Chairman of Green Cross International and CEO of Global Green USA.

==History==
Green Cross International was founded by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1993, building upon the work started by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On 6 June 1992, the Rio Earth Summit delegates asked Gorbachev to establish Green Cross International, and around the same time, Swiss National Council MP Roland Wiederkehr founded &quot;World Green Cross&quot;, with similar aims. The two organisations merged in 1993, becoming Green Cross International, which was formally launched in Kyoto, Japan, on 18 April 1993.

In 1994, the first Green Cross National Organisations (GCNOs) joined GCI in The Hague, including Japan, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, and the United States.

==Mission==
The initial concept envisaged an international body to provide assistance to countries in ecological trouble.

The organisation&#x27;s stated mission is to:
*&quot;Respond to the combined challenges of security, poverty, and environmental degradation to ensure a sustainable and secure future&quot;;
*&quot;Promote legal, ethical and behavioural norms that ensure basic changes in the values, actions, and attitudes of government, the private sector, and civil society, necessary to develop a sustainable global community&quot;;
*&quot;Contribute to the prevention and resolution of conflicts arising from environmental degradation&quot;; and
*&quot;Provide assistance to people affected by the environmental consequences of wars, conflicts and man-made calamities&quot;.

==Interaction with other organisations==
Other organisations are affiliated with GCI in 30 countries.

GCI holds these statuses:
*Consulting body for United Nations Economic and Social Council
*Consulting body for UNESCO
*Admitted observer organisation with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
*Admitted observer organisation with the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 
*Cooperation with the UN Environment Programme/UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Environmental Emergencies Section

<text>Zuleika is a musical with music by Peter Tranchell and book and lyrics by James Ferman. The musical is based on the 1911 novel, &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot;, by Max Beerbohm.

==History==
The show was first staged at an undergraduate club at Cambridge in 1954, two years before Beerbohm&#x27;s death. The impresario Donald Albery acquired the rights to stage it in the West End, and engaged Osbert Lancaster as designer and Alfred Rodrigues as director. The production opened at the Saville Theatre on 11 April 1957. Beerbohm had died the year before, but his widow, Elisabeth interested herself in the production, and attended the first night.

The plot of the novel was generally followed, except for the conclusion, which was changed to provide a happy ending. Beerbohm had insisted that the name of the heroine should be pronounced &quot;Zuleeka&quot;, but for the musical the pronunciation was changed to &quot;Zul&quot;i&quot;ka&quot;, which was thought easier to sing.

The actress originally cast as Zuleika, Diane Cilento, won excellent critical comment when the show previewed in Manchester, but was taken ill before the show opened in London. She was unable to appear, and the part was taken by Mildred Mayne, a performer best known at the time as a model, appearing on posters in the London Underground advertising underwear. A 2011 newspaper obituary for Cilento alleged that her withdrawal from the production was due to a suicide attempt.

==Cast==
*Katie Batch – Patricia Stark
*Noaks – Peter Woodthorpe
*Lord Sayes – Roderick Cook
*The Hon Charles Trent-Garby – Clive Exton
*Sir John Marraby – Philip Bond
*Oover – Michael O&#x27;Connor
*The Duke of Dorset – David Morton
*The Macquern – John Gower
*The Warden of Judas – Daniel Thorndyke
*Zuleika – Mildred Mayne
*Melisande – Hermione Harvey
*Aunt Mabel -- Patricia Routledge

== Music ==
Here is a list of numbers:

* Eights Week
* City of Repose
* Zuleika
* Zuleika&#x27;s Travels
* Lovely Time
* It&#x27;s My Doorstep Too!
* All Over Again

* Anything Can Happen
* The Last Dance of the Evening
* What Has She Got?
* Always Be Wary of Women
* I Want A Man To Say No
* Someday
* Follow the Fashion
* Seventeen Years From Now

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Times&quot;, having called the show &quot;a most pleasing imitation of Edwardian musical comedy&quot;, added &quot;Miss Mildred Mayne, taking the part of Zuleika at short notice, is not, perhaps, all that Beerbohm painted her, but she is always engaging and she sings easily and well.&quot; In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Philip Hope-Wallace was unconvinced by the new Zuleika: &quot;What the incomparable Max would have thought of Mildred Mayne, the new leading lady, one fails to imagine.&quot; In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Kenneth Tynan called the show &quot;the best British musical since &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;&quot;, but thought Mayne &quot;competent in a role for which competence is not enough&quot;.&quot; Rupert Hart-Davis, who accompanied Elisabeth Beerbohm to the first night, was privately less tactful: he called the show &quot;delightfully gay and charming,&quot; but added, &quot;the leading lady is quite without looks, charm or talent. With someone like … Marilyn Monroe it would run for ever.&quot;

The show ran for 124 performances, closing on 27 July 1957.

<doc id="940044" wikidata="Q2330501" url="?curid=940044" title="The X-Files season 2">
<text>The second season of the science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on September 16, 1994, concluded on the same channel on May 19, 1995, after airing all 25 episodes. The series follows Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, who investigate paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X-Files by the FBI.

The second season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; takes place after the closure of the department following the events of the first season finale. In addition to stand-alone &quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot; episodes, several episodes also furthered the alien conspiracy mythology that had begun to form. Season two introduced several recurring characters—X (Steven Williams), an informant to Mulder; Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), Mulder&#x27;s partner-turned-enemy; and the Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson), a shape-shifting assassin.

The storylines were widely affected by the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson; it was decided that Scully would be kidnapped and abducted by aliens, explaining her absence and allowing her to appear comatose two episodes later, which ultimately added more intricacies to the mythology. The season earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations. The premiere &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, debuted with a Nielsen household rating of 10.3 and was viewed by 9.8 million households, marking a noticeable increase in viewership since the previous year. The series rose from number 111 to number 63 for the 1994–95 television year. In addition, the show&#x27;s second season has generally received positive reviews from television critics.

== Plot overview ==
Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is reassigned to teach at the FBI Academy while Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is given lowly surveillance assignments. After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re-opens the X-Files, claiming that is what the conspirators will fear most.

Scully turns up comatose in a hospital four weeks later with no explanation about how she got there. X provides Mulder with information allowing him to take revenge on her captors, but Mulder is instead convinced by Scully&#x27;s sister Melissa to visit her bedside. Scully recovers and returns to work shortly thereafter. The agents later investigate a case involving alien biology being injected into teenagers in Wisconsin, and once again they encounter Deep Throat&#x27;s killer, who is killed by the local sheriff.

When investigating a case involving the murder of identical doctors, the agents come across a shapeshifting Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson) responsible for executing a series of alien clones. During this case a grown woman claiming to be Mulder&#x27;s sister Samantha appears, telling Mulder of the Bounty Hunter&#x27;s objectives and that she has the ability to identify him. When Scully is kidnapped by the Bounty Hunter, Mulder is forced to trade Samantha for her. During a botched attempt to kill the Bounty Hunter, Samantha is killed. However, it is discovered that this was simply one of many alien clones of Samantha. With the help of X, Mulder pursues the Bounty Hunter to a submarine in the Arctic. Mulder is nearly killed when exposed to the Bounty Hunter&#x27;s toxic blood, but is saved by Scully.

When a hacker downloads decades&#x27; worth of classified information about aliens onto a digital tape, he gives it to Mulder, who finds that the entire tape is written in Navajo. Cigarette Smoking Man begins searching for the tape and visits Mulder&#x27;s father, who calls Mulder to see him shortly afterwards. Before he can reveal anything to Mulder, however, he is murdered by Alex Krycek. Scully brings Mulder to New Mexico, where she introduces him to Albert Hosteen, a code-talker who can translate the digital tape. Albert&#x27;s grandson shows Mulder a boxcar filled with alien corpses. Cigarette Smoking Man tracks Mulder&#x27;s location, however, and orders the boxcar burned.

== Production ==

=== Writing and development ===

The season premiere was originally supposed to have been written by series creator Chris Carter. In his initial pitch, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. In fact, the producers wanted to film the episode in Russia, but they were not able to secure the appropriate arrangements. In the end, Carter was unable to complete the script idea, which would have also featured the reopening of the X-Files. Instead, co-executive producers Glen Morgan, James Wong and Howard Gordon penned the opening premiere, &quot;Little Green Men&quot;; the episode was the first entry to actually show an alien in the series. This delay gave Carter time to write &quot;Duane Barry&quot;, the start of the series&#x27; first two-parter.

As the series ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the pregnancy of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully giving birth to an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson&#x27;s pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as &quot;the best thing that ever happened to the series&quot; as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. 

The writers decided to close the X-Files at the end of the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson&#x27;s pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with &quot;very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing&quot;. The two-parter of Carter&#x27;s &quot;Duane Barry&quot; and Paul Brown&#x27;s &quot;Ascension&quot; were scripted to culminate in Scully&#x27;s abduction and the re-opening of the X-Files. Anderson does not feature at all in the following episode &quot;3&quot;, as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time of filming.

=== Casting ===
The season introduced the character X, played by Steven Williams, who replaced Deep Throat as Mulder&#x27;s informant, following Deep Throat&#x27;s assassination in the first-season finale, &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;. X was originally intended to be a woman with Natalija Nogulich already cast in the role, but was replaced by Williams as the writers did not believe she had the &quot;right chemistry&quot; with her co-stars. X was written to be different than Deep Throat. Deep Throat had been selfless, while X was intended to be selfish and scared. Nicholas Lea, who had previously appeared in a small part in the season one&#x27;s &quot;Gender Bender&quot;, was cast as Alex Krycek. Krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for Scully when she was abducted, but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on the show.

During the production of the season, Duchovny asked Carter &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?&quot; Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotnitz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two-part episodes &quot;Colony&quot; and &quot;End Game&quot;. Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very &quot;distinctive look&quot; about him, most notably his face and mouth. 

Megan Leitch appeared in &quot;Colony&quot; and &quot;End Game&quot; as a grown-up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and returned to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been &quot;straight science fiction&quot; and it was too &quot;ridiculous&quot; to give too many answers. Darren McGavin, star of &quot;&quot;, was sought out for the part of Senator Matheson in &quot;Little Green Men&quot; and Mulder&#x27;s father in &quot;Colony&quot; and &quot;End Game&quot;, but the roles went to Raymond J. Barry and Peter Donat respectively, while McGavin agreed to play X-Files founder Arthur Dales in season five.

=== Crew ===
Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote seven episodes. Co-executive producers and writing team Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote five episodes for their final season as regular writers for the series, although they both returned as consulting producers for part of season four. Supervising producer Howard Gordon wrote five episodes. Frank Spotnitz joined the series, writing two episodes. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Carter for two episodes, receiving story credit. Glen Morgan&#x27;s younger brother Darin Morgan joined the series, contributing the story for an episode written by his older brother and James Wong, and writing another script solo.

Paul Brown joined the series as a producer and wrote two episodes. Sara B. Charno, another staff writer, wrote two episodes. Vince Gilligan joined the series, writing one episode. Former supervising producer Alex Gansa returned to co-wrote one episode with writing partner Howard Gordon. Chris Ruppenthal returned to write one more freelance episode after last season. Steve De Jarnatt contributed one freelance episode for the season. Line producer and production manager Joseph Patrick Finn was promoted to producer with this season. Paul Rabwin continued to serve as co-producer for the show.

Producing-directors for the show included Rob Bowman, David Nutter, Kim Manners and co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin, who directed most of the season; Bowman with seven, Nutter with five, and Manners and Goodwin each with two. Series creator Chris Carter directed one episode, making his directorial debut, while Daniel Sackheim, Michael Lange, James Contner, James Whitmore, Jr., Michael Vejar, Nick Marck, Stephen Surjik and Win Phelps each directed one episode.

=== Ratings ===
The second season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;Little Green Men&quot; on September 16, 1994. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.3, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 9.8 million households, an increase from the first season&#x27;s finale, &quot;The Erlenmeyer Flask&quot;, which was viewed by 8.3 million households. &quot;Little Green Men&quot; was, at the time, the highest-rated episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air. As the season continued, ratings began to grow. The season hit a high with the fifteenth episode, &quot;Fresh Bones&quot;, which was viewed by 10.8 million households. 

The season hit a low with the twenty-first episode, &quot;The Calusari&quot;, which was viewed by 7.9 million households and received a rating of 8.3/16. The season finale, &quot;Anasazi&quot;, earned a Nielsen rating of 10.1, with an 18 share, and was viewed by 9.6 million households, marking a 13.5 percent increase in households when compared to the previous season finale. The series was ranked as number 63 during the 1994–95 television season, a significant increase in ratings when compared to the first season, which finished at number 111.

=== Reviews ===
&quot;The DVD Journal&quot; gave the season four out of four stars, calling it a &quot;memorable season&quot;. The review highlighted &quot;The Host&quot;, &quot;Duane Barry&quot; and &quot;Ascension&quot;, the cliffhanger finale &quot;Anasazi&quot;, the &quot;unforgettable&quot; &quot;Humbug&quot;, and meeting Mulder and Scully&#x27;s families in &quot;Colony&quot; and &quot;One Breath&quot;. IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had &quot;started to explore a little&quot; and the &quot;evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar&quot;. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book &quot;Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen&quot;, rated several episodes across the season highly, awarding five stars out of five to &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, &quot;Duane Barry&quot;, &quot;One Breath&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, &quot;Die Hand Die Verletzt&quot;, and &quot;Anasazi&quot;. Several episodes rated poorly, with &quot;3&quot;, &quot;Excelsis Dei&quot;, and &quot;The Calusari&quot; being considered particularly poor.

Many critics considered the &quot;Duane Barry&quot;/&quot;Ascension&quot;/&quot;One Breath&quot; story arc to be the best part of the season. Shearman singled out the three-parter as the highlight of the season, noting that the &quot;intimacy&quot; and &quot;sincerity [of] the emotion&quot; of the episodes allowed the mythology of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to play out for a further seven seasons. Tom Kessenich, in his book &quot;Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files&quot; named the story arc the top episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and wrote, &quot;to this day, this remains the defining moment in the series run. So much sprang forth from this trio of episodes. ... Sensational.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The second season earned the series seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including its first for Outstanding Drama Series. The episode &quot;Duane Barry&quot; received four nominations for different categories; CCH Pounder for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series; Chris Carter for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Drama Series; James Coblentz for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing for a Series – Single Camera Production; and for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Editing for a Series.

Other nominations included John S. Bartley for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series for &quot;One Breath&quot;, and Stephen Mark for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing for a Series – Single Camera Production for &quot;Sleepless&quot;. This season earned the series its first of three wins for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama.

<text>Electroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture where a small electric current is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles.

The Cochrane Collaboration, a group of evidence-based medicine (EBM) reviewers, reviewed acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Because of the small number and poor quality of studies, they found no evidence to recommend its use for this condition. The reviewers concluded:
:&quot;Although the results of the study on electroacupuncture show that electroacupuncture may be beneficial to reduce symptomatic knee pain in patients with RA 24 hours and 4 months post treatment, the reviewers concluded that the poor quality of the trial, including the small sample size preclude its recommendation. The reviewers further conclude that acupuncture has no effect on ESR, CRP, pain, patient&#x27;s global assessment, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, general health, disease activity and reduction of analgesics. These conclusions are limited by methodological considerations such as the type of acupuncture (acupuncture vs electroacupuncture), the site of intervention, the low number of clinical trials and the small sample size of the included studies.&quot;

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found inconclusive evidence that electroacupuncture was effective for nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum during pregnancy. The American Cancer Society has concluded that the evidence does not support the use of EAV &quot;as a method that can diagnose, cure, or otherwise help people with cancer&quot; or &quot;as a reliable aid in diagnosis or treatment of ... other illness&quot;.

<text>Adele is a musical in three acts with book, music and lyrics by Adolf Philipp. The musical was coyly marketed and published as an English adaptation by Adolf Philipp and Edward A. Paulton with the claim that the original French book and lyrics were by Paul Hervé, and the music by Jean Briquet. However, both Paul Hervé and Jean Briquet were pseudonyms of Adolf Philipp and the work had never been written or performed in French prior to the original English language production. This was done to make the work seem like an authentic French stage work rather than the original creation of Adolf Philipp, an American.

The musical is set in France in the cities of Paris and Trouville, Normandy. The plot concerns a French girl who falls in love with the son of her father&#x27;s business rival.

== Productions ==
The Broadway production opened on August 28, 1913, at the Longacre Theatre, transferring to the Harris Theatre and ran for a total of 196 performances. It was directed by Ben Teal and produced by Joseph P. Bickerton Jr. Natalie Alt played the titular role. Georgia Caine was Mme. Myrianne de Neuville, Hal Forde was Baron Charles de Chantilly and Craufurd Kent was Robert Friebur.

The West End London production opened at the Gaiety Theatre on May 30, 1914. Adele was played by Carolyn Thompson and Neuvelle by Georgina Caine.

<doc id="940049" wikidata="Q1110299" url="?curid=940049" title="The X-Files season 3">
<text>The third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on Fox in the United States on September 22, 1995, concluded on the same channel on May 17, 1996, and contained 24 episodes. The season continues to follow the cases of FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, who investigate paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X-Files by the FBI.

The season features the conclusion of several plot-lines introduced in season two, while also introducing several new plot elements. Major plot arcs include an elaborate conspiracy being discovered when an alien autopsy video is acquired by Mulder, Scully&#x27;s search for the killer of her sister, and the mystery surrounding X (Steven Williams). Pivotal characters such as the First Elder (Don S. Williams) and the alien virus black oil were first introduced in this season. In addition, the season features a wide variety of &quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot; episodes, stand-alone stories not of influence to the wider mythology of the series.

The season attained higher ratings than season two, the highest viewing audience the series had yet achieved. Season premiere &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; debuted with a Nielsen household rating of 19.94, which more than doubled the premiere of the last season. The ratings consistently stayed above 15.0, making it one of the most watched series of the 1995–96 television line-up. The season received generally positive reviews from television critics, winning five Primetime Emmy Awards. Many of the episodes written by writer Darin Morgan received critical acclaim, including the episodes &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; and &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; which are often cited as some of the best of the series. Morgan left the series following this season, due to an inability to keep up with the fast-paced nature of the show.

== Plot overview ==
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is later found in the desert following the events of the second season finale and nursed back to health by Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman). Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.

Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, Mulder infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien-human hybrid. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X (Steven Williams). X had been tipped off about Mulder&#x27;s activities by the agent&#x27;s partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams), who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.

The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War II-era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman&#x27;s body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.

== Writing ==
Development of the first episode of the season, &quot;The Blessing Way&quot;, began with the second-season finale &quot;Anasazi&quot;. Both of those episodes, along with &quot;Paper Clip&quot;, form a trilogy of episodes that began the third season. &quot;Anasazi&quot; was directed by R. W. Goodwin, who later directed the season finale &quot;Talitha Cumi&quot;, and &quot;Paper Clip&quot; was directed by Rob Bowman. Bowman directed a total of eight episodes for the season, followed by Kim Manners who directed seven. Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote eight episodes, directing one.

Darin Morgan had a small involvement in the second season, and was asked to contribute more content for the third. He first appeared in &quot;The Host&quot; as the Flukeman, and was brought on by his brother Glen Morgan to help write the episode &quot;Blood&quot;. Morgan&#x27;s first sole credit as a writer came in the episode &quot;Humbug&quot;, which received a positive reception by the staff. David Duchovny expressed an enjoyment for working with Morgan, commenting &quot;what I loved about his scripts was that he seemed to be trying to destroy the show.&quot; 

Morgan wrote three episodes, but later left the series because he could not keep up with the fast-paced nature of network television. He also expressed a negative opinion of the way his teleplays were handled, despite a positive reception by both critics and the crew of his work. He also contributed to the script for the episode &quot;Quagmire&quot;. After writing one episode the previous season, Vince Gilligan returned to write another solo episode for the season, now credited as a creative consultant. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Howard Gordon and Chris Carter for two episodes receiving story credit.

New writers in the third season included story editor Jeffrey Vlaming who wrote two episodes, supervising producer Charles Grant Craig who wrote a single episode, Kim Newtown who wrote two episodes, and staff writer John Shiban who wrote two episodes. All new writers except Shiban did not return after this season. Series visual effects producer Mat Beck also wrote an episode. Other producers included production manager and producer Joseph Patrick Finn and co-producer Paul Rabwin.

== Themes ==
&quot;Nisei&quot; and &quot;731&quot;, show a darker side to the series, exploring the public&#x27;s distrust in the government. Other episodes dealing with the wider mythology of the series—&quot;Talitha Cumi&quot;, &quot;Piper Maru&quot; and &quot;Apocrypha&quot;—explore similar concepts, showcasing the shadow government plot line of the series. Episodes like &quot;2Shy&quot; and &quot;Pusher&quot; feature sadistic villains, containing human beings capable of highly immoral acts despite their seemingly mundane appearances. Another episode with a serial killer antagonist, &quot;Grotesque&quot;, revolves around the way that evil can change and influence people. &quot;Oubliette&quot; offers a sentimental and emotional plot driven by the kidnapping of a young girl. The episode features parallels to the real life Polly Klaas case and provides commentary on both stockholm syndrome and trauma.

Aliens and serial killers are not the only antagonists in the season; several episodes revolve around more traditional, B-movie inspired monsters, taking influence from horror films. These episodes include &quot;War of the Coprophages&quot; and &quot;Quagmire&quot;, about killer cockroaches and a lake monster. Several episodes have satirical elements, including &quot;D.P.O.&quot;, &quot;Syzygy&quot; and &quot;War of the Coprophages&quot;, with the latter two showcasing how the public can create panic out of need. Both &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; and &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; play against tropes and the established formula of the series, subverting themes the series usually followed.

=== Ratings ===
The third season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; on September 22, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 12.3, with a 22 share, meaning that roughly 12.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 22 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 19.94 million viewers. &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; was, at the time, the highest-rated episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air. The previous record belonged to the season two entry &quot;Fresh Bones&quot;, which scored an 11.3 rating with a 19 share. As the season continued, ratings dropped slightly and stabilized. After the season premiere, the highest-rated episode of the season was the finale, &quot;Talitha Cumi&quot;, which was viewed by 17.86 million viewers. The season hit a low with the twenty-third and penultimate episode of the season, &quot;Wetwired&quot;, which was viewed by 14.48 million viewers.

The series was ranked as number 55 during the 1995–96 television season, and was viewed by an average of 15.40 million viewers, an increase in almost seven percent when compared to the second season, which was viewed by 14.50. In its third season, &quot;The X-Files&quot; became Fox&#x27;s top-rated program in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The third season of the show was the last to be aired on Friday nights. For its fourth season, the show was moved to Sunday.

=== Reviews ===
Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the third season &quot;The X-Files″&quot; &quot;best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time&quot;, noting it was consistent and &quot;[swung] from strength to strength&quot; between mythology and stand-alone episodes. However, she thought it &quot;starts out kind of terribly&quot; with &quot;The Blessing Way&quot;. Zack Handlen, VanDerWerff&#x27;s colleague, wrote that the third season was &quot;one of the show&#x27;s strongest, with the conspiracy arc still keeping tension high instead of just vamping for time. By this point, the sometimes awkward effects work of the early years is gone, and the overall direction is highly polished, giving even the season&#x27;s weakest entries a cinematic feel&quot;. He stated that Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; and &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; were &quot;&quot;The X-Files&quot; two greatest hours&quot;. 

The writing credits provided by Morgan was widely cited as a highlight of the season. &quot;War of the Coprophages&quot; written by him received positive reviews, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;War of the Coprophages&quot; an A−, who praised the absurdity and entertainment value of the episode. Another episode, &quot;Quagmire&quot; containing some writing credits by Morgan received positive reviews, with the 10-minute dialogue sequence featuring Mulder and Scully receiving highly positive reviews.

Gilligan&#x27;s episode &quot;Pusher&quot; was also cited as one of the best episodes of the series by both IGN and Den of Geek, and Tom Kessenich, in his book &quot;Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files&quot;, named the episode the third best episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and called it the &quot;best MOTW [&quot;monster-of-the-week&quot;] in the series history&quot; Duchovny considers his performance in &quot;Oubliette&quot; as his favorite of the season, an episode that received mostly positive reviews. Writing for DVD Talk, Earl Cressey rated the season overall four-and-a-half stars out of five, finding that the series&#x27; increased budget meant that its production values and the quality of its guest appearances were better than previous seasons.

=== Accolades ===
The third season earned the series eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It received its second consecutive nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, Gillian Anderson received her first nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and the episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Art Direction for a Series. The series won five awards, including Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Drama Series, for the episode &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; written by Darin Morgan. Peter Boyle won for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in that same episode.

The episode &quot;Nisei&quot; won for both Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. John S. Bartley won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series due to the episode &quot;Grotesque&quot;. Duchovny and Anderson were each nominated for a Golden Globe Award for their performances.
