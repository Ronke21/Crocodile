<text>Moses B. Stuart (March 26, 1780 – January 4, 1852) was an American biblical scholar.

==Life and career==
Moses Stuart was born in Wilton, Connecticut on March 26, 1780. He was brought up on a farm, then attended Yale University graduating with highest honours in 1799; in 1802 he was admitted to the Connecticut bar and was appointed as a tutor at Yale, where he remained for two years. In 1806 Stuart became the pastor of the Centre (Congregational) Church of New Haven. He was later appointed professor of sacred literature in the Andover Theological Seminary in 1810.

He succeeded Eliphalet Pearson (1752–1826), the first preceptor of the Phillips (Andover) Academy and in 1786–1806 was appointed professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at Harvard. At this time he knew hardly more than elementary Hebrew and not much more Greek; in 1801–12 he prepared for the use of his students a Hebrew grammar which they copied day by day from his manuscript; in 1813 he printed his &quot;Grammar&quot;, which appeared in an enlarged form, with a copious syntax and praxis, in 1821, and was republished in England by Dr Pusey in 1831. Stuart was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815 and the American Philosophical Society in 1824.

He gradually made the acquaintance of German works in hermeneutics, first Johann Friedrich Schleusner, Seiler and Gesenius, and taught himself German, arousing much suspicion and distrust among his colleagues by his unusual studies. However, recognition soon followed, partly as a result of his &quot;Letter to Dr Channing on the Subject of Religious Liberty&quot; (1830), but more largely through the growing favour shown to German philology and critical methods.

In 1842 Stuart published a second edition of his work &quot;Hints on the Interpretation of Prophecy&quot;. The historical setting of this work he alluded to in his Preface, writing, &quot;It is time for the churches, in reference to the matters now before us, to seek some refuge from the tumultuous ocean on which they have of late been tossed.&quot; (p. 5) This setting he more explicitly addressed in his Appendix, where he replied to the book George Duffield, D.D., of Detroit, published in 1842, &quot;Dissertations on the Prophecies Relative to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ&quot;. Stuart as well mentioned Duffield&#x27;s view of William Miller in regard to the time of the Second Coming (p. 172).

Stuart&#x27;s 1850 book &quot;Conscience and the Constitution&quot; took the position that slavery was an institution allowed by the Bible, but that, as it was actually practiced in the United States, slavery was morally wrong. Therefore there should be a voluntary emancipation of slaves by the Southern slave owners. However, Parker Pillsbury reported in his 1847 &quot;Forlorn Hope of Slavery&quot; that Stuart of Andover Theological Seminary wrote &quot;to President Fisk of another Theological Seminary, that &#x27;slavery may exist, without violating the Christian faith or the Church.&#x27;&quot;

Stuart has been called the father of exegetical studies in America. He contributed largely by his teaching to the renewal of foreign missionary zeal—of his 1,500 students more than 100 became foreign missionaries, among them such skilled translators as Adoniram Judson, Elias Riggs and William G Schauffler.

In 1848 Stuart resigned his chair at Andover. He died in Andover on January 4, 1852.

==Major works==
*&quot;Winer&#x27;s Greek Grammar of the New Testament&quot; (1825), with Edward Robinson
*&quot;Critical History and Defence of the Old Testament Canon&quot;
*&quot;Hug&quot; (1836), translation from the German
*&quot;Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews&quot; (1827–1828)
*&quot;Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1832)
*&quot;Hints on the Interpretation of Prophecy Second Edition&quot; (1842); this Andover printing lacks the Appendix containing his reply to Duffield. The 1851 New York printing of the same edition does contain Stuart&#x27;s Appendix.
*&quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse&quot; (1845)
*&quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1846)
*Gesenius&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew Grammar&quot; (1846), a version which involved Stuart in a long controversy with Thomas Conant, the earlier, and possibly more scholarly, translator of Gesenius
*&quot;Commentary on the Book of Daniel&quot; (1850)
*&quot;Commentary on Ecclesiastes&quot; (1851)
*&quot;Commentary on the Book of Proverbs&quot; (1852)

<text>Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll is the sixth album by American punk rock band Social Distortion. It is their first studio album in eight years, since the release of &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; in 1996. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the fall of 2000, but was not yet completed, and it was officially released on September 28, 2004. This album is Social Distortion&#x27;s first to feature guitarist Jonny Wickersham, following the death of original guitarist Dennis Danell in February 2000. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, was released in late 2004 and became one of Social Distortion&#x27;s biggest hits.

Social Distortion could not release a follow-up to &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; partly because of various activities, most obviously those of frontman Mike Ness&#x27;s solo career, releasing two solo albums in 1999, one with original material (&quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot;) and one cover album (&quot;Under the Influences&quot;). Touring behind these projects, and matters pertaining to Danell&#x27;s death, set &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; aside for a number of years before finally being completed in 2004.

&quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was the first time since Social Distortion&#x27;s 1990 self-titled album that Ness had collaborated with another songwriter. It was also the band&#x27;s first album not to include a cover song since their 1983 debut album &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; traces its beginnings to the &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; tour in 1997, where Ness began writing new material for the sixth Social Distortion album. One of the new songs, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Run No More&quot;, was first performed at a concert in Germany that year. In 1998, with Social Distortion not working, Ness launched a solo career and decided to record some of the songs for his first album, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot;.

In November 1999, Ness added more details to the possibility of a follow-up to &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; and mentioned he would &quot;like to get one out&quot; in fall 2000. In May 2001, a questioner asked Ness how the album was coming along. He replied, &quot;Slow.&quot; His wife elaborated that he was in &quot;home mode&quot;, working on restoring a house in Santa Ana, CA. The band was rumored to resume recording in June or July.

In July 2001, five songs that were going to appear on the album were announced. The songs were &quot;Road Zombie&quot;, &quot;Winners and Losers&quot;, &quot;I Wasn&#x27;t Born to Follow&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me for Granted&quot; and &quot;Footprints on My Ceiling&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me for Granted&quot; was the only known unreleased song that the band played at the &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; benefit concert in 2000. In July 2001, in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, Ness discussed the possibility of releasing the album in spring 2002 and mentioned an invitation from Johnny Cash to record together.

In January 2002, an inside source reported that Social Distortion was planning to begin recording the album in March and began recording demos for the album in October, with an intended release date of spring 2003. In October 2003, the band announced on their official website that they were planning to enter a studio in Los Angeles, California, in November to finish work on the album. During a January 11, 2004, concert in Orlando, Florida, Ness revealed that the album was &quot;three-quarters of the way completed&quot; and mixing began in June.

A January 2003 issue of a German magazine &quot;Visions&quot; conducted an interview with Ness. About the album, he says: &quot;Definitely more glam and seventies influences and less country since I&#x27;m able to realize this part of me better by the Mike Ness Band. And certainly more hope and light than on &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;. You can&#x27;t forever tell yourself and others that life&#x27;s all bad. Apart from other things, punk rock also is about fun and loud guitars. Before doing the last album I went through a really hard time, and even if not all is great in my life, I&#x27;m much better now than at that time.&quot;

On August 5, 2004, Social Distortion announced on their official website that the album would be called &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and would officially be released on September 28. On the same day, it was announced that bass guitarist John Maurer, who recorded the album, had left the band &quot;in order to stay home and devote time to his wife and two children&quot;. On tour, Rancid&#x27;s Matt Freeman joined as his replacement, then was himself replaced a few months later by Ness&#x27; touring bass guitarist for his solo project, Brent Harding.

==Reception==

Critical reviews of &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; were mostly positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming gave the album a rating of four stars out of five and states: &quot;&quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; shows that Social Distortion have held onto what made them great while growing and changing in the best ways, and the result is one of the best albums this band has made to date.&quot; In 2005, the album was ranked number 456 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="957669" wikidata="Q576829" url="?curid=957669" title="Soviet aircraft carrier Kiev">
<text>Kiev () is an aircraft carrier (heavy aircraft cruiser in Russian classification) that served the Soviet Navy and the Russian Navy from 1975 to 1993. She was built between 1970 and 1975 at Chernomorski factory in Mykolaiv and was the first vessel to be built. She is currently part of a theme park in China.

==Service life==

&quot;Kiev&quot; was laid down on 21 July 1970 and launched on 26 December 1972. She was completed and commissioned on 28 December 1975, but officially entered service only in February 1977, after completing all trials.
On 16 July 1976 she sailed from Sevastopol in the Black Sea, and on 20 July began testing her Yakovlev Yak-36M aircraft (four Yak-36M and one Yak-36MU on board) under sea conditions in the Mediterranean off Crete. On 10 August 1976 she arrived in Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, and was attached to the Northern Fleet&#x27;s 170th Anti-Submarine Warfare Brigade, and conducted extensive tests up to December. Between 12 and 19 April 1977 she took part in the &quot;Sever-77&quot; exercise, and on 26 June 1977 was reclassified from &quot;Protivolodochnyye Kreysery&quot; (PKR) &quot;ASW cruiser&quot; to &quot;Tyazhelyye Avianesushchiye Kreysery&quot; (TAVKR) &quot;Heavy aircraft carrying cruiser&quot;. Between 20 December 1977 and 21 April 1978 she participated in operations in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. On 3 November 1978 she hit a sand bar, but suffered no damage. She took part in a local exercise on 4 August 1978, and on 11 October in final tests of the main missiles in the White Sea.

From 1977 to 1987, &quot;Kiev&quot; undertook 10 practice voyages to the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. In March 1979 she undertook manoeuvres with her sister ship &quot;Minsk&quot; on the Mediterranean. In October 1981 she was a flagship in the massive fleet exercise Zapad-81 on the Baltic Sea. From December 1982 to November 1984 she underwent an overhaul and modernization in Mykolaiv. From 1985, the practice of operating Yakovlev Yak-38s in STOL mode instead of VTOL was introduced, allowing an increase in aircraft payload and range, and a replacement of Kamov Ka-25 helicopters with Kamov Ka-27 started. In 1985 &quot;Kiev&quot; went back to the Northern Fleet. From 1987 she mainly stayed in Severomorsk. In December 1989 she was moved to reserve. After the disintegration of the USSR, the ship was taken by Russia. Due to a low military budget and worsening ship&#x27;s condition, she was retired on 30 June 1993.

==Post-service life==
In 1996 &quot;Kiev&quot; was sold to Binhai Aircraft Park, a theme park in Tianjin, China. The concept was developed by world tourism and attraction consultant Leisure Quest International.

In August 2011, ex-&quot;Kiev&quot; was developed into a luxury hotel after renovations costing £9.6 million.

<text>Edwards Amasa Park (December 29, 1808June 4, 1900) was an American Congregational theologian.

==Biography==
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Park was the son of Calvin Park (1774-1847) (a Congregational minister who was a professor from 1804 to 1825 at Brown University, and pastor at Stoughton, Massachusetts from 1826 to 1840). Edwards Amasa Park graduated at Brown University in 1826, was a teacher at Braintree for two years, and in 1831 graduated from Andover Theological Seminary. He was co-pastor (with R. S. Storrs) of the orthodox Congregational church of Braintree in 1831-1833; professor of mental and moral philosophy at Amherst in 1835; and Bartlet professor of sacred rhetoric (1836-1847), and Abbot professor of Christian theology (1847-1881) at Andover. He died at Andover on 4 June 1900.

An ardent admirer of Jonathan Edwards, whose great-granddaughter he married, Park was one of the most notable American theologians and orators. He was the most prominent leader of the new school of New England Theology. He left his theological impress on the &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot;, which he and Bela B. Edwards took over in 1844 from Edward Robinson, who had founded it in 1843, and of which Park was assistant editor until 1851 and editor-in-chief from 1851 to 1884.

==Publications==
As a general statement of the position of orthodox Congregationalism he drew up and annotated the &quot;Associate Creed of Andover Theological Seminary&quot; (1883), and the anonymously published &quot;Worcester Creed&quot; of 1884 was his popularized and simplified statement. He edited in 1890 &quot;The Atonement&quot;, a collection of essays by various hands, prefaced by his study of the &quot;Rise of the Edwardean Theory of the Atonement&quot;.

Park&#x27;s sermon, &quot;The Theology of the Intellect and that of the Feelings&quot;, delivered in 1850 before the convention of the Congregational ministers of Massachusetts, and published in the &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; of July 1850, was the cause of a long and bitter controversy, metaphysical rather than doctrinal, with Charles Hodge. Some of Park&#x27;s sermons were published in 1885, under the title &quot;Discourses on Some Theological Doctrines as Related to the Religious Character&quot;. With Austin Phelps and Lowell Mason he prepared &quot;The Sabbath Hymn Book&quot; (1858).

He published memoirs of Samuel Hopkins, Nathanael Emmons, and others. See &quot;Professor Park and His Pupils&quot; (Boston, 1899), a memorial of his 90th birthday, with articles by R.S. Storrs, G.R.W. Scott, Joseph Cook, G. Frederick Wright, and others.

<text>Bernard Pivot (; 5 May 1935 – 6 May 2024) was a French journalist, interviewer and host of cultural television programmes. He was chairman of the Académie Goncourt from 2014 to 2020.

==Biography==
Pivot was born in Lyon on 5 May 1935, the son of two grocers. During World War II his father, Charles Pivot, was taken prisoner and his mother moved the family home to the village of Quincié-en-Beaujolais, where Bernard Pivot started school. In 1945 his father was released and the reunited family returned to Lyon. At age 10 Pivot went to a Catholic boarding school where he discovered a passion for sport, while he was more average at traditional school subjects, except French and history.

After starting law studies in Lyon Pivot entered the Centre de formation des journalistes (CFJ) in Paris, where he met his future wife, Monique. He graduated second in his class. After an internship at &quot;Le Progrès&quot; in Lyon, he studied economic journalism for a full year, and then joined the &quot;Figaro Littéraire&quot; in 1958.

In 1970 he hosted a humorous daily radio programme . In 1971 the &quot;Figaro Littéraire&quot; closed and Pivot joined &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. He left in 1974 after a disagreement with Jean d&#x27;Ormesson. Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber invited him to start a new project, which led to the creation of a new magazine, &quot;Lire&quot;, a year later. Meanwhile, he had begun hosting a television programme in April 1973 called &quot;&quot; on the First Channel of the ORTF. In 1974, the ORTF was dissolved and Pivot started his &quot;Apostrophes&quot; programme. &quot;Apostrophes&quot; was first broadcast on Antenne 2 on 10 January 1975, and ran until 1990. Pivot then created &quot;Bouillon de culture&quot;, with the aim of broadening people&#x27;s interests beyond reading. However, he eventually returned to books.

Pivot died of cancer in Neuilly-sur-Seine, on 6 May 2024, at the age of 89.

==Spelling championships==

In 1985, Pivot created the &quot;Championnats d&#x27;orthographe&quot; (&quot;Spelling Championships&quot;) with linguist Micheline Sommant, which in 1992 became &quot;Championnats mondiaux d&#x27;orthographe&quot; (&quot;World Spelling Championships&quot;), then the &quot;Dicos d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;Golden Dictionaries&quot;) in 1993.

==Pivot and James Lipton==
James Lipton was inspired to create &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; by a chance viewing of a Pivot programme on cable TV. Lipton adapted Pivot&#x27;s use of a Proust Questionnaire to one that he himself used at the end of each episode of &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;.

However, the question &quot;&quot;If God exists&quot;, &quot;what would you like Him to tell you when you&#x27;re dead?&quot; was considered potentially offensive to US audiences and replaced by a more acceptable &quot;If&quot; &quot;heaven&quot; &quot;exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?&quot;&quot;

Pivot became aware that Lipton was inspired by his questionnaire and invited him to appear on the final episode of &quot;Bouillon de culture&quot;.

==Television work==

* &quot;Apostrophes&quot; (1975–1990)
* &quot;Bouillon de culture&quot; (1991–2001)
* &quot;&quot; (2002–2006)

== Defence of paedophilia ==
On 26 November 1973, Pivot invited the paedophile novelist Tony Duvert onto his show &quot;Ouvrez les guillemets&quot;. Duvert refused, letting his editor and supporters Jérôme Lindon and Alain Robbe-Grillet promote his book.

In January 1975, Yves Berger, the literary director of Éditions Grasset and Pierre Sabbagh&#x27;s cultural adviser on the 2nd channel of French television, persuaded Jacqueline Baudrier, in charge of the 1st channel, to replace Marc Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Italics&quot; with Pivot&#x27;s &quot;Ouvrez les guillemets&quot; talk show. On 30 May 1975, he received Vladimir Nabokov, the author of &quot;Lolita&quot; on &quot;Apostrophes&quot;; on 12 December 1976, Michel Foucault, who criticised psychoanalysis and &quot;contractual sexuality&quot; based on consent or non-consent, with René Schérer, Guy Hocquenghem and François Châtelet; on 14 October 1983, Renaud Camus, defender of the paedophile cause; on 23 April 1982, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who described having ambiguous relations with children in kindergarten; on 2 March 1990, Gabriel Matzneff, a noted paedophile whose book &quot;Mes amours décomposés&quot; was highly criticised; on 23 February 2001, Catherine Dolto, to talk about the legalisation of paedophilia on &quot;Bouillon de Culture&quot;; and in 2005, Michel Tournier, whose references to paedophilia were published in La Pléiade in 2017.
On 17 March 2013, Pivot defended Alexandre Postel&#x27;s book &quot;Un homme effacé&quot;, which described a man who owns explicit pictures of children on his computer, and on 30 October 2016, &quot;La Mauvaise vie&quot; by Frédéric Mitterrand, as a &quot;brave book, very brave, a kind of secular confession where each confession, as in Georges Perec&#x27;s &quot;Je me souviens…&quot;, starts with &quot;Je regrette…&quot;.
In 2017, neuropsychiatrist Louis Masquin, in the Catholic magazine &quot;La Croix&quot;, described the introduction of paedophilic literature on French television in Pivot&#x27;s shows as the &quot;reflection of the &quot;paedophile adventure&quot;, &quot;considered approximately normal&quot;.

In 2019, Pivot wrote on Twitter that &quot;cardinals, bishops and priests who rape children don&#x27;t believe in heaven or hell&quot;, criticising the influence of the Vatican II reform. In September 2019, he declared on Twitter: &quot;In my generation, boys looked for little Swedish girls who had the reputation of being more open than French girls. I imagine our surprise, our fear, if we had approached a Greta Thunberg&quot;. Julien Bayou, from the environmentalist party Europe Écologie – Les Verts, replied: &quot;You&#x27;re talking about a minor&quot; and French feminist Caroline de Haas asked him to delete his post, something he refused to do. He was immediately defended by far-right essayist Éric Zemmour. In December, Pivot apologised for allowing Gabriel Matzneff to describe his relationships with teenage girls and boys on his literary talk shows without challenging him.

In July 2021, Pivot posted a tweet about actress Françoise Arnoul, who had just died, in which he remarked that &quot;young people in the 1950s dreamed about her breasts. But the ones seen in &quot;The Wreck&quot; were not hers. She confessed it to me on a broadcast. Still a minor, she was not allowed to be filmed naked.&quot;

<doc id="957682" wikidata="Q6009281" url="?curid=957682" title="In Death Ground">
<text>In Death Ground is a 1997 military science fiction novel by American writer David Weber and Steve White. The story is completed in the novel &quot;The Shiva Option&quot;.

The title is taken from a passage in Chapter 11 of Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;: &quot;In difficult ground, press on; On hemmed-in ground, use subterfuge; In death ground, fight.&quot; The original text is &quot;圮地則行；圍地則謀；死地則戰&quot;。

== Plot summary ==

The novel is set in a distant future. Following the accidental discovery of interstellar travel via &#x27;warp points&#x27;, humanity has expanded throughout space, evolving into a Terran Federation consisting of Core Worlds like Earth and Alpha Centauri, Corporate Worlds like Galloway&#x27;s Star, and Fringe Worlds colonized by small groups of like-minded people seeking to preserve ethnic or cultural identities from getting lost in a cosmopolitan sameness. (Tensions exist between the three groups of worlds, and are further explored in &quot;Insurrection&quot;, another novel also written by Weber and White).

Following a series of three interstellar wars (ISWs 1–3) with different species (warlike felinoid Orions and their centauroid Gorm associates, birdlike Ophiuchi, the genocidal Rigelians, and the Thebans (explored in a prequel novel &quot;Crusade&quot;), humanity has experienced a seventy-year &quot;vacation from history&quot;, i.e. seven decades of peace.

A survey squadron travels through a previously uncharted warp point and encounters a hive-like species referred to derisively as the &#x27;Bugs&#x27; (inspired by the Arachnids in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;). All attempts at communication fail, and the Bugs ambush the survey squadron, with a great loss of material and human life. Pursuing the survivors, the Bugs mount a massive invasion of Terran and Orion space.

Satellites left behind monitor the conquered planets and reveal that Bugs regard other sentient life forms as food sources; indeed the Bugs prefer to consume their prey alive. It is later revealed that the Bugs raise ranches of conquered species.

The alternative being &quot;equal opportunity genocide&quot;, Terrans, Orions, Gorm, and Ophiuchi form a Grand Alliance, with Terrans and Orions as the senior members. The novel features long and very detailed space and ground battle sequences, detailed discussions of tactical doctrine, the ongoing arms race between the Alliance and the Bugs, and the development of interpersonal relations between military people of different background and species.

The universe and novels are based on the &quot;Starfire&quot; wargame series, which David Weber helped to develop, and which has existed in various editions since 1976.

<text>Austin Phelps (January 7, 1820October 13, 1890), was an American Congregational minister and educator. He was for 10 years President of the Andover Theological Seminary and his writings became standard textbooks for Christian theological education and remain in print today.

== Biography ==

Austin Phelps was born in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. His father, Eliakim Phelps was a clergyman and the principal of a girls’ school in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Eliakim Phelps was later pastor of a Presbyterian church in Geneva, New York, where he was installed as in 1830, and in 1835 he was elected Secretary of the American Educational Society of Philadelphia.

After preparing for college, at the age of twelve Austin studied at Hobart College from 1833 to 1835, then at Amherst for six months. He was by far the youngest boy in his class and was intensely unhappy. In 1835 he rejoined his family in Philadelphia where he finally obtained a degree in 1837 from the University of Pennsylvania.

He studied theology at Union Theological Seminary (including six months of Hebrew studies under Isaac Nordheimer), at the Yale Divinity School, and later at Andover. In 1840, he was licensed to preach by the Third Presbytery of Philadelphia. In 1842, he was pastor of the Pine Street (Congregational) Church in Boston when he met and married in the autumn of that year Elizabeth Stuart (August 13, 1815November 30, 1852). She was the eldest daughter of Moses Stuart, president of Andover Theological Seminary. His wife Elizabeth Stuart, aside from Jacob Abbott, was one of the earliest writers of books for girls, publishing the four volume &quot;Kitty Brown&quot; series of books for girls under the pen name H. Trusta and other books. They had three children, Mary Gray (b. 1844), Moses Stuart (b. 1849) and Amos Lawrence (b. 1852).

In the spring of 1848 he moved his family to Andover, Massachusetts, where he became professor of sacred rhetoric and homiletics at Andover Theological Seminary. In 1869 he was selected as president of Andover, a role he served in until 1879 when failing health forced him to resign.

For seven months in 1850, his father Eliakim&#x27;s home in Stratford, CT was the site of bizarre spiritualist rappings and phenomena which were widely reported in the press. These events were an influence on Austin&#x27;s daughter Mary Gray Phelps (1844-1911), a feminist who later wrote three popular spiritualist novels under the name Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward.

After his wife Elizabeth died of brain fever on November 20, 1852, their 8-year-old daughter Mary Gray asked to be renamed in honor of her mother.
He married Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, Mary Stuart (b. 1822), in 1854, but she died only eighteen months later. He married for a third time Mary Ann Johnson (1829–1918) of Boston, with whom he had two more children, Edward and Francis. Austin died on October 13, 1890, at Bar Harbor, Maine.

== Works ==

His &quot;Theory of Preaching&quot; (1881) and &quot;English Style in Public Discourse&quot; (1883) became standard textbooks. With Professors E. A. Park and D. L. Furber he edited &quot;Hymns and Choirs&quot; (1860), and with Professor Park and Lowell Mason &quot;The Sabbath Hymn Book&quot; (1859). His book &quot;The Still Hour&quot; (1859), a summary of a series of sermons on prayer, is a devotional classic and remains in publication.

His other works are:

* &quot;The New Birth&quot; (1867), portraying conversion (in some instances) as a gradual change
* &quot;Sabbath Hours&quot; (1874)
* &quot;Studies of the Old Testament&quot; (1878)
* &quot;Men and Books&quot; (1882)
* &quot;My Portfolio&quot; (1882)
* &quot;My Study&quot; (1885)
* &quot;The Still Hour: or, Communion with God&quot; (1860)
* &quot;The Certainty of Success in Preaching&quot; (1889)
* &quot;My Note Book&quot; (1890)

== Quotes ==

&quot;Wear the old coat and buy the new book.&quot;

&quot;We are never more like Christ than in prayers of intercession.&quot;

&quot;Suffering is a wonderful fertilizer for the roots of character. The great objective of this life is character, for it is the only thing we can carry with us into eternity. And gaining as much of the highest character possible is the purpose of our trials.&quot;

<text>Francesc Fàbregas Soler (; ; born 4 May 1987) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who played as a central midfielder. He is currently the head coach of club Como.

Fàbregas came through La Masia, Barcelona&#x27;s youth academy, leaving at 16 when he was signed by Premier League club Arsenal in September 2003. Following injuries to key midfielders in the early part of the 2004–05 season, he went on establish himself in the team. He broke several of the club&#x27;s records and won the FA Cup in 2005. His performances earned him recognition, being named in the UEFA Team of the Year twice and the PFA Team of the Year twice.

After a protracted transfer saga, Fàbregas left London in August 2011 to return to Barcelona in a deal worth up to £35 million. During his three-year spell at the Camp Nou, Fàbregas played alongside Xavi and Andrés Iniesta and won a La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, the FIFA Club World Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and two Spanish Super Cups. He returned to London in June 2014 to Arsenal&#x27;s cross-town rivals Chelsea for a fee of £30 million. In four-and-a-half years at the club, he won the Premier League twice, and the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Europa League once each. He left for free to Ligue 1 club Monaco in January 2019 and retired in 2023, after one year in the Italian Serie B with Como.

Internationally, Fàbregas made his debut for the Spain national team in March 2006. He represented his country in the World Cup in 2006, 2010 and 2014, in the European Championship in 2008, 2012 and 2016, and in the Confederations Cup in 2009 and 2013. He was a key figure in Spain&#x27;s European Championship victories in 2008 and 2012 and their 2010 World Cup triumph, in which he supplied the pass for Andrés Iniesta&#x27;s winning goal in the final. In October 2015, Fàbregas earned his 100th cap for Spain.

== Early years ==
Born in Arenys de Mar, Barcelona, Catalonia, to Francesc Fàbregas Sr., who runs a property company, and Núria Soler, the owner of a pastry company, Fàbregas has supported FC Barcelona since childhood and went to his first match when he was nine months old with his grandfather.

He began his club football career with CE Mataró before being signed for Barcelona&#x27;s La Masia youth academy aged ten in 1997. It is said that his first coach, Señor Blai, limited Fàbregas&#x27; appearances in matches against Barcelona to reduce the risk of him being scouted by the club, though he eventually joined their academy. Despite initial attempts to retain him, Mataró eventually permitted Fàbregas to train with Barcelona one day per week. Eventually Fàbregas joined Barcelona&#x27;s academy full-time. His initial training was as a defensive midfielder playing alongside notable names such as Gerard Piqué and Lionel Messi. Fàbregas was a prolific scorer at the youth level, occasionally scoring over 30 goals in a season, but he did not make a first-team game at the Camp Nou. During his time at Barcelona&#x27;s youth academy, Fàbregas idolised Barcelona&#x27;s then-captain and number four Pep Guardiola, who would later give Fàbregas his shirt as consolation when Fàbregas&#x27; parents divorced.

== Club career ==

=== Arsenal ===

==== Adapting to England ====
Sensing that he would have limited opportunities at Barcelona, Fàbregas joined Premier League club Arsenal in their Academy, signing for the London club on 11 September 2003. Initially, he found life difficult in England&#x27;s capital but soon struck a friendship with Spanish-speaking teammate Philippe Senderos, who helped him settle down. As a 16-year-old, Fàbregas did not contemplate breaking into the first team immediately but looked up to senior players like Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva, while concentrating on training and learning the English language. He nevertheless made his debut for Arsenal not long after, on 28 October 2003, in a League Cup tie at home to Rotherham United. In doing so, he became Arsenal&#x27;s youngest-ever first team player, aged 16 years and 177 days. He then became the youngest goalscorer in Arsenal&#x27;s history in a later round of the League Cup, scoring in a 5–1 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Although Arsenal went on to win the league unbeaten in the 2003–04 season, Fàbregas was not awarded a winner&#x27;s medal because he did not play a single league game.

It was not until the start of the 2004–05 season that the Spaniard started making first team appearances in matches outside the League Cup. His first match of the season was against Manchester United in the FA Community Shield. Following an injury to Vieira, Fàbregas stepped in and made four consecutive Premier League starts. He was praised for his performances in those games, even claiming a goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 3–0 victory, and becoming Arsenal&#x27;s youngest-ever goalscorer in a league game. With further injuries to Edu and Gilberto Silva, he received more playing time in all competitions. He signed his first professional contract with Arsenal in September 2004, which committed his long-term future to the club. In October 2004, Arsenal lost 2–0 to Manchester United, ending their 49-match unbeaten run in the Premier League. The match was dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Buffet&quot; after pizza was thrown at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson at the end of the match in the players&#x27; tunnel by a then-unknown Arsenal player. Speculation that the player was Fàbregas was confirmed in November 2011 by former Arsenal player Martin Keown on a phone-in show on BBC Radio 5 Live. In the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, he became the second-youngest goalscorer in the competition&#x27;s history after scoring the third goal against Rosenborg in a 5–1 win. He concluded his season by winning his first honours with Arsenal when he was in the starting eleven that defeated Manchester United on penalties in the 2005 FA Cup Final.

==== Making the starting eleven ====
After The Gunners&#x27; move to the Emirates Stadium in summer 2006, Fàbregas was given the number 4 shirt, which had been vacated by Patrick Vieira following his transfer to Juventus the previous year. He featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability to fill in the void left by the Frenchman. Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his own style of play and impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal&#x27;s first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, at the same time proving that he could compete against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.

Fàbregas&#x27; increase in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid expressed a desire to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would not listen to any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract was unusually long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal&#x27;s playing style and Wenger as reasons for his long-term commitment to the club.

The 2006–07 season was a learning experience for the young Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were defeated by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, emerged as one of the key creative players for the team, playing in every single league game. He kick-started Arsenal&#x27;s 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper &quot;TuttoSport&quot;, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United&#x27;s Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal&#x27;s Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.
The 2007–08 season began with much uncertainty for Arsenal. First, David Dein, the club&#x27;s vice-chairman, left amidst allegations of internal strife, followed by the departure of the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and captain, Thierry Henry, who signed for Barcelona. There was also speculation over Wenger&#x27;s future with the club. Fàbregas knew that he would become the most important player for Arsenal, but stated he was ready for the challenge. He started the season well, chalking up goals and assists, and website soccernet attributed the early success of Arsenal to the young Spaniard. His start to the season also earned him the O2 Player of the Month award from Arsenal fans for August, September and October, as well as the Premier League Player of the Month for September. With Arsenal leading the league table until March, Fàbregas was equally instrumental in the club&#x27;s 2007–08 Champions League campaign; in the return leg against Milan, the midfielder scored late in the game to send Arsenal into the quarter-finals. Though Arsenal ended the season trophyless, Fàbregas amassed several personal awards. On 11 April 2008, Fàbregas was nominated for the PFA Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards for the second year running; he was later crowned the winner of the latter, and named in the PFA Team of the Year. He was also named the 2007–08 Arsenal.com Player of the Season.

==== Captaincy ====

On 24 November 2008, 14 league games into the 2008–09 season, Fàbregas was named as the successor to William Gallas as club captain. However, just as Arsenal were getting back into the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool. The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth in the league and being knocked out at the semi-finals of the 2008–09 Champions League campaign.

In the opening league game of 2009–10 season, Fàbregas scored a brace and managed two assists in Arsenal&#x27;s 6–1 away win against Everton. Arsenal went on to secure qualification for the 2009–10 Champions League campaign by beating Celtic over two legs, but their early momentum to the season was disrupted by consecutive league game losses to Manchester United and Manchester City. The team bounced back strongly after this setback, and with Fàbregas being prolific in scoring and setting up his teammates, it went unbeaten in the next 13 games. Despite suffering four league losses even before mid-season approached, Arsenal managed to lead the league standings after 22 games. On 31 March 2010, in the Champions League first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona, Fàbregas suffered a leg fracture before scoring the equalising goal in the game which ended 2–2. Arsenal, who were four points behind league leaders Manchester United, were deprived of their captain for the remaining six league games of the season; they were subsequently eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League, and fell out of the league title race. Fàbregas was later named to the PFA Team of the Year.

Before the start of the 2010–11 season, there was once again intense media speculation about the Spaniard&#x27;s future, and in June 2010, a €35 million bid from Barcelona was rejected. The 2010–11 season turned out to be an extremely competitive one in the Premier League; even though Arsenal had lost five games before mid-season, they were jostling for pole position with Manchester United and Manchester City. Going into late February, Arsenal were still in contention for the quadruple, but within a span of two weeks they lost in the League Cup final, were eliminated by Barcelona in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, and defeated in the FA Cup quarter-final.

=== Barcelona ===

==== 2011–12 season ====

On 15 August 2011, Barcelona signed Fàbregas for an initial fee of €29 million with a further €5 million in variables, plus Fàbregas would pay Arsenal €1 million a year from his wage for five years, ending one of the most protracted transfer sagas in recent times. Statistics show that in the five years prior to Fàbregas&#x27;s departure from Arsenal, Fàbregas created 466 goal-scoring chances, made 86 assists and scored 48 goals, all three statistics topping those of new teammates Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, despite both having made more appearances in the same period.

Fàbregas joined a team that had won three La Liga titles in a row and two Champions League titles in three years, and one that featured the likes of Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and David Villa. He made his debut in the second leg of the Supercopa de España, coming on as a substitute against Real Madrid. Fàbregas drew a red card in the 90+4th after being the target of a dangerous challenge from Marcelo. Barcelona won the tie 3–2 and 5–4 on aggregate. He scored his first goal in a 2–0 win against Porto as Barcelona won the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, and his first league goal on his league debut, a 5–0 home win over Villarreal. He went on to score three more league goals in the month of September, including a late equaliser in the 2–2 away draw to Valencia.

Fàbregas then spent the majority of October sidelined with a hamstring injury picked up on international duty. He made his return, and scored, in a 4–0 away victory to Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League. He then made his league return in the 2–2 draw away to Athletic Bilbao, scoring a goal in the same match. Fàbregas then went on to score a brace in a 5–0 home victory against Levante before netting in a 3–1 away victory against Real Madrid. Fàbregas later scored against Brazilian club Santos to help Barcelona to a 4–0 victory in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup final.

Fàbregas got another brace in a 4–0 victory against Osasuna in the Copa del Rey. He also scored in the semi-final of the competition against Valencia to help Barcelona to the final with a 3–1 win on aggregate. He kept a regular run in the Barcelona side for the rest of the season, including appearances in both semi-final legs of the 3–2 aggregate defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League, and a substitute appearance in the 3–0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final.

Fàbregas ended his first season at Barcelona by winning the 2011–12 Copa del Rey, 2011 Supercopa de España, 2011 UEFA Super Cup and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, notching 15 goals and 20 assists in 48 appearances and four best midfielder awards.

==== 2012–13 season ====
Fàbregas ended his long goal drought for his club when he scored his first league goals of the season with a brace against Sevilla in a 3–2 away victory. He then scored three goals in October, coming in the league, Champions League and the Copa del Rey. He scored again on 25 November in a 4–0 win away to Levante. On 13 January 2013, Fàbregas scored in a 3–1 win away to Málaga. Fàbregas scored his first hat-trick of his career against Mallorca in a 5–0 victory on 6 April 2013. He ended his second season at Barcelona by winning the first league title of his career, with a record 100 points. Barcelona were eliminated, however, in the semi-finals of both the Copa del Rey, to rivals Real Madrid, and the Champions League, to winners Bayern Munich. Fàbregas ended the season with 14 goals and 12 assists in 48 appearances in all competitions.

==== 2013–14 season ====
Barcelona began the season by winning the Supercopa de España. In the opening game of the league season on 18 August, Fàbregas provided five assists in a 7–0 win over Levante. He scored 8 goals in 36 league matches, including braces in away wins over Granada on 10 November and Getafe on 22 December, the latter including a penalty kick. He also scored the only goal of the game on 1 October as Barcelona won away at Celtic in the group stage of the Champions League, heading in Alexis Sánchez&#x27;s cross in the 73rd minute.

=== Chelsea ===
On 12 June 2014, Premier League club Chelsea signed Fàbregas on a five-year contract for a fee in the region of €33 million. Following his transfer he took the number 4 shirt, previously worn by David Luiz. Fàbregas spoke of his transfer, saying, &quot;I asked Barcelona to find a way for me to leave the club. The president tried to stop the sale, but I already had my mind made up.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d be happy at Chelsea, I would&#x27;ve never made this decision. Above all, I want to be happy both professionally and personally.&quot;

==== 2014–15 season ====
Fàbregas made his competitive debut for Chelsea on 18 August as the team began their league season away to Burnley; he played the full 90 minutes of a 3–1 victory, providing two assists. He was a nominee for the Premier League Player of the Month in August 2014, with the accolade going instead to another new Chelsea signing, Diego Costa. On 13 September 2014, after providing two assists in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–2 victory over Swansea City, Fàbregas became the first player ever in Premier League history to record at least one assist in six successive games; four under Chelsea and two under Arsenal during the 2010–11 season. Four days later, he scored his first goal for the club, opening a 1–1 draw at home against Schalke 04 in Chelsea&#x27;s first match of the Champions League group stage.

His first league goal for Chelsea gave them a 2–1 win at Crystal Palace on 18 October, capping off a 19-pass move. Fàbregas also completed 123 passes, the most by any player on either side. On 10 December, with Chelsea already through to the knockout stage as group winners, Fàbregas scored an eighth-minute penalty to open a 3–1 Champions League victory over Sporting CP. Twelve days later he scored a second league goal, set up by Eden Hazard and concluding a 2–0 win away to Stoke.

Fàbregas was fitted with a protective mask after breaking his nose in a collision with Charlie Adam during the reverse fixture on 4 April. Eight days later, he scored the only goal of the game in the 88th minute in a victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. On 3 May, the day before his 28th birthday, he won his first Premier League title at the ninth attempt, following a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace. During the penultimate game of the season, away at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, Fàbregas was shown the red card and booed off by fans for deliberately kicking the ball at Chris Brunt&#x27;s head while players were speaking to referee Mike Jones. On appeal, the suspension for this red card was cut from three matches to one.

==== 2015–16 season ====
Fàbregas scored his first goal of the season on 16 September, as Chelsea defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 4–0 in the Champions League. He, Costa and Oscar were jeered by the crowd in December after the dismissal of Mourinho, with the supporters believing that the trio&#x27;s conduct and poor performances were more culpable for the team&#x27;s poor form. His first league goal came in a 3–3 home draw against Everton on 15 January 2016 and his second came in a 2–1 away win against Southampton on 27 February 2016. On 19 March 2016, Fàbregas scored a free-kick as well as a penalty in 2–2 home draw against local rivals West Ham United. Fàbregas scored Chelsea&#x27;s last goal of the season after converting a penalty in the 1–1 draw against new Premier League champions, Leicester City.

==== 2016–17 season ====
Fàbregas was linked with a move away from London after he was an unused substitution in the 2016–17 Premier League opener against West Ham. On 20 August 2016, Fàbregas once again started on the bench against Watford, entering the match in the second half to replace Nemanja Matić and creating an assist for Diego Costa, who scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In the post-match press conference, Fàbregas earned the praise of manager, Conte, for his inspiring performance in the comeback win as well as the attitude he shows during training sessions. Fàbregas&#x27;s first two goals of the season came in an EFL Cup tie against Leicester City on 20 September, both coming within two minutes of each other in extra time to win the game 4–2, the victory moving Chelsea on to the Round of 16.

After a month long absence due to an injury, Fàbregas played a full 90 minute to for Chelsea u23 against Southampton u23 on 21 November 2016. During the match, he provided two assists to fellow first team player, Michy Batshuayi, and helped earn a 3–2 victory. Fàbregas saw his first league action since September in a game against Manchester City on 3 December 2016. Chelsea were trailing 1–0 when Fàbregas picked out Diego Costa with a long ball into the box. Costa brought the ball down and fired it into the net to equalise. Fàbregas came off the bench against West Bromwich Albion on 11 December 2016 and immediately made an impact on the deadlocked match, finding Diego Costa once again with a long ball that led to the winning goal. On 14 December 2016, Fàbregas led Chelsea to their tenth consecutive league victory with his first league goal of the season, scoring in the 40th minute against Sunderland. In his fifth league start of the season, on 31 December 2016, Fàbregas recorded his 100th Premier League assist in his 293rd appearance in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–2 home victory over Stoke City; he became the fastest player in Premier League history to reach this landmark, taking 74 fewer appearances than Ryan Giggs.

On 4 February 2017, Fàbregas scored against former club Arsenal when he collected goalkeeper Petr Cech&#x27;s poor clearance and chipped the ball back over him. He did not celebrate the goal out of respect to his former club. On 25 February, Fàbregas marked his 300th Premier League appearances with a goal and an assist as Chelsea defeated Swansea City 3–1. In the same match, he also reached 102 assists in the Premier League, equalling Frank Lampard as the league&#x27;s second-highest provider of all time.

==== Subsequent seasons ====
In the 2017–18 season, Fàbregas made 49 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals in a campaign which saw Chelsea win the FA Cup against Manchester United. He passed the ball to Eden Hazard who was fouled for a penalty, which the Belgian scored as the only goal of the game.

On 5 January 2019, Fàbregas played his final game in English football, a 2–0 home win over Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup. He took a penalty which was saved by Luke Steele. Fàbregas was in tears at the end of the game.

=== Monaco ===

On 11 January 2019, Fàbregas signed for Monaco on a deal until June 2022. He was signed by his former Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry, and there was no transfer fee, although Chelsea would receive payments related to his performances. He made his debut in Ligue 1 two days later a 1–1 draw against Marseille. On 2 February, he scored his first goal in a 2–1 win against Toulouse.

Fàbregas was sent off on the first day of the 2019–20 Ligue 1 season, in a 3–0 home loss to Lyon. His foul on Léo Dubois after 30 minutes was upgraded from a yellow to red card by VAR review. On 20 November 2020, Fàbregas scored the winning goal for Monaco in a 3–2 win over Paris Saint-Germain, which was their first win against PSG since August 2016. From December 2020 up to February 2021 he was injured in his left calf muscle.

In 2021–22, Fàbregas missed most of the season with a hamstring injury. He attempted a comeback for the reserve team on 22 April 2022 at home to Aubagne in the fourth-tier Championnat National 2, but was taken off after 40 minutes with an ankle complaint. Having totalled 36 minutes over two games of Ligue 1 football in his final season, he was released at the end of his contract in June 2022 but said that he would not retire.

=== Como and retirement ===
On 1 August 2022, Fàbregas was unveiled as a new player for Serie B club Como, signing a two-year contract. He made his debut 28 days later, playing the final 18 minutes as a substitute in a 1–0 home loss to Brescia.

Fàbregas announced his retirement from football on 1 July 2023.

== International career ==

=== Youth team ===

Although he features regularly for the Spain national football team, Fàbregas&#x27; international career began at youth level. At the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship held in Finland, he finished as top scorer of the tournament despite playing in midfield, and was voted Player of the Tournament. Spain finished runners-up in the tournament to Brazil. Fàbregas was next involved in the 2004 UEFA U-17 European Championship, where Spain also finished runners-up. He was named the Golden Player of the tournament by FIFA.

===Senior team===

In 2006, Fàbregas debuted for the Spanish senior squad in a friendly match against Ivory Coast. He became the youngest player capped for Spain in 70 years, beating Sergio Ramos&#x27; record. He received favourable reviews for his debut and was involved in the build-up to Spain&#x27;s first goal in the 3–2 victory over the Ivorians.

====2006 World Cup====
On 15 May 2006, Fàbregas was selected for the Spanish 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. During the tournament, he came on as a second-half substitute in Spain&#x27;s first two group matches, contributing an assist to striker Fernando Torres in their 3–1 victory against Tunisia. He started alongside Spain&#x27;s reserve players (including then-Arsenal teammate José Antonio Reyes) in Spain&#x27;s third group match against Saudi Arabia. He earned a starting role in Spain&#x27;s first knockout-stage match against France, in place of Marcos Senna, but Spain lost 3–1. Fàbregas also became the youngest player in Spanish football history to participate in a World Cup when he came on as a substitute for Luis García after 77 minutes in the 4–0 victory against Ukraine on 13 June 2006; he was then 19 years and 41 days old. He was later nominated for the Gillette Young Player of the World Cup, but Germany&#x27;s Lukas Podolski won the award.

====UEFA Euro 2008====

In UEFA Euro 2008, Fàbregas was handed the squad number 10, rather than 18 which he had previously held. Despite featuring mostly as a substitute, the midfielder made a considerable impact in Spain&#x27;s campaign. He scored his first international goal in that competition in Spain&#x27;s 4–1 win over Russia and also had an assist in that game. In the quarter-finals against Italy, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty in the penalty shoot-out after the teams remained deadlocked 0–0 after extra time. In the semi-finals, Spain defeated Russia 3–0 with Fàbregas providing two assists. The midfielder made the starting eleven in the Final against Germany where Spain prevailed 1–0, which was Spain&#x27;s first major title since 1964. For his efforts, Fàbregas was named in the Team of the Tournament, a 23-man squad selected by the UEFA Technical Team.

====2009 Confederations Cup====
After missing out for several months due to his injury, Fàbregas regained his place as a regular in Vicente del Bosque&#x27;s squad. In June, he was named in the team for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. He scored his second international goal in a 5–0 win against New Zealand in the competition&#x27;s group stage. In the semi-finals against the United States, which Fàbregas started, Spain suffered a shock 2–0 loss, and its 15-game winning streak came to an end.

====2010 World Cup====
Fàbregas was selected as a part of del Bosque&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. With del Bosque preferring a starting midfield of Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso, Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, Fàbregas did not start in any of Spain&#x27;s games in the competition. He featured as a substitute in four of their seven matches, in which Spain lost their opening game against Switzerland before winning the next six en route to the final. In the final against the Netherlands, Fàbregas set up the extra-time winner for Iniesta to win Spain the World Cup for the first time in their history.

==== UEFA Euro 2012 ====

Fàbregas was selected as a part of del Bosque&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2012.
Fàbregas started in the centre of the front three of a 4–3–3 formation against Italy in Spain&#x27;s opening Group C match, essentially acting as a false 9. In the 64th minute he scored the equaliser after Italy had taken the lead in the 61st minute; the game finished in a 1–1 draw. He then scored his second goal of the tournament in the next group stage match against Ireland, which ended in a 4–0 win to Spain. When Spain faced Portugal in the semi-finals and the game remained scoreless at the end of extra time, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty of the shootout as Spain prevailed 4–2. In the final against Italy, Fàbregas started and provided the assist to David Silva for the game&#x27;s opening goal, en route to a 4–0 Spain victory.

==== 2013 Confederations Cup ====
Fàbregas was named in the provisional squad in the lead up to the 2013 Confederations Cup by del Bosque. He made two starts in the competition and one substitute appearance, all during the group stage of the competition, and assisting a goal in Spain&#x27;s opening group match against Uruguay, which Spain won 2–1. Spain won all their group matches, only conceding a goal and scoring 15. Spain advanced to the final of the competition for the first time, after a lengthy and difficult semi-final clash in a re-match against their opponents of the European Championship Final of the previous year, Italy. The match ended 0–0 after extra time and Spain won 7–6 in the resulting penalty shoot-out, but were eventually defeated 3–0 in the final by hosts and defending champions Brazil.

==== 2014 World Cup ====

Fàbregas was named in Spain&#x27;s 30-man provisional squad for the World Cup, and was also included in the final list for the tournament. He made his debut in the tournament in the opening 1–5 defeat to the Netherlands, replacing David Silva for the last 12 minutes. With Spain already eliminated, he played 22 minutes of 3–0 win against Australia in the last group game, this time in place of Santi Cazorla.

====UEFA Euro 2016====
On 31 March 2015, Fàbregas captained Spain for the first time, in their 0–2 friendly defeat to the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Arena. He earned his 100th cap on 12 October 2015, becoming the tenth Spaniard to do so, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Ukraine with Spain already qualified. In his milestone match at the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv, he won a first-half penalty when fouled by Oleksandr Kucher, but his spot kick was saved by Andriy Pyatov. He started all of Spain&#x27;s matches at the finals, coming as a substitute in each of the three group games and playing the entirety of the defeat by Italy in the Round of 16 which ended their participation.

====2018 World Cup====
Fàbregas was not selected for the Spain squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup (his Chelsea colleagues Pedro, Álvaro Morata and Marcos Alonso were also overlooked after the club&#x27;s disappointing season); he instead joined the BBC as a studio analyst for the tournament.

==Managerial career==

On 1 July 2023, Fàbregas was appointed as head coach of Como&#x27;s under-19 and B-teams following his retirement from professional football. He obtained his UEFA A coaching licence in 2023.

Following the dismissal of Moreno Longo on 13 November 2023, Fàbregas was promoted to first-team head coach on an interim basis. As he had no UEFA Pro coaching licence by the time of his appointment, he was handed a special dispensation to fill in as head coach for one month. On 20 December, Como announced the appointment of Osian Roberts as the new caretaker manager until the end of season, while Fàbregas would stay on as an assistant to the first team coaching staff. Fàbregas&#x27;s final game in charge of the club was a 3–3 home draw against Palermo on 23 December.

After Roberts took Como from 7th to 3rd place, the club managed to win automatic promotion to Serie A, with Fàbregas staying as assistant for the remainder of the season. On 19 July 2024, just days after being admitted to the UEFA Pro coaching course organised yearly in Coverciano by the Italian Football Federation, Fàbregas was formally appointed in charge of Como, signing a four-year contract as head coach.

Fàbregas&#x27;s debut as the permanent manager of Como on 11 August 2024 was a 1–1 draw away to Sampdoria in the first round of the Coppa Italia, subsequently losing on penalties. Eight days later in his first game in Serie A, the club lost 3–0 away to Juventus.

== Style of play ==

=== Arsenal ===

Originally brought to Arsenal as a youth to slowly develop via the League Cup, Fàbregas was unexpectedly deployed as Arsenal&#x27;s starting central midfielder following a midfield injury crisis during the 2004–05 season. At the time, defensive midfielder Vieira served as his role model and mentor, and he styled his game after his childhood hero and compatriot Pep Guardiola, whose shirt number 4 he would inherit in his subsequent move to Barcelona in 2011. Because he was of a different mould from his Arsenal predecessors who played in the same position, this led to criticisms of his lightweight frame and less aggressive style of play, due to his development in the Barcelona Youth Academy, with former teammate Ashley Cole criticising the Spaniard as &quot;an unproven featherweight&quot; in his autobiography.

However, it did not take long for Fàbregas to become one of the most coveted and celebrated young talents in the game with his success at Arsenal. Functioning mostly as a playmaker and renowned for his passing range, he was described as the general of Arsenal&#x27;s first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal&#x27;s intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age. He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, as exemplified by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006–07 season. Between 2006–07 and 2010–11, Fàbregas created the most chances in the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.

Fàbregas quickly started assuming responsibility for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. After the 2007–08 season, Fàbregas began maturing as a goalscorer, scoring 11 goals in his first 16 games, prompting Arsene Wenger to compare the Spaniard to Michel Platini. Through his career at Arsenal, Fàbregas played as a central midfielder in a two-man midfield pivot (usually next to a more defensive player like Edu, Patrick Vieira, Gilberto Silva, Mathieu Flamini or Abou Diaby), a box-to-box &#x27;number 8&#x27; in a three-man midfield, and later as a &#x27;number 10&#x27; in his prime.

=== Barcelona and Spain ===

At Barcelona, Fàbregas continued to play a prominent midfield and playmaking role, although he was moved into a less talismanic role than that which he had occupied at Arsenal. His new surroundings at Barcelona were comparable with what he had played with the Spanish national team. In Pep Guardiola&#x27;s 4–3–3 formation, he was suggested to be a good profile fit for the trademark patient, attacking, &quot;tiki-taka&quot; build-up style of play, also associated in the international setup under Luis Aragonés and Vicente del Bosque. Fàbregas was used in a variety of different roles under Guardiola. Due to the presence of Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Andrés Iniesta in the three-man midfield, as well as the emerging Thiago, Fàbregas was often employed as a supporting forward, or even out of position as a winger under Guardiola. He regularly performed in the role that Lionel Messi had occupied during the previous season, functioning as a false-9 in a 4–6–0 formation (a role which he would also regularly play for Spain at Euro 2012 under Del Bosque), whilst Messi would play as a right winger or second forward. Fàbregas was used in deeper roles on occasion, as an attacking, deep-lying or central playmaking midfielder, in particular under Guardiola&#x27;s immediate successors, Tito Vilanova and Gerardo Martino. While Fàbregas&#x27; time at Barcelona was deemed to be successful, critics argued that there was a sense that he was not used to his maximum ability as at Arsenal &amp; &#x27;shoe-horned&#x27; under Guardiola rather than given a consistent midfield berth like Iniesta or Xavi, an admission that Fàbregas himself acknowledged.

=== Chelsea ===
Upon returning to England, Fàbregas moved back to playing a playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control and vision to dictate the tempo of play. He was often supported by defensive midfielders in order to give him more space and time on the ball due to his then-deteriorating lack of pace &amp; athleticism. In this deeper creative position, although playing in a significantly less dynamic role than at Arsenal or Barcelona, he still excelled in Mourinho&#x27;s system, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider. In his penultimate seasons at Chelsea, Fàbregas was given a more limited role - often coming off the bench in efforts to wrangle technical control of the midfield or to provide further creative pressure against low blocks.

== Outside football ==

=== Personal life ===
Fàbregas married his long-time Lebanese girlfriend Daniella Semaan in May 2018. They have two daughters and a son, all born in the 2010s. In July 2013, Fàbregas won a court case over the marital home with Semaan&#x27;s ex-husband.

In July 2019 he was banned from driving in the UK for six months after being caught speeding.

=== Sponsorship ===
In 2011, Fàbregas signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier, Puma. He appeared in an advert for the new Puma PowerCat 1.12 in September 2011 and was one of the flagship wearers of Puma&#x27;s PowerCat range of football boots. When the PowerCat was succeeded by the evoPower, again Fàbregas was the forefront of Puma&#x27;s marketing campaign. In January 2014, the brand launched a C4 evoPower boot, specifically designed for just Fàbregas to wear. In 2012, Fàbregas signed an endorsement deal with Soul Electronics to sport Ludacris&#x27; signature line of headphones.

=== Other projects ===
Fàbregas starred in his own one-time only television programme, called &quot;The Cesc Fàbregas Show: Nike Live&quot;, that aired on 19 May 2008. The programme was sponsored by Nike and was shown on Sky Sports. The show featured Fàbregas in several sketches with then Arsenal teammates like Philippe Senderos and Nicklas Bendtner, as well as coach Arsène Wenger, Fàbregas&#x27; parents and &quot;Little Britain&quot; star Matt Lucas.

===Punditry===
For the 2018 World Cup, Fàbregas was a pundit for the BBC&#x27;s coverage. He featured alongside Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker.

<text>The Shiva Option, published by Baen Books, is the sequel to David Weber and Steve White&#x27;s military science fiction novel &quot;In Death Ground&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The Grand Alliance of Terrans, Orions, Gorm and Ophiuchi has suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Bugs during the Pesthouse Campaign. Many senior military commanders have been lost, along with the bulk of the Terran Federation pre-war fleet. The Bugs appear unstoppable and fight their way toward Federation space, reaching the key system of Alpha Centauri before they are narrowly repulsed. Now, with the war once more at a stalemate, the Grand Alliance must try to recover their losses and break the deadlock.

Unable to communicate or negotiate with the Bugs, the Alliance realises that the war has become a fight for the survival of their respective species and invoke Directive 18, last used against the Rigelians, and embark upon a war of species extermination. Hope arrives when the Alliance infers that, due to differences in construction methods, they can be faced by no more than five Bug Home systems. They also postulate that the massive Bug fleets are, in fact, the result of years of military build-up. The reason for this seemingly unnecessary military reserve remains unknown.

After finding a hidden route into one of the Bug home systems, the new military commanders of the Grand Alliance invoke Directive 18 and carry out a series of devastating attacks on the planet, launching massive waves of antimatter missiles against the surface in order to sterilize it. The simultaneous death of billions of their fellows leaves the surviving Bug fleet temporarily incapacitated, seeming to confirm the Alliance analysts speculation that the Bugs are telepathic. This “psychic shock” effect becomes known as the “Shiva Option” (named after the Hindu God of Destruction). Soon it becomes Alliance doctrine to exercise the Shiva Option wherever possible, in order to incapacitate Bug mobile forces and reduce resistance. Gradually, the Grand Alliance takes the initiative, forcing the Bugs onto the defensive.

Meanwhile, Terran Federation Survey Flotilla 19, last seen headed into unknown space and cut off from Alliance territory by the Bug counter-offensive, runs a desperate gauntlet to try to find a way back to friendly territory, whilst fending off almost continuous Bug attacks. Eventually, they stumble across the Star Union of Crucis, a multi-species polity that fought the bugs more than a century ago and have been in hiding ever since, rebuilding their forces. It transpires that the Bug military build-up was prompted by their first war with the Crucians. The commander of the survey team establishes communications with the Crucians and they unite against the pursuing Bug forces, destroying them. Seeing an opportunity to destroy their ancient enemies for good, the Crucians willingly offer themselves as new members of the Grand Alliance against the Bugs. In return, the commander of the flotilla releases the latest military technology to the Crucians and their allies, the Telikans and the Zarkolyans. Fighting their way back to Alliance space, the Crucians finally establish contact and formalize their membership of the Grand Alliance.

Now trapped between their old and new enemies, the Bugs fight an increasingly desperate defensive war. When the three remaining Bug home systems are cut off from each other, the Grand Alliance are able to quickly overwhelm the remaining Bug forces and successfully carry out Directive 18.

With one exception – a small Bug colony, isolated from its home world by a hidden warp point, remains undiscovered by the Alliance...

<doc id="957687" wikidata="Q1742772" url="?curid=957687" title="Myria-">
<text>Myria- (symbol my) is a now obsolete decimal metric prefix denoting a factor of 104 (ten thousand). It originates from the Greek μύριοι (&quot;mýrioi&quot;) (myriad). The prefix was part of the original metric system adopted by France in 1795, but was not adopted when the SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.

In 1685 John Wallis proposed the usage of myrio.
Also, in 19th century English it was sometimes spelled myrio, in line with a puristic opinion by Thomas Young.

The &quot;myriametre&quot; (10 km) is occasionally encountered in 19th-century train tariffs, or in some classifications of wavelengths as the adjective &quot;myriametric&quot;. The French &quot;mesures usuelles&quot; (1812–1839) did not include any units of length greater than the &quot;toise&quot;, but the &quot;myriametre&quot; remained in use throughout this period. In Sweden and Norway, the &quot;myriametre&quot; is still common in everyday use. In these countries this unit is called &quot;mil&quot;. Of units customarily used in trade in France, the &quot;myriagramme&quot; (10 kg) was the metric replacement for an avoirdupois unit, the &quot;quartier&quot; (25 pounds). Isaac Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; still mentioned the &quot;myriaton&quot; in 1952.

The myria&#x27;s symbol of &quot;my&quot; ultimately led to its demise. In 1905 the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) assigned it the symbol &quot;M&quot;, wishing to use only single-letter symbols. This meant that myriameter, for example, was abbreviated Mm. But in the first part of the twentieth century, electrical engineers began to use capital M for the prefix mega-, as in megawatt and megohm. This usage became so widely and firmly adopted that in 1935 the CIPM adopted the prefix “mega-” with “M” as its symbol, dropping the myria- entirely. In 1975, the United States, having previously authorized use of the myriameter and myriagram in 1866, declared the terms no longer acceptable.

<doc id="957699" wikidata="Q1038158" url="?curid=957699" title="Homiletics">
<text>In religious studies, homiletics ( &quot;homilētikós&quot;, from &quot;homilos&quot;, &quot;assembled crowd, throng&quot;) is the application of the general principles of rhetoric to the specific art of public preaching. One who practices or studies homiletics may be called a &quot;homilist&quot;, or more simply, a &quot;preacher&quot;.

== Explanation ==
Homiletics, the art of preaching, studies both the composition and the delivery of religious discourses. It includes all forms of preaching, including sermons, homilies and catechetical instruction. Homiletics may be further defined as the study of the analysis, classification, preparation, composition, and delivery of sermons.

The formation of the Lyman Beecher course at Yale University resulted in an increased emphasis on homiletics. The published volumes of this series include information regarding the history and practice of the discipline.

=== Branch of pastoral theology ===
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defines homiletics as &quot;that branch of rhetoric that treats of the composition and delivery of sermons or homilies&quot;. This definition was influential in the 19th century among thinkers like John Broadus and Karl Barth. Karl resisted this definition of the term, saying that homiletics should retain a critical distance from rhetoric. The homiletic-rhetorical relationship has been a major issue in homiletic theory since the mid-20th century.

The first form of preaching was largely the homily.

=== Christian tradition: The preaching of Jesus ===
Jesus preached and commissioned his apostles to do so. His preaching included two forms of the sermon, the missionary and the ministerial. Missionary sermons are given to outsiders and correspond the Catholic &quot;magisterium.&quot; Ministerial sermons are given to those already part of the movement, corresponding to the Catholic &quot;ministerium&quot;. For example, Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount is a missionary sermon. By contrast, his discourse after the Last Supper () is ministerial.

It cannot be said that Jesus&#x27; preaching took any definite, rounded form, in the sense of a modern sermon. His aim was to sow the seed of the word, which he scattered abroad, like the sower in the parable. His commission to his Apostles included both missionary and ministerial sermoning. For examples of missionary sermoning, see , , , For examples of ministerial sermoning, see Paul the Apostle&#x27;s sermon in . In this sermon, the apostles were supported by assistants who were elected and consecrated for a purpose (e.g. Timothy and Titus). Some of these assistants had been favored with charismata. 

=== Missionary preaching ===

In missionary preaching the apostles were also assisted, but informally, by the laity, who explained the Christian doctrine to their acquaintances amongst unbelievers who, in their visits to the Christian assemblies, must have heard something of it, e.g., cf. I Cor., xiv, 23-24. This is particularly true of Justin Martyr, who, wearing his philosopher&#x27;s cloak, went about for that purpose. The sermons to the faithful in the early ages were of the simplest kind, being merely expositions or paraphrases of the passage of scripture that was read, coupled with &quot;extempore&quot; effusions of the heart. This explains why there is little or nothing in the way of sermons or homilies surviving from that period. It also explains the strange statement made by Sozomen (Hist. Eccl., VII, xix), and by Cassiodorus in his &quot;Tripartite History&quot;, which Duchesne apparently accepts, that no one preached at Rome. (Sozomen wrote about the time of Pope Xystus III, in office 432-440) Thomassin&#x27;s explanation of Sozomen&#x27;s statement is that there was no preaching in the sense of an elaborate or finished discourse before the time of Pope Leo, with the exception, perhaps, of the address on virginity by Pope Liberius (in office 352-366) to Marcellina, sister of Ambrose, on the occasion of her taking the veil, which is regarded as a private discourse.

And the reason for this he attributes to the stress of persecution. Neander (I, 420, note) says of Sozomen&#x27;s statement: &quot;The remark could not extend to the early times; but suppose it did, it meant that the sermon was only secondary. Or the fact may have been that this Eastern writer was deceived by false accounts from the West, or it may have been that the sermon in the Western Church did not occupy so important a place as it did in the Greek Church.&quot;

=== Homiletics in the Jewish tradition ===
Preaching as a regular part of worship services in Judaism can be traced back to the time of Ezra, who instituted the custom of reading a portion of the Torah, written in Hebrew, and then paraphrasing or explaining it in the vernacular, which at the time was Aramaic. This tradition was well established by the fourth century BCE. After the destruction of the temple, synagogues became central to Jewish worship and the role of the sermon increased. A regular structure arose: the speaker first quoted a verse from the Bible, then expounded on it, and finally closed with a summary and a prayer of praise. Sermons from highly regarded rabbis of this period have been preserved in the Midrash, forming part of the Talmud.

Homiletics is taught as part of the typical curriculum at modern-day rabbinical seminaries.

== Early Christian church ==
According to middle second-century writer Justin Martyr, the practice of the early church was for someone to read from the &quot;Memoirs of the Apostles or the Writings of the Prophets&quot;, meaning readings from what was to become the Christian Bible. A discourse on the text followed the reading. This was the same practice as that of the synagogues, but now with the New Testament writings added, except that in Christian churches the same person who read the scripture also explained it and there was no set lectionary of readings. Origen, a third-century theologian, preached through most books of the Old Testament and many of the New, which we have today. Origen&#x27;s sermons on the scripture are expository and evangelistic. By the fourth century, a system had developed where a reading from the Law, Prophets, Epistles, and Gospels were read in that order, followed by a sermon. John Chrysostom is recognized as one of the greatest preachers of this age. His sermons begin with exegesis, followed by application to practical problems.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia:
== Decline in the West ==

After the age here described preaching was on the decline in the West, partly because of the decay of the Latin language (cf. Fénelon, &quot;Dial.&quot;, 164), and in the East, owing to the controversies on Arianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Macedonianism, and other heresies. But still preaching was regarded as the chief duty of bishops; for instance, Cæsarius, Bishop of Arles, gave charge of all the temporal affairs of his diocese to deacons, that he might devote all his time to the reading of the Scriptures, to prayer, and to preaching. The next great name in preaching is that of Gregory the Great, particularly as a homilist. He preached twenty homilies, and dictated twenty more, because, through illness and loss of voice, he was unable to preach them personally. He urged bishops very strongly to preach; and, after holding up to them the example of the Apostles, he threatened the bishops of Sardinia. An edict was issued by King Guntram stating that the assistance of the public judges was to be used to bring to the hearing of the word of God, through fear of punishment, those who were not disposed to come through piety. The Synod of Trullo laid down that bishops should preach on all days, especially on Sundays; and, by the same synod, bishops who preached outside their own diocese were reduced to the status of priests, because being desirous of another&#x27;s harvest they were indifferent to their own – &quot;ut qui alienæ messis appetentes essent, suæ incuriosi&quot;. At the Council of Arles (813), bishops were strongly exhorted to preach; and the Council of Mainz, in the same year, laid down that bishops should preach on Sundays and feast days either themselves (&quot;suo marte&quot;) or though their vicars. In the Second Council of Reims (813), can. xiv, xv, it was enjoined that bishops should preach the homilies and sermons of the Fathers, so that all could understand. And in the Third Council of Tours (can. xvii), in the same year, bishops were ordered to make a translation of the homilies of the Fathers into the rustic Roman tongue, or theodesque—the rustic Roman tongue being a species of corrupt Latin, or patois, understood by the uneducated (Thomassin, &quot;De Benef.&quot;, II, l. III, c. lxxxv, p. 510). Charlemagne and Louis the Pious were equally insistent on the necessity of preaching. The former went so far as to appoint a special day, and any bishop who failed to preach in his cathedral before that day was to be deposed. Pastors, too, were ordered to preach to their people as best they could; if they knew the Scriptures, they were to preach them; if not, they were at least to exhort their hearers to avoid evil and do good (Sixth Council of Arles, 813, can. x).

== Middle Ages ==
According to the Catholic Encyclopedia:

The preaching of the time was characterized by:
* heavy use of Biblical quotation, integrated throughout, sometimes with a mystical interpretation shaped by Eastern influences
* sermons targeted towards the poor and ignorant
* simplicity, the aim being to impress a single striking idea
* use of familiar maxims, examples, and illustrations from life
* vivid sensory imagery for dramatic effect

Scholastic philosophy supplied an almost inexhaustible store of information; it trained the mind in analysis and precision; while, at the same time, it supplied a lucidity of order and cogency of arrangement such as we look for in vain in even the great orations of Chrysostom.

Philosophy regards man only as an intellectual being, without considering his emotions, and makes its appeal solely to his intellectual side. And, even in this appeal, philosophy, while, like algebra, speaking the formal language of intellect, is likely to be wanting from the view-point of persuasiveness, inasmuch as, from its nature, it makes for condensation rather than for amplification. The latter is the most important thing in oratory – &quot;Summa laus eloquentiæ amplificare rem ornando.&quot; Fénelon (Second Dialogue) describes it as portrayal; De Quincey, as a holding of the thought until the mind gets time to eddy about it; Newman gives an analysis of it; his own sermons are remarkable for this quality of amplification as are those of Bourdaloue on the intellectual, and those of Massillon on the intellectual-emotional side, v. g. the latter&#x27;s sermon on the Prodigal Son. Philosophy, indeed, is necessary for oratory; philosophy alone does not constitute oratory, and, if too one-sided, may have an injurious effect – &quot;Logic, therefore, so much as is useful, is to be referred to this one place with all her well-couched heads and topics, until it be time to open her contracted palm into a graceful and ornate rhetoric&quot;. What has been here stated refers to philosophy as a system, not to individual philosophers. It is scarcely necessary to say that many Scholastics, such as Thomas and Bonaventure, were noted preachers.

== Renaissance ==

The next noted period in the history of preaching is the Renaissance, with the rise of humanism. The motto of two representative humanists, Reuchlin and Erasmus, was: &quot;Back to Cicero and Quintilian.&quot; Erasmus on visiting Rome exclaimed: &quot;Quam mellitas eruditorum hominum confabulationes, quot mundi lumina.&quot; Pierre Batiffol says: &quot;One Good Friday, preaching before the pope, the most famous orator of the Roman Court considered that he could not better praise the Sacrifice of Calvary than by relating the self-devotion of Decius and the sacrifice of Iphigenia.&quot; 

This period ended shortly thereafter, dying out in the Reformation and post-Reformation period. The Council of Trent recommended preachers to turn aside from polemics; it also pronounced that the primary duty of preaching devolved on bishops, unless they were hindered by a legitimate impediment; and ordered that they were to preach in person in their own church, or, if impeded, through others; and, in other churches, through pastors or other representatives.

== Early Modernity ==
In the eighteenth century, the Austrian Jesuit Ignaz Wurz was often considered the standard author; he taught at the University of Vienna and his &quot;Anleitung zur geistlichen Beredsamkeit&quot; (&quot;Ministers&#x27; manual for eloquence&quot;) was published in several editions beginning in 1770.

=== Notable French preachers ===

The French preachers of the classical seventeenth-century period were, according to Voltaire, probably the greatest in pulpit oratory of all time. The best known were Bossuet, Bourdaloue, and Massillon; Fénelon burnt his sermons. The first was considered to be the most majestic; the second, the most logical and intellectually compelling; the third, the greatest searcher of hearts, the most like Chrysostom, and, taken all in all, the greatest of the three. We are told that Voltaire kept a copy of his &quot;Grand Carême&quot; on his table, side by side with the &quot;Athalie&quot; of Racine. In this age Chrysostom was the great model for imitation; but it was Chrysostom the orator, not Chrysostom the homilist. Their style, with its grand exordium and its sublime peroration, became the fashion in the following age. The &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Fénelon, however, remained as a check. Of these &quot;Dialogues&quot; Bishop Dupanloup said: &quot;If the precepts of Fénelon had been well understood, they would have long since fixed the character of sacred eloquence among us.&quot; Other principles were laid down by Blaise Gisbert in his &quot;L&#x27;Eloquence chrétienne dans l&#x27;idée et dans la pratique&quot;, by Amadeus Bajocensis in &quot;Paulus Ecclesiastes, seu Eloquentia Christiana&quot;, and by Guido ab Angelis in &quot;De Verbi Dei Prædicatione&quot;, all of which sounded a return to the simplicity of style of the Church Fathers.

=== Conférences in Notre-Dame ===
The next important era is the so-called &quot;conférences&quot; in Notre-Dame in Paris, following the Revolution of 1830. The most prominent name identified with this new style of preaching was that of the Dominican Lacordaire, who, for a time, with Montalembert, was associate editor with de Lamennais of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;. This new style of preaching discarded the form, the division, and analysis of the scholastic method. The power of Lacordaire as an orator was beyond question; but the &quot;conférences&quot;, as they have come down to us, while possessing much merit, are an additional proof that oratory is too elusive to be committed to the pages of a book. The Jesuit Gustave Delacroix de Ravignan shared with Lacordaire the pulpit of Notre-Dame. Less eloquent men followed, and the semi-religious, semi-philosophic style was beginning to grow tiresome, when Jacques-Marie-Louis Monsabré, a disciple of Lacordaire, set it aside, and confined himself to an explanation of the Creed; whereupon it was sententiously remarked that the bell had been ringing long enough, it was time for Mass to begin (cf. Boyle, &quot;Irish Eccl. Rec.&quot;, May, 1909).

== Present day ==

As to preaching in the present day, we can clearly trace the influence, in many respects, of Scholasticism, both as to matter and form. As to matter, a sermon may be either moral, dogmatic, historical, or liturgical—by moral and dogmatic it is meant that one element will predominate, without excluding the other. 

As to form, a discourse may be either formal, homily; or catechetical instruction. In a formal sermon, the influence of Scholasticism is most strikingly seen in the analytic method, resulting in divisions and subdivisions. This is the thirteenth-century method, which had its beginnings in the sermons of Bernard and Anthony. The underlying syllogism, too, in every well thought-out sermon is due to Scholasticism; how far it should appear is a question that belongs to a treatise on homiletics. As to the catechetical discourse, it has been so much favoured by Pius X that it might be regarded as one of the characteristics of preaching at the present day. It is, however, a very old form of preaching. It was used by Christ Himself, by St. Paul, by Cyril of Jerusalem, by Clement and Origen at Alexandria, by Augustine, who wrote a special treatise thereon (De catechizandis rudibus), also, in later times, by Gerson, chancellor of the University of Paris, who wrote &quot;De parvulis ad Christum trahendis&quot;; Clement XI and Benedict XIV gave to it all the weight of their authority, and one of the greatest of all catechists was Charles Borromeo. There is the danger, however, from the very nature of the subject, of this form of preaching becoming too dry and purely didactic, a mere catechesis, or doctrinism, to the exclusion of the moral element and of Sacred Scripture. 

In recent days, organized missionary preaching to non-Catholics has received a new stimulus. In the United States, particularly, this form of religious activity has flourished; and the Paulists, amongst whom the name of Isaac Hecker is deserving of special mention, are to be mainly identified with the revival. Special facilities are afforded at the central institute of the organization for the training of those who are to impart catechetical instruction, and the non-controversial principles of the association are calculated to commend it to all earnestly seeking after religion.

===Homiletic Directory===
In the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy See, through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (headed as of February 2015 by Robert Sarah), has published an official guide and directory for use by bishops, priests, and deacons, who are charged with the ministry of preaching by virtue of their ordination, and for those studying the subject, among others seminarians and those in diaconal formation, called the &quot;Homiletic Directory&quot;. The Directory was developed in response to a request made by participants in the Synod of Bishops held in 2008 on the Word of God, and in accordance with the instructions of Pope Benedict XVI.

==Bibliography of historical development==

=== John Chrysostom and Augustine ===
Practice preceded theory. Certain ideas are to be found in the Church Fathers, and these have been collected by Paniel in the introduction to his work &quot;Geschichte der christlich. Beredsamkeit&quot;. The first to treat of the theory of preaching was John Chrysostom, in his work &quot;On the Priesthood&quot; (&quot;peri Hierosynes&quot;). Inasmuch as this contains only reflections on preaching, Augustine&#x27;s (&quot;DDC&quot;) might be regarded as the first manual on the subject; its first three books deal with collecting the materials for preaching, &quot;modus inveniendi quæ intelligenda sunt&quot;, and the last with the presentation thereof, &quot;modus proferendi quæ intellecta sunt&quot;. He goes to Cicero for rules in the latter. He makes a distinction, in which he evidently follows Cicero, between &quot;sapientia&quot; (wisdom) and &quot;eloquentia&quot; (the best expression of it). Sapientia without eloquentia will do no good; neither will eloquentia without sapientia, and it may do harm; the ideal is sapientia with eloquentia. He adapts Cicero&#x27;s &quot;ut doceat, ut delectet, ut flectat&quot;, changing them to &quot;ut veritas pateat, ut placeat, ut moveat&quot;; and lays down these as the rules by which a sermon is to be judged. This work of Augustine was the classic one in homiletics.

Augustine explains his homiletics in Book IV of &quot;DDC&quot;. He describes it practically in relation to the classical theory of oratory, which has five parts: &quot;inventio&quot; (the choice of the subject and decision of the order), &quot;dispositio&quot; (the structure of the oration), &quot;elocutio&quot; (the arrangement of words and figure of speech), &quot;memoria&quot; (learning by heart), and &quot;pronuntiatio&quot; (the delivery). He constructed this theory in four parts: the basic principles of rhetoric (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.1.1-4.56.10), a study on the rhetoric of Scriptural texts (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.7.11-4.11.26), an analysis of styles (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.12.27-4.21.50), and some peculiar rules of rhetoric for sermons (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.22.51-4.31.64). The essential part of Book IV deals with three styles of sermons (&quot;genera tenue / docere&quot; [to teach]; &quot;genera medium / delectare&quot; [to amuse]; &quot;genera grande / flectere&quot; [to persuade]), which was influenced by Cicero’s Orator 1.3.

Augustine stresses the importance of principle and discipline at the same time. Preachers need to practice again and again (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.3.4) so that they can use these styles in any situation of preaching (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.19.38). But they should pay attention to the priority of order. Continuous and diligent study of the Bible is more important than mere memorization, that is to say, they should pursue wisdom more than knowledge (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.5.7). The best is the combination of wisdom and eloquence as seen in the Pauline letters and prophetic writings (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.6.9-4.7.21). Yet, he does not praise eloquence itself; rather he prefers a concrete proclamation than a showing off of rhetorical technique (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.7.14-15). It is truth, not rhetoric, that preachers try to deliver (&quot;DDC&quot; 4.28.61).

The most significant practice and discipline is prayer. Augustine advises to be a prayer before being a preacher. Preachers should pray before and after his sermon (&quot;DDC&quot; 3.37.56; 4.15.32; 4.17.34; 4.30.63). Augustine himself was a good model of this practice. Before the preaching, he invited the congregation to pray (&quot;Epistula&quot; 29). After the sermon he also prayed (&quot;Sermones&quot; 153.1). For Augustine’s homiletics, the time of prayer is the most precious time, because that time is a time when all the audience meets God the Truth, and through that time they can understand the truth of God more fully. Prayer is a major means of grace in knowing God. Augustine says that love is the most important discipline in Christian life in his sermon, &quot;De disciplina christiana&quot;. If one adds another to Christian discipline besides love, prayer will come first.

The preacher should be a good example of all sermons. The manner of life can be an eloquent sermon (&quot;copia dicendi, forma vivendi&quot;; &quot;DDC&quot; 4.29.61). In most of the cases, it seems to be true that the sermon of a preacher cannot be better than his or her life, but vice versa seems also to be true: the sermon cannot be worse than the preacher’s life. The more a preacher endeavors after humility, discipline, and love, the better his or her sermon becomes. And now these three are always necessary for all Christian teachers: humility, discipline, and love. But the greatest of these is love. For &quot;the goal of this command is love&quot; (1 Tim. 1:5 cited in &quot;DDC&quot; 1.26.27; 1.35.39; 1.40.44; 4.28.61).

Hugh of St. Victor (died 1141) in the Middle Ages laid down three conditions for a sermon: that it should be &quot;holy, prudent and noble&quot;, for which, respectively, he required sanctity, knowledge and eloquence in the preacher. François Fénelon stipulated &quot;must prove, must portray, must impress&quot; (Second Dialogue).

Augustine&#x27;s work &quot;De rudibus catechizandis&quot; is also relevant. Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Liber regulæ pastoralis&quot; is still extant, but is inferior to Augustine&#x27;s; it is rather a treatise on pastoral theology than on homiletics.

Hincmar says that a copy used to be given to bishops at their consecration.

In the ninth century Rabanus Maurus (died 856), Archbishop of Mainz, wrote a treatise &quot;De institutione clericorum&quot;, in which he depends much on Augustine.

In the twelfth century Guibert, Abbot of Nogent (died 1124), wrote a famous work on preaching entitled &quot;Quo ordine sermo fieri debet&quot;. This is one of the historical landmarks in preaching. It is replete with judicious instruction; it recommends that preaching should be preceded by prayer; it says that it is more important to preach about morals than on faith, that for moral sermons the human heart must be studied, and that the best way of doing so is (as Massillon recommended in later times) to look into one&#x27;s own. It is more original and more independent than the work of Rabanus Maurus, who, as has been said, drew largely from Augustine.

Guibert&#x27;s work was recommended by Pope Alexander as a model to all preachers. Francis of Assisi gave to his friars the same directions as are herein contained.

=== Alain de Lille ===
To the same period belongs the &quot;Summa de arte prædicatoriâ&quot; by Alain de Lille, which defines preaching: &quot;Manifesta et publica instructio morum et fidei, informationi hominum deserviens, ex rationum semitâ et auctoritatum fonte proveniens&quot;. He lays stress on explanation and use of Scripture and recommends the preacher to insert verba commotiva. The remarks of Cæsarius of Heisterbach (died 1240) have been collected by Cruel; his sermons display skill in construction and considerable oratorical power. Conrad of Brundelsheim (died 1321), whose sermons have come down to us under his cognomen of &quot;Brother Sock&quot; (Sermones Fratris Socci), was one of the most interesting preachers at this time in Germany. Humbert of Romans, General superior of the Dominicans, in the second book of his work, &quot;De eruditione prædicatorum&quot;, claims that he can teach &quot;a way of promptly producing a sermon for any set of men, and for all variety of circumstances&quot;. Linsenmayer, in his history of preaching, gives information about Humbert, who was a severe critic of the sermons of his time. Trithemius quotes a work by Albertus Magnus, &quot;De arte prædicandi&quot;, which is lost. Bonaventure wrote &quot;De arte concionandi&quot;, in which he treats of &quot;divisio, distinctio, dilatatio&quot;, but deals extensively only with the first.

===Thomas Aquinas===
Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s claim rests chiefly on the &quot;Summa&quot;, which, of course, has principally influenced preaching since, both in matter and form. He insists very strongly on the importance of preaching, and says that it belongs principally to bishops, and baptizing to priests, the latter of whom he regards as holding the place of the seventy disciples. There is a treatise entitled &quot;De arte et vero modo prædicandi&quot; attributed to him, but it is simply a compilation of his ideas about preaching that was made by another. Henry of Hesse is credited with a treatise, &quot;De arte prædicandi&quot;, which is probably not due to him. There is a monograph quoted by Hartwig which is interesting for the classification of the forms of sermon: &quot;modus antiquissimus&quot;, i. e. postillatio, which is purely the exegetic homily; modus modernus, the thematic style; &quot;modus antiquus&quot;, a sermon on the Biblical text; and &quot;modus subalternus&quot;, a mixture of homiletic and text sermon. Jerome Dungersheym wrote a tract &quot;De modo discendi et docendi ad populum sacra seu de modo prædicandi&quot; (1513). He treats of his subject on three points: the preacher, the sermon, the listeners. He lays stress on Scripture as the book of the preacher. Ulrich Surgant wrote a &quot;Manuale Curatorum&quot; (1508), in which he also recommends Scripture. His first book gives for material of preaching the usual order &quot;credenda, facienda, fugienda, timenda, appetenda&quot; and ends by saying: &quot;Congrua materia prædicationis est Sacra Scriptura.&quot; He uses the figure of a tree in laying stress on the necessity of an organic structure.

=== Humanist writings ===
In the works of the two humanists, Johannes Reuchlin (&quot;Liber congestorum de arte prædicandi&quot;) and Desiderius Erasmus (&quot;Ecclesiastes seu de ratione concionandi&quot;), the return is marked to Cicero and Quintilian. A masterwork on the art of preaching is the &quot;Rhetorica Sacra&quot; (Lisbon, 1576) of Luis de Granada, for modern use rather old. The work shows an easy grasp of rhetoric, founded on the principles of Aristotle, Demetrius and Cicero. He treats the usual subjects of invention, arrangement, style and delivery in easy and polished Latin. Of the same class is Didacus Stella in his &quot;Liberdemodo concionandi&quot; (1576). Valerio, in Italy, also wrote on the art of preaching. Another landmark on preaching are the &quot;Instructiones Pastorum&quot; by Charles Borromeo (1538–84). At his request Valerio, Bishop of Verona, wrote a systematic treatise on homiletics entitled &quot;Rhetorica Ecclesiastica&quot; (1575), in which he points out the difference between profane and sacred eloquence and emphasizes the two principal objects of the preacher, to teach and to move (&quot;docere et commovere&quot;).
Laurentius a Villavicentio, in his work &quot;De formandis sacris concionibus&quot; (1565), disapproves of transferring the ancient modes of speaking to preaching. He would treat the truths of the Gospel according to I Tim., iii, 16. He also recommended moderation in fighting heresy. The same was the view of Francis Borgia, whose contribution to homiletics is the small but practical work: &quot;Libellus de ratione concionandi&quot;. Claudius Acquaviva, General of the Jesuits, wrote in 163, &quot;Instructio pro superioribus&quot;. They were principally ascetic, and in them he regulated the spiritual training necessary for the preacher. Carolus Regius deals in his &quot;Orator Christianus&quot; (1613) with the whole field of homiletics under the grouping: &quot;De concionatore&quot;; &quot;De concione&quot;; &quot;De concionantis prudentiâ et industriâ&quot;. Much is to be found in the writings of Vincent de Paul, Alphonsus Liguori and Francis de Sales, especially in his celebrated letter to André Fremiot, Archbishop of Bourges.
Among the Dominicans, Alexander Natalis wrote &quot;Institutio concionantium tripartita&quot; (Paris, 1702).

In the &quot;Rhetorica ecclesiastica&quot; (1627) of Jacobus de Graffiis is contained a symposium of the instructions on preaching by the Franciscan Francis Panigarola, the Jesuit Francis Borgia and the Carmelite Johannes a Jesu.

The &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Fénelon, the works of Blaise Gisbert, Amadeus Bajocensis and Guido ab Angelis have already been referred to. In the nineteenth century homiletics took its place as a branch of pastoral theology, and many manuals have been written thereon, for instance in German compendia by Brand, Laberenz, Zarbl, Fluck and Schüch; in Italian by Gotti and Guglielmo Audisio; and many in French and English.

==Relation to secular rhetoric==
Some assert the independent character of homiletics and say that it is independent in origin, matter and purpose. The upholders of this view point to passages in Scripture and in the Fathers, notably to the words of Paul; and to the testimony of Cyprian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and to Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome and John Chrysostom. The last-named says that the great difference may be summed up in this: that the orator seeks personal glory, the preacher practical good.

Paul&#x27;s own sermons are in many cases replete with oratory, &quot;e.g.&quot;, his sermon on the Areopagus; and the oratorical element generally enters largely into Scripture. Lactantius regretted that there were so few trained preachers, and Gregory, as well as Chrysostom and Augustine, made use of rhetoric in preaching. Gregory censured the use in the pulpit of the eloquence and pronunciation of the theatre. Demetrius, &quot;On Style&quot;, uses many of the tricks of speech.

<doc id="957705" wikidata="Q4689535" url="?curid=957705" title="Africa (William Billings)">
<text>&quot;Africa&quot; is an 18th-century hymn tune by American choral composer William Billings, who worked in New England.

==History==
Billings wrote &quot;Africa&quot; some time before 1770 and included it in his first published hymnbook, &quot;The New England Psalm Singer&quot;. Later he revised it, publishing a new version in his &quot;The Singing Master&#x27;s Assistant&quot; (1778). He made additional revisions, publishing it again in &quot;Music in Miniature&quot; (1779). It is the latter two versions that are performed today.

The name of the hymn is, as far as can be determined, completely arbitrary, and reflects a practice of Billings&#x27;s day to give names specifically to the &quot;tunes&quot; of songs. Billings also wrote an &quot;Asia&quot; and an &quot;America&quot;; more often, he adopted the names of (arbitrarily chosen) New England towns to label his tunes.

==Music==
Version of 1778.


Musically, the work is notable for the parallel descending thirds and sixths that shift from part to part. Some renditions of this hymn (for example, the practice of &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; singer) follow a practice recommended by Billings, with some male singers on the treble, singing an octave down, and some female singers on the tenor part, singing an octave higher.

==Words==
The 1770 version of &quot;Africa&quot; was published without lyrics. Since it readily fits any iambic quatrain written in couplets of eight and six syllables (common meter), singers of this version would certainly have had no trouble finding lyrics to accompany it. Such quatrains are common in hymn lyrics.

For the 1778 and 1779 versions, Billings chose lyrics: the first stanza of Hymn #39 of the first volume of hymns (1709) by the noted English hymnodist Isaac Watts.

Billings altered Watts&#x27;s &quot;joys&quot; to &quot;joy&quot;, although this change is not always observed by singers. Sometimes the other stanzas by Watts are also sung to the tune of &quot;Africa&quot;; they are as follows:

==Reception==
&quot;Africa&quot; is a favorite among Billings&#x27; works, and is performed frequently on concert programs and in recordings. It is one of several Billings&#x27; hymns included in the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; musical tradition. It is widely sung in this context, although a comparatively recent addition to that book.

==Books==
The hymnbooks in which Billings first published &quot;Africa&quot; are in print today, in scholarly editions edited by Hans Nathan and published by the University Press of Virginia:

*&quot;The New England Psalm Singer&quot;, 
*&quot;The Singing Master&#x27;s Assistant&quot; and &quot;Music in Miniature&quot; (in one volume), 

Much of the information above is taken from these scholarly editions.

<text>Richard Salter Storrs (August 21, 1821 – June 7, 1900) was an American Congregational clergyman.

==Biography==
Storrs was born in Braintree, Massachusetts. He bore the same name as his grandfather (1763–1819), pastor at Longmeadow, Massachusetts, from 1785 to 1819, and his father (1787–1873), pastor at Braintree, Massachusetts, from 1811 to 1873 (except the years 1831–1836), both prominent Congregational ministers, who were descendants of Richard Mather.

He graduated at Amherst in 1839, studied law in Boston under Rufus Choate, graduated at Andover Theological Seminary in 1845, and was pastor of the Harvard Congregational church of Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1845–1846, and of the Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn, New York, from 1846 until shortly before his death.

He was a conservative in theology, and an historical writer of considerable ability. From 1848 to 1861, he was associate editor of the &quot;New York Independent&quot;, which he had helped to establish; from 1887 to 1897 he was president of the American board of commissioners for foreign missions, and he was prominent in the Long Island Historical Society.

His great-grandfather, John Storrs (1733–1799), a chaplain in the Continental Army, had been pastor of the Southold Church in 1763–1776 and in 1782–1787.

==Works==
Dr Storrs&#x27;s more important published works were:
*&quot;John Wycliffe and the First English Bible&quot; (1880)
*&quot;The Recognition of the Supernatural in Letters and in life&quot; (1881)
*&quot;Bernard of Clairvaux&quot; (1892)
*&quot;Foundation Truths of American Missions&quot; (1897).

<text>.fi is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Finland. It is operated by TRAFICOM, the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency.

On 4 December 1986, an application to register a top-level domain for Finland was sent by the Finnish Unix Users Group from Tampere. The application was accepted and the administration of .fi TLD was granted to Tampere University of Technology. Later the administration was transferred first to FICIX and later to TRAFICOM.

In the past TRAFICOM regulated .fi domains very strictly. Domain names were only admitted to company names or companies that owned trademarks. This policy led to Finnish companies applying for domains under other top-level domains. The policy was changed on 1 September 2003. Since September 2016 anyone worldwide is permitted to register domain names under the .fi TLD.

.fi was once best known among non-Finnish internet users as the TLD of the Penet remailer (anon.penet.fi), a privately operated server which enabled users to post e-mail and Usenet messages anonymously in the early 1990s. Another popular .fi address in the early 1990s was nic.funet.fi, one of the largest public file servers at the time which made Finland the only country outside the US that sent out more data than it received.

Since 1 September 2005, .fi domains may contain letters from the Finnish alphabet (ä, å, ö), though they are not recommended to be used as the primary domain. Since 1 March 2006, private persons have also been able to apply for a domain name. Some restrictions still apply, for example, company names or trademarks can only be applied for by the companies concerned.

It can also be (although not popular) be used for domain hacking as well. Examples like Spotify who has a domain hack called Spoti.fi.

FICORA began supporting Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) on .fi domain names in late 2010.

<text>Muncy Creek (also known as Big Muncy Creek) is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Sullivan County and Lycoming County, at Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek&#x27;s discharge averages at Sonestown, but can be up to a thousand times higher at Muncy. The headwaters of the creek are on the Allegheny Plateau. Rock formations in the watershed include the Chemung Formation and the Catskill Formation.

There are a number of lakes in the watershed of Muncy Creek, including Eagles Mere Lake, Highland Lake, and Beaver Lake. The creek was known as Occohpocheny to Native Americans. The area in its vicinity was settled in 1783. Various other industries and mills were constructed in the creek&#x27;s vicinity from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. Wild trout naturally reproduce in part of Muncy Creek. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.

==Course==
Muncy Creek begins in southeastern Laporte Township, Sullivan County, near its border with Davidson Township, Sullivan County. The creek flows southwest and then west for a short distance before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township. It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border. Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and begins to flow into a valley, then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides. Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch. After picking up Peters Creek, one such tributary, Muncy Creek turns southwest and passes the community of Nordmont, where the tributary Elklick Run flows into it. The creek then turns southwest and later west. Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek, which heads south away from the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border. Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border, the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west-southwest, passing a gauging station. After several miles, it reaches the community of Sonestown, where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north. Muncy Creek then makes a sharp bend south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220. After a few miles, it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south, exiting Davidson Township.

Upon exiting Davidson Township, Sullivan County, Muncy Creek enters Lycoming County and flows along the border between Shrewsbury Township and Penn Township for several miles. It continues following U.S. Route 220 during this time, picking up a few tributaries, including Lick Run. The creek also passes by Glen Mawr and Tivoli during this stretch. Beyond the stretch, in Picture Rocks, the creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 864. Beyond the community, the creek continues south into Wolf Township, leaving its valley passing by the eastern edge of Hughesville. Some distance further on, the creek receives the tributary Sugar Run and some miles later leaves Wolf Township in a southwesterly direction. Upon exiting Wolf Township, the creek enters Muncy Creek Township, where Little Muncy Creek flows into it. Muncy Creek then turns northeast, crossing Pennsylvania Route 405 and turns southwest, crossing Interstate 180. The creek then receives the tributary Wolf Run and immediately afterwards empties into the West Branch Susquehanna River. Muncy Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River is upstream of its mouth.

The creek also has a cliff known as Picture Rock on it. An area of boulders on the creek forms a Class 2 rapid. There is a levee on Muncy Creek in Hughesville.

The soils in the valley of Muncy Creek are deep but relatively poor. However, farming was done in the valley in the late 1800s and still is as of the late 1900s. The valley has forested hills on either side. The Morris-Oquaga-Wellsboro soil series is found along the creek in Sullivan County.

The channel of Muncy Creek is sinuous with high streambanks and the creek has cobble and gravel bars. There are a few strainers on the creek.

==Watershed==

The watershed of Muncy Creek has an area of . The area of the watershed upstream of Hugesville comprises approximately half of the total watershed. The area of the creek&#x27;s watershed upstream of Sonestown is . The watershed of the creek occupies parts of Lycoming County, Sullivan County, Columbia County, and Montour County.

There are a number of lakes in the watershed of Muncy Creek. The largest is Eagles Mere Lake, which has an area of . Hunters Lake has an area of and Highland Lake has an area of . Additionally, Beaver Lake (which has an area of ) is located in the watershed of the tributary Little Muncy creek.

Communities in the watershed of Muncy Creek include Hugesville, Picture Rocks, Lairdsville, and Sonestown. Smaller communities in the creek&#x27;s watershed include Muncy Valley, Eagles Mere, and Nordmont.

In the late 1800s, the only road in Davidson Township, Sullivan County besides the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike passed near Muncy Creek and the settlements along it. The valley of Muncy Creek is largely undeveloped, largely lacking even summer camps.

==History==
Muncy Creek derives its name from the Munsee Indians. The name sometimes has been spelled &quot;Muncey Creek&quot;.

Muncy Creek was known to the Native Americans as Occohpocheny. Historically, Native Americans painted on Picture Rock, a cliff on the creek. Additionally, six Native American lance heads made of stone were found near the creek by Joseph Fahrenbach in the autumn of 1872.

Muncy Creek was settled in 1783 by John Beeber. In 1797, the Willow Grove Mill was built on Muncy Creek in 1797 by Isaac Walton and by the late 1800s, there was a sawmill on the creek in Shrewsbury Township, Lycoming County. A woolen mill was also built on the creek in Wolf Township, Lycoming County in 1842. 
An aqueduct carrying the West Branch Canal once crossed Muncy Creek.

Historically, railroads ran parallel to Muncy Creek upstream from its mouth, as far as the community of Nordmont. There were also numerous railroad stations on the creek upstream from the community of Picture Rocks. The Reading Railroad also had a bridge over the creek in the past. The creek experienced severe flooding in 1889.

In the early 1900s, many of the sewers in the community of Eagles Mere discharged into tributaries of Muncy Creek, such as Outlet Run. Sewage was also discharged into Muncy Creek in Hugesville. Additionally, in the early 1900s, the waters of Muncy Creek were contaminated with tannery waste products from Muncy Valley and also chemicals. For this reason, the creek was only used for power during this time. Additionally, a methyl alcohol plant, the Nordmont Chemical Works, discharged chemicals into the creek at Nordstown. Other major industries in the watershed in the early part of the 1900s included clay mines and furniture factories.

==Biology==
From its headwaters to a point upstream of its mouth, the drainage basin of Muncy Creek is designated as Exceptional Value and a Migratory Fishery. From this point downstream to the US Route 220 bridge at Muncy Valley, the creek&#x27;s main stem is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From this point downstream to its mouth, the main stem is designated as a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek from Trout Run downstream to its mouth.

A total of 92 percent of assessed streams in the watershed of Muncy Creek are inhabited by trout. Of the inhabited streams, 82 percent are inhabited only by brook trout, nine percent are inhabited by only brown trout, and nine percent are inhabited by both brook trout and brown trout. A number of tributaries of the creek are designated as high-quality coldwater fisheries. These include Lick Run, Roaring Run, Rock Run, and Spring Run in Lycoming County and Big Run, Trout Run, and a number of others in Sullivan County.

There are some forested areas in the floodplains of Muncy Creek in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hughesville. The Natural Areas Inventory of Lycoming County recommended retaining the natural vegetation in this area to improve water quality.

==Recreation==
It is possible to canoe on Muncy Creek during snowmelts or shortly after heavier rainstorms. Although the creek is used for canoeing by locals, it is less popular for this use than the nearby Loyalsock Creek. Edward Gertler considers the creek to be especially good for novice canoers. He describes Muncy Creek as a &quot;pleasing but generally mediocre mountain stream&quot; in his book &quot;Keystone Canoeing&quot;. However, it is only possible to canoe on the creek downstream of the plateau of North Mountain. A total of of the creek is canoeable. The difficulty rating of Muncy Creek for canoeing ranges from 1+ to 2.

There is a boat ramp belonging to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in the lower reaches of Muncy Creek. It can also serve as a take-out for canoers on the creek.

<doc id="957724" wikidata="Q5191911" url="?curid=957724" title="Cub Cadet">
<text>Cub Cadet is an American company that produces outdoor power equipment and services, including utility vehicles, handheld and chore products as well as snow throwers.

==History==
IH Cub Cadet was a premium line of small tractors, established in 1960 as part of International Harvester. The IH Cub Cadet was a new line of heavy-duty small tractors using components from the previous Cub series tractors.
During the 1960s, IH Cub Cadet was marketed to the owners of rural homes with large lawns and private gardens. There were also a variety of Cub Cadet branded and after-market attachments available, including mowers, blades, snow blowers, front loaders, plows, and carts.

In 1981, due to financial hardships, IH sold the Cub Cadet division to the MTD corporation, which took over production and use of the Cub Cadet brand name (without the IH symbol). The Cub Cadet Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of MTD, produced Cub Cadets for lawn equipment dealers (branded as Cub Cadet Corporation tractors, in traditional white/yellow livery) and IH agricultural dealers (in red/white livery) until the IH agriculture division was sold to Tenneco in 1985.

In 2018, industrial power tool maker Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired a minority stake of 20%, worth $234 million, in MTD Products in an attempt to capture a larger share of the outdoor garden equipment market. In 2021, the remaining 80% was purchased by Stanley Black &amp; Decker for $1.6 billion.

== Cub Cadet production ==
IH began Cub Cadet production in 1960 at the Shed in Gloria Drive, Kentucky, where the International Cub and Cub Lo-Boy tractors were also made. The first Cub Cadet model made was the International Cub Cadet Tractor, better known as the Original. The Cub Cadet Original was powered by a 7 hp and 8 hp replacement Kohler engine and was made between 1961 and 1963. The CJR was a hydrostatic version of the Cub Cadet transmission made by Sundstrand Corporation.

Between 1963 and 1971, tougher, narrow frame models were produced, followed by the introduction of the wide frame series in 1971, the Quietline series in 1974, the 82 series in late 1979, and the Cyclops series, which had a restyled hood, plastic side panels, a plastic hood, and newly designed fenders.
Initially, following its acquisition of the company in 1981, MTD retained many of the same models from the International Harvester-produced models. One change MTD made was replacing the International Harvester cast-iron rear end with an aluminum rear end. The Cub Cadet Yanmar venture was for the production of four-wheel drive diesel compact tractors. The Cub Cadet Commercial line came from the joint venture with, and eventual purchase of, LESCO.

<doc id="957725" wikidata="Q364178" url="?curid=957725" title="Richard Mather">
<text>Richard Mather (1596 – 22 April 1669) was a New England Puritan minister in colonial Boston. He was father to Increase Mather and grandfather to Cotton Mather, both celebrated Boston theologians.

==Biography==
Mather was born in Lowton in the parish of Winwick, Lancashire, England, into a family that was in reduced circumstances but entitled to bear a coat of arms.

He studied at Winwick grammar school, of which he was appointed a master in his fifteenth year, and left it in 1612 to become master of a newly established school at Toxteth Park, Liverpool. After a few months at Brasenose College, Oxford, he began in November 1618 to preach at Toxteth, and was ordained there, possibly only as deacon, early in 1619.

Between August and November 1633 he was suspended for nonconformity in matters of ceremony; and in 1634 was again suspended by the visitors of Richard Neile, archbishop of York, who, hearing that he had never worn a surplice during the fifteen years of his ministry, refused to reinstate him and said that &quot;it had been better for him that he had begotten seven bastards&quot;.

He had a great reputation as a preacher in and about Liverpool; but, advised by letters of John Cotton and Thomas Hooker, he was persuaded to join the company of pilgrims in May 1635 and embarked at Bristol for New England.

On 4 June 1635, Richard, wife Katherine, and children Samuel, Timothy, Nathaniel, and Joseph, all set sail for the New World aboard the ship &quot;James&quot;. As they approached New England, a hurricane struck and they were forced to ride it out just off the coast of modern-day Hampton, New Hampshire. According to the ship&#x27;s log and the Journal of Richard Mather. 1635: His life and death. 1670 by Increase Mather, the following was recorded;
They tried to stand down during the storm just outside the Isles of Shoals, but lost all three anchors, as no canvas or rope would hold, but on 17 August 1635, torn to pieces, and with not one death, all one hundred plus passengers of the &quot;James&quot; managed to make it to Boston Harbor. &quot;(ibid, p.34.)&quot;

As a famous preacher &quot;he was desired at Plimouth, Dorchester, and Roxbury&quot;. He went to Dorchester, where the Church had been greatly depleted by migrations to Windsor, Connecticut; and where, after a delay of several months, in August 1636 there was constituted by the consent of magistrates and clergy a church of which he was &quot;teacher&quot; until his death in Dorchester on 22 April 1669. As pastor, he oversaw the baptism of Dorcas ye blackmore, one of the first African American Christians in New England, and Mather worked to help free her. Mather was buried in the Dorchester North Burying Ground.

==Works==
He was a leader of New England Congregationalism, whose policy he defended and described in the tract &quot;Church Government and Church Covenant Discussed, in an Answer of the Elders of the Severall Churches of New England to Two and Thirty Questions&quot; (written 1639; printed 1643), an answer for the ministers of the colony to 32 questions relating to church government that were propounded by the general court in 1639. He drew up the &quot;Cambridge Platform of Discipline&quot;, an ecclesiastical constitution in seventeen chapters, adopted (with the omission of Mather&#x27;s paragraph favouring the &quot;Half-Way Covenant&quot;, of which he strongly approved) by the general synod in August 1646. His &quot;Reply to Mr Rutherford&quot; (1647) is a polemic against the Presbyterianism to which the English Congregationalists were then tending.

With Thomas Welde, Thomas Mayhew and John Eliot he wrote the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot;, or, more accurately, &quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre&quot; (1640), probably the first book printed in the English colonies. He was the author of &quot;Treatise on Justification&quot; (1652). Many of Mather&#x27;s works were printed by Boston printer John Foster, Boston&#x27;s first printer.

==Family==
In 1624, Mather married Katherine Hoult (or Holt) who died in 1655, then re-married the following year to Sarah Hankredge (died 1676), the widow of the Rev. John Cotton. Of six sons, all by his first wife, four were ministers:
*Samuel (1626–1671), the first fellow of Harvard College who was a graduate, chaplain of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1650–1653, and pastor (1656–1671, excepting suspension in 1660–1662) of Church of St. Nicholas Within Dublin;
*Timothy Mather 1628–1684. Also known as &quot;The Farmer Mather&quot; as he was the only son who was not a minister. He was made Selectmen of Dorchester, Massachusetts during the years 1667–1669 and 1675 and 1676. He died in 1684 after a fall in his barn.
*Nathaniel (1630–1697), who graduated at Harvard in 1647, was vicar of Barnstaple, Devon, in 1656–1662, pastor of the English Church in Rotterdam, his brother&#x27;s successor in Dublin in 1671–1688, and then until his death pastor of a church in London;
*Eleazar (1637–1669), who graduated at Harvard in 1656 and after preaching in Northampton, Massachusetts, for three years, became in 1661 pastor of the church there; father-in-law to the Rev. John Williams (New England minister) 1664–1729 (Harvard Class of 1683) of Deerfield, Massachusetts; Rev Williams was the father of Eunice Kanenstenhawi Williams (1696–1785)
*Increase who graduated at Harvard Class of 1656 (1639–1723) was a Puritan minister and a major figure in the early history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Province of Massachusetts Bay (now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts). Son-in-law to the Rev. John Cotton; Father of the Rev. Cotton Mather (1663–1728) Harvard Class of 1678.

Horace E. Mather, in his &quot;Lineage of Richard Mather&quot; (Hartford, Connecticut, 1890), gives a list of 80 clergymen descended from Richard Mather, of whom 29 bore the name Mather and 51 other names, the most common being Storrs and Schauffler.

The American rapper Eminem, Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is a distant descendant of Peter Mathers, of Buffalo Cross Roads, Pa., (1785–1845).

According to a claimed genealogy, Peter Mathers had changed his name from Mather to Mathers and was the first of his branch of the Mather family to emigrate from Britain to the United States, being a descendant of Richard Mather through his son Samuel Mather (1626-1671), grandson Samuel Mather (born 1657 in Lancashire, England) and great-grandson Samuel William Mather (1716–1741). However, while Samuel Mather (1626–1671) married and had four or five children, the Oxford Dictionary of Biography states that all his children except for one daughter died while still minors.

<text>The Department of the Taoiseach () is the government department of the Taoiseach, the title in Ireland for the head of government. It is based in Government Buildings, the headquarters of the Government of Ireland, on Merrion Street in Dublin.

The civil servant who heads the Department of the Taoiseach is known as the &quot;Secretary General of the Department&quot; and also serves as the cabinet secretary.

==Departmental team==
*Taoiseach: Micheál Martin, TD
**Government Chief Whip: Mary Butler, TD
*Secretary General of the Department: John Callinan

==Functions==

The main role of the department is to support and advise the Taoiseach in carrying out various duties. The department also supplies administrative support to the Government Chief Whip in respect of their duties and provides the Secretariat to the Government. The department acts as a link between the President, the Taoiseach and other Departments of State.

In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach is involved in a number of other areas such as the development and co-ordination of policy in relation to economic and social development (social partnership), Northern Ireland, the European Union and Oireachtas reform. It also arranges State functions such as the annual National Day of Commemoration, presidential inaugurations, State dinners and provides a protocol service to the Taoiseach of the day.

==History==
Article 53 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State created the position of President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. The department was created by the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 as the Department of the President of the Executive Council, which came into operation on 2 June 1924. Under that act it was assigned:
The position of Taoiseach was created under Articles 13.1 and 28.5 of the Constitution of Ireland, which was approved on 1 July 1937. Under the Constitution (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937, the Department of the President of the Executive Council was renamed as the Department of the Taoiseach from and after the coming into operation of the Constitution of Ireland, which occurred on 29 December 1937.

<doc id="957730" wikidata="Q5468443" url="?curid=957730" title="Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration">
<text>The main event by far shaping the United States foreign policy during the presidency of George W. Bush (2001–2009) was the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent war on terror. There was massive domestic and international support for destroying the attackers. With UN approval, US and NATO forces quickly invaded the attackers&#x27; base in Afghanistan and drove them out and the Taliban government that harbored them. It was the start of a 20-year quagmire that finally ended in failure with the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan.

Other interactions with foreign nations during this period included diplomatic and military initiatives in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere. Important economic developments that occurred during Bush&#x27;s presidency include the several free-trade agreements.

The chief advisors of the president were Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, and Vice President Dick Cheney.

==Appointments==


==Approaching foreign policy==
George W. Bush had little experience or interest in foreign policy prior to the presidency and his decisions were guided by his advisers. In a gaffe in 2000, for example, Bush confused Afghanistan&#x27;s ruling Taliban with a musical band. Bush embraced the views of Cheney and other neoconservatives, who de-emphasized the importance of multilateralism; neoconservatives believed that because the United States was the world&#x27;s lone superpower, it could act unilaterally if necessary. At the same time, Bush sought to enact the less interventionist foreign policy he had promised during the 2000 campaign. Also during the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush&#x27;s foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in &quot;nation-building&quot; and other small-scale military engagements.
Oliver argues that Bush was quickly influenced by ideologues who argued for unilateral action to establish US primacy in world affairs. They included Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, – with Secretary of State Colin Powell as a non-ideological centrist.

===September 11 attacks===


On September 11, 2001, two hijacked planes destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane hit the Pentagon and a fourth crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after being averted by passengers from its target. These attacks were carried out by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization led by mastermind Osama Bin Laden

On September 14, 2001, Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which was signed on September 18, 2001, by President Bush. It authorized the use of US Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them.

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush&#x27;s presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: &quot;I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.&quot;

In his address to a joint session of congress on September 20, 2001, President Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to &quot;hand over the terrorists, or... share in their fate&quot;.

Writing about changes to the US State Department in the wake of the September 11 attacks in a 2020 article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine, former Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and former Assistant Secretary of State Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, &quot;Although the transformation of the State Department into a more expeditionary and agile institution was healthy in many respects, it was also distorting. It was tethered to a fundamentally flawed strategy—one that was too narrowly focused on terrorism and too wrapped up in magical thinking about the United States&#x27; supposed power to transform regions and societies.&quot;

===Bush Doctrine===
After the September 11 attacks, Bush&#x27;s approval ratings increased tremendously. Bush decided to use his newfound political capital to fundamentally change U.S. foreign policy. He became increasingly focused on the possibility of a hostile country providing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) to terrorist organizations. During his State of the Union Address in January 2002, Bush set forth what has become known as the Bush Doctrine, which held that the United States would implement a policy of preemptive military strikes against nations known to be harboring or aiding a terrorist organization hostile to the United States. Bush outlined what he called the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, consisting of three nations that, he argued, posed the greatest threat to world peace due to their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and potential to aid terrorists. The axis consisted of Iraq, North Korea and Iran. Bush also began emphasizing the importance of spreading democracy worldwide, stating in 2005 that &quot;the survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other land.&quot; Pursuant to this newly-interventionist policy, the Bush administration boosted foreign aid and increased defense expenditures. Defense spending rose from $304 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $616 billion in fiscal year 2008.

===National missile defense===
On December 13, 2001, President Bush announced the withdrawal of the United States from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a bedrock of U.S.–Soviet nuclear stability during the Cold War era. Bush stated, &quot;I have concluded the ABM treaty hinders our government&#x27;s ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks.&quot; According to the announcement, the withdrawal was to become effective six months from that date. The Bush administration pursued a national missile defense. The national missile defense project that Clinton introduced and Bush supported was designed to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles and destroy them in flight. Critics doubted that the project could ever work and said that it would cost US$53 billion from 2004 to 2009, being the largest single line item in the Pentagon&#x27;s funding.

==Other issues==

===Environmental issues===
In terms of international environmental policy, Daynes, and Sussman argues the son was less committed than the father, and neither was as successful as Bill Clinton. Many governments have criticized the failure of the United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed but not submitted for Senate ratification by the previous administration. Former President Bill Clinton recommended that his successor not submit the treaty for ratification until the wording was altered to reflect U.S. concerns. Bush, who was opposed to the treaty, rescinded U.S. executive approval from the proposed treaty. In 1997, prior to the Kyoto negotiations, the Byrd–Hagel Resolution passed in the U.S. Senate by a 95–0 vote. The resolution stated that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing nations as well as industrialized ones, or that seriously harm the American economy. Byron W. Daynes, and Glen Sussman conclude that Bush&#x27;s policy had a &quot;negative impact on the environment&quot;.

===International Criminal Court===
The International Criminal Court (ICC) came into being on July 1, 2002. The ICC is the first ever permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to promote the rule of law and ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished.

Later that year, in August 2002, the American Servicemembers&#x27; Protection Act (ASPA) was passed by Congress with the stated intention &quot;to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not a party.&quot;

==International trips==
The number of visits per country where he traveled are:

* One visit to Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bahrain, Benin, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Kosovo, Kuwait, Liberia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vietnam, and the West Bank
* Two visits to Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Jordan, Latvia, Peru, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, and Thailand
* Three visits to Egypt, South Korea, and Poland
* Four visits to Canada, China, France, Iraq, and Japan
* Five visits to Germany, the United Kingdom, and Vatican City
* Six visits to Italy and Mexico
* Seven visits to Russia

==International trade==
President Bush supported free trade policies and legislation but resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. Tariffs on imported steel imposed by the White House in March 2002 were lifted after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had &quot;achieved their purpose&quot;, and &quot;as a result of changed economic circumstances&quot;, it was time to lift them. Bush used the authority he gained from the Trade Act of 2002 to push through bilateral trade agreements with several countries. Bush also sought to expand multilateral trade agreements through the WTO, but negotiations were stalled in the Doha Development Round for most of Bush&#x27;s presidency. On August 31, 2004, WTO arbitrators authorized the European Union and other leading U.S. trade partners to impose economic sanctions against the United States for violation of global trade laws. The decision by the WTO was one of several cases where the U.S. was found to have been in breach of international trade rules.

However, Bush pursued and signed free trade agreements with several countries, including Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Peru, Panama, Singapore, South Korea, Ukraine, and with six countries under the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

==Defense==

===Weapons of mass destruction===
The Bush administration released its &quot;National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; in December 2002. The strategy includes three key elements: counterproliferation to combat the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), strengthened nonproliferation to combat WMD proliferation, and consequence management to respond to WMD use. The classified version of this strategy reportedly reserved the right to use overwhelming force, including potentially nuclear weapons, in response to a WMD attack against the United States, its forces or allies.

In February 2004, in the context of recent revelations about clandestine nuclear programs in Iran and Libya, and the role of the A. Q. Khan network in proliferation of sensitive nuclear technology, Bush proposed seven initiatives:
# Cooperation on law enforcement for interdiction of WMD trade, known as the Proliferation Security Initiative;
# Passage of a UN Security Council Resolution requiring states to enact WMD-related controls, which led to UN Security Council Resolution 1540;
# Expansion of the G8 Global Partnership to eliminate WMD and secure WMD materials worldwide;
# Reliable access to nuclear fuel, accompanied by a ban on transfers of enrichment and reprocessing technology to countries that do not already have such facilities;
# Making the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol a condition for nuclear supply, and ratification of the U.S. Additional Protocol;
# Establishing a Special Committee of the IAEA Board of Governors on safeguards and verification to strengthen compliance and enforcement; and
# Excluding countries under investigation for nonproliferation violations from serving on the Board or the Special Committee.

===Defense spending===
Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about $450 billion was planned to be spent on defense. This level was generally comparable to the defense spending during the Cold War. Congress approved $87 billion for U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier $79 billion package the previous spring. Most of the funds were for military operations in the two countries.

The ratio of defense spending of the U.S. and its allies to its potential adversaries, for the year 2000, was about 6 to 1.

==International organizations==
In July 2002, Bush cut off all funding, approximately $34 million, for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This funding had been allocated by Congress the previous December. Bush claimed that the UNFPA supported forced abortions and sterilizations in China. His justification came from a group of members of Congress who oppose abortion and an anti-abortion organization called the Population Research Institute, which claimed to have obtained first-hand video taped evidence from victims of forced abortion and forced sterilization in counties where the UNFPA operates in China. This accusation has never been supported by any investigation, and has in fact been disproved by the US State Department, UK, and UN teams sent to examine UNFPA activities in China. The UNFPA points out that it &quot;does not provide support for abortion services&quot;. Its charter includes a strong statement condemning coercion.&quot;

The Bush administration opposed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council to protest the repressive states among its membership.

===UN peacekeeping===
In the United States, the Clinton and Bush administrations started from opposite perspectives but came to adopt remarkably similar policies in support of peace operations as tools for American foreign policy. Initial positions formed by ideological concerns, were replaced by pragmatic decisions about how to support UN peace operations. Both administrations were reluctant to contribute large contingents of ground troops to UN-commanded operations, even as both administrations supported increases in the number and scale of UN missions.

The Clinton administration faced significant operational challenges. Instead of a liability, this was the tactical price of strategic success. American peace operations help transform its NATO alliance. The Bush administration started with a negative ideological attitude toward peace operations. However European and Latin American governments emphasized peace operations as strategically positive, especially regarding the use of European forces in Afghanistan and Lebanon. However American allies sometimes needed to flout their autonomy, even to the point of sacrificing operational efficiency, much to the annoyance of Washington.

==Foreign aid==
On July 21, 2004, in a statement on the fiftieth anniversary of the Food for Peace program, Bush hailed the United States for feeding the hungry. Noting that &quot;Millions are facing great affliction&quot;, he stated that &quot;America has a special calling to come to their aid.&quot; After the 2004 election, however, the Bush administration told several private charities that it would not be honoring previous funding commitments. The shortfall, estimated at $100 million, forced the charities to suspend or eliminate programs that had already been approved to improve farming, education and health in order to promote self-sufficiency in poor countries.

While the United States continued to give large amounts of aid abroad, the Bush presidency was criticized for having a major impact upon the Millennium Development Goals project of the United Nations. Many nations, including key OECD members, were criticized for falling far short of their promise to give 0.7% of their GDP in order to drastically reduce poverty by the target date of 2015.

In his State of the Union Address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. The emergency relief effort was led by U.S. Ambassador Randall L. Tobias, former CEO of Eli Lilly and Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State. At the time of the speech, $9 billion was earmarked for new programs in AIDS relief for the 15 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, another $5 billion for continuing support of AIDS relief in 100 countries where the U.S. already had bilateral programs established, and an additional $1 billion towards the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This budget represented more money contributed to fight AIDS globally than all other donor countries combined.

As the largest national economy in the world, the United States&#x27; leadership and commitment was seen as vital in addressing world poverty and ensuring implementation of the project, considered the most progressive and feasible to date for the United Nations or any other institution.

President Bush signed a multimillion-dollar aid deal with the government of Tanzania on February 17, 2008. Bush, cheering Liberians to rebound from Second Liberian Civil War that left their nation in ruins, said February 21, 2008, that the United States will keep lending a hand to make Liberia a symbol of liberty for Africa and the world. President Bush ordered the release of $200 million in emergency aid to help countries in Africa and elsewhere. Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt over surging food prices catapulted the issue to the forefront of the world&#x27;s attention.

==Criticisms and defenses==
The Bush policies in the Middle East, especially Iraq, have come under intense criticism although there are some supporters as well. Bush supporters point to a range of more successful policies elsewhere in the world, as summarized by Hal Brands and Peter Feaver:

==Americas==

===Canada===

Canada&#x27;s elite JTF2 unit joined American special forces in the U.S.-led coalition War in Afghanistan shortly after the al-Qaida attacks on September 11, 2001. Canadian forces joined the multinational coalition in Operation Anaconda in January 2002. On April 18, 2002, an American pilot bombed Canadian forces involved in a training exercise, killing four and wounding eight Canadians. A joint American-Canadian inquiry determined the cause of the incident to be pilot error, in which the pilot interpreted ground fire as an attack; the pilot ignored orders that he felt were &quot;second-guessing&quot; his field tactical decision. Canadian forces assumed a six-month command rotation of the International Security Assistance Force in 2003; in 2005, Canadians assumed operational command of the multi-national Brigade in Kandahar, with 2,300 troops, and supervises the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Kandahar, where al-Qaida forces are most active.

Relations between President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien were strained throughout their overlapping times in office. After the September 11 attacks terror attacks, Jean Chrétien publicly mused that U.S. foreign policy might be part of the &quot;root causes&quot; of terrorism. Some Americans criticized his &quot;smug moralism&quot;, and Chrétien&#x27;s public refusal to support the 2003 Iraq war was met with negative responses in the United States, especially among conservatives.

Prime Minister Chrétien said on October 10, 2002, that Canada would, in fact, be part of a military coalition to invade Iraq if it were sanctioned by the United Nations. However, when the United States and the United Kingdom subsequently withdrew their diplomatic efforts to gain that UN sanction, Jean Chrétien announced in Parliament on June 18, 2003, that Canada would &quot;not&quot; participate in the pending invasion. Nevertheless, he offered the US and its soldiers his moral support. However, according to classified U.S. documents released by WikiLeaks, a high-ranking Canadian official may have secretly promised to clandestinely support the invasion.

President Bush and newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper were thought to share warm personal relations and also close ties between their administrations. Because Bush was so unpopular among liberals in Canada (particularly in the media), this was underplayed by the Harper government.

Shortly after being congratulated by President Bush following his election victory in January 2006, Harper rebuked U.S. ambassador to Canada David Wilkins for criticizing the Conservatives&#x27; plans to assert Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over the Arctic Ocean waters with military force.

===Central American Free Trade Agreement===

The U.S. Senate approved the CAFTA-DR on June 30, 2005, by a vote of 54–45, and the U.S. House of Representatives approved the pact on July 28, 2005, by a vote of 217–215, with two representatives not voting. Controversy arose over this vote because it was held open 1 hour and 45 minutes longer than the normal 15 minutes in order to get some members to change their votes. For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on CAFTA on July 28 and the pact garnered an additional vote from Sen. Joe Lieberman—who had been absent on June 30—in favor of the agreement. The implementing legislation became Public Law 109-053 when it was signed by Bush on August 2, 2005.

The Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras have also approved the agreement. They are all the current members of CAFTA-DR.

El Salvador became the first country to formally implement CAFTA, which went into effect on March 1, 2006, when the Organization of American States (OAS) received signed copies of the treaty. On April 1, 2006, Honduras and Nicaragua fully implemented the agreement. On May 18, 2006, the Congress of Guatemala ratified CAFTA-DR, which went into effect on July 1, 2006. The Dominican Republic implemented the agreement on March 1, 2007. In a referendum on October 7, 2007, Costa Rica narrowly backed the free trade agreement, with 51.6% voting &quot;Yes&quot;; the agreement took effect on January 1, 2009.

===Chile===
President Bush signed the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement signed on June 6, 2003. The pact came into force on January 1, 2004. On that date, tariffs on 90% of U.S. exports to Chile and 95% of Chilean exports to the United States were eliminated. The agreement also established that Chile and the U.S. will establish duty-free trade in all products within a maximum of 12 years (2016). In 2009, bilateral trade between the United States and Chile reached US$15.4 billion, a 141% increase over bilateral trade levels before the U.S.-Chile FTA took effect. In particular, U.S. exports to Chile in 2009 showed a 248% increase over pre-FTA levels.

===Mexico===

During Fox&#x27;s administration, Mexico pushed for &quot;comprehensive&quot; reform of U.S. immigration law that addressed the problem of Illegal immigration to the United States. The issue had been called &quot;The Whole Enchilada&quot; by Fox&#x27;s administration, which stated that &quot;immigration reform in the United States should address mutual border problems, the rights of undocumented immigrants, and the development of regions in Mexico that &#x27;expel&#x27; migrants&quot;. However, according to former U.S. ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow, all discussions between the parties on immigration were informal.

The immigration reform that Fox sought included a guest worker plan. Fox said, &quot;The best thing that can happen to both our countries is to have an orderly flow, a controlled flow, of migration to the United States&quot;. This reform was supported by President Bush and approved by the U.S. Senate, however, the bill was rejected by the House of Representatives. According to the Washington Post, the hopes were complicated by the recent approval of the SBI (Secure Border Initiative), a bill that includes building a triple fence between the U.S. and Mexico.

During Fox&#x27;s presidency the net migration rate in Mexico increased 152% from −2.84 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants to −4.32; in the same period, population growth decreased 35% from 1.57% to 1.16%. Fox, who was said to be &quot;proud&quot; of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. has acknowledged the importance of remittances by both legal and illegal Mexican workers in the U.S. (now the #1 source of revenue for the country).

During the country&#x27;s tenure as a rotating member of the UN Security Council, Mexico did not support the U.S-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Peru===
On November 18, 2003, the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, notified Congress of the intention of the Bush administration to initiate negotiations for a free trade agreement with the countries involved in the Andean trade act. Negotiations started without Bolivia in May 2004, however, as each of the three remaining Andean countries decided to pursue bilateral agreements with the United States. After 13 rounds of negotiations, Peru and the United States concluded an agreement on December 7, 2005. Alfredo Ferrero, Peruvian Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, and the U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman signed the deal on April 12, 2006, in Washington, D.C., in the presence of Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo.

The Congress of Peru debated the agreement for six hours during the night of June 27, 2006, and ratified it in the early hours of the next day. The vote was 79–14, with seven abstentions. The U.S. House of Representatives approved the agreement on November 8, 2007, with a 285–132 vote. The U.S. Senate approved the agreement on December 4, 2007, with a 77–18 vote. The implementation bills gained wide support from the Republican Party (176–16 in the House, 47–1 in the Senate) and split backing from the Democratic Party (109–116 and 29–17).

On January 16, 2009, Bush signed a proclamation To Implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and for Other Purposes, effective February 1, 2009.

==Asia==

===ASEAN===
President Bush simultaneously improved relations with India, Japan, South Korea, China, and ASEAN. Bush confirmed that he would be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) conference for the first time during his presidency in 2007. However, he did not attend the conference due to American opposition to the government of Myanmar at the time.

===China===

The Bush administration&#x27;s policy towards China faced the difficult task of sustaining the cooperative US-China relationship in the context of China&#x27;s rise. China&#x27;s success in economic development since the 1979 reforms had allowed Beijing to transform growing Chinese material wealth into political and military power. Robert Zoellick, serving in Bush&#x27;s cabinet as US Trade Representative and Deputy Secretary of State, once underlined that &quot;China is big, it is growing, and it will influence the world in the years ahead. At the end of his second term, President Bush had successfully managed to establish significant elements of US-China cooperation and build a record of cooperation with a rising China while achieving US national interests. During his presidential campaign, Bush revealed his disagreement with the Clinton administration&#x27;s view of China as &quot;a competitor, not a strategic partner. While seeing China as a power in transition and asserting that if China became a friend of the US, &quot;that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the peace we seek may not be found&quot;, Bush warned that China would be &quot;respected as a great power... unthreatened, but not unchecked&quot;, under his administration.

Bush became increasingly concerned about China&#x27;s growing economic and political influence in the world, often labelled as &#x27;China&#x27;s rise&#x27;, and its implications for US primacy and interests. President Bush believed that China&#x27;s rise was an inevitable phenomenon that the United States had to manage. He strived to build a &quot;constructive, candid, and cooperative&quot; relationship with China. This, in Bush&#x27;s viewpoint, would form a sturdy basis for the US to advance engagement with China. In fact, Bush&#x27;s determination to increase cooperation with China led to &quot;the best relations since 1972.

The Bush administration had made efforts to embed the Chinese economy in the international economic system, assist Chinese economic development and share the mutual economic benefits between the two nations. In 2001, despite a confrontation between Washington and Beijing over the downed EP-3E Aries II spy plane which collided with a Chinese fighter jet, President Bush still declared his support for China&#x27;s entry into the World Trade Organization. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m an advocate of China&#x27;s entry into the WTO&quot;, stressing that &quot;China ought to be a trading partner of ours. I think it is in our economic interests to open up the Chinese markets to U.S. products, to U.S. agricultural products&quot;.

Also, President Bush actively supported permanent normalized trade relations with China. In his view, American farmers and businessmen would gain better benefits from freer access to the large Chinese market. He therefore asked the US Congress to extend normalized trade relations with China in 2001: &quot;Fair trade is essential not only to improving living standards for Americans but also for a strong and productive relationship with China.&quot; President Bush and his team believed that trading with China would be a good thing for the US and Chinese economies. Integrating China into the world economy would ultimately lead to the promotion of human dignity in China and the emergence of a good China. In her 2000 article entitled &quot;Promoting the National Interest&quot; Condoleezza Rice, Bush&#x27;s Secretary of State, wrote: President Bush&#x27;s efforts to build a cooperative relationship with China can also be seen in his way of maintaining frank and productive relations with Chinese leaders. In 2002–2003 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in China. There were up to 5,327 infections and 348 deaths in China. While the Chinese leadership had been criticized for its handling of the SARS outbreak, President Bush praised his Chinese counterpart for being open about this transnational epidemic. President Bush&#x27;s public support for President Hu in that critical moment was highly appreciated by the Chinese president and contributed to building cooperative leader-to-leader relations between the United States and China.

In the mid-2000s, the United States focused relatively less on China issues. This approach was reinforced by the economic benefits to the United States from its relations with China, including cheaper consumer products like clothing and electronics. During this period, the United States also issued significant debt to fund its military interventions and China became the largest foreign purchaser of U.S. government debt.

President Bush called Chinese President Hu Jintao March 26, 2008, to express his concern about China&#x27;s crackdown on protesters in Tibet since March 10, 2008. Bush and Hu also discussed issues including Taiwan, North Korea&#x27;s denuclearization and Myanmar.

===India===

Relations with India improved significantly during Bush&#x27;s tenure. In September 2001, President Bush removed sanctions which had been imposed.

During the tenure of the George W. Bush administration, relations between India and the United States were seen to have blossomed, primarily over common concerns regarding growing Islamic extremism, energy security, and climate change. Bush commented, &quot;India is a great example of democracy. It is very devout, has diverse religious heads, but everyone is comfortable about their religion. The world needs India&quot;. Fareed Zakaria, in his book &quot;The Post-American World&quot;, described Bush as &quot;being the most pro-Indian president in American history.&quot; Similar sentiments are echoed by Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy and ideologue of India&#x27;s Congress Party – the largest constituent of the UPA. According to Laskar, the UPA rule has seen a &quot;transformation in bilateral ties with the US&quot;, as a result of which the relations now covers &quot;a wide range of issues, including high technology, space, education, agriculture, trade, clean energy, counter-terrorism, etc.&quot;.

After the December 2004 tsunami, the US and Indian navies cooperated in search and rescue operations and in the reconstruction of affected areas.

Since 2004, Washington and New Delhi have been pursuing a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; that is based on shared values and generally convergent geopolitical interests. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives – including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation – are underway. This latter initiative, first launched in 2005, reversed three decades of American non-proliferation policy. Also in 2005, the United States and India signed a ten-year defence framework agreement, with the goal of expanding bilateral security cooperation. The two countries engaged in numerous and unprecedented combined military exercises, and major US arms sales to India were concluded. An Open Skies Agreement was signed in April 2005, enhancing trade, tourism, and business via the increased number of flights, and Air India purchased 68 US Boeing aircraft at a cost of $8 billion. The United States and India also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation in 2005. After Hurricane Katrina, India donated $5 million to the American Red Cross and sent two planeloads of relief supplies and materials to help. Then, on March 1, 2006, President Bush made another diplomatic visit to further expand relations between India and the U.S.

===Japan===

During Bush&#x27;s visit to Japan, In his address to the Japanese parliament in February 2002, President Bush expressed his gratitude to Japan for supporting the US in the war on terror, and asserting that the Japanese response to the terrorist threat showed the strength of the US-Japan alliance and &quot;the indispensable role of Japan, a role that is global, and begins in Asia&quot;. President Bush also convinced members of Japan&#x27;s parliament that the 21st century would be &quot;the Pacific century&quot;, and committed to giving support to Japan. The Bush administration made important progress in deepening US-Japan security cooperation. Under Bush, bilateral security initiatives between the United States and Japan were centred on counter-terrorism cooperation. President Bush endorsed the idea that Japan should play a more active international role and praised Japan for its passage of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law that allowed Japan to send refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean to assist US-led operations in Afghanistan in 2001. On December 9, 2003, the Japanese Diet passed the Humanitarian Relief and Iraqi Reconstruction Special Measures Law that allowed Prime Minister Koizumi to dispatch the Self Defence Forces (SDF) to Iraq. In January 2004, Japan sent a total of 1,000 military personnel (including 550 Ground Self-Defence Force personnel and 450 Maritime Self-Defence Force and Air Self- Defence Force personnel) to Iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and take part in reconstruction activities. This was the first time in the post-war period Japanese troops were sent overseas without an inter- national mandate. Japan withdrew its ground forces in 2006 while a Japanese self-defence forces air division stayed in Iraq until the expiration of the UN authorisation for multilateral forces in Iraq in 2008. Indeed, under Bush, military cooperation between Washington and Tokyo in Afghanistan and Iraq became a new dimension and a symbol of their alliance.

===North Korea===
Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of the three states in an &quot;axis of evil&quot; in his 2002 State of the Union Address. He said that &quot;the United States of America will not permit the world&#x27;s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world&#x27;s most destructive weapons.&quot; and that &quot;North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens&quot; Within months, &quot;both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.&quot; President Bush in his 2005 State of the Union Address, stated that &quot;We&#x27;re working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions&quot; and that &quot;In the next 4 years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time&quot;. North Korea&#x27;s October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush&#x27;s foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on &quot;[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world&quot;. Bush condemned North Korea&#x27;s position, reaffirmed his commitment to &quot;a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula&quot;, and said that &quot;transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States&quot;, for which North Korea would be held accountable.

North Korea had developed weapons of mass destruction for several years prior to Bush&#x27;s inauguration, and the Clinton administration had sought to trade economic assistance for an end to the North Korean WMD program. Though Secretary of State Powell urged the continuation of the rapprochement, other administration officials, including Vice President Cheney, were more skeptical of the good faith of the North Koreans. Bush instead sought to isolate North Korea in the hope that the regime would eventually collapse.

North Korea launched missile tests on July 5, 2006, leading to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695. The country said on October 3, 2006 &quot;The U.S. extreme threat of a nuclear war and sanctions and pressure compel the DPRK to conduct a nuclear test&quot;, which the Bush administration denied and denounced. Days later on October 9, 2006, North Korea followed through on its promise to test nuclear weapons. On October 14, 2006, the Security Council unanimously passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, sanctioning North Korea for the test. In the waning days of his presidency, Bush attempted to re-open negotiations with North Korea, but North Korea continued to develop its nuclear programs.

On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.

===Singapore===

President Bush and Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong signed a bilateral free trade agreement on May 6, 2003; the agreement entered into force on January 1, 2004. The growth of U.S. investment in Singapore and the large number of Americans living there enhance opportunities for contact between Singapore and the United States.

===South Korea===

President Bush simultaneously improved relations with South Korea. On February 20, 2002, during President Bush&#x27;s visit to South Korea, Bush and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung recognized that the South Korea-U.S. alliance is indispensable not only for stability on the Korean Peninsula but also in Northeast Asia as a whole. Furthermore, President Bush and Kim Dae-Jung expressed satisfaction that the bilateral alliance is not limited to cooperation in security matters but that the comprehensive partnership has expanded and developed to all areas, including political, economic, and diplomatic arenas. President Bush and president Kim Dae-jung exchanged views about the war against terrorism and future course of action. and Dae-Jung praised President Bush for the success in the war against terrorism under his outstanding leadership and indicated that South Korea as an ally would do its utmost to cooperate and provide full support. In December 2001, South Korea deployed troops to the U.S.-led War in Afghanistan . Afterwards, South Korea took only the role of providing medical and vocational training by assisting the United States with only two dozen volunteers working inside Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul. According to an ISAF statement, on June 30, 2008, South Korea returned, operating a small hospital near the airbase in Bagram with military and civilian personnel. In February 2004, South Korea deployed troops to Iraq as part of the coalition forces to provide support to U.S. forces in the Iraq War, which was also another boost in U.S.-ROK Relations.

===Taiwan===
Bush&#x27;s hostile position toward China in the 2000 campaign and early months of his presidency was suddenly reversed after 9/11, and his especially friendly attitude toward Taiwan became a casualty. During his campaign Bush had warned that Clinton was too friendly with China, which he saw as a strategic competitor. Early on as president Bush increased arms sales to Taiwan, including 8 submarines. He was asked on April 25, 2001, &quot;if Taiwan were attacked by China, do we [The U.S.] have an obligation to defend the Taiwanese?&quot; He responded, &quot;Yes, we do... and the Chinese must understand that. The United States would do whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself.&quot; He made it understood that &quot;though we have common interests, the Chinese must understand that there will be some areas where we disagree.&quot; However, on the advice of Rice and Powell, he later explained that he was not changing America&#x27;s historical relationships. The shock of 9/11 force Bush to move closer to China. Soon he was calling China a strategic partner in the war on terror and postponing deals with Taiwan.

Taiwan&#x27;s leadership was increasingly nervous in the early 21st century. It had to deal with growing isolation around the world because of China&#x27;s pressure on other countries. In economic terms, it was facing worsening trade relationships with major trading partners. According to Chen-Don Tso, Taiwan was unable to make free trade agreements with them. Its main goal was to reach an explicit partnership with the United States. However, repeated efforts by Taiwan especially in 2003 to 2006 were rejected by Washington, in its quest to improve relations with Beijing.

==Europe==

===Historical background===
President Bush made his first visit to Europe in June 2001. Bush came under criticism from European leaders for the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, which was aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. He asserted that the Kyoto Protocol is &quot;unfair and ineffective&quot; because it would exempt 80 percent of the world and &quot;cause serious harm to the U.S. economy&quot;. Post September 11, President Bush worked closely with his NATO allies in Europe, to fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, in Afghanistan. However, after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, relations were strained with France and Germany, who strongly opposed the invasion. But President Bush had an excellent relationship with Tony Blair of Britain and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, which took part in the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine. However, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, both undemocratically elected and fiercely autocratic, received official state visits to the White House, along with increased economic and military assistance. The President had encouraged both leaders to hold free and fair elections early on in his second term, but in fact neither leader carried out significant reforms.

===Belarus===
President Bush signed the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 on October 20, 2004, to impose sanctions on the Belarus government of Alexander Lukashenko. The law expresses the sense of Congress that the Belarusian authorities should not receive various types of non-humanitarian financial aid from the U.S. It also calls for the President to report to Congress on arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and on the personal wealth and assets of senior Belarus officials. President Bush said in his signing statement of October 20, 2004, &quot;will work with our allies and partners to assist those seeking to return Belarus to its rightful place among the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies.&quot;

In June 2006, President Bush issued executive order to freeze the US assets of hard-line Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and nine other individuals deemed obstacles to democracy in the former Soviet republic. &quot;There is simply no place in a Europe whole and free for a regime of this kind&quot;, Bush said in a letter to the US Congress announcing his executive order, which affects assets held in the United States or by US financial institutions.

On December 8, 2006, the United States House of Representatives passed, and (following Senate enactment) on January 12, 2007, President Bush signed into law, the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006, a statute amending and updating the act.

===Czech Republic===
President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel. On January 30, 2003, Havel signed &quot;The letter of the eight&quot; supporting the U.S. led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Havel also deployed Czech forces in the Iraq War as part the Coalition forces in May 2003.

Havel&#x27;s successor Václav Klaus, also deployed Czech forces in the U.S. led coalition War in Afghanistan in 2004.

===Denmark===

President Bush and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen enjoyed a strong friendship. Denmark with Rasmussen, deployed forces to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan in 2001 as part of NATO forces in the International Security Assistance Force. Rasmussen strongly supported the 2003 Iraq War and was one of the signatories of The letter of the eight on January 30, 2003. As in most European countries he faced considerable opposition, both in the parliament and in the general population. Subsequent opinion polls suggested the Danish population&#x27;s opinion was split on the issue. One vocal protester managed to get into the Danish parliament during the period before the war, where he poured red paint on the prime minister while yelling &quot;Du har blod på dine hænder&quot; (literally: &quot;You have blood on your hands&quot;). A member of the Danish parliament for the socialist Red-Green Alliance, Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil, stated that it was a reaction she might have made under the circumstances, although she later denounced such behaviour. Denmark was one of only five countries to take part in the actual invasion operations (the others being the U.S., UK, Poland and Australia) though the contingent mainly consisted of two minor warships and staff and radio units that were never involved in actual combat. In the months after the initial phase of the war, Danish troops participated in the multi-national force stationed in Iraq. Approximately 550 Danish troops were stationed in Iraq from 2004 and into 2007, first at &quot;Camp Dannevang&quot; and later at &quot;Camp Einherjer&quot;, both near Basra. When the contingent of troops left around August 2007, it was not replaced and Denmark shifted its focus to non-military support around Baghdad. The official reason provided is that the Iraqi government should now be able to handle security in the Basra area. Critics of Rasmussen argued that the withdrawal was motivated by decreasing domestic support for the war.

===France===

France with President Jacques Chirac deployed French forces to NATO&#x27;s U.S. led-coalition war in Afghanistan in 2001, but relations with France became strained after Chirac emerged as a leading voice against Bush and Tony Blair in 2003 during the organization and deployment of American and British forces participating in a military coalition to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the Ba&#x27;ath Party under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. Despite British and American pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction, and rallied other governments to his position. &quot;Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war&quot;, Chirac said on March 18, 2003. French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN).

===Germany===

German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder sent forces to Afghanistan as part of NATO operations of the U.S. led war in Afghanistan because due to Germany having a long experience with terrorism itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001. When Schröder left office, Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, UK, France, Canada and after two years Afghanistan.

However, relations with Germany became strained, after Schröder later spoke out strongly against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder&#x27;s stance caused political friction between the US and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder&#x27;s stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, Ludwig Stiegler, compared Bush to Julius Caesar while Schröder&#x27;s Minister of Justice, Herta Däubler-Gmelin, likened Bush&#x27;s foreign policy to that of Adolf Hitler. Schröder&#x27;s critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. After his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was &quot;not telling the truth&quot;. When asked in March 2003 if he were at all self-critical about his position on Iraq, Schröder replied, &quot;I very much regret there were excessive statements&quot; from himself and former members of his government (which capitalised on the war&#x27;s unpopularity).

===Italy===

President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Italy, with Berlusconi in office, became a solid ally of the United States due to his support in deploying Italian troops in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War following the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the war on terror. On January 30, 2003, Berlusconi signed &quot;The letter of the eight&quot; supporting US. policy on Iraq.

Berlusconi, in his meetings with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Bush, said that he pushed for &quot;a clear turnaround in the Iraqi situation&quot; and for a quick handover of sovereignty to the government chosen by the Iraqi people. Italy had some 3,200 troops deployed in Southern Iraq, the third largest contingent there after the American and British forces. When Romano Prodi became Prime Minister, Italian troops were gradually withdrawn from Iraq in the second half of 2006 with the last soldiers leaving the country in December of that year.

===NATO===
In November 2002, at a NATO summit Bush stated &quot;Our NATO alliance faces dangers very different from those it was formed to confront. Yet, never has our need for collective defense been more urgent. The Soviet Union is gone, but freedom still has enemies. We&#x27;re threatened by terrorism, bred within failed states, it&#x27;s present within our own cities. We&#x27;re threatened by the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons which are produced by outlaw regimes and could be delivered either by missile or terrorist cell. For terrorists and terrorist states, every free nation is a potential target, including the free nations of Europe&quot;.

Bush then stated &quot;To meet all of this century&#x27;s emerging threats from terror camps in remote regions to hidden laboratories of outlaw regimes, NATO must develop new military capabilities. NATO forces must become better able to fight side by side. Those forces must be more mobile and more swiftly deployed. The allies need more special operations forces, better precision strike capabilities, and more modern command structures. Few NATO members will have state-of-the-art capabilities in all of these areas; I recognize that. But every nation should develop some. Ours is a military alliance, and every member must make a military contribution to that alliance. For some allies, this will require higher defense spending. For all of us, it will require more effective defense spending, with each nation adding the tools and technologies to fight and win a new kind of war&quot;.

Bush then stated &quot;The United States proposes the creation of a NATO response force that will bring together well-equipped, highly ready air, ground and sea forces from NATO allies – old and new. This force will be prepared to deploy on short notice wherever it is needed. A NATO response force will take time to create and we should begin that effort here in Prague. Yet, security against new threats requires more than just new capabilities. Free nations must accept our shared obligations to keep the peace. The world needs the nations of this continent to be active in the defense of freedom; not inward-looking or isolated by indifference. Ignoring dangers or excusing aggression may temporarily avert conflict, but they don&#x27;t bring true peace&quot;.

===Poland===

President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with Poland, As well as Poland deploying its forces in supporting the global war on terror, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and coalition efforts in Iraq (where Polish contingent was one of the largest). Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller&#x27;s government, together with President Kwaśniewski, made a decision in March 2003 to join the coalition of the willing and deploy Polish troops to Iraq, targeting at overthrowing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government. Leszek Miller was also a co-signatory of &quot;the letter of 8&quot;, signed by eight European prime ministers, supporting the US position on Iraq. Already in 2002 Miller gave permission to the U.S. government to run a secret CIA prison at Stare Kiejkuty military training center, three hours North of Warsaw. Years later he is facing accusations of acting anti-constitutionally by having tolerated the imprisonment and torture of prisoners.

===Russia===

A planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia, Bush, said April 1, 2008, responding to concerns that the U.S. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes. His comments came before he left Kyiv for a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bush failed to resolve their differences over U.S. plans for the planned missile defense system based in Poland and the Czech Republic, on their meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on April 6, 2008, but said they had agreed a &quot;strategic framework&quot; to guide future U.S.-Russian relations, in which Russia and the U.S. said they recognized that the era in which each had considered the other to be a &quot;strategic threat or enemy&quot; was over. Before leaving April 1, 2008, for Bucharest, Bush told that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia&#x27;s or Ukraine&#x27;s inclusion into NATO. Bush said that both countries should be able to take part in NATO&#x27;s Membership Action Plan, which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance. Bush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy. Bush denied that the United States might ease off on membership plans for Ukraine and Georgia if Russia acquiesces on the missile shield.

===Spain===

Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar actively supported Bush in the war on terrorism by first deploying Spanish forces in the U.S.-led coalition War in Afghanistan in 2001. Aznar then met with Bush in a private meeting before 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss the situation of in the United Nations Security Council. The Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; leaked a partial transcript of the meeting. Aznar actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy and the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and was one of the signatories of The letter of the eight defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government&#x27;s nuclear proliferation. Aznar then deployed Spanish forces to the Iraq War as part of Multi-National Force – Iraq coalition forces. The majority of the Spanish population, including some members of Aznar&#x27;s Partido Popular, were against the war.

After the Spanish general election in 2004, in which the Spanish socialists received more votes than expected as a result, besides other issues, of the government&#x27;s handling of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero succeeded Aznar as Prime Minister. Before being elected, Zapatero had opposed the American policy in regard to Iraq pursued by Aznar. During the electoral campaign Zapatero had promised to withdraw the troops if control in Iraq was not passed to the United Nations after June 30 (the ending date of the initial Spanish military agreement with the multinational coalition that had overthrown Saddam Hussein). On April 19, 2004, Zapatero announced the withdrawal of the 1300 Spanish troops in Iraq.

The decision aroused international support worldwide, though the American Government claimed that the terrorists could perceive it as &quot;a victory obtained due to 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings&quot;. John Kerry, then Democratic party candidate for the American presidency, asked Zapatero not to withdraw the Spanish soldiers. Some months after withdrawing the troops, the Zapatero government agreed to increase the number of Spanish soldiers in Afghanistan and to send troops to Haiti to show the Spanish Government&#x27;s willingness to spend resources on international missions approved by the UN.

===United Kingdom===

President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair enjoyed a strong relationship. On September 20, 2001, during his address to a joint session of congress, President Bush declared &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain&quot;. Blair deployed British forces to NATO&#x27;s war in Afghanistan, second only to the US in sending forces. Blair then took the lead (against the opposition of France, Canada, Germany, China, and Russia) in advocating the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Blair was also one of the signatories of The letter of the eight on January 30, 2003.
Again Britain under Blair was second only to the US in sending forces to Iraq. Both sides wound down after 2009, and withdrew their last troops in 2011. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair provided sustained mutual political and diplomatic support and won votes in Congress and parliament against their critics at home.

==Greater Middle East==

===Afghanistan===


In his address to a joint session of congress on September 20, 2001, President Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to &quot;hand over the terrorists, or... share in their fate&quot;.

On October 7, 2001, the US led a NATO invasion of Afghanistan, instigating the global war on terror and what became the early phase of the US led-coalition War in Afghanistan. President Bush confirmed the strikes in his address to the nation, Bush stated that &quot;Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted&quot;. &quot;Food, medicine and supplies would be dropped to the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan&quot;. NATO forces scoured the region for 9/11 alleged mastermind Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist network Al-Qaeda and drove the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban regime, which was sheltering and providing sanctuary for Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, from power. However once Bin Laden left Afghanistan and took up sanctuary in Pakistan, Bush said that he was &quot;not that concerned about him&quot; as the Al-Qaeda leader continued to plot attacks against America.

The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai. the U.S. under the Bush administration supported the new government of Karzai by maintaining a high level of troops to establish the authority of his government as well as combat Taliban insurgency. Both Afghanistan and the United States resumed diplomatic ties in late 2001. In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that &quot;our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade&quot; as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.

Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Ayman al-Zawahiri, Bin laden&#x27;s second-in-command, took charge of al-Qaeda until he was killed in a targeted drone strike under the Biden administration.

Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, in March 2007, the Bush administration deployed another more than 3,500 troops to Afghanistan to expand the fight against the Taliban.

In June 2004, United States Forces began Drone strikes in Pakistan during the administration of President Bush, along the Federal Tribal Areas against Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants.

Major criticisms started to emerge from international human rights organizations about the United States policy of detaining alleged Taliban and Al-Qaeda combatants and refusing to grant these detainees their rights as prisoners of war as detailed in the Geneva Conventions. Other allegations stated that numerous captured Taliban fighters possessed no link to either Al-Qaeda or the Taliban. Instead these fighters had the misfortune of being forcibly recruited into the Taliban military during the American invasion. The practice of impressment was systematic of the Taliban regime which would raid villages for able bodied men to serve on the front lines for a specific time period.

In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. On March 1, 2006, Bush along with his wife Laura made a visit to Afghanistan where they greeted US soldiers, met with Afghan officials and later appeared at a special inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Embassy.

The United States under the Bush administration took the leading role in the overall reconstruction of Afghanistan by providing billions of dollars to the Afghan National Security Forces, building national roads, government and educational institutions.

President Bush and his administration labelled the detainees as &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; deemed to pose a threat to the U.S. or to have information about terrorist structures, plans and tactics. The administration has said that such detainees can be held for &quot;as long as necessary&quot;. Critics claim that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a fair trial and question whether people like Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, can be called an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;. In the case of Zaeef, they claim he cannot be a &quot;combatant&quot; because he was crippled during the Soviet occupation and that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;unlawful&quot; because he was ambassador of his country. The Bush administration and its supporters claim that the war against America by Al-Qaeda is ongoing, that it is unconventional, and that the &quot;battlefield&quot; extends into the U.S. itself. According to the declassified April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, &quot;United States-led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged the leadership of Al-Qaeda and disrupted its operations; however, we judge that al-Qa&#x27;ida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization. We also assess that the global jihadist movement—which includes Al-Qaeda, affiliated and independent terrorist groups, and emerging networks and cells—is spreading and adapting to counterterrorism efforts.&quot;

On September 6, 2006, President Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held &quot;high-value detainees&quot; for interrogation in secret prisons around the world. He also announced that fourteen Al-Qaeda senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

Although the Bush administration released over 100 detainees and authorized military tribunals for the rest, the legal framework governing them has been slow in the making. According to Human Rights Watch, as of January 2004, &quot;the public still [did] not know who the detainees are, what they [had] allegedly done, and whether and when they will be charged with crimes or released. There [had] been no hearings to determine the legal status of detainees and no judicial review—in short, no legal process at all.&quot; In February 2002 the United States began releasing several dozen detainees to their home countries, including many British and Pakistani nationals. The British detainees were briefly investigated and cleared of any British charges within 24 hours of their arrival.

The domestic political equation changed in the U.S. after the September 11, 2001, attacks, bolstering the influence of the neoconservative faction of the administration and throughout Washington. The conflict in Afghanistan, and the events that had launched the war, coincided with a reassessment of foreign policy by the administration, which President Bush articulated in his first State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002. Previously, September 11 had underscored the threat of attacks from terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, as opposed to nation-states, and U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan targeted the ruling Taliban militia for having harbored al-Qaeda sponsor Osama bin Laden. Now speaking of an &quot;axis of evil&quot; comprising Iran, North Korea, and Iraq in his address to Congress, Bush claimed that he was preparing to open a new front in the U.S. global &quot;war on terrorism&quot;.

===Bahrain===

President Bush designated Bahrain a Major non-NATO ally in 2002. President Bush signed the Bahrain–United States Free Trade Agreement into law on January 11, 2006. The FTA was implemented on August 1, 2006, and will reduce certain barriers of trade between the two countries.

===Egypt===

President Bush enjoyed relations with Egypt under President Hosni Mubarak, However, later on Egyptian–American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the U.S. in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks of 2001 but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed U.S. military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq through their membership in the African Union and the Arab League, continued to oppose U.S. occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with U.S. requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella.

President Mubarak spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict should have been resolved first. He also said the war would cause &quot;100 Bin Ladens&quot;. However, as president he did not support an immediate US withdrawal from Iraq because he believed it would probably lead to chaos.

The issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in Iraq, despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree.

US officials quoted in &quot;USA Today&quot; described Egyptian security and military as having shared &quot;valuable intelligence&quot; and providing other &quot;useful counterterrorism assistance&quot;, in the 1980, 90s and &quot;particularly in the decade since the 9/11 attacks&quot;. Under President Hosni Mubarak and his intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, the U.S. has had &quot;an important partnership&quot; in counterterrorism.

===Iran===
In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush labeled Iran as a member of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, where he stated &quot;Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people&#x27;s hope for freedom&quot;. Bush also accused Iran of aiding terrorist organizations. In June 2005, Bush issued Executive Order 13382 freezing the assets of individuals connected with Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. In 2006, Iran re-opened three of its nuclear facilities, potentially allowing it to begin the process of building a nuclear bomb. After the resumption of the Iranian nuclear program, many within the U.S. military and foreign policy community speculated that Bush might attempt to impose regime change on Iran. This was evident in the Iran Freedom and Support Act legislation bill signed by President Bush on September 30, 2006, that appropriated $10 million and directed the President of the United States to spend that money in support of &quot;pro-democracy groups&quot; opposed to the Iranian government. Opponents claimed the bill was a first step towards a US-led invasion of the country. In December 2006, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1737, which imposed sanctions on Iran in order to curb its nuclear program.

There has been much controversy surrounding Iran and its nuclear program in the past few years. The controversy centers on the Iranian enrichment of uranium. Iran officials have stated that they are enriching the uranium to fuel civilian reactors as permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international agreements, but the processes that Iran has been developing to reprocess and enrich uranium are also critical components for the development of a nuclear weapon.

Since there exists some circumstantial evidence that Iran, classified by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism, may have intentions of pursuing a weapons program, the Iranian nuclear program became a major foreign policy of the United States.

===Iraq===

Beginning with his State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002, President Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot; allied with terrorists and posing &quot;a grave and growing danger&quot; to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction. Bush declared, &quot;Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.&quot; Announcing that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, he claimed, &quot;The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade.&quot; and claimed &quot;This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children&quot;. and that &quot;This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors&quot;. and that &quot;This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilised world&quot;.

In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.

Bush began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq on September 12, 2002, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.

In October 2002, Congress passed a legislation titled the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq signed by President Bush on October 16, 2002. authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq government.

On November 20, 2002, at a NATO summit in Prague, Czech Republic, President Bush and President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel held a joint news conference, where Bush stated &quot;It&#x27;s very important for our NATO nations as well as all free nations to work collectively to see to it that Saddam Hussein disarms&quot;, &quot;However, should he choose not to disarm, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him and at that point in time, all our nations will be able choose whether or not they want to participate.&quot;

In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries. The Bush administration&#x27;s claim that the Iraq War was part of the war on terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts.

In his State of the Union Address on January 28, 2003, President Bush declared Saddam Hussein was the worst, and &quot;a brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.&quot; In this context, Bush also said, &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa&quot;.

Although no agreement on authorizing force could be found within the United Nations Security Council, the war was ultimately launched in March 2003, after Bush, in a speech on March 17, 2003, effectively had set out a declaration of his objectives as &quot;assuring [the] national security&quot; of the United States, and &quot;no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms&quot;. Bush also issued an ultimatum stating, &quot;Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing.&quot;


President Bush in his address to the nation from the Oval Office on March 19, 2003, officially announced the beginning of the invasion of Iraq, here he stated &quot;On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ability to wage war. These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign. More than 35 countries are giving crucial support from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense&quot;. The military action was dubbed &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;.


More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003, which resulted in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist regime 24 year rule. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush&#x27;s &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; speech was later criticized as premature. President Bush then appointed Paul Bremer Presidential Envoy to Iraq on May 9, 2003, and administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority, his appointment declared him subject to the &quot;authority, direction and control&quot; of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. On December 14, 2003, President Bush announced the capture of Saddam Hussein, after U.S. forces captured him in Operation Red Dawn and said that Saddam would &quot;face the justice he denied to millions. For the Ba&#x27;athist holdouts responsible for the violence, there will be no return to the corrupt power and privilege they once held&quot;. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush&#x27;s policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was &quot;grave and deteriorating&quot;. While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians as of 2016.

In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, &quot;This is the greatest day in the history of this country.&quot; Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis &quot;have taken rightful control of their country&#x27;s destiny&quot;. This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.

In June 2006, President Bush announced the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, after U.S. forces killed him in an airstrike and stated that through his every action Zarqawi sought to defeat America and its coalition partners by turning Iraq into a safe haven for al-Qaeda. Bush also stated, &quot;Now Zarqawi has met his end and this violent man will never murder again.&quot;

On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2billion (equivalent to $billion in ) for these programs. On January 23, 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced &quot;deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq&quot;. On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying the debate over the conflict was &quot;understandable&quot; but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.

In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government&#x27;s &quot;bold decision&quot; to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it &quot;a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq&quot;. He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis&#x27; legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections. By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began, and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces. During his last visit in Iraq in December 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes to Bush amid official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Al-Zaidi yelled the strikes on Bush as &quot;farewell kiss&quot; and &quot;for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq.&quot;

In March 2010, Center for Public Integrity released a report that President Bush&#x27;s administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about alleged threat of Iraq against the United States, as his rationale to engage war in Iraq. Senior war crimes prosecutor Benjamin B. Ferencz has suggested that Bush should be tried in the International Criminal Court for &#x27;269 war crime charges&#x27; related to the Iraq War.

Criticism also came from the governments of many countries, notably from many on the United Nations Security Council, who argued that the war broke international law. (Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that &quot;all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land&quot; and that &quot;all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution&quot;, while Article III states that the judicial power of the US Supreme Court extends to &quot;all... Treaties made&quot;. This makes a violation of international law also a violation of the &quot;supreme Law of The Land&quot; of America, and withholds immunity from government officials, including the president.) See Worldwide government positions on war on Iraq and The UN Security Council and the Iraq war. For its part, the U.S. administration soon presented a list of countries called the coalition of the willing which supported its position. A later aspect of the criticism has been the death toll in Iraq; over 100,000 Iraqi civilians and 4000 U.S. soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war mainly during the ensuing insurgency and civil war. In 2004, public assertions by Bush&#x27;s former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O&#x27;Neill and counter-terrorism expert Richard Clarke raised questions about the credibility of the Bush administration&#x27;s pre-war claims. Both presented evidence that questioned how focused the Bush administration was on combating Al-Qaeda (which was operating out of Afghanistan, not Iraq) before September 11. Specifically, O&#x27;Neill presented classified and unclassified documents indicating that planning for a war with Iraq and the subsequent occupation began at the first National Security Council meeting and continued with each meeting. Clarke presented testimony and witnesses concerning how Bush and much of his cabinet tried to find excuses to attack Iraq immediately after September 11, such as associating it with September 11, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and claiming that Iraq posed an imminent threat, which implied that a war against Iraq would be legal by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.

Testimony at the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (ongoing during March 2004) has included claims of how much of the Bush administration&#x27;s immediate post-9/11 emphasis on Iraq was appropriate and proportional to the overall picture of terrorism, especially in light of the administration&#x27;s subsequent decision to pursue military action in Afghanistan first, the fact that organizations accused of 9/11 are in Afghanistan, not Iraq, and that no links have been found between these organizations and Saddam Hussein. The commission&#x27;s report is expected to be released before the presidential election. On June 16, 2004, the USA&#x27;s 9/11 Commission filed an initial report on its findings, stating that it found &quot;no credible evidence&quot; of a &quot;collaborative relationship&quot; between pre-invasion Iraq and Al-Qaeda or of Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks.

The inability of the U.S. to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to greater domestic criticism of the administration&#x27;s Iraq policy. Several of the statements that Bush and his administration made leading up to the war in Iraq, especially those involving claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, have been criticized as misleading or inaccurate. Particularly controversial was Bush&#x27;s claim in the 2003 State of the Union Address that British Intelligence had discovered that Iraq was seeking to buy uranium from Africa. Officials and diplomats disputed the evidence for this claim, especially after a document describing an attempted purchase from Niger, which was presented to the United Nations Security Council by Colin Powell, was found to be a forgery. This led to a public embarrassment for George Tenet, the director of the CIA, as well as the Valerie Plame scandal. Much criticism on these issues has come from political opponents of Bush. The Iraq war was a significant issue in the 2004 Democratic primary, including the campaigns of Howard Dean, John Kerry, Al Sharpton, and Dennis Kucinich.

However, State Department documents declassified in 2006 cite hundreds of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq. Nonetheless, it was soon quickly revealed that the particular weapons in question were WMD Saddam had obtained during the Iran-Iraq war, which had long since become stale and non-functional

On March 24, 2004, Bush joked about the weapons of mass destruction issue at the annual White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. While showing slides of himself searching the Oval Office, he joked, &quot;those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere... nope, no weapons over there... maybe under here?&quot; Some found it tasteless of him to be joking about the issue. Others defended the joke as being in line with the self-deprecatory sort of humor that has come to be expected of presidents when they speak at that event.

On September 26, 2006, Bush declassified the key judgments of the April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate. The estimate, titled &quot;Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States&quot;, states the following: &quot;We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere. The Iraq conflict has become the &#x27;cause celebre&#x27; for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement. Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.&quot;

On December 1, 2008, during an interview with ABC World News, Bush stated &quot;The biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq. A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said the weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein&quot;. &quot;I think I was unprepared for war. In other words, I didn&#x27;t campaign and say, &#x27;Please vote for me, I&#x27;ll be able to handle an attack&#x27;... I didn&#x27;t anticipate war.&quot; and on early withdrawal of troops, &quot;It was a tough call, particularly, since a lot of people were advising for me to get out of Iraq, or pull back in Iraq&quot;.

On December 14, 2008, during a joint press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Bush was publicly insulted when an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at the President as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands. The offender, later identified as television correspondent Muntadar al-Zeidi, leapt from his chair and quickly hurled first one shoe and then the other at the president, who was about 20 feet away. Bush successfully dodged both projectiles which were aimed at his head. Zeidi worked for Al-Baghdadia television, an Iraqi-owned station based in Cairo. He was wrestled to the ground by security officials and then hauled away, moaning as they left the room. &quot;So what if the guy threw a shoe at me?&quot; Bush said, comparing the action to political protests in the United States. Al-Baghdadia&#x27;s Baghdad manager told the Associated Press he had no idea what prompted his reporter to go on the attack. The Iraqi government has demanded an on-air apology from his employer.

===Israel===


President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon established good relations in their March and June 2001 meetings. On October 4, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Sharon accused the Bush administration of appeasing the Palestinians at Israel&#x27;s expense in a bid for Arab support for the US anti-terror campaign. The White House said that the remark was unacceptable. Rather than apologize for the remark, Sharon said that the United States failed to understand him. Also, the United States criticized the Israeli practice of assassinating Palestinians believed to be engaged in terrorism, which appeared to some Israelis to be inconsistent with the US policy of pursuing Osama bin Laden &quot;dead or alive&quot;.

In 2003, in the middle of the Second Intifada and a sharp economic downturn in Israel, the US provided Israel with $9 billion in conditional loan guarantees made available through 2011 and negotiated each year at the US–Israel Joint Economic Development Group.

President Bush noted in an April 14, 2002, Memorandum which came to be called &quot;the Bush Roadmap&quot; (and which established the parameters for subsequent Israel-Palestinian negotiations) the need to take into account changed &quot;realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers&quot;, as well as Israel&#x27;s security concerns, asserting that &quot;It is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.&quot; He later emphasized that, within these parameters, details of the borders were subjects for negotiations between the parties.

Bush had maintained a desire to resume the peace process in Israel, and had openly proclaimed his desire for a Palestinian state to be created before 2005. He outlined a road map for peace in cooperation with Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, which featured compromises that had to be made by both sides before Palestinian statehood could become a reality.

One particular proposal was his insistence on new Palestinian leadership; a stance that saw the appointment of the first ever Palestinian Prime Minister on April 29, 2003. Bush had denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for continued support of violence and militant groups. The road map for peace stalled within months after more violence and the resignation of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmoud Abbas.

By the end of 2003, neither side had done what was outlined in the plan. In April 2004 Bush announced that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip but retain Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He also announced agreement with Sharon&#x27;s policy of denying the right of return. This led to condemnation from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Arab and European governments and was a major departure from previous U.S. foreign policy in the region. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak commented Bush&#x27;s policies had led to an &#x27;unprecedented hatred&#x27; of Arabs for the U.S.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, On July 14, 2006, the US Congress was notified of a potential sale of $210 million worth of jet fuel to Israel. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency noted that the sale of the JP-8 fuel, should it be completed, will &quot;enable Israel to maintain the operational capability of its aircraft inventory&quot;, and that &quot;The jet fuel will be consumed while the aircraft is in use to keep peace and security in the region&quot;. It was reported on July 24 that the United States was in the process of providing Israel with &quot;bunker buster&quot; bombs, which would allegedly be used to target the leader of Lebanon&#x27;s Hezbollah guerilla group and destroy its trenches.

American media also questioned whether Israel violated an agreement not to use cluster bombs on civilian targets. Although many of the cluster bombs used were advanced M-85 munitions developed by Israel Military Industries, Israel also used older munitions purchased from the US. Evidence during the conflict, hitting civilian areas, although the civilian population had mostly fled. Israel asserts that civilian damage was unavoidable, as Hezbollah ensconced itself in highly populated areas. Simultaneously, indiscriminate Hezbollah rocket fire turned many of its northern towns into virtual ghost towns, in violation of international law. Many bomblets remained undetonated after the war, causing hazard for Lebanese civilians. Israel said that it had not violated any international law because cluster bombs are not illegal and were used only on military targets.

On July 15, 2006, the United Nations Security Council again rejected pleas from Lebanon that it call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that the US was the only member of out the 15-nation UN body to oppose any council action at all.

On July 19, 2006, the Bush administration rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that certain conditions had to be met, not specifying what they were. John Bolton, US Ambassador to the United Nations, rejected the call for a ceasefire, on the grounds that such an action addressed the conflict only superficially: &quot;The notion that you just declare a ceasefire and act as if that is going to solve the problem, I think is simplistic.&quot;

On July 26, 2006, foreign ministers from the US, Europe, and the Middle East that met in Rome vowed &quot;to work immediately to reach with the utmost urgency a ceasefire that puts an end to the current violence and hostilities&quot;. However, the US maintained strong support for the Israeli campaign, and the conference&#x27;s results were reported to have fallen short of Arab and European leaders&#x27; expectations.

After the 2006 Lebanon war ended, President Bush said that Hezbollah was responsible for starting the war, and that the group suffered a defeat at the hands of Israel. He dismissed claims of victory by Hezbollah leaders, asking: &quot;how can you claim victory when at one time you were a state within a state, safe within southern Lebanon, and now you&#x27;re going to be replaced by a Lebanese Army and an international force?&quot; In his 2010 memoir, &quot;Decision Points&quot;, Bush wrote that Israel had weakened Hezbollah and secured its northern border, but that Israel&#x27;s &quot;shaky military performance&quot; cost it international credibility. He also said that Israel &quot;mishandled its opportunity&quot;, and that some of the sites it attacked were of &quot;questionable military value&quot;.

In September 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the U.S. vetoed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#x27;s plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities the previous May.

===Jordan===

On September 28, 2001, President Bush signed the Jordan–United States Free Trade Agreement and it was the first free trade agreement (FTA) the United States signed with an Arab country (and the fourth FTA overall behind Israel, Canada, and Mexico). However, King Abdullah advised Washington against the 2003 Iraq War, but later allegedly gave the invading coalition some degree of covert and tacit support, despite the overwhelming opinion of his own public. The Jordanian government publicly opposed the war against Iraq. The King stressed to the United States and European Union that a diplomatic solution, in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1409 (2002), was the only appropriate model for resolving the conflict between Iraq and the UN. In August 2002 he told the Washington Post that an attempt to invade Iraq would be a &quot;tremendous mistake&quot; and that it could &quot;throw the whole area into turmoil&quot;.

===Kuwait===
Kuwait was the only major regional ally that supported the U.S.-led 2003 Invasion of Iraq, because Kuwait had hostility towards Saddam&#x27;s Iraq stemmed from the events surrounding the first Persian Gulf War. The public appeared to consider Saddam to be as much of a threat in 2003 as he was in the past, and were particularly interested in attempts to repatriate many Kuwaiti citizens who had disappeared during the Gulf War, and were presumably languishing in Iraqi jails up until Saddam&#x27;s fall from power. Kuwait also allowed the U.S. to launch the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the U.S. military bases stationed in Kuwait. However, Kuwait did not deploy forces to the Iraq War. In 2004, President Bush designated Kuwait as a Major non-NATO ally

===Lebanon===
President Bush stated Lebanon &quot;can serve as a great example (to other countries) of what is possible&quot; in the Middle East&quot;.

In April 2006, following a meeting at the White House with Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, Mr. Bush said that the United States &quot;strongly supports a free and independent and sovereign Lebanon&quot;. He recalled the 2005 Cedar Revolution, in which hundreds of thousands of Lebanese protested against and forced the withdrawal of Syrian troops from their country.

Prime Minister Siniora stated &quot;We took great joy in seeing the Cedar Revolution. We understand that the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the street to express their desire to be free required courage, and we support the desire of the people to have a government responsive to their needs and a government that is free, truly free.&quot;

President Bush recalled Lebanon&#x27;s &quot;great tradition&quot; of serving &quot;as a model of entrepreneurship and prosperity&quot;. He also called for a full investigation into the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, which helped spur the Cedar Revolution.

Prime Minister Siniora said the United States &quot;has been of great support&quot; to Lebanon, which has gone through &quot;major changes&quot; in the past year-and-a-half&quot; and that &quot;Lebanon has really been committing itself that we want the change to happen to in a democratic and a peaceful manner, but at the same time, to really stay course on course; that we are there to meet the expectations of the people to have a united, liberal, free country, and, at the same time, prosperous economy... The United States has been of great support to Lebanon. I am really convinced that President Bush and the United States will stand beside Lebanon to have Lebanon stay as a free, democratic, united, and sovereign state.&quot;

&quot;Out of the tough times [Lebanon] has been through&quot;, said President Bush, &quot;will rise a state that shows that it&#x27;s possible for people of religious difference to live side-by-side in peace; to show that it&#x27;s possible for people to put aside past histories to live together in... peace and hope and opportunity.&quot;

===Libya===
After its public announcement on December 19, 2003, Libya announced its intention to rid itself of WMD and MTCR-class missile programs. the Gaddafi government cooperated with the U.S., the U.K., the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons toward these objectives. Libya also signed the IAEA Additional Protocol and has become a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

In recognition of these actions, the U.S. under the Bush administration began the process of normalizing relations with Libya. The U.S. terminated the applicability of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to Libya and President Bush signed an Executive Order on September 20, 2004, terminating the national emergency with respect to Libya and ending IEEPA-based economic sanctions. This action had the effect of unblocking assets blocked under the Executive Order sanctions. Restrictions on cargo aviation and third-party code-sharing have been lifted, as have restrictions on passenger aviation. Certain export controls remain in place.

U.S. diplomatic personnel reopened the U.S. Interest Section in Tripoli on February 8, 2004. In the same month, the U.S. State Department lifted the 23-year travel ban on Libya. The U.S. Interest Section was upgraded to a U.S. Liaison Office on June 28, 2004, and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006. The establishment in 2005 of an American School in Tripoli demonstrates the increased presence of Americans in Libya, and the continuing normalization of bilateral relations. Libya re-established its diplomatic presence in Washington with the opening of an Interest Section on July 8, 2004, which was subsequently upgraded to a Liaison Office in December 2004 and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006.

On May 15, 2006, the US State Department announced its intention to rescind Libya&#x27;s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in recognition of the fact that Libya had met the statutory requirements for such a move: it had not provided any support for acts of international terrorism in the preceding six-month period, and had provided assurances that it would not do so in the future. On June 30, 2006, the U.S. rescinded Libya&#x27;s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. In July 2007, Mr. Gene Cretz was nominated by President Bush as ambassador to Libya. The Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate held Cretz&#x27;s confirmation hearing on Wednesday, September 25, 2008. The Libyan government satisfied its responsibility and paid the remaining amount of money it owed (total of $1.5 billion) to the victims of several acts of terrorism on Friday, October 31, 2008. That same year, the United States and Libya also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation.

===Morocco===

In the 21st century, both countries have become close allies in the global &quot;war on terror&quot;. Morocco was among the first Arab and Islamic states to denounce the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and declare solidarity with the American people in fighting terrorism. After the September 11 attacks, Morocco has been instrumental in supporting the United States. For example, King Mohammed VI presided over a mass service in support of the victims of the September 11 attacks. Additionally, security cooperation between the two countries is well developed. King Mohammed VI collaborates with U.S. intelligence and security officials in providing intelligence and preventing terrorist attacks in the Straits of Gibraltar. In January 2004, during the Bush administration, Morocco was designated a major non-NATO ally as a reward for its collaboration. Morocco remains one of America&#x27;s oldest and closest allies, a status affirmed by Morocco&#x27;s zero-tolerance policy towards Al-Qaeda and their affiliated groups. Morocco also assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with questioning al-Qaeda members captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere

Morocco also plays a pivotal role in the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative to contain Salafist groups in the Saharan and in the Sahel regions of West Africa. Likewise, when Casablanca was the victim of terrorist bombings on May 16, 2003, the U.S. government offered Morocco the full resources of its military and intelligence community. Furthermore, the CIA has utilized Morocco as a source for recruiting Arabic-speaking spies.

The United States and Morocco signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on June 15, 2004, which went into effect on January 1, 2006. The Kingdom of Morocco submitted an official statement on the matter for a U.S. House of Representatives congressional hearing in June 2007. It read, in part, &quot;Morocco is pleased to see that the United States has over the last several years very substantially increased its engagement in the Maghreb. Morocco is a longtime partner of the United States and our experience with your great nation over the last two centuries has persuaded us that there is much that we can accomplish together. The FTA between Morocco and USA is a great opportunity for US companies to increase their market shares&quot;. The FTA also stipulates broad labor protections for both countries, with a dual focus on transparency, and maintaining said protections while promoting economic growth. The explicitly defined protections laid out in the Labor section of the agreement are essentially the general rights promoted by the International Labor Organization in their 1998 declaration; however, the Labor section also provides a framework by which the countries may cooperate to extend labor rights further. The developments listed as potentially pursuable include the establishment of &quot;social safety net programs&quot;, regulation of &quot;working conditions&quot;, and &quot;timely&quot; creation of &quot;labor market statistics&quot;. In 2008, U.S. direct investment in Morocco was about 7%, and U.S. aid to Morocco was about 4%. In 2017, US direct investment in Morocco had risen to 21.4%.

===Oman===
On November 15, 2004, the Bush administration notified the U.S. Congress of its intent to sign a trade agreement with the Middle Eastern Sultanate of Oman. On January 19, 2006, the two countries signed the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (OFTA), which was part of the Bush administration&#x27;s strategy to create a US - Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by 2013.

On June 29, 2006, the U.S. Senate passed OFTA by a vote of 60–34, the fewest &quot;aye&quot; votes in the Senate of any trade bill other than CAFTA. On July 20, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed OFTA by a vote of 221–205, with 7 abstentions. For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on September 19, 2006, and the bill&#x27;s implementing bill was passed 62–32, with 6 abstentions. In all, the Senate approved the bill 63–37, since all senators voted either &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; in one of the two votes.

President Bush signed the bill into law on September 26, 2006.
And on December 29, 2008, signed the proclamation to implement the agreement with effective date of January 1, 2009.

===Qatar===
President Bush visited Qatar in June 2003, where he met with Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. then Visited U.S. Central Command headquarters and addressed U.S. military personnel, becoming the first U.S. president to visit the country.

===Saudi Arabia===

President Bush had close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi royal family. Saudi Arabia engaged the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Patton Boggs as registered foreign agents in the wake of the public relations disaster when knowledge of the identities of suspected hijackers became known. They also hired the PR and lobbying firm Qorvis for $14 million a year. Qorvis engaged in a PR frenzy that publicized the &quot;9/11 Commission finding that there was &#x27;no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded [Al Qaeda]&#x27;—while omitting the report&#x27;s conclusion that &#x27;Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism.&#x27;&quot;

According to at least one journalist (John R. Bradley), the ruling Saudi family was caught between depending for military defense on the United States, while also depending for domestic support on the Wahhabi religious establishment, which as a matter of religious doctrine &quot;ultimately seeks the West&#x27;s destruction&quot;, including that of its ruler&#x27;s purported ally—the US. During the Iraq War, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, criticized the U.S.-led invasion as a &quot;colonial adventure&quot; aimed only at gaining control of Iraq&#x27;s natural resources. But at the same time, Bradley writes, the Saudi government secretly allowed the US military to &quot;essentially&quot; manage its air campaign and launch special operations against Iraq from inside Saudi borders, using &quot;at least three&quot; Saudi air bases.

The two nations cooperated and shared information about al-Qaeda (Alsheikh 2006) and leaders from both countries continue to meet to discuss their mutual interests and bilateral relations.

Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are strategic allies,

===Syria===
Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria. In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In May 2004, a new comprehensive set of economic sanctions were enacted under the Bush administration by Executive Order 13338. Overall, There were a total of seven of executive orders enacted by President Bush to implement sanctions on Syria, which include Executive Orders 13315, 13224, 13382, 13338, 13399, 13441, and 13460. These sanctions are imposed on certain Syrian citizens or entities due to their participation in terrorism, acts of public corruption, or their destabilizing activities in Iraq and Lebanon.

In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria&#x27;s Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush&#x27;s order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to &quot;undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon&quot; in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon&#x27;s parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi&#x27;am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon&#x27;s government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.

===Turkey===

===United Arab Emirates===

According to Richard A. Clarke, then US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism and a contributor in the 9/11 Commission Report, the UAE is the United States best counter-terrorism ally in the Gulf. According to previous US ambassador to UAE Richard G. Olson, Deputy Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan structured the UAE Armed forces to be closely aligned with the US military.

The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces is the only Arab country to commit military troops for humanitarian aid missions in the US-led War in Afghanistan when it deployed its forces of 170 soldiers serving in Tarin Kowt province in March 2008.

==Oceania==

===Australia===


President Bush and Australian Prime Minister John Howard maintained a strong friendship. Following the September 11 attacks, in which eleven Australian citizens were also killed, there was an enormous outpouring of sympathy from Australia for the United States. Prime Minister Howard became one of Bush&#x27;s strongest international supporters, and supported the United States in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 by invoking the ANZUS treaty and the invasion of Iraq in 2003, by deploying Australian forces in both wars.

In 2004 the Bush administration &quot;fast tracked&quot; a free trade agreement with Australia. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called the deal a &quot;reward&quot; for Australia&#x27;s contribution of troops to the Iraq invasion.

===New Zealand===

Relations with New Zealand under the Bush administration improved and became increasingly closer especially after Prime Minister Helen Clark visited the White House on March 22, 2007. Following the 9/11 attacks, Prime Minister Clark contributed New Zealand military forces to the War in Afghanistan.

==Sub-Saharan Africa==
&quot;Time&quot; stated that Africa is the &quot;triumph of American foreign policy&quot; and is the &quot;Bush Administration&#x27;s greatest achievement&quot;.

===Humanitarian aid===
President Bush worked to reduce the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Africa, stop the spread of malaria, and rebuild broken nations from their genocidal pasts. One of the most notable programs initiated by Bush is the PEPFAR (President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) Program, which was a commitment of $15 billion over five years (2003–2008) from the United States to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. As of September 2007, the program estimated that it had supported the provision of antiretroviral treatment to approximately 1,445,500 people, mostly in Africa. Alternate Delegate to the United Nations Kelly Craft advised the US Ambassador to the UN on US engagement in Africa. Craft also gave a speech to the UN General Assembly on the investment the U.S. and other nations were making to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa and malaria in Africa, and promote development there.

Bush also initiated programs that put more than 29 million of Africa&#x27;s poorest children into schools. Bush provided &quot;huge overt support&quot; in Liberia to stabilize the country, and increasingly effective aid and trade backing good governance have helped improve health and provide education, skills, and jobs on the continent. He also supported agricultural independence in Africa, reducing Chinese mercantilism on the continent that had been overwhelming the farmers. Beninese cotton farmers urged him to &quot;stand fast on his opposition to the pork-belly politics of the farm bill that is winding its disgraceful way through Congress&quot; on his last visit to Africa. Finally, he was steadfast in changing the Doha round of World Trade Organization talks so it will favor the poor in Africa.

===Sudan/Darfur conflict===

On October 13, 2006, President Bush signed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act imposing sanctions against people responsible for genocide and war crimes in Sudan. It enables the Bush administration to deny Sudan&#x27;s government access to oil revenues. Furthermore, to the signing of the law, Bush signed another executive order that confirms the existing sanctions but eases some on parts of southern Sudan. It also includes exceptions to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid to Darfur. On the other side the order toughens some sanctions, including a provision that bars any American from engaging in oil-related transactions in Sudan. The order comes as the Bush administration&#x27;s new special envoy for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, began a trip to Sudan, where he plans to meet with government officials and visit war-torn Darfur.

In response to the Government of Sudan&#x27;s continued complicity in unabated violence occurring in Darfur, Bush imposed new economic sanctions on Sudan in May 2007. These sanctions blocked assets of Sudanese citizens implicated in the Darfur violence, and also sanctioned additional companies owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan. Sanctions continue to underscore U.S. efforts to end the suffering of the millions of Sudanese affected by the crisis in Darfur. Sudan has often accused the U.S. of threatening its territorial integrity by supporting referendums in the South and in Darfur.

===Zimbabwe===
In March 2003, President Bush issued an executive order, where he imposed targeted sanctions on the Government of Zimbabwe, including financial and visa measures, sanctions against selected individuals including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and 76 other high-ranking government officials, a ban on transfers of defence items and services, and a suspension of non-humanitarian government-to-government assistance. &quot;Over the course of more than two years, the government of Zimbabwe has systematically undermined that nation&#x27;s democratic institutions, employing violence, intimidation, and repressive means including legislation to stifle opposition to its rule&quot;, Bush said in the order. Bush also said the situation in Zimbabwe &quot;endangers the southern African region&quot; and threatens to undermine democratic reforms throughout the continent. Despite strained political relations, the United States continued as a leading provider of humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe, providing about $400,000,000 in humanitarian assistance from 2002 to 2007, most of it being food aid. In January 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice of the Bush administration identified Zimbabwe as one of the states in outposts of tyranny due to the Zimbabwean Government of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s increased assault on human rights and the rule of law.

In July 2008, President Bush signed another executive order to widen the sanctions against individuals and organizations in Zimbabwe associated with what he calls the &quot;illegitimate&quot; regime of President Robert Mugabe after the controversial 2008 Zimbabwean general election.

<doc id="957736" wikidata="Q3793133" url="?curid=957736" title="Upper Class Twit of the Year">
<text>&quot;Upper Class Twit of the Year&quot; is a comedy sketch that was seen on the 1970 &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; episode &quot;The Naked Ant&quot; (series 1, episode 12), and also in a modified format as the finale of the movie &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;. It is notable for its satire on dimwitted members of the English upper class. Its title is a reference to the Horse of the Year Show, because equestrianism is often regarded as an upper-class pursuit in the UK.

==Scenario==
To a horserace-style commentary by John Cleese, we view an obstacle-course race among five stereotypical, upper-class twits, to determine the 127th Annual Upper-Class Twit of the Year.

The competitors are:
* Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith (portrayed by Eric Idle in &quot;MPFC&quot; and John Cleese in &quot;ANFSCD&quot;)
** Has an O-level in chemo-hygiene (&quot;MPFC&quot; only)
** Can count up to 4 (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
** Is in the Grenadier Guards (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
* Simon Zinc-Trumpet-Harris (portrayed by Terry Jones in &quot;MPFC&quot; and Eric Idle in &quot;ANFSCD&quot;)
** An Old Etonian (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
** Married to a very attractive table lamp
* Nigel Incubator-Jones (portrayed by John Cleese in &quot;MPFC&quot; and Terry Jones in &quot;ANFSCD&quot;)
** Best friend is a tree
** A stockbroker in his spare time
* Gervaise Brook-Hampster (portrayed by Michael Palin in both versions)
** Used as a wastepaper basket by his father
** Also in the Guards
** Is in the wine trade (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
* Oliver St John-Mollusc (portrayed by Graham Chapman in both versions)
** Another old Etonian (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
** His father was a Cabinet Minister, and his mother won the Derby. (&quot;ANFSCD&quot; only)
** Said to be this year&#x27;s outstanding twit.

At the start, the twits face the wrong way, so the starter turns them round. They then don&#x27;t run because they don&#x27;t know they have to move when the gun goes off. The starter explains the idea to the twits, who respond by laughing and pointing at him.

The obstacles are, in order:
* Walking Along The Straight Line
** The Twits must walk along one of several narrow straight lines a few feet apart, without falling over.
* The Matchbox Jump
** The Twits must jump over a fence that is three matchboxes high. In &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, this is changed to two matchboxes. (Vivian refuses the fence in the film.)
* Kicking The Beggar
** The Twits must approach a beggar with a tray and kick him until he falls over.
* The Hunt Ball Photograph (&quot;MPFC&quot; only)
** The Twits must have their photographs taken and make small talk with a pair of attractive females, Lady Arabella Plunkett and Lady Sarah Pencil Farthing Vivian Streamroller Adams Pie Biscuit Aftershave Gore Stringbottom Smith.
* Reversing Into The Old Lady
** The Twits must get into their sports cars and reverse them into a cardboard cut-out of an old lady, then speed off. On this obstacle, Oliver St John-Mollusc proves his outstanding twitness by managing to run himself over, rendering him dead, but not necessarily out of the competition. This leads straight into...
* Waking The Neighbour
** The Twits must drive their cars forward and then try to wake up a neighbour attempting to get some sleep by slamming their doors, tooting their horns, etc.
* Insulting The Waiter (&quot;MPFC&quot; only)
** The Twits must be thoroughly rude to a waiter with a tray.
* The Bar (&quot;MPFC&quot; only)
** The Twits must make their way underneath a wooden bar suspended five feet off the ground.
* Shooting The Rabbits
** Each Twit is given a shotgun; and he must shoot a rabbit that has been tied very firmly to several stakes so it can&#x27;t move around very much (as the Upper-Class Twit of the Year is only a one-day event). Several of the Twits are forced to bludgeon the rabbit to death with the butt of their gun or a fist. Their failure to hit the rabbits with their shotguns is attributed to the misty conditions (caused by the gunsmoke) and the shooting distance of nearly one foot.
* Taking The Bras Off The Debutantes
** The Twits must remove a bra from a mannequin representing a debutante while standing in front of it. It is claimed to be the most difficult obstacle by the commentator: many of the Twits even dismember the mannequins in their attempts to remove the bras, and a few still have bras (often with torsos still dangling from them) stuck to their hands as they go on to the final event:
* Shooting Themselves
** Finally, the Twits approach a table with five revolvers on it. The winner is the first Twit to shoot himself.

The sketch ends with Gervaise Brook-Hampster coming in first, followed by Smith-Smythe-Smith (shot by Nigel in &quot;ANFSCD&quot;, shot by Simon in &quot;MPFC&quot;) and Nigel Incubator-Jones in a medal ceremony, while Simon Zinc-Trumpet-Harris manages to club himself unconscious with the butt of his gun (in &quot;MPFC&quot;, the men also are interchanged). The three coffins of the winning Twits are placed on the medal rostrum and medals are draped around them. Cleese ends his commentary by remarking that &quot;there&#x27;ll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets of Kensington tonight!&quot; However, in &quot;ANFSCD&quot; the standings are different with Simon accidentally shooting Vivian into second place then shooting himself into third place and Nigel knocking himself unconscious.

==Production==
* In &quot;MPFC&quot; there is a very small crowd, which is mainly made up of cardboard cut-outs of donkeys, whereas in &quot;ANFSCD&quot; stock footage of large crowds in stadiums is used.
* The TV sketch was filmed at Hurlingham Park in Fulham. This fact is mentioned at the beginning of the sketch.
* The film sketch was made at Stirling Corner Sports Centre near Borehamwood.

==Inspiration==
John Cleese has stated that the idea for the &quot;wake the neighbour&quot; part was inspired by an apartment he once rented that was near a bar whose patrons kept him awake at night when they slammed the doors on their cars. This is also mentioned in trivia notes included on the A&amp;E DVD release of Season 1, though the wording there suggests the entire sketch may have been inspired by the people Cleese encountered, not just &quot;wake the neighbour&quot;.

<text>Siaogang District ( lit: Small port District) is a district of Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan. Before the merging of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in 2010, Siaogang was the southernmost district in Kaohsiung City. The second largest airport in Taiwan, Kaohsiung International Airport, is located in Siaogang.

==History==
Siaogang was developed during Dutch era. The Dutch built Ang Moh Harbor as an addition to Anping Harbor in Tainan. After the Dutch were defeated by Koxinga, they left Taiwan. Koxinga&#x27;s government developed Taiwan as the last stronghold to revive the Ming Dynasty and prepare his troops to fight against the Qing dynasty. He sent one of his men, Wu Yanshang, to expand Siaogang. After the demise of Koxinga, his son and his grandson, the Qing managed to defeat the Kingdom of Tungning and annexed Taiwan.

===Empire of Japan===
In 1895, the Qing dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki after losing the First Sino-Japanese War, and Siaogang was used to produce sugar for Japanese. In 1920, the original name of &quot;Kang-a-ki&quot; () was changed, and the incorporated areas were administered as under Hōzan District, Takao Prefecture. As a heavy industry base in Taiwan during World War II, Siaogang was more heavily bombed by the Allied force than other parts of the city.

===Republic of China===
After the war and the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China, Siaogang was administrated as Siaogang Township of Kaohsiung County, a third-level government of the Republic of China, under Taiwan Province. Siaogang was annexed by Kaohsiung City and become Siaogang District on 1 July 1979, when Kaohsiung City became a special municipality.

==Geography==
Siaogang is located in the southern part of Kaohsiung. It borders Cianjhen District to the north, Daliao District to the east, Linyuan District to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the west.

==Administrative divisions==
The district consists of Xiaogang, Gangkou, Gangzheng, Gangqi, Gangming, Ganghou, Gangnan, Gangxing, Fenggong, Dianzhen, Daling, Erling, Sanling, Zhengling, Shunling, Liuling, Hongliang, Shantung, Jingdao, Jinan, Taishan, Shanming, Gaosong, Songjin, Songshan, Daping, Pingding, Kongzhai, Xiazhuang, Gezuo, Guilin, Zhongcuo, Fengming, Longfeng, Fengsen, Fenglin, Fengxing and Fengyuan Village.

==Economy==
As far as the industry of Taiwan is concerned, Siaogang is one of the most important
regions for the shipbuilding and steel industries. During the 1970s, the government spent 5 years carrying out Ten Major Construction Projects. Two companies resulting from the projects are based here: China Steel and CSBC Corporation, Taiwan. CPC Corporation, Taiwan also a part of the ten projects, has a major oil refinery facility located here. With the proximity of Kaohsiung Harbor, the products of these companies are exported worldwide. These products are also transported throughout the island via National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan), which terminates on the northern border of the district.

<doc id="957758" wikidata="Q638973" url="?curid=957758" title="Leofric, Earl of Mercia">
<text>Leofric (died 31 August or 30 September 1057) was an Earl of Mercia. He founded monasteries at Coventry and Much Wenlock and was a very powerful earl under King Cnut and his successors. Leofric was the husband of Lady Godiva.

==Life==
Leofric was the son of Leofwine, Ealdorman of the Hwicce, who witnessed a charter in 997 for King Æthelred II. Leofric had three brothers: Northman, Edwin and Godwine. It is likely that Northman is the same as &quot;Northman Miles&quot; (&quot;Northman the knight&quot;) to whom King Æthelred II granted the village of Twywell in Northamptonshire in 1013. Northman, according to the Chronicle of Crowland Abbey, the reliability of which is often doubted by historians, says he was a retainer (knight) of Eadric Streona, the Earl of Mercia. It adds that Northman was killed on Cnut&#x27;s orders along with Eadric and others. Cnut then &quot;made Leofric ealdorman in place of his brother Northman, and afterwards held him in great affection&quot;.

Becoming Earl of Mercia, which occurred sometime before 1032, made him one of the most powerful men in King Cnut&#x27;s court, second only to the ambitious Earl Godwin of Wessex. Leofric may have had some connection by marriage to Ælfgifu of Northampton, the first wife of Cnut, which might help to explain why he was the chief supporter of her son Harold Harefoot against Harthacnut, Cnut&#x27;s son by Emma of Normandy, during the succession crisis after Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035. However, Harold died in 1040 and was then succeeded by his brother Harthacnut, who made himself unpopular by implementing heavy taxation during his short reign. Two of his tax-collectors were killed at Worcester by angry locals. The king was so enraged by this that in 1041 he ordered Leofric and his other earls to plunder and burn the city, and lay waste to the surrounding area. This command must have tested Leofric&#x27;s loyalty, since Worcester was the cathedral city of the Hwicce, his people.

When Harthacnut suddenly died in 1042, he was succeeded by his half-brother Edward the Confessor. Leofric loyally supported Edward when he came under threat at Gloucester, from Earl Godwin, in 1051. Leofric and Earl Siward of Northumbria gathered a great army to meet Godwin. Edward&#x27;s advisors counseled him that battle would be folly, as there&#x27;d be important members of the nobility on both sides; the loss of these men, should many die in battle, would leave England open to its enemies. In the end the issue was resolved by less violent means; in accordance with Leofric&#x27;s advice the settlement of the dispute was referred to the Witenagemot, and Earl Godwin and his family were outlawed for a time. Earl Leofric&#x27;s power was then at its height, but in 1055 Leofric&#x27;s own son Ælfgar was outlawed, &quot;without any fault&quot;, says the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Ælfgar raised an army in Ireland and Wales and brought it to Hereford, where he clashed with the army of Earl Ralph of Herefordshire and severely damaged the town. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; wryly comments &quot;And then when they had done most harm, it was decided to reinstate Earl Ælfgar&quot;.

Leofric died in 1057 at his estate at Kings Bromley in Staffordshire. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, he died on 30 September, but the chronicler of Worcester gives the date as 31 August. Both agree that he was buried in Coventry at St Mary&#x27;s Priory and Cathedral. Leofric was succeeded by his son Ælfgar as earl.

==Religious works==
Earl Leofric and Godiva were noted for great generosity to religious houses. In 1043 he founded and endowed a Benedictine monastery at Coventry. John of Worcester tells us that &quot;He and his wife, the noble Countess Godgifu, a worshipper of God and devout lover of St Mary ever-virgin, built the monastery there from the foundations out of their own patrimony, and endowed it adequately with lands and made it so rich in various ornaments that in no monastery in England might be found the abundance of gold, silver, gems and precious stones that was at that time in its possession.&quot;

In the 1050s Leofric and Godiva appear jointly as benefactors in a document granting land to the monastery of St Mary, Worcester, and the endowment of the minster at Stow St Mary, Lincolnshire. They are commemorated as benefactors of other monasteries as well, at Leominster, Chester, Much Wenlock, and Evesham.

==Family==
Apart from Northman, killed in 1017, Leofric had at least two other brothers: Edwin was killed in battle by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1039, and Godwine died some time before 1057.

Leofric may have married more than once. His famous wife Godgifu (Godiva) survived him and may have been a second or later wife. Since there is some question about the date of marriage for Leofric and Godgifu, it is not clear whether she was the mother of Ælfgar, Leofric&#x27;s only known child. If Godiva was married to Earl Leofric later than about 1010, she could not have been the mother.

==Historicity==
Leofric used a double-headed eagle as his personal emblem, and this has been adopted by various units of the British Army as a symbol for Mercia.

Historians disagree extensively on the character of Leofric. Folklore tends to depict him as an unfeeling overlord who imposed over-taxation, whereas many historians object to this, and consider it as part of the Lady Godiva myth; they suggest that he was a strong and respected leader. There is also great disagreement over his reputation as a military leader: some historians believe Leofric to have been weak in this respect, but others go as far as to give him the title &#x27;Hammer of the Welsh&#x27;.

== &quot;Visio Leofrici&quot; ==
A prose account of Leofric&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;Visio Leofrici&quot; or the &quot;Vision of Leofric&quot;, was written in Old English, surviving in MS Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (CCCC) 367. It is split into four episodes, each of which depicts one of Leofric&#x27;s miraculous visions. The last of these four has been noted for its similarities to the account of Leofric&#x27;s vision in Osbert&#x27;s later account of the life of Edward the Confessor.

==In popular culture==
On screen, Leofric was portrayed by Roy Travers in the British silent short &quot;Lady Godiva&quot; (1928), George Nader in the film &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot; (1955), and Tony Steedman in the BBC TV series &quot;&quot; (1965). He also may have inspired the character &quot;Leofric&quot;, played by Adrian Bower in the BBC series &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;.

Directed and written by Kenji Eno, it was published by Warp in Japan in 1999 and by Sega in North America in 2000. &quot;D2&quot; stars the &quot;digital actress&quot; Laura but has an independent story unrelated to the original &quot;D&quot;, and uses action-oriented gameplay in contrast to the puzzle-driven &quot;D&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The game has a few different kinds of gameplay. The majority of &quot;D2&quot; involves exploring the Canadian wilderness from a third-person perspective while interior locations are encountered in a first-person perspective. While exploring the wilderness, the player encounters random battles, much like those of a role-playing video game. When fighting monsters, the player cannot move Laura, but only aim her weapons. Defeating these creatures earns Laura experience points, which are used to level Laura up, increasing her health limit. Laura is initially equipped with a submachine gun with unlimited ammunition and a hunting rifle, which is used to hunt animals for meat which she can use to regain health.

In terms of the hunting feature, animals Laura kills for meat are totaled up during gameplay and on the Options screen, and players can see how many kills she has collected as well as any medals given. Additionally, Laura has a camera that she can use to take pictures any time in the game (except during cinematics). Players can also save the pictures to a VMU and view them later on.

==Plot==
The game opens with Laura Parton falling asleep on an airplane trip to an undisclosed location. After being jolted awake by a tone over the airplane&#x27;s PA system and a friendly conversation with a fellow passenger named David, a group of terrorists, who seem to be guided by some kind of mysterious cultist chanting to himself, suddenly and violently takes control of the plane. David, who turns out to be a special agent within the FBI, attempts to stop the terrorists, but he is thwarted when a meteorite strikes the plane, sending it crashing into the Canadian wilderness.
After a series of bad dreams, Laura awakens in a small cabin being cared for by Kimberly Fox, a poet, and songwriter who also survived the crash. She explains that ten days have passed since the accident, although Kimberly had only found her some distance from the crash site two days prior, leaving a strange eight-day gap where she was mysteriously taken care of. The moment of peace is broken when another survivor, one of the hijackers, staggers into the cabin before suddenly transforming into a hideous plant-like monster. Here, Laura and Kimberly meet Parker Jackson, a CETI researcher and fellow crash survivor who drives out the monster, only to be driven out himself by a distrusting Kimberly.

Laura then sets out into the wilderness in order to investigate the possibility of contacting the outside world and seeking out other survivors only to discover that more strange, hideous creatures are lurking in the area, as something is causing the crash survivors to mutate into the very same monsters she must avoid and battle while traveling through the region. She is driven deeper into the mystery when she must venture into an abandoned mining facility in order to locate Jannie, a lost little girl Kimberly had found along with Laura and one of the plane&#x27;s former passengers.

==Development==
Development for &quot;D2&quot; started as a premier game for the cancelled Panasonic M2 console, the successor to the 3DO console. The 3DO Company, with which Warp had a good working relationship, had suggested Warp create a sequel to &quot;D&quot; for their new console.

In this early version, a pregnant Laura is on a passenger flight to Romania which is attacked by a supernatural force. The plane crashes and her unborn child is spirited away by the Devil to medieval Transylvania, to be the child of a widowed duke who sold his soul for a son. The player would have taken the role of Laura&#x27;s son as he enters adulthood, and must escape a large castle and fight the Devil to save his father. Unlike the original &quot;D&quot;, but like the &quot;D2&quot; that was released for Dreamcast, the game was to feature full-motion video cutscenes but gameplay entirely played out with real-time graphics, and consisting of both puzzle solving and combat.

&quot;D2&quot; was the first M2 game for which screenshots from a playable version were released to the public. Warp employed their usual unorthodox promotional tactics during development. For the first two days of the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show, Warp did not show any games, instead holding a celebration of the arrival of the cherry blossom season at their booth, before finally showing a demo of &quot;D2&quot; on the third (and final) day of the show. For Christmas that same year, Warp sent out &quot;D2&quot; brand packets of curry emblazoned with the images of Kenji Eno and Laura to select journalists.

Though at the time it was believed that &quot;D2&quot; was nearly complete when Panasonic officially announced that the M2 was not going to be released, Eno later revealed the game was &quot;about 50 percent finished&quot;. Following the abandonment of the M2, Warp began work on porting the game to the Sega Saturn. However, eventually Kenji Eno decided to abandon the original concept and create an entirely new game for the Dreamcast.

In Japan, a demonstration version of &quot;D2&quot; was packaged with another Warp-produced game, the Dreamcast remake of the Sega Saturn title &quot;Real Sound: Kaze no Regret&quot;. This early preview of the game, known as &quot;D2 Shock Demo&quot;, features modified opening credits and a &quot;heads up display&quot; compared to the completed game. Additionally, it contains a save file that copies to the Dreamcast VMU and unlocks a &quot;secret movie&quot; in the retail Japanese version of &quot;D2&quot;. This movie is a preview of the shelved M2 version of &quot;D2&quot;. It was removed from the North American version but can briefly be seen as an in-flight movie during the hijacking sequence.

A playable animation demo of the M2 version of D2 was found and coded to run on M2 kiosk hardware in December 2019. It features the main character of the M2 version, Taren, executing the backflip sword slash seen in the alpha version of D2 previews from 1997.

==Release==
The game was released in Japan as one standard edition and three limited edition variants. The standard edition features Laura on the cover, while the limited edition covers are white, silver or black, respectively, for the Hope, Bliss, and Eclipse variants. The limited editions also included a calendar of the year 2000. It was jewel-case sized and printed on a single page of translucent plastic, colored either red, blue, or green.

==Reception==
&quot;D2&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;D2&quot; aroused conflicting reactions in reviewers. They lauded the graphics, music, and deep storytelling. However, they criticized the actual gameplay for being repetitive, dull and buried with cutscenes. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;If you&#x27;ve got a lot of patience, it&#x27;s well worth your time, but &quot;D2&quot; desperately needs a better sense of pace.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 32 out of 40.

<text>Sinhua District (), alternatively spelled Xinhua, is a suburban district in central Tainan, Taiwan.

==History==
Before the Dutch and Han Chinese invaded, this region was home to a community of Taiwanese aborigines, the Siraya. In 1624, the VOC occupied Tayuan (modern day Anping, Tainan). 

In the past, the Siraya indigenous tribe called this place Tavocan (&quot;land of hill and forest&quot;). &quot;Tavakan&quot; was a village of about a thousand people; the name was also written &quot;Taffacan&quot;, &quot;Tavocan&quot;, &quot;Tavacang&quot;, and &quot;Davocan&quot; in Dutch records. The village grew into the market-town of &quot;Twa-bak-kang&quot; (), about southeast of &quot;Sin-kang&quot; (modern-day Sinshih). 

After 1627, the VOC sent missionaries into neighboring districts. In 1635, George Candidius, a Dutch pastor, advised Pieter Nuyts, the leader of the Dutch VOC in Taiwan, that the VOC would have to conquer the aborigines before they could be controlled. In 1636, eighteen tribal groups, including the inhabitants of Tavocan, submitted to Dutch rule.
Since the early part of the 20th century, Sinhua has been an important fruit wholesaling center. Around 1920, dozens of baroque-influenced store buildings were constructed along what is now Jhongjheng Road. Most of these buildings survive in good condition, and the street, known as &quot;Sinhua Old Street,&quot; has become a tourist attraction.

In 1945, Sinshih Township was part of Sinhua District.

The Taiwan Communist Party was established on 20 June 2008 in Sinhua.

==Geography==
*Area: 62.06 km2
*Population: 43,830 people (January 2016)

Much of the district is rural, with large areas devoted to pineapple cultivation. Sinhua is located on Taiwan Highway No. 20, also known as the Southern Cross-Island Highway, and Freeway Nos. 3 and 8. It borders Yongkang, Shanshang, Sinshih and Guanmiao districts.

The eastern half of the district lies within the Siraya National Scenic Area.

==Administrative divisions==

<doc id="957768" wikidata="Q369967" url="?curid=957768" title="Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge">
<text>The Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge (&quot;Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror Bridge&quot;; , abbreviated as &quot;F.S.M. Köprüsü&quot;), also known as the Second Bosphorus Bridge (), is a bridge in Istanbul, Turkey spanning the Bosphorus strait (Turkish: &quot;Boğaziçi&quot;). When completed in 1988, it was the 5th-longest suspension bridge span in the world.

The bridge is named after the 15th-century Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, who conquered the Byzantine capital, Constantinople (Istanbul), in 1453. It carries the European route E80, Asian Highway 1, Asian Highway 5 and Otoyol 2 highways.

Three other bridges that connect Europe and Asia are located in Turkey, which are named Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, 15 July Martyrs Bridge (formerly known as Bosphorus Bridge) and the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge.

==Location==
The bridge is situated between Istanbul Hisarüstü (European side) and Kavacık (Asian side). It is a gravity-anchored suspension bridge with steel pylons and vertical hangers. The aerodynamic deck hangs on double vertical steel cables. It is 1,510 m long with a deck width of 39 m. The distance between the towers (main span) is 1,090 m and their height over the road level is 105 m. The clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64 m.

==Construction==
The bridge was designed by Freeman Fox &amp; Partners and BOTEK Bosphorus Technical Consulting Corp., who had previously designed the Bosphorus Bridge. An international consortium of three Japanese companies (including IHI Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries), one Italian (Impregilo) and one Turkish company (STFA) carried out the construction works. The bridge was completed on May 29, 1988, and later opened on June 3, 1988 by Prime Minister Turgut Özal, who drove his official car, becoming the first to cross. The cost of the bridge is estimated to be around US$130 million to 380 million.

==Transportation==
The bridge is on the Trans-European Motorway between Edirne and Ankara. The highway bridge has four lanes for vehicular traffic plus one emergency lane in each direction. On weekday mornings, commuter traffic flows mostly westbound to the European part, so five of the eight lanes run westbound and only three eastbound. Conversely, on weekday evenings, five lanes are dedicated to eastbound traffic and three lanes, to westbound traffic. Pedestrians are not allowed to use the bridge. Currently, around 150,000 vehicles pass daily in both directions; almost 70% are automobiles.

==Toll collection==
Fatih Sultan Mehmet is a toll bridge, but payment is required only from vehicles traveling to Asia (as in the First Bosphorus Bridge, no payment is required while passing from Asia to Europe.) Since April 2008, cash payments are no longer accepted, having been replaced by a remote payment system. As of the OGS systems retirement on March 31, 2022, HGS is the only way to access the bridge.

A HGS sticker can be obtained at various stations before the toll plaza of highways and bridges.

As of 2024 the toll fee is 15 to 110 Turkish lira, depending on the type of vehicle.

<doc id="957781" wikidata="Q5157388" url="?curid=957781" title="Computer-assisted reporting">
<text>Computer-assisted reporting describes the use of computers to gather and analyze the data necessary to write news stories.

The spread of computers, software and the Internet changed how reporters work. Reporters routinely collect information in databases, analyze public records with spreadsheets and statistical programs, study political and demographic change with geographic information system mapping, conduct interviews by e-mail, and research background for articles on the Web.

Collectively this has become known as computer-assisted reporting, or CAR. It is closely tied to &quot;precision&quot; or analytic journalism, which refer specifically to the use of techniques of the social sciences and other disciplines by journalists.

== History and development ==

One researcher argues the &quot;age of computer-assisted reporting&quot; began in 1952, when CBS television used a UNIVAC I computer to analyze returns from the U.S. presidential election. One of the earliest examples came in 1967, after riots in Detroit, when Philip Meyer of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; used a mainframe computer to show that people who had attended college were equally likely to have rioted as were high school dropouts.

Since the 1950s, computer-assisted developed to the point that databases became central to the journalist&#x27;s work by the 1980s. In his book, Precision Journalism, the first edition of which was written in 1969, Philip Meyer argues that a journalist must make use of databases and surveys, both computer-assisted. In the 2002 edition, he goes even further and states that &quot;a journalist has to be a database manager&quot;. 

In 2001, computers had reached a critical mass in American newsrooms in terms of general computer use, online research, non-specialist content searching, and daily frequency of online use, showing that CAR has become ubiquitous in the United States.

==Tools and techniques==

The techniques expanded from polling and surveying to a new opportunity for journalists: using the computer to analyze huge volumes of government records. The first example of this type may have been Clarence Jones of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, who in 1969 worked with a computer to find patterns in the criminal justice system. Other notable early practitioners included David Burnham of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who in 1972 used a computer to expose discrepancies in crime rates reported by the police; Elliot Jaspin of &quot;The Providence Journal&quot;, who in 1986 matched databases to expose school bus drivers with bad driving histories and criminal records; and Bill Dedman of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, who received the Pulitzer Prize for his 1988 investigation, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, which dealt with mortgage lending discrimination and redlining in middle-income black neighborhoods.

== Professional organizations ==

In the last 15 years, journalism organizations such as the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR, a program of Investigative Reporters and Editors) and the Danish International Center for Analytical Reporting (DICAR), have been created solely to promote the use of CAR in newsgathering. Many other organizations, such as the Society of Professional Journalists, the Canadian Association of Journalists and the University of King&#x27;s College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, offer CAR training or workshops. Journalists have also created mailing lists to share ideas about CAR, including NICAR-L, CARR-L and JAGIS-L.

<text>Drongen (; , ) is a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent located in the province of East Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1977. In 1967, part of the original municipality was already annexed to Ghent. On 1 January 1977, the municipality of Drongen was merged into Ghent.

Drongen is divided into three parishes: Drongen, Luchteren and Baarle.

== Monastery ==
Drongen is known for its early medieval monastery, Drongen Abbey, founded in the 7th century by the monk Amandus, the Missionary of the Leie and Schelde. Destroyed by the Normans in 853, the monastery was rebuilt by the counts of Flanders. The monastery was the victim of the religious wars following the Reformation, and in 1578 it was once again destroyed by Calvinists.

In 1638, the abbey church was rebuilt and between 1638 and 1698 the monastery was restored. After a fire in 1727, the church tower was restored once again in 1734, with a distinctive appearance. In 1797, the French occupied and sold the abbey. In 1804, Lieven Bauwens used the monastery as a textile plant. The current monastery and abbey church date from 1859 and remain in use as a spiritual centre run by the Society of Jesus dedicated to the teachings of Ignatius of Loyola.

== Notable people ==
Drongen is the birthplace of professional footballer Kevin De Bruyne.

<text>Cats &amp; Dogs is a 2001 spy-comedy film directed by Lawrence Guterman and written by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins and Alexander Pollock, with the voices of Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon, Charlton Heston, Jon Lovitz, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Clarke Duncan.

The story centers on the relationships between cats and dogs, depicting the relationship as an intense rivalry in which both sides use organizations and tactics that mirror those used in human espionage. It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on July 4, 2001. The film received mixed reviews and earned $200.7 million on a $60 million budget.

== Plot ==

The Brody family&#x27;s pet Bloodhound Buddy chases a cat and is captured by other cats in an ambush. Cats and dogs are revealed to be highly intelligent, tech-savvy enemies capable of speech, waging war with covert operatives while concealing their true nature from humans. After an Anatolian Shepherd dog named Butch reports Buddy&#x27;s capture to his superiors, the best canine agents are dispatched to complete Buddy&#x27;s mission: to prevent the cats from making all humans allergic to dogs.

At a local barn one month later, a litter of Beagle puppies mocks their youngest brother for trying to escape captivity. A Doberman Pinscher agent replaces the litter with a pack of Miniature Pinscher agents, failing to notice the youngest Beagle. Carolyn, the Brodys’ matriarch, arrives to adopt a new dog and selects the Beagle, naming him Lou after her son Scotty sarcastically suggests the name &quot;Loser&quot;.

After detonating an explosive trap laid by cats for Lou, Butch – mistaking him for a trained operative – brings him to the dogs&#x27; underground network, and introduces agents Peek, a Chinese Crested Dog, and Sam, an Old English Sheepdog. Butch quickly realizes Lou is not the agent he was expecting, but his superiors order him to train Lou himself due to lack of time to find a replacement. Lou is briefed on the origins of the conflict between cats and dogs, dating back to Ancient Egypt when cats ruled the world. Butch reveals that Buddy has escaped the cats and the spy trade, retiring to a condo in Boca Raton.

Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles, a white Persian cat, plans to exploit the Brodys&#x27; patriarch Charles&#x27; research on dog allergies to conquer the world. His scheming is interrupted by Sophie, his comatose owner&#x27;s maid, who enjoys dressing Tinkles in embarrassing costumes. Tinkles orders his sidekick Calico, an Exotic Shorthair, to send Devon Rex ninjas to steal the research. Lou foils the theft and meets a former agent and Butch&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Ivy, a Saluki who encourages him to bond with Scotty.

Mr. Tinkles contracts a Russian Blue mercenary named Dimitri Kennelkoff, who tricks Lou and places a bomb on Brody&#x27;s lab door. Kennelkoff battles Lou and Butch, damaging the Brodys&#x27; house until Butch disables the bomb and captures Kennelkoff. During the interrogation, the dogs recover a note by Mr. Tinkles from Kennelkoff&#x27;s stomach.

After a breakthrough involving Lou playing with Scotty, Charles&#x27; machine finally finds the formula to a cure for human allergies to dogs. Having bugged the house, Mr. Tinkles and Calico spring a trap for the Brodys. First, Mr. Tinkles travels to a Christmas tree flocking plant under the guise of the plant&#x27;s comatose owner, Mr. Mason, and sends the employees home, then lures the Brodys with fake tickets to a soccer exhibition game, capturing the family.

The dogs receive a video from Mr. Tinkles demanding Charles&#x27; research as a ransom for the Brodys, and dogs around the world assemble at a meeting, led by a Mastiff. When the assembly decides not to surrender the formula, Lou confronts Butch. Revealing that he was abandoned by his owner, the unsympathetic Butch leaves Lou behind. Desperate, Lou brings Mr. Tinkles the research and is double-crossed. Butch, realizing what has happened, stages a raid of Mr. Tinkles&#x27; factory where mice are being prepared to spread the mass-produced allergy.

While Butch, Ivy, Peek, and Sam fight Tinkles&#x27; cat forces, Lou frees the Brodys and Calico, who was betrayed by Tinkles, revealing to the family that he can speak. Lou defeats Tinkles but is struck by an excavator as an explosion destroys the whole factory. Butch rescues the seemingly dead Lou, tearfully admitting that Lou was right to love his adoptive family, and Lou awakens. He decides to return to a normal pet&#x27;s life with the Brodys until he can serve as a full-grown agent.

Meanwhile, Tinkles is sent to live with Sophie and her three sisters, where he is dressed in even more humiliating outfits as punishment for his actions against the dogs.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A great concept, but the movie fails to develop the characters and some of the jokes are hit-or-miss.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Jane Horwitz called it &quot;[a] surprisingly witty and sophisticated spy movie spoof that will tickle adult pet lovers and still capture kids 6 and older with its boy-and-his-dog love story and pet slapstick&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, praising the special effects and the CGI. In contrast, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Irritating, childish and more frantic than funny, &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; does manage some few pleasant moments, but they are not worth waiting for&quot;.

&quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Feature Film (Comedy) and Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actor (Alexander Pollock). John Debney won the ASCAP Award for his musical contribution to this film as well as &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids&quot;.

<doc id="957794" wikidata="Q485755" url="?curid=957794" title="Ananda Krishnan">
<text>Tatparanandam Ananda Krishnan (1 April 1938 – 28 November 2024), also known by the initialism A. K., was a Malaysian entrepreneur who was a founder and chairperson of Usaha Tegas and founder of Yu Cai Foundation (YCF).

At the time of his death, he was estimated to have a net worth of US$5.1 billion according to Forbes making him the 671th wealthiest person in the world and 3rd richest in Malaysia. Ananda Krishnan shunned public exposure and was known to maintain a low profile for a person of his stature.

== Early life and education ==
Ananda Krishnan was born on 1 April 1938 in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur and has his roots in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. He studied at Vivekananda Tamil School in Brickfields and furthered his studies at Victoria Institution, Kuala Lumpur. Later, as a Colombo Plan scholar, he attended the University of Melbourne, Australia for his B.A. (Honours) degree majoring in political science. During that time, he boarded in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Following that, Krishnan obtained a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School, graduating in 1964.

Krishnan was a follower of Buddhism and had three children, two daughters and a son. His only son, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo is a Theravada Buddhist monk.

Contrary to many misconceptions, Ananda Krishnan was not awarded any federal or honorific titles.

== Career ==

Krishnan&#x27;s first entrepreneurial venture was a Malaysian consultancy MAI Holdings Sdn Bhd. He set up Exoil Trading, which went on to purchase oil drilling concessions in various countries. Later, he moved into gambling (in Malaysia). In the early part of the 1990s, he started diversifying into the multimedia arena.

He had business interests in media (Astro), satellite (MEASAT), oil and gas (Bumi Armada, Pexco), telecommunications (Maxis, Sri Lanka Telecom). He owned stakes in Tanjong Public Limited Company, an investment holding company with subsidiaries involved in leisure (TGV Cinemas) and property (67% Maxis Tower etc.).

Krishnan first came to prominence by helping to organise the Live Aid concert with Bob Geldof in the mid-1980s. In the early 1990s, he began building a multimedia empire that now includes two telecommunication companies—Maxis Communications, MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems and SES World Skies—and has three communication satellites circumnavigating the Earth.

He effected the purchase of 46% of Maxis Communications, the country&#x27;s largest cellular phone company, from América Móvil, AT&amp;T Corporation, British Telecom, Belgacom, Ooredoo, Orange S.A. and Royal KPN N.V. for $1,180 million—raising his stake to 70%. Maxis has more than ten million subscribers, with around 40% market share in Malaysia. He also owned a stake in Sri Lanka Telecom.

In an agreement between Astro and India&#x27;s Sun Network, Krishnan planned to produce TV channels which cater to the Indian market, especially Tamil people in countries such as US, Western Europe and the Middle East. He also planned to offer TV services featuring Web-based interactivity. Ananda Krishnan owned stakes in TVB.com and the Shaw Brothers movie archives.

== Death ==
Krishnan died of natural causes in Swiss Alps on 28 November 2024, at the age of 86.

== Philanthropy ==
Ananda Krishnan donated to education, the arts, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia through his company Usaha Tegas, and its subsidiaries.

In 2003, Krishnan&#x27;s Usaha Tegas launched the Harapan Nusantara education fund. Since 2004 the fund has sponsored 100 students a year to attend special programs at local private universities that collaborate with foreign universities. In the same year the company also started the Yu Cai Education Foundation with a grant of $6.6 million to help ethnic Chinese groups.

In 2006, Ananda Krishnan&#x27;s media company Astro introduced its scholarship program, promising to devote an annual RM2 million to support promising Malaysian undergraduate and graduate students studying media and broadcasting.

In 2008, he contributed to the opening of the Montfort Girls Centre to help orphaned and underprivileged girls develop their vocational skills.

In 2010, Krishnan was featured on the Forbes list of 48 Heroes of Philanthropy.

In January 2015, Ananda Krishnan and the Usaha Tegas Group launched the Yu Cai Foundation (YCF). YCF provides student scholarships for Mandarin-based schools and grants to educational institutions which promote the study of vernacular languages, especially Mandarin and English.

<doc id="957797" wikidata="Q5883013" url="?curid=957797" title="Hollywood Victory Committee">
<text>The Hollywood Victory Committee was an organization founded on December 10, 1941, during World War II to provide a means for stage, screen, television and radio performers that were not in military service to contribute to the war effort through bond drives and improving morale for troops. It was associated with the Screen Actors Guild. The Committee organized events between January 1942 until August 1945. Chairmen of the committee included Clark Gable, James Cagney, Sam Levene and George Murphy. Hattie McDaniel was the Chairman of the Negro Division of the Hollywood Victory Committee, providing entertainment for soldiers in hospitals, and those stationed at military bases.

One of the committee&#x27;s most notable successes was the Hollywood Victory Caravan which crossed the country in April / May 1942.

Within its four years, arranged for stars to travel five million miles to entertain soldiers. The committee&#x27;s final report took credit for providing 56,037 free appearances by 4,147 persons in 7,700 events, including 13,555 playing days by 176 persons on 122 overseas tours.

The Hollywood Victory Committee organized Hollywood stars to headline many of the variety, dramatic, and musical shows provided by the USO Camp Tours. The shows were originally organized under great secrecy and sent initially to the British Isles to entertain American troops stationed there. Entertainers would eventually travel to most battle fields to provide entertainment to active duty soldiers. 

Radio broadcasts were a very important part of this entertainment since radio could reach millions of people quickly and many stars were recruited to help get out important messages on buying bonds, saving salvage scrap, or raising funds for charity. Using the top names in entertainment to make the announcements elevated participation and public reception of the projects. There were many requests for programs, sometimes as many as five in one week, and all were met. Hollywood stars were even furnished to Canada to promote the sale of Canadian Victory Bonds.

One very popular program organized by the Hollywood Victory Committee was the broadcast of &quot;Command Performance&quot;. This program was not heard by American civilians but broadcast by short-wave radio to America&#x27;s fighting forces on all battle fronts. The American soldiers sent in requests for what wanted on these broadcasts and the Hollywood Victory Committee worked to furnish the Hollywood stars. Major General A.D. Surles, Director of the War Department Bureau of Public Relations, said that the troops &quot;sit with ears glued to the radio every Sunday.&quot; Surles also wrote, &quot;it may be seen that your efforts on our behalf and the many services rendered to us by you and the stars of the screen, stage and radio are not only doing a tremendous job in the entertainment of our men in service abroad, but are doing an equally important job in building goodwill for our country with international audience.&quot;

==Beginning of the Hollywood Victory Committee==

Clark Gable was the first chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee. He had starred in the movie &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in 1939 and had recently completed other films such as &quot;Boom Town&quot; with Spencer Tracy in 1940. A major star when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941. Gable was perfect to lead the patriotic movement in Hollywood.

One of Gable&#x27;s first decisions as chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee was to enlist the aid of his wife, Carole Lombard, also a successful actress, to sell war bonds. She initially traveled around Indiana, selling over $2 million in war bonds. In Indianapolis, Lombard lead the crowd in the World War II cheer &quot;V for Victory&quot;. Tragically, this patriotic act may have contributed to her untimely death. In a hurry to return home to her husband in California, Lombard purchased seats on TWA Flight #3 from Indianapolis to Burbank. The flight made a stop for a scheduled layover in Las Vegas, and Lombard and her group were in danger of being bumped. She talked her way onto the final leg of the flight by reminding military officials that she had sold over $2 million in war bonds. In flight for only a few minutes and a short 32 miles from the airport, the DC-3 crashed into Potosi Mountain. All aboard the flight were killed.

Army officials offered to honor Lombard with a complete military funeral but Gable chose to respect her wishes and opted for a simple, private funeral. After his wife&#x27;s burial in California, Clark Gable joined the Army Air Corps and flew B-17 missions from England. Lombard was recognized by the Hollywood Victory Committee as the first star to give her life in the war effort.

Prior to World War II America adopted an isolationist policy and sought to avoid involvement in the growing conflicts in Europe. During World War I, war had become more violent and all-encompassing for those nations involved. Casualties from the new styles of war skyrocketed. Americans were disillusioned with war and they needed to be quickly convinced to join the conflict. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and America&#x27;s entrance into the war, something had to be done to convert America&#x27;s isolationist citizens.

On December 18, 1941, President Roosevelt addressed Hollywood and asked them to help change Americans into supporters of the war effort. Hollywood stars were called upon to promote the sale of war bonds, raise compliance with rationing programs, explain the Land-Lease Program and encourage everyone to pay their taxes and support the war.

Gable, the first chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee, encouraged his fellow actors to not only support the war effort with their talents but to actively join the military. Gable, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Stewart led by example and enlisted. Stewart joined the Army Air Force Corps as a private and was eventually promoted to lieutenant colonel. Stewart would become a brigadier general . Hollywood stars also raised money and support for the war by participating, entertaining and selling war bonds. Actor Audie Murphy would become the most decorated war veteran of the war. Hollywood was clearly leading the way in supporting World War II through the leadership of the Hollywood Victory Committee.

The Hollywood Victory Committee encouraged movie theaters to also participate in the war mobilization. Theaters often became collection centers for items that needed to be recycled. Stars often lead such drives as the recycling of metals and actress Rita Hayworth even donated her car&#x27;s bumpers to the scrap metal drive. Many theaters also sold war bonds from the box office. They were centers for blood donation as well and many Hollywood actors and actresses lead the way and publicly made blood donations at the theaters. Some theaters granted free admission with a blood donation. The Hollywood Victory Committed lead the way in converting Americans to become war supporters.

==James Cagney==
James Cagney, one of the great actors of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, was one of the early chairmen of the Hollywood Victory Committee. Famous for his defiant comedy and vivacious presence on screen he could play a gangster as well as dance in a musical. His favorite film, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. 1942 was a patriotic wartime musical that was filled with passion and support for the military. He was a close friend of Ronald Reagan, he was a family man who passionately supported his country. In 1938, as the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, Cagney was accused of communist sympathies and was brought before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. He was exonerated. Through all of this he never lost his passion for his country or his enormous appeal to his fans. During his involvement as Chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee, James Cagney participated in long domestic and overseas tours to entertain the troops and worked tirelessly to sell war bonds.

==George Murphy==
George Murphy was another Chairman of the Victory Committee, and like good friends James Cagney and Ronald Reagan, he would also serve as President of the Screen Actors Guild. Like Reagan, he became active in politics after Chairing the Hollywood Victory Committee and organizing entertainment for the Armed Forces during the Second World War. Hd would serve as a senator from California for the Republican Party.

==Hattie McDaniel==

Hattie McDaniel, famous for her role as Mammy in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, was the first African-American to win an Academy Award. Her Oscar for her role in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was criticized by some since she won it playing the role of a slave. Though she generally avoided politics, she became Chairwoman of the Hollywood Victory Committee&#x27;s Negro Division.

==Hollywood Victory Caravan==
One of the most successful projects of the Hollywood Victory Committee was the organization of the Hollywood Victory Caravan in 1942. During a three-week cross country rail tour, performers such as Laurel and Hardy, Bing Crosby, Groucho Marx, Cary Grant, Desi Arnaz and Bob Hope participated in performances and rallies that promoted the Sale of War Bonds. This would become the USA&#x27;s largest war bond tour of the Second World War. Film stars Bob Hope and Bing Crosby would keep the memory alive in their 1945 movie about a young woman&#x27;s attempt to travel to Washington DC to visit her brother who was a soldier. They played themselves in this musical comedy that was produced by Paramount Studios for the U.S. Treasury in 1945. It preserves one of the most successful projects of the Hollywood Victory Committee.

<doc id="957806" wikidata="Q17042337" url="?curid=957806" title="Hitscan">
<text>Hitscan in video game design, most commonly in first-person shooters, is a type of hit registration system that determines whether an object has been hit or not simply by scanning if the item used was aimed directly at its target and then applies the effects of the item (usually damage) instantly. A weapon, for example, does not launch a projectile the player needs to lead, damage is applied as soon as the player&#x27;s crosshair is on a target and the fire button is pressed. Internally, this is most commonly done by simulating a ray from the origin of the item along the trajectory of the &quot;projectile&quot; and simply scanning for any objects touching the ray. Games might still show a visual of a projectile although it technically has no effect. In contrast, a projectile-based weapon would launch an actual projectile object that moves through the virtual space at a certain speed and will apply damage only once it has actually touched (&quot;hit&quot;) a target.

A projectile weapon which uses unmodified hitscan information to dictate whether or not it has hit its target is often called a &quot;hitscan weapon&quot;. Shooting the weapon calls the hitscan function, and if an object is detected in the projectile&#x27;s path, a hit is registered. Since the effect is immediate, the projectiles effectively travel at infinite speed and have a linear or otherwise simple trajectory—a practical approximation of a bullet&#x27;s speed and accuracy over short distances.

A simplified hitscan operation occurs in the first-person shooter &quot;DOOM&quot;; when the player holds down the fire button with the pistol, it fires inaccurately from the second shot. As another example, the submachine gun in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; calls a hitscan function in the middle of a &#x27;blazing gun&#x27; animation, creating a small amount of lag between weapon deployment and the hitting of the target to better approximate real-life ballistics.

== Advantages ==

The primary advantage is the simplicity of the simulation, which uses relatively simple mathematics to calculate hits. Although bullets do not move at infinite speed via perfectly straight trajectories, they move fast enough that a hitscan solution is normally a reasonable approximation. It leaves the question of where a weapon has hit to just one function, streamlining the programming of weapons.

In terms of game design, it readily ties cause (the player presses a &#x27;fire&#x27; button, executing a hitscan function) to effect (the hitscan returns a result, the player sees the weapon&#x27;s effect at that location). As a heavily simplified model of real world ballistics, it makes games more accessible in that there is no need to aim slightly ahead of a moving target in order to compensate for the time it takes for the projectile to reach it. Although less realistic, this model requires no understanding of real weapon handling in order to play the game, and reinforces the intuitive understanding that whatever the reticle is placed over will be hit.

== Disadvantages ==

Visually representing the firing effect of a hitscan weapon can be difficult: since the weapon hits its target instantaneously, any bullet or projectile that comes from the weapon is merely a &#x27;ghost&#x27;, and where it lands may not necessarily represent its actual hit. In particular, a projectile bullet effect will always lag behind the effect of its hit, a problem which can be compounded by Internet latency in online multiplayer gaming.

With advances in processing and Internet bandwidth, it has become more practical to simulate the ballistic nature of real-world firearms in real-time games by using a more realistic &quot;projectile&quot; model, spawning bullets as actual game objects with mass and velocity, and continuously simulating them until they reach their target.

<text>Scripps Research is a nonprofit American medical research facility that focuses on research and education in the biomedical sciences. Headquartered in San Diego, California, the institute has over 170 laboratories employing 2,100 scientists, technicians, graduate students, and administrative and other staff.

The institute holds over 1,100 patents, has produced 11 FDA-approved therapeutics, and has generated over 50 spin-off companies. The Scripps Research graduate program is ranked 9th nationally in the biological sciences, 6th for organic chemistry, and 6th for biochemistry.

In 2022, their Jupiter, Florida, campus became a part of the University of Florida. Jupiter-based graduate students remain part of the Scripps Research graduate program.

==History==
Scripps Research began with the Scripps Metabolic Clinic, founded near the current site in the La Jolla area of San Diego in 1924 by philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps, who was inspired by the discovery of insulin. In 1946, the metabolic clinic separated from Scripps Memorial Hospital.

In 1956, Scripps Research was renamed Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation to reflect its broader focus and management&#x27;s renewed commitment to biomedical research. Harvard biochemist A. Baird Hastings joined the institute in 1959, followed by immunologist Frank J. Dixon and colleagues William Weigle, Joseph Feldman, Charles Cochrane, and Jacinto Vazquez in 1961, biochemist Frank Huennekens and microbiologist John Spizizen in 1962. Dixon was appointed director of research operations in 1974, and in 1977 these operations assumed the name of The Research Institute of Scripps Clinic.

Upon Dixon&#x27;s retirement in 1986, Richard Lerner, who had been chair of the Scripps Department of Molecular Biology, was appointed the research institute&#x27;s new director. In 1989, the institute launched a graduate program. In 1991, as the result of a merger of hospitals, the research branch became part of a larger organization, the Scripps Institutions of Medicine and Science. In 1993, the research division separated from the clinical side, becoming an independent nonprofit organization under the name of the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). An additional campus in Florida was instituted in 2004.

Michael Marletta became president and CEO in 2012, assuming the position from Lerner. Marletta announced his resignation on July 21, 2014, and James C. Paulson was subsequently appointed acting president and CEO.

In September 2015, Peter G. Schultz was appointed CEO, and Steve A. Kay, president. Kay announced he was returning to the University of Southern California in August 2016.

In October 2016, TSRI announced a strategic affiliation with the non-profit California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr). The two organizations had already collaborated on several research programs in recent years, including the development of an antibody engineering platform aimed at improving treatments for chronic diseases such as diabetes and COPD, and immune therapies for the treatment of cancer. Calibr now represents the drug discovery and development division of Scripps Research.

In February 2017, 5AM Ventures&#x27; John Diekman was named chairman of the board.

In July 2018, TSRI was officially rebranded to Scripps Research.

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography is often incorrectly associated with Scripps Research; it is in fact a nearby research facility that is part of UCSD. Scripps Research is a private nonprofit institute not directly associated with UCSD. Confusingly, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography was once called the Scripps Institution for Biological Research.

In 2022, Scripps Florida separated from Scripps Research and became a part of the University of Florida.

==Features==
Scripps Research&#x27;s California campus is located on of land between Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla.

The board of directors includes John D. Diekman (founder of 5AM Ventures), William R. Hearst III (chairman of the board, Hearst Corporation), Ge Li (founder of WuXi AppTec), and Joel S. Marcus (founder, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.).

===Research rankings===
According to the 2017 Nature Innovation Index, Scripps Research is the #1 most influential research institution in the world (LENS score of 18.1), followed by The Rockefeller University (LENS score of 15.4) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (LENS score of 9.4).

Scripps Research was noted as a standout in the Science Watch survey of &quot;high-impact&quot; papers in chemistry (1997–2008), ranked number one worldwide by citations per paper.

Another measure of productivity, the Hirsch index (which has been published by Chemistry World), placed six Scripps Research scientists – Wüthrich, Sharpless, Lerner, Yates, Schultz, and Chi-Huey Wong – in the top 100 of 2,000 chemists rated. Science Watch placed Sharpless within the Top 10 list of its &quot;Top 100 Chemists 2000–2010&quot; based on citations impact; other faculty in the list were the late Carlos F. Barbas and John R. Yates.

In addition, a Thomson-Reuters&#x27;s list of researchers ranked in the top one percent by citations in their field (2002 to 2012) included TSRI researchers Phil S. Baran (chemistry); the late Carlos F. Barbas (chemistry); Dennis Burton (microbiology); Benjamin Cravatt III (biology and biochemistry); Pascal Poignard (microbiology); K. Barry Sharpless (chemistry); Eric Topol (genomic and digital medicine); Ian Wilson (microbiology); Richard Wyatt (microbiology); and Jin-Quan Yu (chemistry).

==Education==

===Scripps Research&#x27;s Graduate Program===
The graduate program at Scripps Research started in 1989 as the Macromolecular and Cellular Structure and Chemistry (MCSC) Program. A program in Chemistry followed three years after the establishment of the MCSC Program. In 2003, the institute redefined the curriculum to allow and encourage students to build course loads in an interdisciplinary manner. In 2005, Scripps Research&#x27;s graduate program expanded to encompass the Jupiter, Florida campus. Today, approximately 300 graduate students are enrolled in the program, which offers doctoral degrees in the chemical and biological sciences. In addition to its Ph.D. programs, Scripps Research offers a master&#x27;s degree in the discipline of Clinical and Translational Investigation (MCTI) for physician-scientists. The institute also administers the Skaggs-Oxford Scholarship program, which enables students to pursue a joint Ph.D./D.Phil. with the University of Oxford.

The most recent graduate school rankings by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; places Scripps Research&#x27;s program as 6th in chemistry (2nd in biochemistry, 5th in organic chemistry) and 10th in biological sciences.

In 2018, the program was renamed the Skaggs Graduate School of Chemical and Biological Sciences following a gift from the Skaggs family.

===Medical schools===
Florida Atlantic University launched a new joint MD/PhD program association with Scripps Florida. The first students entered the new program in fall 2011. Previously, Scripps Research and the Scripps Health hospital network explored the idea of starting a medical school in California, but this project did not come to fruition.

===Outreach programs===
The California and Florida campuses both offer educational outreach programs for high school students and undergraduates interested in learning more about science.

==Scripps Florida==
The Florida campus of Scripps Research operates a state-of-the-art biomedical research facility focusing on neuroscience, cancer biology, medicinal chemistry, drug discovery, biotechnology, and alternative energy development. More than 500 faculty, staff and students occupy Scripps Research&#x27;s Florida campus.

The facility&#x27;s grand opening took place on February 26, 2009, five years after Scripps Florida started operating. It was a public ceremony that drew many dignitaries, including then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

In 2022, Scripps Florida became a part of University of Florida Health. In October 2022, it received a $100 million donation from UF alumnus Herbert Wertheim. It was renamed &quot;Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation &amp; Technology&quot; after the donation.

===Research===
The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute received $64.8 million in annual research revenue in 2024.

==Funding==
Grants and contracts provide funding for a significant portion of the institute&#x27;s research. This revenue is derived primarily from the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. In addition, grantors include, among others, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, and the Juvenile Diabetes Association.

Gifts from individuals and private foundations provide an important source of funding for Scripps Research. In 2008, Audrey Geisel had a star named after her in recognition of her 50 years of support.

Private foundations that have provided support include the ALSAM Foundation, Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, W.M. Keck Foundation, Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, the Ellison Medical Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and Harold L. Dorris Foundation.

The establishment of the Scripps Florida campus was made possible by a one-time $310 million appropriation of federal economic development funds and by the Florida State Legislature and by an economic package provided by Palm Beach County.

<text>Extra Terrestrial Visitors (Spanish: Los nuevos extraterrestres, &quot;The New Extraterrestrials&quot;) is a 1983 science fiction film directed by Juan Piquer Simón. The film&#x27;s original draft was meant to be a straightforward horror film about an evil alien on a murderous rampage, but the producers demanded script alterations in order to cash in on the success of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; by featuring a child and a cute, lovable alien.

A co-production between France and Spain, it was first theatrically released in the former country. In the United States, it was sometimes known by the alternate title &quot;The Unearthling&quot;, and was aired on television bearing this name.

The film was largely forgotten until 1991, when it was lampooned by B movie-mocking cult TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, which used a print by Film Ventures International in which the film was re-titled &quot;Pod People&quot;.

==Plot==
Three poachers go into the woods to hunt. One of them sees what he thinks is a meteor land and goes to investigate. He finds a red glowing cave with a stash of large eggs. He decides to smash them, but is killed by an unseen entity before he can finish, which leaves one egg left intact. The mysterious being takes revenge for the destruction, first killing the other hunters and then going after members of a rock band led by Rick, who are on a weekend camping trip. This band is accompanied by Laura, a girl who Rick met and told about the weekend&#x27;s plans, not expecting her to want to come along. Sharon, a member of the band, is jealous of Laura, as she (Sharon) is Rick&#x27;s girlfriend. Cathy and Tracy are also band members.

Tommy is a young boy living in a secluded house with his mother Molly and his short-tempered uncle Bill. He also finds the cave, and brings the remaining egg home where it hatches. The creature from the egg grows rapidly overnight until it is as large as Tommy. Tommy nicknames it &quot;Trumpy&quot; because he has a short, trumpet-like trunk. Tommy and Trumpy quickly become playmates. At one point, Tommy asks Trumpy where he is from. Trumpy indicates a star map, which for some reason features the Big Dipper prominently. It also becomes clear that Trumpy has developed telekinetic powers around this time, as it flings various objects around Tommy&#x27;s room. While the mother alien continues to look for her missing offspring, the rock band stops at Tommy&#x27;s house for medical care after Laura encounters the alien mother and falls off of a cliff, later dying in the house. A strange dot formation (similar to the Big Dipper) is later seen on her forehead.

Rick&#x27;s friend Brian and uncle Bill go to a nearby ranger station to use the radio. There they stumble on the alien mother, as well as the body of a second poacher, which also bears the dot pattern. The alien kills Brian while Bill flees to the cabin. The alien beats him home, however, and kills band-member Tracy in the band&#x27;s camper. Tommy witnesses the attack through his telescope. The survivors decide to hole up in the cabin until the next day.

Trumpy&#x27;s mother sneaks into the house and kills Cathy while she is taking a shower. The survivors attempt too late to come to her rescue when they hear Cathy screaming, and Bill manages to wound the alien with a wild shot. Bill and Rick want to catch Trumpy&#x27;s mother before she can escape, so Rick takes a rifle and they go in pursuit.

Immediately after they leave, Trumpy appears, scaring Molly and Sharon. Molly grabs a rifle and aims to shoot Trumpy, but Tommy protects his alien friend and hustles Trumpy into the woods. Molly and Sharon give chase, searching for Tommy, Rick, and Bill in the gloom.

Eventually Trumpy and his mother reunite briefly before Rick and Bill find them. The alien mother attacks Bill, who shoots her once before being killed, then she is gunned down by Rick. Trumpy and Tommy disappear in the woods and say their goodbyes before Tommy reunites with his mother, Sharon, and Rick. The movie ends with Trumpy moving deeper into the woods and Tommy, Rick, Molly, and Sharon heading back to the cabin.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Extra Terrestrial Visitors&quot; was a co-production between France and Spain, with filming taking place in Madrid. The cast were largely Spanish actors, though the film was shot in both Spanish and French language and dubbed in post-production.

==Release==
&quot;Extra Terrestrial Visitors&quot; was first released theatrically in France. It was sometimes screened on American television under the alternate title &quot;The Unearthling&quot;.

In 1990, the film was acquired for U.S. television distribution by Film Ventures International, who re-titled it &quot;Pod People&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Chris Morgan, reviewing the &quot;Pod People&quot; version of the film, deemed it &quot;one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but fortunately it is bad in a way that is funny.&quot;

===&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;===
&quot;Extra Terrestrial Visitors&quot; gained some popularity in 1991 after it was lampooned by the B movie series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;), which aired a print sourced from Film Ventures International in which the film was re-titled &quot;Pod People&quot;. The episode aired in the summer of 1991.

In common with &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot;, another Film Ventures release spoofed by &quot;MST3K&quot;, the opening and ending credits for &quot;Pod People&quot; are superimposed over blurred footage from an entirely unrelated movie, in this case &quot;The Galaxy Invader&quot; (1985). The latter film would later be spoofed by Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy for RiffTrax in 2011. &quot;Pod People&quot; was selected by fans to be in the &quot;MST3K&quot; 2016 and 2020 Turkey Day Marathon.

The film&#x27;s fictional pop band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hear the Engines Roll&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Rugen los motores&quot;, &quot;The engines roar&quot;) is lampooned in a sketch in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; for its unintelligible lyrics, specifically the chorus, &quot;hear the engines roll now&quot;, interpreted by the &quot;MST3K&quot; cast as &quot;hideous control now&quot;, &quot;idiot control now&quot;, and other variations. The lead singer&#x27;s after-song gesture of making the OK sign, smiling, and saying, &quot;It stinks!&quot; became a recurring in-joke on &quot;MST3K&quot;.

=== Home media ===
In 1985, the film was released on VHS in Canada, licensed by Cinema Shares International, under the title &quot;The Unearthling&quot;. In the United Kingdom, a VHS was released under the title &quot;E. T.: The Second Coming&quot;.

The &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; version of the film was released by Rhino Home Video as part of the &quot;Collection, Volume 2&quot; DVD set which was re-released by Shout Factory in a multi-film set on 24 May 2016. The film itself has been released on DVD in 2005 by Substance. It was re-released on Blu-ray by Severin Films on June 27, 2023.

<text>Daxi District (), formerly known as Daxi Township (), is a district in eastern Taoyuan City, Taiwan. In March 2012, it was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Small Tourist Destinations&quot; by the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan.

==History==
The Daxi area was occupied for several thousand years by the Atayal people. The Atayal called the local river (modern-day Dahan Creek) &quot;Takoham&quot; in their native Austronesian language. This gave rise to similar names such as &quot;Toa-kho-ham&quot; (; also ) in Hokkien and &quot;Taikokan&quot; in Japanese via transliteration.

Eighteenth-century Han settlement in the Taipei Basin led many Atayal families to relocate upriver, though some Atayal stayed and mingled with the newcomers. The settlement later became an important trading post in the 19th century.

In 1803, open fighting broke out between two rival factions of Han settlers in Taipei, and many refugees fled south for safety. Among the refugees was the Lin Ben Yuan Family, one of the wealthiest clans in Taiwan at the time. The clan settled in Takoham, invested its fortunes in the settlement and brought prosperity to the whole region. Due to its strategic location and the investments made by the Lin clan, Takoham became the center of trading and transportation between Taipei and the south. Goods would arrive here to be transported to Taipei via Dahan river, and many traders opened their shops in the area; some of the shops still exist today in the old town section.

When the North-South Railway that bypasses the Takoham settlement was completed in 1909, the importance of river trade declined. Takoham lost its significance in North-South transportation, and is no longer a significant trading port. On the other hand, it became famous for the production of wooden furniture. In 1920, the Japanese government renamed this area 大溪 (&quot;big creek&quot;), pronounced &quot;Daikei&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Dàxī&quot; in Mandarin, which was administered under Shinchiku Prefecture.

 is a popular ingredient in Taiwanese cuisine. Daxi is also home to the mausoleums of two Kuomintang leaders: the late president Chiang Kai-shek in nearby Cihu and his son Chiang Ching-kuo in Touliao.

<doc id="957830" wikidata="Q1580019" url="?curid=957830" title="Liftback">
<text>A liftback is a variation of a hatchback car body style, with a more gently sloping roofline, roughly between 45 and 10 degrees, whereas traditional or archetypal hatchback designs tend to use a 45 degree to near vertical slope on the top-hinged tailgate (often called, and even counted as, a rear&quot; &#x27;door&#x27; &quot;on hatchbacks).

As such, a liftback is essentially a hatchback with a gently sloping roof, with a side profile like that of fastback sedans, from an auto styling perspective. Some liftbacks, especially two-door models, may also have an appearance similar to a coupe, but with a boot / trunk tailgate hinged at the roof end, that is lifted including the rear window to open. Carmaker Saab used this in the marketing of their 900 liftback models, by calling them Combi coupé.

The liftback design combines a sedan or coupé with the rear hatch versatility of a hatchback. Liftbacks generally have more cargo space than the typically shorter bodied hatchbacks, and more space-use flexibility than conventional three-box sedans – but don&#x27;t offer the space of a more square and boxy station wagon / estate variant of the same model. The aerodynamics of liftbacks can be more closely tear-drop shaped than those of hatchbacks, which due to their steeper down-sloped rears, more often end with a type of Kammback.


== History ==

In 1973, Toyota invented the &quot;liftback&quot; term to describe the sloping roofline variation of the Celica with a tailgate hinged at the roof, as opposed to the regular hardtop coupe variation which was introduced three years earlier. As its roofline slope is uninterrupted, it can also be defined as a fastback-styled hatchback.

== Liftback versus fastback ==
The term &quot;fastback&quot; is not interchangeable with &quot;liftback&quot;. A liftback is defined as having a tailgate that is hinged from the roof, similarly to a hatchback, whereas a fastback is a broad styling term used to describe any car with an uninterrupted slope in the roofline from the roof to the rear bumper. Thus, although some liftbacks are fastbacks, not all liftbacks are necessarily fastbacks. Additionally, some fastbacks have a tailgate hinged below a fixed rear window, which is not characteristic of a liftback. 

Some feel the slope of the rear window is a key determinant in the term &quot;liftback&quot;, in which the rear cargo door, or hatch, is horizontally angled. As a result, the hatch is lifted more upwards than backwards to open, a lifting action.

== Europe ==
Liftbacks were the mainstay of manufacturers&#x27; D-segment offerings in Europe in the 1990s to late 2000s, having become popular in the 1980s. It was common for manufacturers to offer the same D-segment model in three different body styles: a 4-door sedan, a 5-door liftback, and a 5-door station wagon. Such models included the Ford Mondeo, the Mazda 626 and 6, the Nissan Primera, the Opel Vectra and Insignia, and the Toyota Carina and Avensis. There were also models in this market segment available only as a 5-door liftback or a 4-door sedan, and models available only as a 5-door liftback or a 5-door station wagon. Often, the liftback and the sedan shared the same wheelbase and the same overall length, and the full rear overhang length of a conventional sedan trunk was retained on the five-door liftback version of the car.
 
The term was sometimes used for marketing purposes, among others, by Toyota, for example, to distinguish between two 5-door versions of the E90 series Corolla sold in Europe, one of which was a conventional 5-door hatchback with a nearly vertical rear hatch while the other one was a 5-door liftback.

Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz were not part of this trend in the 1990s, as they did not offer their D-segment or executive cars as 5-door liftbacks back then. However as some other manufacturers started to retire D-segment liftbacks from their European lineup, starting around 2009 Audi and BMW started to sell liftback versions of some of their vehicles but with their own marketing terms, referring to them as &quot;Sportback&quot; (Audi) or &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (BMW). For instance the Audi A4 and Audi A6 sedans had liftback variants known as the Audi A5 Sportback and Audi A7 Sportback, respectively. Interestingly, the Audi A7 Sportback would give rise to the Audi A7L which was an extended-wheelbase sedan of the former. However BMW&#x27;s liftback variants of the BMW 5 Series (F10) and BMW 5 Series (G30), sold as the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo (F07) and as the BMW 6 Series (G32), were not successful.

The second-generation Škoda Superb, produced from 2008 until 2015, is a car that functions both as a hatchback and a sedan. It features a &quot;Twindoor&quot; trunk lid that can be opened using hinges located below the rear glass, or together with the rear glass using hinges at the roof.

<text>Joanne Ekamdeiya Gobure (born April 26, 1982 in Nauru) is a Nauruan poet and teacher.

==Biography==
Gobure was born in Denigomodu and settled in a district of Uaboe. Gobure is the cousin of Nauruan tennis player Chris Gobure, who played in the South Pacific Games with Paner Baguga and others.

She attended schools of Nibok, Aiwo and Yaren and graduated with the Nauru Junior Certificate.

Since 2003, Gobure has worked mainly as a teacher at Nauru College, at Aiwo. She was employed by the director of the school, Richard Lewis, and by the education minister, Baron D. Waqa, as an IT teacher. Although she has not finished college education course, she is studying at the local campus of the University of South Pacific (USP). She mainly provides training to work with Microsoft Office. She additionally works at Nibok Infant School as a teacher.

Gobure writes poetry, overwhelmingly in the English language. While most of Gobure&#x27;s works are little known outside of Nauru, &quot;A Beautiful Prayer&quot; is a poem which has garnered some attention, particularly because it had been running through several internet forums and Christian websites.

In common with some other contemporary Oceanic writers (e.g., such as Afaese Manoa of Tuvalu), Gobure has the reputation of a writer with a very strong sense of religious vocation.

<doc id="957837" wikidata="Q7244877" url="?curid=957837" title="Princess and dragon">
<text>Princess and dragon is an archetypical premise common to many legends, fairy tales, and chivalric romances. Northrop Frye identified it as a central form of the quest romance.

The story involves an upper-class woman, generally a princess or similar high-ranking nobility, saved from a dragon, either a literal dragon or a similar danger, by the virtuous hero (see damsel in distress). She may be the first woman endangered by the peril, or may be the end of a long succession of women who were not of as high birth as she is, nor as fortunate. Normally the princess ends up married to the dragonslayer.

The motifs of the hero who finds the princess about to be sacrificed to the dragon and saves her, the false hero who takes his place, and the final revelation of the true hero, are the identifying marks of the Aarne–Thompson folktale type 300, the Dragon-Slayer. They also appear in type 303, the Two Brothers. These two tales have been found, in different variants, in countries all over the world.

The &quot;princess and dragon&quot; scenario is given even more weight in popular imagination than it is in the original tales; the stereotypical hero is envisioned as slaying dragons even though, for instance, the Brothers Grimm had only a few tales of dragon and giant slayers among hundreds of tales.

==History==
One of the earliest examples of the motif comes from the Ancient Greek tale of Perseus, who rescued the princess Andromeda from Cetus, a sea monster often described as resembling a serpent or dragon. This was taken up into other Greek myths, such as Heracles, who rescued the princess Hesione of Troy from a similar sea monster. Most ancient versions depicted the dragon as the expression of a god&#x27;s wrath: in Andromeda&#x27;s case, because her mother Queen Cassiopeia had compared her beauty to that of the sea nymphs, and in Hesione&#x27;s, because her father had reneged on a bargain with Poseidon. This is less common in fairy tales and other, later versions, where the dragon is frequently acting out of malice. The homosexual variety of the tale is also found in Greek mythology; similar myths existed in Crissa and Thespiae of a terrifying beast that ravaged the place unless a young man was sacrificed, Alcyoneus in Crisa and Cleostratus in Thespiae to them. In both cases a man who is in love with the youth (Eurybarus and Menestratus respectively) and steps in to take the youth&#x27;s place and slay the monster.

The Japanese legend of Yamata no Orochi also invokes this motif. The god Susanoo encounters two &quot;Earthly Deities&quot; who have been forced to sacrifice their seven daughters to the many-headed monster, and their daughter Kushinadahime is the next victim. Susanoo is able to kill the dragon after getting it drunk on sake (rice wine).

Another variation is from the tale of Saint George and the Dragon. The tale begins with a dragon making its nest at the spring which provides a city-state with water. Consequently, the citizens had to temporarily remove the dragon from its nest in order to collect water. To do so, they offered the dragon a daily human sacrifice. The victim of the day was chosen by drawing lots. Eventually in this lottery, the lot happened to fall to the local princess. The local monarch is occasionally depicted begging for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon but at this point a traveling Saint George arrives. He faces and defeats the dragon and saves the princess; some versions claim that the dragon is not killed in the fight, but pacified once George ties the princess&#x27; sash around its neck. The grateful citizens then abandon their ancestral paganism and convert to Christianity.

A similar tale to St. George&#x27;s, attributed to Russian sources, is that of &quot;St. Yegóry, the Brave&quot;: after the kingdoms of Sodom and Komor fall, the kingdom of &quot;Arabia&quot; is menaced by a sea-monster that demanded a sacrifice of a human victim every day. The queenly stepmother sent the Princess Elizabeth, the Fair, as the sacrifice. Yegóry, the Brave rescues Elizabeth and uses her sash to bind the beast. To mark her deliverance, he demands the building of three churches.

In a tale from Tibet, a kingdom suffers from drought due to two &quot;serpent-gods&quot; blocking the streams of water at the source. Both dragons also demand the sacrifices of citizens from the kingdom, men and women, to appease them, until prince Schalu and his faithful companion Saran decide to put an end to their existence.

When the tale is not about a dragon but a troll, giant, or ogre, the princess is often a captive rather than about to be eaten, as in &quot;The Three Princesses of Whiteland&quot;. These princesses are often a vital source of information to their rescuers, telling them how to perform tasks that the captor sets to them, or how to kill the monster, and when she does not know, as in &quot;The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body&quot;, she frequently can pry the information from the giant. Despite the hero&#x27;s helplessness without this information, the princess is incapable of using the knowledge herself. 
Again, if a false claimant intimidates her into silence about who actually killed the monster as in the fairy tale &quot;The Two Brothers&quot;, when the hero appears, she will endorse his story, but she will not tell the truth prior to them; she often agrees to marry the false claimant in the hero&#x27;s absence. The hero has often cut out the tongue of the dragon, so when the false hero cuts off its head, his claim to have killed it is refuted by its lack of a tongue; the hero produces the tongue and so proves his claim to marry the princess. In some tales, however, the princess herself takes steps to ensure that she can identify the hero—cutting off a piece of his cloak as in &quot;Georgic and Merlin&quot;, giving him tokens as in &quot;The Sea-Maiden&quot;—and so separate him from the false hero.
This dragon-slaying hero appears in medieval romances about knights-errant, such as the Russian Dobrynya Nikitich. In some variants of Tristan and Iseult, Tristan wins Iseult for his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, by killing a dragon that was devastating her father&#x27;s kingdom; he has to prove his claim when the king&#x27;s steward claims to be the dragon-slayer. Ludovico Ariosto took the concept up into &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; using it not once but twice: the rescue of Angelica by Ruggiero, and Orlando rescuing Olimpia. The monster that menaced Olimpia reconnected to the Greek myths; although Ariosto described it as a legend to the characters, the story was that the monster sprung from an offense against Proteus. In neither case did he marry the rescued woman to the rescuer. Edmund Spenser depicts St. George in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, but while Una is a princess who seeks aid against a dragon, and her depiction in the opening with a lamb fits the iconography of St. George pageants, the dragon imperils her parents&#x27; kingdom, and not her alone. Many tales of dragons, ending with the dragon-slayer marrying a princess, do not precisely fit this cliché because the princess is in no more danger than the rest of the threatened kingdom.

An unusual variant occurs in Child ballad 34, &quot;Kemp Owyne&quot;, where the dragon &quot;is&quot; the maiden; the hero, based on Ywain from Arthurian legend, rescues her from the transformation with three kisses.

Mythological comparativist Julien d&#x27;Huy ran an analytical study of the antiquity and diffusion of the snake- or dragon-battling mytheme in different cultural traditions.

Scholarship suggests a connection between the episode of the dragon-slaying by the hero and the journey on an eagle&#x27;s back, akin to the Mesopotamian myth of Etana.

==Modern versions==
In the 1959 animated film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Walt Disney concluded the tale by having the wicked fairy Maleficent transform herself into a dragon to withstand the prince, converting the fairy tale to one with the princess and dragon theme.

In Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;, both the book and film versions feature a tank in the shape of a dragon that protects Dr. No&#x27;s island from superstitious intruders. James Bond and Honeychile Rider are menaced by the &quot;dragon&quot;, destroy it, have their friend Quarrel killed and are captured by the crew of the Dragon tank. Ann Boyd&#x27;s 1967 book &quot;The Devil with James Bond&quot; explores the theory of the updating of the Princess and dragon genre.

In modern fantasy works, the dragon may hold the princess captive instead of eating her. Patricia Wrede spoofed this concept in &quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot;.

A feminist subversion of the concept for young readers is Robert Munsch&#x27;s &quot;The Paper Bag Princess&quot;, in which a princess outwits a dragon to save a prince (her betrothed, whom she proceeds &quot;not&quot; to marry upon him insulting her makeshift clothing instead of thanking her).

In Jay Williams&#x27;s tale &quot;The Practical Princess&quot;, a dragon demands that a king should sacrifice his daughter to him so that he will leave the rest of the kingdom alone. But the princess saves herself by making a &quot;princess dummy&quot; out of straw and filling it with boiling pitch and tar. The princess dresses the straw dummy in one of her own gowns, then goes to the dragon&#x27;s cave where she offers herself as a sacrifice. The unwitting dragon swallows the dummy whole, and the pitch and tar explode inside the dragon&#x27;s stomach, killing him. Afterwards, the princess observes, &quot;Dragons are not very smart.&quot;

In the Isaac Asimov short story &quot;Prince Delightful and the Flameless Dragon&quot;, it is revealed that Dragons used to be slain as part of a passage from princehood to adulthood, though after a while, they became a protected species. Contrary to popular myth, they do not eat princesses as they tend to smell of cheap perfume and give indigestion.

In animated television series &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; episode, &quot;The Hero&quot;, Sir Brad Starlight, the bumbling knight who believes in fairy tales, sets off to rescue the princess from the dragon king. However, it turns out that the princess and the dragon king are in love with each other and are engaged to marriage; as the dragon himself is actually a good guy and the princess herself does not need to be rescued.

==Interpretations==
In his study on the historical roots of the wondertale, Russian scholar Vladimir Propp interpreted the dragonslaying tale (ATU 300) as an &quot;inversion&quot; of the ancient ritual of a maiden sacrifice to a river to ensure good crops. Propp speculated that, in regards to this practice, the hero would be seem as a &quot;profaner&quot; of the ritual, but, as time passed, the maiden sacrifice was discarded and the hero was elevated.

==Diversions==

In some stories, mostly in more recent literary works, the cliché involving princesses and dragons is somehow twisted to create a more exciting or humorous effect. For example, in &quot;The Paper Bag Princess&quot;, the princess came to realize that her prince was even more obnoxious than the dragon, and refused to go with him, preferring to skip off into the setting sun alone instead. In some versions, the princess may also befriend, tame, personally defeat, or even be turned into a dragon herself. Indeed, there are a few examples when a curse or spell transforms a princess into a dragon or similar creature (e.g. an alligator, giant bird, or fictional reptile species). In such stories, the transformed princess usually aids her sweetheart in a battle against a force of evil. In &quot;The Swan Princess&quot;, for example, Princess Odette is transformed into a swan, and she helps her lover triumph in a battle against the sorcerer Rothbart, who has the power to transform himself into a hideous beast (a manifestation of a lion, wolf, bear and bat).

<text>The siege of Dapur occurred as part of Pharaoh Ramesses II&#x27;s campaign to suppress Galilee and conquer Syria in 1269 BC. He described his campaign on the wall of his mortuary temple, the Ramesseum in Thebes, Egypt. The inscriptions say that Dapur was &quot;in the land of Hatti&quot;. Although Dapur has often been identified with Tabor in Canaan, Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen argues that this identification is incorrect and that the Dapur in question was in Syria, north of Kadesh.

Egyptian reliefs depict Dapur as a heavily fortified settlement with both inner and outer walls and situated on a rocky hill, which was usual for Bronze Age settlements in Syria and abroad, Egypt was also fortified.

Contemporary illustrations of the siege show the use of ladders, chariots, and mounted cavalry with Egyptian soldiers climbing scale ladders supported by archers. Six of the sons of Ramesses, still wearing their sidelocks of youth, also appear on those depictions of the siege. Those include:

<text>Guantian District () is a rural district in central Tainan, Taiwan. It is the hometown of former Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian. It hosts a population of 20,866 residents.

== History ==
Guantian (官田) was formerly known as the &quot;Guantian&quot; (官佃). During Dutch rule, this area belonged to the government as &quot;Wang Tian&quot; (王田). During Ming Zheng rule, Wang Tian was changed to &quot;Guantian&quot;, and the land was handed over to the civil and military officials, who can then recruit the farmers. Among them, the Chen Yonghua family had the most commitments and gradually formed a Han Chinese settlement, hence the name &quot;Guantian&quot; (官佃).

Under the Qing rule, it became &quot;Guantian village&quot; (官佃庄). During the Japanese colonial era in 1920, it was renamed as &quot;Guantian village&quot; (官田庄), belonging to Zengwun County, Tainan Prefecture. In 1953 after the war, it became &quot;Guantian Township&quot; (官田鄉). On 25 December 2010, it was renamed as &quot;Guantian District&quot; (官田區).

Guantian District had human activities since three thousand years ago, but it was only officially established a hundred years ago under Japanese rule. Although the district administration of Guantian District is young, the history of the people and the land can be traced back to ancient times.

<text>Evelyn De Morgan (30 August 1855 – 2 May 1919) was an English painter associated early in her career with the later phase of the Pre-Raphaelite Movement, and working in a range of styles including Aestheticism and Symbolism. Her paintings are figural, foregrounding the female body through the use of spiritual, mythological, and allegorical themes. They rely on a range of metaphors (such as light and darkness, transformation, and bondage) to express what several scholars have identified as spiritualist and feminist content. Her later works also dealt with the themes of war from a pacifist perspective, engaging with conflicts such as the Second Boer War and World War I.

==Early life==
She was born Mary Evelyn Pickering at 6 Grosvenor Street in London, England, to Percival Pickering QC, the Recorder of Pontefract, and Anna Maria Wilhelmina Spencer Stanhope, the sister of the artist John Roddam Spencer Stanhope and a descendant of Coke of Norfolk who was an Earl of Leicester.

De Morgan was educated at home; according to her sister and biographer, Anna Wilhelmina Stirling, their mother insisted that &quot;from the first Evelyn [was to] profi[t] from the same instruction as her brother.&quot;
 She studied Greek, Latin, French, German, and Italian, as well as classical literature and mythology, and was also exposed at a young age to history books and scientific texts.

== Personal life ==

In August 1883, Evelyn met the ceramicist William De Morgan (the son of the mathematician Augustus De Morgan), and on 5 March 1887, they married. They spent their lives together in London, visiting Florence for half the year every year from 1895 until the outbreak of WWI in 1914. Evelyn De Morgan supported the suffrage movement, and she appears as a signatory on the Declaration in Favour of Women&#x27;s Suffrage of 1889. She was also a pacifist and expressed her horror about the First World War and Boer War in over fifteen war paintings including &quot;The Red Cross&quot; and &quot;S.O.S&quot;. In 1916, she held a benefit exhibition of these works at her studio in Edith Grove in support of the Red Cross and Italian Croce Rossa.

For the first half of their marriage, De Morgan used the profits from sales of her work to help financially support her husband&#x27;s pottery business; she also actively contributed ideas to his ceramics designs. The De Morgans finally achieved financial security in 1906 after the publication of William&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Joseph Vance&quot;.
De Morgan and her husband were both spiritualists, and De Morgan’s sister and biographer A. M. W. Stirling credits them as the anonymous authors of a 1909 publication of automatic writings — communications with spirit beings — titled &quot;The Result of an Experiment&quot;. The introduction to this book describes the couple as practicing automatic writing together every night for many years of their marriage. Since precious little primary material in Evelyn De Morgan’s own hand has survived, this text provides important information about her faith and her approach to a range of issues—from her understanding of ultimate reality to her belief about the role of art in capturing spirit. From the moment that de Morgan encountered spiritualism, her perspective seemed to change, and her works started to reflect more ideas about darkness and death. De Morgan used a range of motifs to represent spiritual ideas. A few examples are Renaissance angels, heavenly auras, a distinctive contrast between light and dark, and the symbolic use of colours. De Morgan used complex allegories to depict her social commentary and spiritual beliefs. The iconography in these works reflect several spiritual themes such as the progress of the spirit, the materialism of life on earth, and the imprisonment of the soul in the earthly body.  

Evelyn De Morgan died on 2 May 1919 in London, two years after the death of her husband and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey. Their tombstone bears an inscription from &quot;The Result of an Experiment&quot;: “Sorrow is only of the flesh / The life of the spirit is joy”.
==Career==

De Morgan started drawing lessons when she was 15, and from the outset was dedicated to her craft. On the morning of her seventeenth birthday, she wrote in her diary: &quot;Art is eternal, but life is short…&quot; — &quot;I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.&quot; This diary, given up after a few months, reveals her devotion to her work. She records hours upon hours of &quot;steady work,&quot; chastising herself for &quot;wast[ing] time&quot; through daily tasks like going to tea and changing her dress. According to Stirling, De Morgan was interested in little other than painting and fought hard to be considered seriously as an artist. She rebelled against any efforts to turn her into an &quot;idle&quot; woman, and when her mother suggested she be presented to society, De Morgan rejoined: &quot;I&#x27;ll go to the Drawing Room if you like...but if I go, I&#x27;ll kick the Queen!&quot; Stirling recounts another incident in which De Morgan rejected further attempts to introduce her to society: &quot;It was...suggested to Evelyn that she might like to go into Society and see a little of the world, but she jumped to a conclusion respecting this process which was clearly unjustifiable in her case. &#x27;No one shall drag me out with a halter round my neck to sell me!&#x27; was her uncompromising rejoinder.&quot;

In 1872, she was enrolled at the South Kensington National Art Training School (today the Royal College of Art) and in 1873 moved to the Slade School of Art. At Slade, she was awarded the prestigious Slade Scholarship and won several awards: the Prize and Silver Medal for Painting from the Antique; First Certificate for Drawing from the Antique; and Third Equal Certificate for Composition. She eventually left Slade to work more independently.

De Morgan was known to George Frederic Watts from infancy, and while developing as an artist she would often visit him at his studio-home, Little Holland House. She also studied under Watts&#x27;s student, her uncle John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, who had a great influence on her visual style. Beginning in 1875, Evelyn often visited him in Florence where he lived. This enabled her to study the great artists of the Renaissance; the influence of Quattrocento artists like Botticelli is especially visible in her works from this point onwards. After this period, De Morgan&#x27;s art began to move away from the more traditional, classical subjects and style favoured by the Slade School towards a development of her own particular, mature style. Through Stanhope, De Morgan also developed friendships with Pre-Raphaelite painters Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. She was also friendly with other key figures in the Victorian literary and artistic world, like writer Vernon Lee.

De Morgan first exhibited in 1876 at the Dudley Gallery and then a year later at the inaugural Grosvenor Gallery exhibition in London. She exhibited regularly until 1907, including a one-woman show at Wolverhampton Municipal Art Gallery and Museum in which 25 works were shown, including 14 for sale. After 1907, she stopped exhibiting regularly. E.L. Smith theorises that this was due to the financial security that came from the success of her husband&#x27;s first novel, meaning she was no longer obligated to sell her paintings.

The vast majority of De Morgan’s works, particularly from the mid-1880s onwards, depict content or themes that can be described as broadly spiritualist. These themes arguably reach their peak in her later works like &quot;Daughters of the Mist&quot; (c. 1905–10), which use a Symbolist allegorical register to suggest their profoundly mystical content by suggestion rather than explicit declaration.

==Works==


In August 1875, De Morgan sold her first work &quot;Tobias and the Angel.&quot; Her first exhibited painting, &quot;St Catherine of Alexandria,&quot; was shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1876.

<text>Yujing District () is a rural district in eastern Tainan, Taiwan. It is famous for its cultivation of mangoes.

After a 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit southern Taiwan in March 2010, pillars were severely damaged at Yujing Junior High School forcing school officials to cancel some classes.

==History==
Yujing, was formerly known as (or in Dutch records after 1650&#x27;s; transliterated as ) in Taivoan, is likely the site of tribe of , a former political unit of the Taiwanese aborigines. The name has also been spelled &quot;Tefurang&quot;, &quot;Tefurangh&quot;, &quot;Tevoran&quot;, &quot;Tevourang&quot;, and &quot;Devoran&quot;. Tevorang was one of nine villages that joined in warfare against the people of Favorlang (modern-day Huwei, Yunlin).

During the Kingdom of Tungning, members of the Siraya people from the Tavocan area (modern-day Xinhua) moved to this area due to conflicts with Han Chinese.

The Tapani Incident of 1915 was one of the largest armed uprisings by Taiwanese Han and aboriginals against Japanese rule in Taiwan.

In 1920, political divisions of Taiwan had structural changes and many geographical names were changed into Japanese style. The name &quot;Tapani&quot; was transliterated as in Japanese &quot;Tamai&quot; (Kanji: ) and administratively was called Tamai Village, , Tainan Prefecture. During Japanese rule, Tamai produced abundant sugar.

===Republic of China===
The name &quot;Tamai&quot; (Kanji: ) of the very same Japanese Kanji is pronounced &quot;Yujing&quot; in Mandarin Chinese.
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Yujing was organized as a rural township of Tainan County. On 25 December 2010, Tainan County was merged with Tainan City and Yujing was upgraded to a district of the city. In the 1960s, with government promotion, the name &quot;Yujing&quot; became almost synonymous with &quot;mangos&quot;.

<text>Rende is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province of Cosenza, Calabria, Italy, home to the headquarters of the University of Calabria. It has a population of about 35,000, or more than 60,000 if the university students living there are taken into account. The city is divided into two parts: the old town, on a high hill, and the modern area, on level ground, which is fully connected to the city of Cosenza and central to the cultural and economic life of the urban area.

== Geography ==

Rende stretches from the left river of the Crati to the mountains called &quot;Serre Cosentine&quot;.
* Southern borders: Cosenza, Castrolibero, Marano Marchesato and Marano Principato.
* Northern borders: Montalto Uffugo and San Vincenzo La Costa.
* Western borders: San Fili.
* Eastern borders: Castiglione Cosentino, Rose, San Pietro in Guarano and Zumpano.

The municipality counts the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of Arcavacata, Commenda, Quattromiglia, Roges, Santo Stefano, Saporito and Surdo.

The territory presents mountain areas from west that degrade slowly eastward forming hills, one of which is the historic centre, until the valley of the Crati. Thanks to large flat areas, it is covered by the modern city. The most important rivers crossing Rende are Crati, Campagnano, Surdo and Emoli.

==History==
The Oenotrians founded here a town named &quot;Acheruntia&quot; and, later, Pandosia. However, several inhabitants later moved to a more defendable area, corresponding to the modern &quot;frazione&quot; of Nogiano, founding (c. 520 BC) the new settlement of &quot;Aruntia&quot;, later, &quot;Arintha&quot;. This is mentioned by the ancient Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus as a Bruttian town of Oenotrian origins.

During Roman times, the town followed the history of the nearby Cosentia. After a long resistance, it was sacked by Totila&#x27;s troops in 547, during the Gothic Wars. In the 8th-10th centuries, it was sometimes attacked by Saracen troops, until part of the population moved in what is now the territory of Castiglione Cosentino. Later it was controlled by the Normans and subsequently other southern Italian (sometimes of foreign origin) dynasties.

==Main sights==
* Norman Castle, built in 1095 by Bohemond I of Antioch.
*Mother church of Santa Maria Maggiore, built around 12th century but rebuilt several times, the last in the late 18th century
*Sanctuary of Maria Santissima di Costantinopoli

== Economy ==

The economy of Rende is mostly based on the University of Calabria. In comparison to the rest of southern Italy, Rende has quite a strong economy and is therefore in full expansion. While full industrialization has not yet been very successful, in recent times, major companies have established offices in Rende. Among these are the Japanese Digital and Data Innovation company NTT Data, which has a Research and Development office in Rende; and JRS Silvateam Food Ingredients.

== Sports ==
Rende is home to the football team Rende Calcio, which competes in the official semi-professional tournament (C2)

<text>James Roland &quot;Poley&quot; McClintock (September 22, 1900, Tyrone, Pennsylvania — January 6, 1980, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania) was a member of Fred Waring&#x27;s Pennsylvanians, a popular jazz band of the 1920s.

As a child, McClintock was a neighbor of Waring in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. The two performed together in the Boy Scout Fife and Bugle Corps, with Waring as drum major and McClintock as drummer. In 1915, he and Waring&#x27;s brother, Tom, formed a banjo group, The Waring-McClintock Snap Orchestra.

His characteristic vocal inflections are heard frequently in many of the Pennsylvanians&#x27; novelty tunes, singing his parts in a low-range frog-like croak. It is widely believed that the part sung by Tony Burrows in The Pipkins&#x27; 1970 novelty record &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot; was intended as a tribute to McClintock.

McClintock was married to silent film actress Yvette Mitchell.

<text>James Arthur Monk (born December 5, 1957) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins, the New York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles. He is considered by many NFL players, coaches, and analysts to be one of the greatest wide receivers of all time. Monk was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Personal life==
He is a relative (first cousin once removed) of jazz pioneer Thelonious Monk.

==College career==
Monk attended and played college football at Syracuse University, where he was a four-year Orangemen letterman (1976–79). He led the team in receiving in 1977, 1978, and 1979 and still ranks in the top 10 on several school career record lists, including career receptions (sixth), all-time receiving yards (seventh), and receiving yards per game (ninth). While there, Monk was a graduate of the College of Visual and Performing Arts.

===College statistics===
* Includes bowl games.

==Professional career==
Monk was selected in the first round of the 1980 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins. During his rookie year, he was a unanimous All-Rookie selection and had 58 receptions, which was a Redskin rookie record.

In 1984, Monk caught a then-NFL record 106 receptions for a career-best 1,372 yards. He caught eight or more passes in six games, had five games of 100 yards or more, and in a game against the San Francisco 49ers caught ten passes for 200 yards. That season, he earned team MVP honors and his first Pro Bowl selection. Monk went over the 1,000-yard mark in each of the following two seasons, becoming the first Redskins receiver to produce three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. He also became the first Redskins player to catch 70 or more passes in three consecutive seasons. In 1989, he was part of a prolific wide receiver trio (along with Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders) nicknamed &quot;The Posse,&quot; who became the first trio of wide receivers in NFL history to post 1,000-plus yards in the same season.

During Monk&#x27;s 14 seasons with the Redskins, the team won three Super Bowls (XVII, XXII, and XXVI) and had only three losing seasons. He was an All-Pro and All-NFC choice in 1984 and 1985 and was named second-team All-NFC in 1986. He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl following the 1984, 1985 and 1986 seasons.

Nine times during his 15-season career with the Redskins, New York Jets, and Philadelphia Eagles, Monk exceeded 50 catches in a season and five times gained more than 1,000 receiving yards. His record for most receptions in a season (106 in 1984) stood until broken by Sterling Sharpe&#x27;s 108 in 1992. He also set the record for career receptions when he caught his 820th in a Monday Night game against Denver on October 12, 1992. He became the first player to eclipse 900 receptions, and pushed the record up to 940 before being overtaken by Jerry Rice in the final week of his last season (1995). With the retirement of James Lofton in 1993, he was the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career yards for just two weeks in 1994 before being passed by Jerry Rice. He retired with the most consecutive games with a catch (183). He was named to the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team. Monk also became the first player in the league to record a touchdown reception in 15 consecutive seasons, as well as the first player ever to record at least 35 receptions in 15 consecutive seasons. Through the course of his 14 years with the Redskins, Monk converted nearly two-thirds of his 888 catches into first downs.

On August 2, 2008, Monk, along with fellow Washington Redskins teammate Darrell Green, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon his induction into the Hall of Fame, Monk received the longest standing ovation in Pro Football Hall of Fame history, lasting four minutes and four seconds when later timed by NFL Films. In 2012, Monk was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

<doc id="957871" wikidata="Q830585" url="?curid=957871" title="Destination Tokyo">
<text>Destination Tokyo is a 1943 black and white American submarine war film. The film was directed by Delmer Daves in his directorial debut, and the screenplay was written by Daves and Albert Maltz, based on an original story by former submariner Steve Fisher. The film stars Cary Grant and John Garfield and features Dane Clark, Robert Hutton, and Warner Anderson, along with John Ridgely, Alan Hale Sr. and William Prince.

&quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; has been called &quot;the granddaddy of submarine films like &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981), and &quot;U-571&quot; (2000)&quot;.

Produced during the height of World War II, the film was used as propaganda to boost morale back home and to entice young men to join the Submarine Service of the U.S. Navy.

== Plot ==
On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS &quot;Copperfin&quot;, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs Mare Island Naval Shipyard on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to rendezvous with a PBY Catalina and take meteorologist Lt. Raymond aboard. He is then to proceed to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid.

After picking up Raymond, the &quot;Copperfin&quot; is attacked by two Japanese floatplanes. Both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike, a &quot;Copperfin&quot; crewman, goes down the hull to pull the Japanese aboard, he is stabbed to death by the downed pilot. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the Japanese, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike&#x27;s death. At least partly to expiate his mistake, Tommy volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck under the direction of Captain Cassidy.

When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American &quot;Tin Can&quot; does not attend the service. This angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction.

As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the &quot;Copperfin&quot; has to negotiate defensive minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy seizes the opportunity and follows in its wake. That night, a three-man party, including resourceful womanizer &quot;Wolf&quot;, goes ashore to make weather observations.

Meanwhile, Tommy is diagnosed with appendicitis. &quot;Pills&quot;, the pharmacist&#x27;s mate, has to operate following instructions from a book, using improvised instruments and without sufficient ether to last throughout the procedure. The operation is successful, and &quot;Cookie&quot; Wainwright begins to prepare the pumpkin pie he had promised to bake for Tommy.

Raymond broadcasts the information the shore party has collected in Japanese in an attempt to avoid detection, but the Japanese are not fooled and search the bay. The &quot;Copperfin&quot; remains undetected, allowing the men to watch part of the Doolittle Raid through the periscope. After recovering Raymond and his team, the submarine then slips out of the bay, following an exiting ship when the anti-submarine nets are opened to let it through.

Later, the &quot;Copperfin&quot; sinks a Japanese aircraft carrier and is badly damaged by its escorts. In desperation, after long hours and barrages of depth charges, Cassidy attacks, sending a destroyer to the bottom and enabling the crew to return safely home.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Production on &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; began on June 21, 1943 and continued through September 4 of that year. Members of the cast spent time at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, to familiarize themselves with submarine procedures and operations. Technical advisors to the film included the captain of the , Dudley Walker Morton, and crewmember Andy Lennox. The &quot;Wahoo&quot; was reported as missing in action after production on &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; completed, sunk by Japanese aircraft in October 1943 while returning home from a patrol in the Sea of Japan. Commander Morton and all aboard were lost. Thanks to the efforts of the Wahoo Project Group, the wreckage was identified in 2006.

The existence of a submarine in Tokyo Bay relaying information to the Doolittle Raid is mentioned in the film &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944), based on pilot Ted Lawson&#x27;s memoir. There is a scene on the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; where Lawson (Van Johnson), fresh from a briefing on the latest positions of the barrage balloons over Tokyo, tells his friend Bob Gray (Robert Mitchum): &quot;You know, the changes in those balloons threw me. Just think, a bunch of guys sweating all day in a sub down in Tokyo Bay, guys just like us, sneaking up at night to radio balloon positions...&quot; The existence of such a submarine is not part of the participants&#x27; or historians&#x27; accounts of the raid. The Doolittle Raiders detailed description of the raid states that the barrage balloons seen on the raid were a negligible threat. There were many other possible intelligence sources for information given out at the briefings.

The model of the &quot;Copperfin&quot; used for filming was based on actual American submarines, except that, to confuse the Japanese, it was given equipment and apparatus that were used on numerous different types of subs. The film was accurate enough to be used by the Navy as a training tool for submariners.

The incident in &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; in which the pharmacist&#x27;s mate performs an appendectomy was based on an actual event which took place on the submarine .

Some filming of &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; took place at Portuguese Bend on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

For &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;, Warner Bros. borrowed Cary Grant from Columbia Pictures in a swap which sent Humphrey Bogart to Columbia to make &quot;Sahara&quot;. Grant had turned down the role that Bogart eventually played, and Gary Cooper had turned down the role of the captain of the &quot;Copperfin&quot; that Grant played.
== Reception ==
&quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; premiered in Pittsburgh on December 15, 1943 as a benefit for crippled children. According to Warner Bros. records, it earned $3,237,000 domestically and $1,307,000 internationally.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote: 

It has a lot of exciting incident in it; some slick, manly performances are turned in by Cary Grant (as the commander), John Garfield, Alan Hale and Dane Clark. But an essential rule of visual drama, which is to put within a frame only so much explicit action as can be realistically accepted in a space of time, is here completely violated. The Warners have a big but too extravagant action film.
In contrast, the review in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, was effusive in its praise: 

&#x27;Destination Tokyo&#x27; runs two hours and 15 minutes, and that&#x27;s a lot of film. But none of it is wasted. In its unspooling is crammed enough excitement for possibly a couple of pictures. Here is a film whose hero is the Stars and Stripes; the performers are merely symbols of that heroism. Here is a film of superbly pooled talents.
A later release of &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; was colorized.

== Nominations ==
Screenwriter Steve Fisher received an Academy Award nomination for his original story for &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;.

== Influence ==
Inspired by Grant&#x27;s role, a 17-year-old Tony Curtis forged his mother&#x27;s signature to enlist in the United States Navy in 1943. Requesting submarine duty, he instead served aboard a submarine tender, . Later, as a top Hollywood talent, he co-starred with Grant as submariners in the 1959 World War II comedy &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, with Grant commanding the fictional USS &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;.

When the crew of a World War II-submarine in the 1951 movie &quot;Operation Pacific&quot; is given the treat of watching a movie, &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; is screened. Footage from this film was reused in the 1959 film &quot;Submarine Seahawk&quot;.

According to his autobiography, &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; influenced Ronald Reagan in his decision to accept the lead role of a World War II submarine captain in the 1957 movie &quot;Hellcats of the Navy&quot;.

<doc id="957872" wikidata="Q701693" url="?curid=957872" title="Lukang">
<text>Lukang, formerly romanized as Lugang and also known by other names, is an urban township in northwestern Changhua County, Taiwan. The township is on the west coast of Taiwan, facing the Taiwan Strait. Lukang was an important sea port in the 18th century and 19th century. It was the most populous city in central Taiwan until the early 20th century. In March 2012, it was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Small Tourist Towns&quot; by the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan.

==Name==
The township&#x27;s name, which means &quot;Deer Port&quot;, came from its deerskin trade during the Dutch period. Its old Taiwanese name was Lok-a-kang () and its shortened version is seen in English texts and maps as variants such as Lok-kang, Lokang and Lo-kiang.

In 2011, the Ministry of Interior decided to keep the historical Wade-Giles spelling &quot;Lukang&quot; and abandon the change to the Pinyin spelling &quot;Lugang&quot; consistent with the switch to Tongyong Pinyin in 2002 and later Hanyu Pinyin 2009.

==History==
An important trading port during Lukang&#x27;s heyday from 1785 to 1845, Lukang&#x27;s population reached 20,000. Lukang was Taiwan&#x27;s second largest city after Tainan and was larger than Bangka (now a district of Taipei), then the island&#x27;s third-largest city. The rice industry brought great wealth to the city. During the late 1800s the most prominent families in Lukang were the Huang and Koo clans.

The subsequent silting of the harbor and the city&#x27;s refusal to allow railroads to pass through the city led to losses in trade in commerce, which, in turn led to Lukang&#x27;s decline relative to other cities, which were experiencing considerable urbanization and population growth. This same decline, however, averted the modernization processes that demolished historical buildings in Tainan and Taipei, leaving Lukang preserved as it was in the past.

During the period of Japanese rule, the city was Taiwan&#x27;s fifth most populous city, with a population of 19,805 according to the December 1904 census. The Hoklo people in the area were predominantly of Xiamen and Quanzhou origin, thereby speaking the Quanzhou dialect of Hokkien. Nanguan music is highly popular in Lukang and originates from Quanzhou.

In 1920, Lukang was governed as under Shōka District of Taichū Prefecture.

==Overview==
There are many old temples in Lukang, such as Longshan Temple and Matzu Temple. The city boasts over 200 temples dedicated to a wide variety of folk deities. The town is also the origin of the terms &quot;ē-káng&quot; (下港) and &quot;téng-káng&quot; (頂港) used respectively to refer to southern Taiwan and northern Taiwan; the literal meanings of the terms are &quot;below the harbor&quot; and &quot;above the harbor&quot;.

The Yu Jen Jai (玉珍齋) cakes are famous local specialties, as well as Lukang&#x27;s Ox Tongue Cakes (牛舌餅) and oyster pancakes. It will host the 2012 Taiwan Lantern Festival, beating out six other contenders.

Lukang encompasses with a population of 85,423, including 43,199 males and 42,224 females as of January 2023.

==Administrative divisions==
The township comprises 29 villages, which are Dayou, Zhongxing, Luojin, Shunxing, Pulun, Xingong, Yushun, Tungshi, Guocuo, Yongan, Jingfu, Taixing, Zhangxing, Xinghua, Longshan, Caiyuan, Jiewei, Zhaoan, Haipu, Yangcuo, Caozhong, Tounan, Shanlun, Dingpan, Toulun, Gouqi, Liaocuo, Tungqi and Dingcuo.

<text>USS &quot;Pintado&quot; (SSN-672), a short hull attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pintado, a large mackerel-like fish, whose elongated spots suggested the Spanish language word meaning &quot;painted.&quot;

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Pintado&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, at Vallejo, California, on 29 December 1965, and her keel was laid down there on 27 October 1967. She was launched on 16 August 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Bernard A. Clarey, the wife of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Bernard A. &quot;Chick&quot; Clarey (1912–1996), and commissioned on 11 September 1971.

== Service history ==
&quot;Pintado&quot; was assigned San Diego, California, as her home port. She commenced her first operational deployment to the United States Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific in November 1972, returning to San Diego, in February 1973. &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted her second operational deployment from April to September 1974.

In May 1974 &quot;Pintado&quot; collided with a Soviet Navy YANKEE class ballistic missile submarine in the approaches to the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky naval base on the Soviet Union&#x27;s Kamchatka Peninsula. The collision smashed much of &quot;Pintado&quot;″s sonar sphere, jammed one of her a starboard-side torpedo hatches shut, and moderately damaging one of her diving planes. The commanding officer, then-Commander J. Guy Reynolds, later retired as a vice admiral. The Soviet submarine surfaced immediately, but the extent of damage to her was not known. &quot;Pintado&quot;, meanwhile, remained submerged and departed the area at top speed. She proceeded to Guam, where she entered drydock for repairs that lasted seven weeks.

From end October 1974 to September 1975, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted routine training operations in the San Diego area. In March 1975, &quot;Pintado&quot; became the first submarine to successfully launch the Harpoon missile. In August 1975,&quot;Pintado&quot; changed homeport to Bremerton, Washington, where she underwent upgrades and repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Finishing the yard period early, &quot;Pintado&quot; returned to San Diego, in June 1976, and resumed routine training operations in the San Diego area.

Following her year of routine training, &quot;Pintado&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific in August 1977. She was operating with Republic of Korea Navy vessels on 6 December 1977, when a South Korean surface ship abruptly turned toward her. She executed a crash dive, but the two ships collided, and &quot;Pintado&quot; sustained damage to the top of her rudder. She returned to San Diego in February 1978.

From February to September 1978, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted local training operations in the San Diego area.

From September to December 1978, &quot;Pintado&quot; operated in the Arctic under the polar ice cap, surfacing at the North Pole on 10 October 1978.

In September 1979, &quot;Pintado&quot; deployed to the Indian Ocean and supported Carrier battle groups Alpha and Bravo during the early weeks of the Iranian hostage crisis. She returned to San Diego, in January 1980.

&quot;Pintado&quot; again deployed to the Western Pacific from February to August 1981, earning a Navy Unit Commendation.

In June 1982, &quot;Pintado&quot; entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for a 16-month regular overhaul and refueling, during which her combat systems were extensively upgraded. The overhaul was completed in December 1983, and in December 1983 she resumed operations out of San Diego.

&quot;Pintado&quot; returned to the Arctic Ocean in September 1984, operating under the polar ice cap until December 1984, in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine . On 12 November 1984, &quot;Pintado&quot; and &quot;Gurnard&quot; became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole.

From July 1985 to January 1986, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted her fifth operational deployment to the United States Seventh Fleet, in the Western Pacific. During this deployment, &quot;Pintado&quot; steamed over and conducted numerous fast-paced and highly successful operations. Following her return to San Diego, she completed repairs and alteration and celebrated the 15th anniversary of her commissioning. During the autumn of 1986, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted over 50 days of highly successful operations as the Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific ready nuclear-powered attack submarine.

&quot;Pintado&quot; surfaced at the North Pole, for the third time on 16 June 1987, during arduous Arctic operations extending from January to June 1987.

In January 1990 &quot;Pintado&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard, for a regular overhaul and refueling.

In January 1992, &quot;Pintado&quot;″s home port was changed to Pearl Harbor and became a member of Submarine Squadron 1.

From August 1992 through October 1992, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted her fourth Arctic operation, also marking her 1000th surfacing and dive on 23 August 1992. She surfaced at the North Pole for an unprecedented fourth time on 4 September 1992, and returned to Pearl Harbor, in November 1992, after circumnavigating North America, and steaming over .

In July 1993, &quot;Pintado&quot; made a six-month UNITAS deployment in company with several U.S. Navy surface units, circumnavigating South America while visiting numerous ports and working extensively in exercises with various South American navies.

From February 1996 through August 1996, &quot;Pintado&quot; conducted her sixth and final deployment to the Western Pacific. During this deployment &quot;Pintado&quot; participated in several exercises with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and the Republic of Korea Navy.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==
&quot;Pintado&quot; was decommissioned on 26 February 1998, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, in Bremerton, was completed on 27 October 1998.

<doc id="957883" wikidata="Q32728" url="?curid=957883" title="Wulai District">
<text>Wulai District (Atayal: Ulay; ) is a mountain indigenous district in southern New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. It sits near the border with Taipei and is famous for its hot springs. It is the largest district in New Taipei, as well as the most mountainous, and is home to the indigenous Atayal people.

==Name==
The name of the town derives from the Atayal phrase &quot;kilux ulay&quot; meaning &quot;hot and poisonous&quot; when an Atayal hunter hunting by a stream saw mist coming from it.

==History==
Formerly classified as an &quot;Aboriginal area&quot; under Taihoku Prefecture during Japanese rule, Wulai was organized as a rural township of Taipei County after the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945.

On June 22, 2001, President Chen Shui-bian visited a local school and hosted a graduation ceremony there.

On December 25, 2010, Taipei County was upgraded to the special municipality of New Taipei City and Wulai was upgraded to a district.

In August 2015, Wulai was devastated by Typhoon Soudelor, wiping out several hotels and destroying hot springs in the region. The course of the Nanshi River that passes through the district has since changed, with the riverbank eroded heavily by surging water. Heavy landslides were attributed to the overdevelopment of the mountain areas around the river which damaged the soil and watershed along the slope lands.

==Geography==
* Elevation: (average)
* Area: 
* Population: 6,300 people (March 2023)

==Administrative divisions==
Wulai District is divided into five urban villages:
* Zhongzhi/Jhongjhih (), Wulai (), Xiaoyi/Siaoyi (), Xinxian/Sinsian () and Fushan () Village.

==Tourist attractions==
Wulai is a tourist town most renowned for its hot springs, sightseeing, and aboriginal culture. Other activities include hiking, camping, swimming, fishing, and birdwatching. During the spring, visitors come see the cherry trees bloom. According to locals, bathing in the odorless hot springs can cure skin diseases (such as ringworm, eczema, and herpes).
* Fushan Botanical Garden
* Neidong National Forest Recreation Area
* Wulai Atayal Museum
* Wulai Forestry Life Museum
* Wulai Old Street
* Yun Hsien Resort
* Wulai Hot Spring – visitors often go to the numerous hot spring hotels, public baths, as well as the Nanshi River.
* Waterfalls – Several waterfalls exist in the Wulai gorge, but the largest is Wulai Waterfall.
* Wulai Gondola – the gondola takes visitors to the top of Wulai Waterfall, where it accesses the Yun Hsien Resort.
* Atayal aboriginal culture – many shops in Wulai specialize in aboriginal foods, arts, crafts, and clothing.

==Transportation==
===Road===
Wulai District is accessible by Xindian Bus from Xindian Station of Taipei Metro to Wulai Bus Terminus.

The 9A branch line of the Provincial Highway 9 passes through the district.

===Rail===
The district also has the Wulai Scenic Train, a converted mine train built during the Japanese era that takes visitors from downtown Wulai to the attractions at the base of Wulai Waterfall.

<text>Clan Kerr () is a Scottish clan whose origins lie in the Scottish Borders. During the Middle Ages, it was one of the prominent border reiver clans along the present-day Anglo-Scottish border and played an important role in the history of the Border country of Scotland.

==History==

===Origins of the clan===
The name Kerr is rendered in various forms such as Kerr, Ker, Kear, Carr, Karr, Carre, and Cares. Theories on the origin of the name vary; some arguing it stems from the &#x27; which refers to brushwood, low lying grassland, marsh or fen. Another variant is found on the west coast of Scotland, particularly on the Isle of Arran, taken from the Scottish &#x27;, meaning &quot;dusky&quot;, or Irish &quot;ceàrr&quot;, meaning left-handed. In some cases it is thought to come from the Welsh word &quot;cawr&quot;, meaning giant. Alternatively, it may derive from the Irish and Scottish &quot;cearr&quot;, meaning pointed spear.

The early Roxburghshire Kerrs had their origins in the 12th century Ayrshire bailiery of Cunninghame. During the reign of David I (1082–1153), Hugh de Morville, Lord High Constable of Scotland, granted lands in Cunninghame to the Norman family of William de Ker. These lands became known as Kersland. At this time, Cunninghame was under the control of de Morville who also maintained the nearby port of Irvine – one of Scotland&#x27;s earliest capitals – as his military headquarters.

Hugh de Morville hailed from the Normandy town of Morville. In an era when noble families defined themselves by their location of origin, it is conceivable that the roots of the family of William de Ker (William from Ker) lie in a town bearing the name of Ker. Though speculative, this could be the Normandy town of Criel, renamed Criel-sur-Mer in 1902. According to a publication from 1740: &quot;Ker veut dire une maison; &amp; je crois que le nom du bourg de Criel en est derivé...&quot; (&quot;Ker means a house; and I think that the name of the village of Criel is derived from it...&quot;)

William de Ker&#x27;s grandson is said to have been allied to Sir William Wallace in the struggle for Scottish independence: &quot;William Ker of Kersland joined Wallace in 1296. He and Stephen of Ireland are said to have been the only two of Wallace&#x27;s men who survived the battle of Elcho. Ker was the constant friend and companion of Wallace. In 1305, when Wallace was taken prisoner at Robroyston, William Ker only was with him. They were found both asleep, and Ker was unfortunately killed in the scuffle&quot;.

Family tradition asserts the Norman origin for the chiefs comes from two brothers, Ralph and Robert (also called John), who came to Roxburgh from Lancashire. It has never been confirmed who was the elder, although the senior branch of the family, the Kerrs of Ferniehurst claim descent from Ralph, while their rivals, the Kerrs of Cessford, descended from John.

Asked how to say his name, Admiral Mark Kerr told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; in 1935, &quot;In Scotland the name rhymes with &quot;care&quot;. Since many of the family have come to England the pronunciation in this country rhymes with &quot;car&quot;, which we have entirely submitted to.&quot; Another common pronunciation of Kerr, such as in the majority of the United States, is &quot;kur&quot;.

===15th and 16th century clan conflicts===
The two main branches of the Clan Kerr, the Kerrs of Ferniehurst and the Kerrs of Cessford, often feuded with each other. However, both Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst and Andrew Kerr of Cessford were made Wardens of the Middle Marches, the first in 1502 and the latter after the Battle of Flodden in 1513. After Flodden, some of the Liddesdale clans put themselves under the Kerr of Ferniehurst&#x27;s protection, but, in 1523, his castle was captured by an English force after a protracted defence.

The Clan Kerr feuded in particular with the Clan Scott. The feud began on 25 July 1526, when Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch launched an attack (the Battle of Melrose) to rescue the young James V of Scotland who was being held by the Douglas Earl of Angus at Darnick just west of Melrose, and in the ensuing fight Kerr of Cessford was killed. The Kerrs, however, took their time and, in 1552, they set upon Sir Walter Scott on Edinburgh High Street and killed him. The feud came to an end when Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst married Janet Scott who was the sister of the tenth Scott Laird of Buccleuch.

Mark Kerr had his lands of Newbattle and Prestongrange erected into the barony of Newbattle by a charter of 1591.

===17th century and Civil War===

In 1606, Mark Kerr was created Earl of Lothian. This title failed when his son died in 1624 without male issue. In 1621, Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst was created Lord Jedburgh.

The third peerage to come to the family was the earldom of Ancram, which was given to Sir Robert Kerr, a descendant of a younger son of Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst. In 1616, Sir Robert Ker of Cessford, by this time spelt his surname with a single &#x27;r&#x27;, was created Earl of Roxburghe. In 1631, Sir William Kerr, son of the Earl of Ancram, was granted a new earldom of Lothian in 1631. His son was Robert Kerr who was advanced to the rank of marquess and who also succeeded to the earldom of Ancram on the death of his uncle.

During the Scottish Civil War, Colonel Kerr supported the Covenanter commander, General David Leslie, Lord Newark, and took the Clan Mackenzie&#x27;s Redcastle, demolished it, and hanged the garrison.

===18th century and Jacobite risings===

Lord Mark Kerr, son of the Chief, Robert Kerr, 1st Marquis of Lothian, was a distinguished professional soldier and is reputed to have had a high sense of personal honour and a quick temper. He fought several duels throughout his military career but rose ultimately to the rank of general, and was appointed governor of Edinburgh Castle in 1745.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Clan Kerr supported the British government. At the Battle of Culloden in 1746, Lord Kerr&#x27;s great nephew, Lord Robert Kerr (son of William Kerr, 3rd Marquis of Lothian), who was Captain of the grenadiers in Barrell&#x27;s regiment, received the first charging Cameron on the point of his Spontoon, but a second cut him through the head to chin. He has the dubious distinction of being the only person of high rank killed on the government side. The eldest of the brothers, Mark, Lord Kerr, later the fourth Marquess of Lothian, commanded three squadrons of government cavalry at the Battle of Culloden and survived to serve under the Duke of Cumberland in France in 1758.

==Left-handedness==

The Kerrs have typically been associated with left-handedness, and some of their buildings, such as Ferniehirst Castle, supposedly have turnpike stairs explicitly designed with this in mind, though this is disputed. Andrew Ker (1471–1545), known as Dand, developed Ferniehirst into a formidable stronghold. Both Dand and his paternal grandfather, Andrew of Cessford, are believed to have been left-handed swordsmen. A left-handed mercenary warrior could command a higher fee for his services, and those who fought under the Ferniehirst and Cessford banners were encouraged to fight &quot;ker-handed&quot;.

There is an anecdotal link between the Kerrs and left-handedness. An article in the British Medical Journal around 1972 stated that about 30% of those with the surname Kerr were left-handed, compared to 11% as the world&#x27;s population. However, a 1993 study found no statistically significant increase in left-handedness among people with the family name Kerr or Carr.

==Castles==

Castles that have been owned by the Clan Kerr include among others:

*Ferniehirst Castle is about a mile south of Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. It is now an extended and altered tower house that incorporates work from the sixteenth century. The castle was first built in 1470 and the Kerr of Ferniehirst branch of the clan were made Wardens of the Middle Marches in 1502. The original entrance leads to a staircase known as the &#x27;Left-Handed Staircase&#x27; based on a story that Sir Andrew Kerr having returned from the Battle of Flodden in 1513, and who was left handed, had his followers trained to use their weapons with their left hands. The castle was sacked in 1523 by the English, but was recaptured in 1549 with French help, and the leader of the captured garrison was executed. In 1570, the castle was damaged in a raid when Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst, protector of Mary, Queen of Scots, hoped to have her released from imprisonment. In 1593, James VI of Scotland attacked the castle because of the help that the Kerrs had given to Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, whom the king had accused of witchcraft and treason. Between 1934 and 1984, the castle was leased by the Scottish Youth Hostel Association, apart from during World War II when it was used as an army billet. The Kerr Marquises of Lothian and Earls of Ancrum still own Ferniehirst Castle although they live in London. The castle is said to be haunted by a &quot;Green Lady&quot; and is open to the public in July.
*Newbattle Abbey or &quot;Newbattle Castle&quot; is a mile south-west of Dalkeith in Midlothian. After the Protestant Reformation the property was given to the Kerrs of Ferniehirst and they were made Lords of Newbattle in 1591, and Earls of Lothian in 1606. The feud between the Kerrs of Ferniehirst and the Kerrs of Cessford was ended in 1631, when William Kerr of Ferniehirst married Ann Kerr of Cessford and the family were made Marqueses of Lothian in 1701. Many of the Newbattle buildings were demolished but some were incorporated into a fortified dwelling for the family. It was remodeled down the centuries into a large mansion. The eleventh Marquis of Lothian gave the building to the nation and it is now an adult education college. The castle is said to be haunted with stories of a &quot;Grey Lady&quot;, said to be the spirit of a girl who was killed when she fell in love with a monk, as well as stories of spectral monks haunting the grounds.
*Cessford Castle, a massive L-plan castle and is now a ruin. The castle dates from the fifteenth century or earlier. It was surrounded by a curtain wall with a second wall and ditch beyond this. The castle was held by the Kerrs of Cessford who became rivals of the Kerrs of Ferniehirst.Sir Andrew Kerr of Cessford fought and survived the Battle of Flodden in 1513, but Cessford Castle was attacked by the English in 1519. It was besieged by the English four years later who reckoned it the third strongest fortress in Scotland. The castle was torched in 1543 and sacked by the English a year later. Sir Walter Kerr of Cessford was banished to France for being involved in the murder of Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch in 1552. The Kerrs of Cessford were made Earls in 1616 and then Dukes of Roxburghe in 1704. In about 1650, Cessford Castle was abandoned and the materials were used to build Floors Castle.
*Floors Castle is a massive castellated mansion that dates from 1721. It was designed by William Adam, but was remodeled by William Henry Playfair in the nineteenth century.

==Chief==
*Clan chief: Ralph William Francis Joseph Kerr, 14th Marquess of Lothian
*Arms: Quarterly, 1st &amp; 4th, Azure, the sun in his splendour Or (for the peerage of Lothian); 2nd &amp; 3rd, Gules, on a chevron Argent, three mullets of the field (Kerr)

== Crest ==
The family crest comprises the Latin motto &#x27;Sero Sed Serio&#x27; (late, but in earnest) with an image of the sun at its centre. The motto was adopted following the Battle of Ancrum Moor, in February 1545, which took place around 10 km from Ferniehirst Castle during the Rough Wooing. During four hundred years of cross-border invasions, feuding and lawlessness in the Scottish Borders, survival came to depend upon a shifting pattern of allegiances. On this occasion, the Kerrs, who were accomplished mounted troops, initially sided with the English forces. As the balance of the battle tipped in favour of the Scots, the Kerrs switched loyalties and turned their cavalry against the English, who had a low winter sun in their eyes, and drove them from the field. The Kerrs thus arriving late, but in earnest.

==Tartans==

<text>Ivan Brunetti (born October 3, 1967) is an Italian and American cartoonist and comics scholar based in Chicago.

==Career==
Noted for combining blackly humorous taboo-laden subject matter with simplified and exaggerated cartoon drawing styles, Brunetti was strongly influenced by Charles M. Schulz and &quot;Peanuts&quot;. His best known comic work is his largely autobiographical series &quot;Schizo&quot;, of which four issues appeared between 1994 and 2006, the first 3 of which have been collected as &quot;Misery Loves Comedy&quot;. &quot;Schizo&quot; #4 received the 2006 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Comic of the Year.

He has also produced two collections of gag cartoons, &quot;Haw!&quot; (2001) and &quot;Hee!&quot; (2005). He has worked as an illustrator, including cover designs for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since 2007. His early work includes also the strip &quot;Misery Loves Comedy&quot; which he created for the University of Chicago newspaper &quot;The Maroon&quot; while a student there. The strip bears no relation to the 2007 Fantagraphics Books collection of the same name, which collects the first three issues of &quot;Schizo&quot; in their entirety, along with additional material contributed to various other publications during the same time period.

In 2005, Brunetti curated &quot;The Cartoonist&#x27;s Eye,&quot; an exhibit of 75 artists&#x27; work, for the A+D Gallery of Columbia College Chicago. He then edited &quot;An Anthology of Graphic Fiction, Cartoons, and True Stories&quot; (2006, Yale University Press), which was declared a bestseller by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in January 2007. The second and final volume of the anthology was released in October 2008. Brunetti also illustrated the cover of comedian Patton Oswalt&#x27;s album, &quot;My Weakness Is Strong&quot;.

Brunetti&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice&quot; (2011, Yale University Press) won a 2012 Eisner Award. Also in 2012, Brunetti contributed to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;Cartoonists on the world we live in&quot; series.

His second nonfiction book, &quot;Aesthetics: A Memoir&quot;, appeared in 2013 to positive reviews.

He is currently on the faculty of Columbia College Chicago, where he teaches classes on comics, drawing and design.

<text>Cessford Castle is a large ruined mid-15th century L-plan castle near the village of Cessford, midway Jedburgh and Kelso, in the historic county of Roxburghshire, now a division of the Scottish Borders. The Castle is &quot;caput&quot; of the Barony of Cessford, and the principal stronghold of the Kers/Kerrs, notorious Border Reivers, many of whom served as Wardens of the Middle March.

==History==
Cessford was built around 1450 by Andrew Ker, an ancestor of Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe, and of the Dukes of Roxburghe. It is from this place that the Duke takes his subsidiary titles: Baron Ker of Cessford, and Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford. It is possible that the castle incorporates parts of an earlier structure. The fortalice was built on an L-plan, with a main keep with a wing of almost the same magnitude. With up to six storeys, two of which were barrel vaulted, and with walls up to thick, it was a formidable place of defence. The angle of the building was enclosed by a single-storey defensive gatehouse, and the whole was surrounded by a barmekin and defensive earthworks, a fact that is corroborated by the record of English troops having to use an escalade to gain access to the castle courtyard during the siege of 1523. The castle was besieged in 1523 by the Earl of Surrey who remarked: &quot;It might never have been taken had the assailed been able to go on defending&quot;. The castle was abandoned in 1650.

==Historical incidents==
After Berwick upon Tweed was captured by Richard, Duke of Gloucester in July 1482, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland burnt a number of places in the area. At the end of his campaign, on 22 August 1482 he knighted twenty of his soldiers at the &quot;mains of Sessford.&quot;

<text>Yuanlin (Hokkien POJ: &quot;Oân-lîm&quot;) is a county-administered city in eastern Changhua County, Taiwan. It is the second largest settlement in the county, after the county seat of Changhua City.

==History==
The land around Yuanlin was cleared of trees and bushes, and fitted for cultivation since the Yongzheng era of the Qing dynasty (1723–1735). It was well developed about the 16th year of the Qianlong era. At first, people cut down the surrounding forests to build their houses. Gradually, only the round woodland was left, and the town was named (), meaning &quot;the round woodland.&quot; Later the characters were changed to (Yuanlin). Yuanlin produces different kinds of fruits, and succade (fruit cooked in sugar syrup and encrusted with a sugar crystals) is one of its specialties.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Yuanlin was made the capital of the newly established Taichung County. In 1950, Changhua and Nantou were separated from the county to form new counties. Being in Changhua County, Yuanlin ceased becoming the capital of Taichung County, and the new capital of Taichung County was given to Fengyuan Township. On 8 August 2015, Yuanlin was upgraded from an urban township into a county-administered city after the qualifying population level for city status was revised downwards from 125,000 to 100,000 people.

==Geography==

Yuanlin is located on the eastern border of Changhua County, in central Taiwan. The city is bordered to the north by Dacun, to the east by Fenyuan and Nantou City (the only neighboring settlement outside Changhua County), to the south by Shetou, and to the west by Yongjing and Puxin.

==Demographics==
With a population of 122,763 as of March 2023, Yuanlin was the most populated township in Taiwan until it was upgraded into a county-administered city, and has a higher population than 10 of the 17 county-administered cities. The division between male and female residents is almost equal, with 60,510 male and 62,253 female registered inhabitants in 41,855 households. At the beginning of the Republic of China era on Taiwan, the first census in December 1946 showed a population of 37,999, with steady annual increases from then on. The number of inhabitants passed the 50,000 mark in 1953, and first exceeded 100,000 in 1979. Since 1995 the population has fluctuated only slightly, and remained between 124,000 and 128,000.

==Administrative divisions==
Lunya, Zhenxing, Lincuo, Chushui, Hushui, Dafeng, Zengxing, Fuzun, Xitung, Nantung, Zhongtung, Tungbei, Tunghe, Minsheng, Liming, Huilai, Zhongyang, Gouzao, Darao, Daming, Wannian, Zhongzheng, Renmei, Xinxing, Heping, Guangming, Zhongshan, Santiao, Zhongxiao, Renai, Sanhe, Sanqiao, Sanai, Sanxin, Sanduo, Sanyi, Xinsheng, Nanping, Nanxing, Yuantan and Dapu Village.

==Politics==
In the early 2010s two mayors of the town were convicted in separate corruption cases. July 2010 saw former mayor Tu Quanchong sentenced to 16 years in prison for soliciting NT$3.5 million in kickbacks from a major construction project dating back to his time in office. In April 2011 the then serving mayor, Wu Zongxian, was impeached on corruption charges similarly related to kickbacks from construction projects. Wu was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison, having been found guilty of exacting bribes in excess of NT$16 million from 81 different projects since 2005. Officials from the Control Yuan said the scope of Wu&#x27;s activities was &quot;unprecedented&quot; and that &quot;virtually no construction projects in the town were untainted by corruption&quot;.

==Transportation==

===Rail===

Yuanlin has a station on the Taiwan Railways Administration&#x27;s Western Line. A project is underway to redevelop the station in combination with converting the current at-grade line to an elevated line through the city, a plan designed to improve road traffic flow and promote investment. The elevation of the track will eliminate three level crossings and five underpasses, and the area currently comprising the station will be converted into a mixed-use development with commercial space, parking and green space. This redevelopment was scheduled to be completed in 2013 and has a budget of NT$4 billion.

===Road===

Bus stations in the city are Yuanlin Bus Station of Yuanlin Bus and Yuanlin Transfer Station. To travel outside Yuanlin by road, the Provincial Highway 76, an east-west elevated route, runs through the city and is the most efficient way to reach either of Taiwan&#x27;s major north-south freeways, the National 1 and the National 3.

<doc id="957896" wikidata="Q17148691" url="?curid=957896" title="Run Silent, Run Deep">
<text>Run Silent, Run Deep is a novel by Commander (later Captain) Edward L. Beach Jr. published in 1955 by Henry Holt &amp; Co. The story describes World War II submarine warfare in the Pacific Ocean, and deals with themes of vengeance, endurance, courage, loyalty and honor, and how these can be tested during wartime. The name refers to &quot;silent running&quot;, a submarine stealth tactic.

It was the first of Beach&#x27;s 13 books. He told an interviewer that writing, for the most part, came easily:

The novel was on &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; list for several months. The staff of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; included it on their list of 250 Outstanding Books of the Year. Beach served on submarines in the Pacific Ocean during the war, and this adds to the realism of the story. He composed two sequels to &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;: &quot;Dust on the Sea&quot; (1972), a third person narrative detailing later patrols of the &quot;Eel&quot;; and &quot;Cold is the Sea&quot; (1978), about the same protagonist&#x27;s later service on a nuclear-powered submarine in 1960.

&quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; proved to be the best-known of Beach&#x27;s novels. It was adapted to a 1958 movie of the same name starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.

==Plot==
The narrative is presented as the transcript of a Navy tape recording made by Commander Edward J. Richardson, recounting the events resulting in his receipt of the Medal of Honor. The prefatory note that purports to identify the text in this way says it was meant to be used in a war bond drive, but is unsuitable for that because Richardson &quot;failed to confine himself to pertinent elements of the broad strategy of the war, and devoted entirely too much time to personal trivia.&quot;

In the spring of 1941, Richardson takes command of a World War I &quot;S-16&quot;, a submarine retired in 1924, and soon is assigned Jim Bledsoe as his executive officer. They and their crew work at the Philadelphia Navy Yard to fit out their boat and commission her, and in August take her to New London, Connecticut, for training. There Richardson meets Bledsoe&#x27;s girlfriend, Laura Elwood. The three of them are together when they learn of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Though it took Richardson three years of submarine duty to qualify for command, the war and the prospect of many more submarines coming into service lead Richardson, against his better judgment, to recommend Bledsoe for command in late December, just after learning that Bledsoe and Laura plan to wed. 

Richardson is forced to withdraw his recommendation of Bledsoe when Jim shows immaturity and performs recklessly on his qualification for command, nearly sinking their boat. Bledsoe is resentful, and Laura despises Richardson for ruining Bledsoe&#x27;s chance for a command. Richardson and his crew, including Bledsoe, are soon assigned to a newly launched submarine, the USS &quot;Walrus&quot;, and take her to Pearl Harbor to destroy Japanese shipping in the Pacific Ocean. Laura and Jim marry just before the &quot;Walrus&quot; departs New London.

During their first war patrol in the &quot;Walrus&quot;, they encounter the Japanese destroyer &quot;Akikaze&quot;, skippered by Captain Tateo Nakame (nicknamed &quot;Bungo Pete&quot;), who is responsible for sinking a series of American submarines in the Bungo Suido, including the USS &quot;Nerka&quot;, commanded by Richardson&#x27;s longtime friend Stocker Kane. After several more war patrols, the &quot;Walrus&quot; is ordered to return to patrol Bungo Suido where Richardson is wounded in a night-time surface encounter with Bungo Pete. Bledsoe assumes command for the return to Pearl Harbor and Richardson is hospitalized upon arrival. Bledsoe fleets up to command &quot;Walrus&quot;, thanks in large part to Richardson&#x27;s personal endorsement to the commodore, who balks at Jim&#x27;s still comparative youth, and the earlier failed qualification for command exercise back at New London. Bledsoe takes &quot;Walrus&quot; to Australia for her next three war patrols. 

Bledsoe establishes a reputation as an aggressive skipper with an outstanding record for sinkings. Between patrols, Bledsoe has an extramarital affair at Pearl Harbor, causing Richardson anguish for Laura&#x27;s sake. After heavy drinking during a shore party, Bledsoe reveals to Richardson that he had only pretended to be a loyal friend and subordinate, grudgingly remaining as executive officer during their patrols together &quot;for the crew&#x27;s sake.&quot; However, Richardson&#x27;s conduct under enemy fire as skipper—and having now personally experienced the weight of command for himself—have finally persuaded him that he had been wrong in doubting Richardson all along. During its next patrol under Bledsoe, however, Bungo Pete makes the &quot;Walrus&quot; his seventh victim.

During his stint ashore, Richardson works on reliability problems with American torpedoes and receives another command, the new boat USS &quot;Eel&quot;. When the news of the loss of Bledsoe and the &quot;Walrus&quot; arrives, Richardson convinces his superiors to let him hunt Bungo Pete in the &quot;Eel&quot;. A great battle ensues in a raging storm between the &quot;Eel&quot;, fighting on the surface, and Bungo Pete&#x27;s special anti-submarine warfare group, which consists of a Q-ship, a Japanese submarine, and the &quot;Akikaze&quot;. After Richardson sinks all three vessels, he discovers three lifeboats in the vicinity: Realizing that Bungo Pete and his skilled specialists will be rescued to resume hunting U.S. vessels, he intentionally rams the lifeboats.

Soon after, the &quot;Eel&quot; is detailed to lifeguard duty off Guam, where Richardson saves three aviators, earning him the Medal of Honor. After the war he returns home, hoping to begin a relationship with Laura Bledsoe.

<text>Hesher is an extended play and the first release by Canadian rock band Nickelback.

All the songs were written and performed by Nickelback, the first songs lead singer Chad Kroeger wrote for the band. It was recorded in Vancouver and released March 10, 1996. Supposedly, the name came from a friend of the band who would frequently say &quot;Hey sure&quot;. After selling more than 1,000 copies, the band stopped production of the EP, and it is now a sought-after collector&#x27;s item. Chad Kroeger has often expressed his dislike of &quot;Hesher&quot; and has even described it as &quot;terrible,&quot; however he did once claim in a 2009 interview that the track &quot;Fly&quot; is &quot;pretty good.&quot;

Vancouver radio station CFOX-FM drew professional interest to the EP when it played &quot;Fly&quot; once a day. 

&quot;Hesher&quot; was the first of only two releases from the band to feature Chad and Mike Kroeger&#x27;s cousin Brandon Kroeger as the drummer, the other being their 1996 debut studio album &quot;Curb&quot;. Four of the seven songs on &quot;Hesher&quot; were later placed on &quot;Curb&quot;; &quot;Where?&quot; and &quot;Left&quot; were re-recorded entirely, while the original versions of &quot;Windowshopper&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot; were re-mixed and re-mastered significantly for the debut. &quot;Windowshopper&quot; was renamed &quot;Window Shopper&quot; on &quot;Curb&quot;.

== Recording ==
Chad Kroeger asked his step-father to give him $4,000 so that the band could record the EP.
The band spent half the money to record the EP, and spent the other half on magic mushrooms.

== Track listing ==

<doc id="957901" wikidata="Q647340" url="?curid=957901" title="Line 5 (Beijing Subway)">
<text>Line 5 of the Beijing Subway () is Beijing&#x27;s only subway line with an entirely north-south route. Line 5&#x27;s color is maroon. It entered into operation on October 7, 2007. It runs for in a near straight line through the city center (just approximately east of the Forbidden City at Dongdan) from in Changping District to in Fengtai District. Though Line 4 and Line 8 also broadly follow north-south routes (and so, in part, do Lines 14 and 13), Line 5 remains the only line to follow an almost entirely straight north-south course. Line 5 is also notable for including three stations in the densely populated northern suburb of Tiantongyuan, as well as providing convenient access to the Temple of Earth and Temple of Heaven. Since Line 5 connects with Line 1, Line 2 (twice), Line 6, Line 7, Line 10 (twice), Line 13, Line 14 and Line 15, and also links densely populated suburbs directly to the city center, it tends to experience very crowded conditions during rush hour and even very late into the evening. Over 1 million passengers use the line every weekday in 2019. 
==Hours of operation==
The first south-bound trains departs from Tiantongyuan North at 4:59am. The first north-bound train departs from Songjiazhuang at 5:19am. The last south-bound train leaves Tiantongyuan North at 10:47pm. The last north-bound train leaves Songjiazhuang at 11:10pm. For the official timetable, see the reference.

==Route==

Line 5 runs in a North-South direction, beginning with three stations in the northern suburb of Tiantongyuan in Changping District, about outside the 5th Ring Road. Then, it enters Chaoyang District and connects to Line 13 at . At , it connects with Line 15. At , it links up with Line 10 Loop. Further south, it passes immediately to the east of the Temple of Earth and meets the Line 2 Loop at . Then Line 5 cuts through the old areas of Dongcheng District. It connects with the East-West Line 6 at , and the old foreign Legation Quarter between and . Further south, Line 5 stops at , connects with the East-West Line 7, as well as (connects with Line 14) and eventually reaches and Line 10 again, in Fengtai District.

==Stations (North to South)==
●: stop

===Technology===
Line 5 was the first subway line in Beijing to feature platform screen doors in underground stations and automatic platform gates in elevated stations that prevent riders from falling onto the tracks. Line 5 stations also have LCD screens that display the wait times for the next train. Line 5 trains have digital voice announcements (in Mandarin and English) and LCD passenger information displays.
==History==

<text>A wrinkle ridge is a type of feature commonly found on lunar maria, or basalt plains. These features are low, sinuous ridges formed on the mare surface that can extend for up to several hundred kilometers. Wrinkle ridges are tectonic features created after the lava cooled and solidified. They frequently outline ring structures buried within the mare, follow circular patterns outlining the mare, or intersect protruding peaks. They are sometimes called &quot;veins&quot; due to their resemblance to the veins that protrude from beneath the skin. 

Wrinkle ridges are named with the Latin designation &quot;dorsum&quot; (plural &quot;dorsa&quot;). The standard IAU nomenclature uses the names of people (generally scientists) to identify wrinkle ridges on the Moon. For example, the Dorsa Burnet are named for Thomas Burnet, and the Dorsum Owen is named after George Owen of Henllys.

Wrinkle ridges can also be found on Mars, for example in Chryse Planitia, on several of the asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft, on Mercury, and certain moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Although several hypotheses have been advanced as causes of wrinkle ridges, today they are generally considered to be of tectonic origin. They involve folding and faulting. If correctly interpreted as thrust faults, where a rupture occurs and one side of the rupture is pushed on top of the other, they are evidence of compressional stress in planetary crust.

<doc id="957908" wikidata="Q260752" url="?curid=957908" title="Jeanna Fine">
<text>Jeanna Fine (born September 29, 1964) is an American former pornographic actress and erotic dancer.

== Career ==
Adult film actress Barbara Dare remarked how &quot;fine&quot; Jeanna was, which prompted Jeanna to adopt that as her surname. She was romantically involved with fellow pornographic actress Savannah.

Fine began in the adult movie industry as a blonde-haired punk-girl when she was 21 in 1985. She made fifty movies between 1986 and 1989. She re-emerged as black-haired in 1990. According to Fine&#x27;s official adult film bio, Fine&#x27;s adult film career was noted to have several large gaps between performing, such as during the pregnancy and birth of her son.

According to her IAFD page, Fine made her last non-compilation film in 2002.

Fine was inducted in the AVN Hall of Fame in 1997. She is also in the X-Rated Critic&#x27;s Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Fine appeared briefly in the film &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;, as a dancer working the adult parlor where an attack was made on a mafia character played by fellow adult star Ron Jeremy.

== Personal life ==
Fine became involved in a long-term relationship with fellow pornographic actress Savannah, who claimed to have fallen deeply in love with Fine. In a 1999 interview following the airing of the E! &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot; about Savannah&#x27;s life and death, Fine commented, &quot;We had an ongoing, on-again, off-again, volatile, loving relationship. At that time I was having a lot of problems myself. Between [male porn actor] Sikki Nixx and Savannah pushing and pulling, I pretty much at one point ran away from them both. I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer. But I feel I left her behind when she needed me most. It&#x27;s very sad.&quot; Their relationship has been described as troubled due to the two women&#x27;s heroin addiction.

<doc id="957909" wikidata="Q1039452" url="?curid=957909" title="Batong line">
<text>The Batong Line of the Beijing Subway () is an east–west rapid transit line in eastern Beijing. It extends Line 1 further east from in Chaoyang District to in Tongzhou District. Through operation with Line 1 started on August 29, 2021.

The Batong Line derives its name by combining the first character of Bawangfen (), another name for Sihui, and Tongzhou (), the eastern suburban district of Beijing which the line serves.

The Batong Line is mainly above ground with only section is underground and runs from in the west to in the east. The color of the Batong Line that is shown on maps, like that of Line 1, is dark red.

The line tends to be very crowded during rush hour. To alleviate this headways were reduced and express services were introduced during rush hour in early 2020. However, these express services were removed with the start of through operation with Line 1 in mid 2021.

==Hours of operation==
The first east-bound train departs Sihui at 6:00am. The first west-bound train departs Huazhuang at 5:16am. The last east-bound train leaves Sihui at 11:40pm. The last west-bound train leaves Huazhuang at 10:56pm.

==Route==
The Batong Line follows the Beijing-Tongzhou Expressway eastward from Sihui to Guǎnzhuang. Between Gaobeidian and Guǎnzhuang, the Batong Line and its stations are built into the highway&#x27;s median. At Bali Qiao, the Batong Line turns to the southeast and follows the Jingtang Road to Tu Qiao, which is located just inside the Tuqiao Bridge exit on the eastern 6th Ring Road. From there, the line turns and follows the 6th Ring Road south and west to and .

==Stations (from West to East)==
Station list for Line 1 and Batong line of Beijing Subway, after the through operation started on August 29, 2021.&lt;br&gt;
==Rolling stock==
The line uses 6-car Type B rolling stock.

===Former===
==History==
===Phase 1===
Construction of the Batong Line began on December 28, 2001, and the line opened on December 27, 2003.

In 2012, traffic on Batong Line was relieved by the opening of the parallel Line 6, with a 12.14% decrease in daily ridership and a 10–20% reduction in flow during rush hour. However, during peak hours sections the line still operates above 100% capacity.

===Southern extension (Phase 2)===
There are 2 stations on the southern extension: station and station (both are transfer stations with the eastern extension of Line 7). The extension is 4.5 km in length, including 3.8 km underground section. station was opened on December 28, 2019. station opened on August 26, 2021.

===Opening timeline===
===Through operations with Line 1===

In 2010, a CPPCC member Chen Dingwang, proposed that services on Line 1 and the Batong Line should directly link, with through operations, reducing travel times and removing the unnecessary forced transfers at or . However, the Beijing Subway responded that Line 1&#x27;s and Batong&#x27;s signal systems are completely different, so through-operation will be more difficult to achieve from an engineering standpoint. As of 2016, preliminary design and feasibility studies are underway to allow for through operations between Line 1 and Batong. On June 12, 2020, the project of the through operation of Line 1 and Batong line was approved by Beijing Development and Reform Commission. Through operation with Line 1 started on 29 August 2021.

<doc id="957910" wikidata="Q419736" url="?curid=957910" title="Acclamation">
<text>An acclamation is a form of election that does not use a ballot. It derives from the ancient Roman word &quot;acclamatio&quot;, a kind of ritual greeting and expression of approval towards imperial officials in certain social contexts.

==Voting==
===Voice vote===
The most frequent type of acclamation is a voice vote, in which the voting group is asked who favors and who opposes the proposed candidate. In the event of a lack of opposition, the candidate is considered elected. In parliamentary procedure, acclamation is a form of unanimous consent.

This form of election is most commonly associated with papal elections (see Acclamation in papal elections), though this method was discontinued by Pope John Paul II&#x27;s apostolic constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;. It is also sometimes found in the context of parliamentary decisions, or United States presidential nominating conventions (where it is often used to nominate the running mate and incumbent Presidents).

===Uncontested election===

In Canada, a candidate for a parliamentary, legislative or municipal position is said to be elected by acclamation if he or she has no opponents for the seat, an eventuality that rarely occurs federally, but is more common in legislative elections in the northern territories and municipal elections.

The last instance of an acclamation in an election to the House of Commons of Canada was in 1957, when George Doucett was acclaimed in a by-election following the death of his predecessor William Gourlay Blair. Just two months before, Chesley William Carter had been the last person to be acclaimed in a general election. In the Northwest Territories riding of Inuvik Boot Lake, Floyd Roland was returned by acclamation in two consecutive elections, in 2003 and 2007.

==In ancient Rome==
Acclamations were ritual verbal expressions of approval and benediction in public (like gladiatorial games) and private life. The departure and return of imperial magistrates was, for example, accompanied by acclamation. In the later Roman Empire, expressions of goodwill were reserved for the emperor and certain relatives, who were greeted in this manner during public appearances on special occasions such as their birthdays. By the 4th century AD, acclamations were compulsory for high-level imperial officials.

<text>In time series modeling, a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) is a nonlinear autoregressive model which has exogenous inputs. This means that the model relates the current value of a time series to both:
* past values of the same series; and
* current and past values of the driving (exogenous) series — that is, of the externally determined series that influences the series of interest.
In addition, the model contains an error term which relates to the fact that knowledge of other terms will not enable the current value of the time series to be predicted exactly.

Such a model can be stated algebraically as

: formula_1

Here &quot;y&quot; is the variable of interest, and &quot;u&quot; is the externally determined variable. In this scheme, information about &quot;u&quot; helps predict &quot;y&quot;, as do previous values of &quot;y&quot; itself. Here &quot;ε&quot; is the error term (sometimes called noise). For example, &quot;y&quot; may be air temperature at noon, and &quot;u&quot; may be the day of the year (day-number within year).

The function &quot;F&quot; is some nonlinear function, such as a polynomial. &quot;F&quot; can be a neural network, a wavelet network, a sigmoid network and so on. To test for non-linearity in a time series, the BDS test (Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman test) developed for econometrics can be used.

<text>Tequila Sunrise is a 1988 American romantic crime film written and directed by Robert Towne, and starring Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell, with Raul Julia, J. T. Walsh, Arliss Howard and Gabriel Damon in supporting roles. The film&#x27;s original music score was composed by Dave Grusin.

The film was the second (after &quot;Personal Best&quot;) to be both written and directed by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Towne. It was commercially successful, grossing over $100 million at the box office worldwide, but its critical reception was mixed. One period reviewer was of the opinion that, &quot;perhaps because the elements were so irresistible—Robert Towne directing Gibson, Russell and Pfeiffer in a California crime film—an aura of disappointment settled over &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, no matter how engaging, and profitable, it turned out to be.&quot;

&quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film&#x27;s soundtrack spawned the single &quot;Surrender to Me&quot;, performed by Ann Wilson (lead singer of Heart) and Robin Zander (lead singer of Cheap Trick), reaching number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1989.

==Plot==
Former drug dealer Dale &quot;Mac&quot; McKussic is trying to go straight. His close friend Nick Frescia is a Detective Lieutenant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department who, in spite of their long-term relationship going back to high school, is duty-bound to bring Mac to justice if he should sell drugs again, as DEA Agent Hal Maguire believes to be the case.

Mac is attracted to restaurant owner Jo Ann Vallenari. Nick becomes acquainted with her while attempting to learn more about Mac&#x27;s activities, in particular his relationship with the Mexican drug kingpin Carlos, who the DEA agents and Mexican federal police commandante&#x27; Escalante believe is coming to town. Mac has a legitimate business and is raising a son, trying to distance himself from his old life. However, he tries to help his lawyer sell some cocaine and feels indebted to his old friend Carlos, who is pressuring him to do one last job.

Jo Ann succumbs to Nick&#x27;s charms and a love affair begins. During a meeting at Jo Ann&#x27;s restaurant with Maguire and Escalante to discuss Mac and Carlos, Escalante gives Nick a pistol as a gesture of good faith. Jo Ann accuses Nick of using her to gather information on Mac, who often eats at her restaurant and hired her to cater his son&#x27;s birthday party.

Nick admits he is investigating Mac and originally approached her because of that. But he truthfully has fallen in love with her. Jo Ann ends her relationship with Nick for his initial deception after catching him trying to listen in on a private telephone conversation. Meanwhile, Maguire and his associates set a trap for Mac and the mysterious Carlos, whose face no one but Mac has ever seen.

Jo Ann eventually realizes Mac is in love with her and she has fallen for him. Nick figures out that Mac&#x27;s cousin Gregg is an informer for the DEA and Maguire has become dangerously obsessed with catching Mac. Mac and Jo Ann make love at his house.

At Jo Ann&#x27;s restaurant, Nick meets her, gives her a pistol (the one Escalante previously gave him) for protection, and tells her to stay there until a deputy sheriff arrives to guard her, because Carlos is expected to arrive at Mac&#x27;s home later that night. Ignoring Nick&#x27;s warning, she returns to Mac&#x27;s house and discovers that Escalante is, in fact, Carlos.

Carlos relieves her of Nick&#x27;s pistol, recognizing it, and takes her to his yacht at the marina. He knows Gregg is the informer and has him killed, leaving his body next to a shipment of gasoline-contaminated cocaine. Maguire and Nick find Gregg&#x27;s body and the cocaine at the beach.

Carlos meets with Mac on his yacht, pressuring him to agree to kill Jo Ann, who now knows too much. He refuses, threatens Carlos at gunpoint and gets Jo Ann to safety on a speedboat. Mac nevertheless promises him that he will be at the rendezvous site as arranged to conclude their business.

Nick explains to Maguire that Escalante is actually Carlos and heads for the marina. Mac arrives first and is double-crossed by Carlos. In the ensuing fight, they struggle over the pistol, which fatally discharges, killing Carlos and wounding Mac in the process.

Maguire shows up and begins shooting, hitting an already dead Carlos in the face, and then at Mac as he is raising his hands to surrender. The gunfire causes the boat&#x27;s fuel tank to catch fire, just as Mac jumps in the water. Nick arrives at the marina. Hearing the gunfire, he draws his weapon and orders Maguire to cease fire. He continues shooting, forcing Nick to kill him. The fire causes the boat to explode, and with it the millions of dollars on board.

Nick later asks Jo Ann to meet him at the beach. She arrives to instead find Mac and runs to embrace him. A pleased Nick watches from a distance.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Filming===
&quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; was filmed on location at Manhattan Beach, California.

Before filming commenced, actors attached to the lead male roles included Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, Nick Nolte, and Jeff Bridges.

The expensive menswear and slicked-back hair sported by Kurt Russell&#x27;s character, Detective Lieutenant Nick Frescia, was modelled upon Pat Riley. Russell remarked that &quot;Riley&#x27;s look was right for this film because he was arrogantly confident but not offensive. It&#x27;s very tough to do that.&quot;

The famous love scene between Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer takes place in a hot tub, that was reportedly not properly constructed or chlorinated, resulting in skin rashes and splinters for the actors and their body doubles, and causing production to halt for a few days.

Director Robert Towne wanted the Gibson character to go up in smoke at the end of the film, but one of the conditions Warner Bros. set was that he must live. He &quot;was supposed to be a moth in the flame&quot;, said Towne in 1998. &quot;The real high for him was never doing the drugs, but the danger of dealing the drugs.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; holds a score of 53% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews, and a score of 62 on Metacritic, indicating mixed reviews. It was a commercial success, grossing over $105 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million.

Critics commented both positively and negatively upon the labyrinthine nature of the complex plot, characteristic of earlier Robert Towne screenplays such as &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; weaves a tangled web, and there are times when we are not sure what is happening, or why. There are even moments when the chronology itself seems confused, when characters seem to know things they could not be aware of, when other characters arrive at places they should not have known about.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the fuzzy focus of someone who has stared too long at a light bulb. Narrative points aren&#x27;t made and the wrong points are emphasized.&quot; However, &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote that the &quot;set-up has the precision of fine needlepoint, picking out the plot outline before embroidering it with a complex pattern of interwoven relationships.&quot;

Pfeiffer was described as a &quot;stunning presence&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while &quot;Time Out&quot; thought her &quot;perfect as the immaculately dressed and icily controlled restaurateur caught between Gibson&#x27;s honest (ex-)criminal and Russell&#x27;s ambiguously motivated cop.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised each of the lead performances—&quot;Gibson projects control skating atop paranoia, and is appealing as a man you&#x27;d want to trust. Russell is fine as the slick cop who&#x27;s confused by his own shifting values, and Pfeiffer achieves a rather touching quality with her gun-shy girl beneath the polished professional&quot;—but concluded there was &quot;not much kick in this cocktail, despite its mix of quality ingredients.&quot;

===Accolades===
Conrad Hall was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and won an American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases.

Gabriel Damon was nominated for a Young Artist Award in the category of Best Young Actor Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.

Moreover, football is the sport that interests the majority of Spanish people (48%) and a total of 67% of the population said they were fans of or had a liking for a particular club.

In a survey of the sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010, football was ranked as the second most popular recreational sport practiced by the population (17.9%). 75.9% said they had purchased tickets to a football match. In addition, 67.3% of the people said they saw all, almost all, many, or some of the football matches broadcast on television. In another survey undertaken in 2014, football practice decreased to 14% of the population, being overtaken by other sports such as running, cycling, and swimming for recreation. However, in this survey, football was still the sport that interested the most of Spain&#x27;s people (48%). 67% of the population said they were fans of or sympathized with a particular club. In addition, 74.9% said they watched, whenever possible, the matches broadcast on television regarding their favourite teams, and 42.4% had flags, badges, or objects of their favourite teams. Data from this survey confirmed the widespread impression that most of Spain&#x27;s people are supporters of Real Madrid (32.4%) or FC Barcelona (24.7%), and the other teams have fewer supporters nationwide, such as Atlético de Madrid (16.1%), Valencia CF (3.5%), Athletic Bilbao (3.3%), or Sevilla FC (3.2%).

A relationship between football, politics, intercultural relations, identity, and attitudes toward regionalism in Spain has also been reported.

The Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish: Real Federación Española de Fútbol) – the country&#x27;s national football governing body – organizes two Cup competitions: the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de España. The &quot;Liga de Fútbol Profesional&quot; (LFP) (English: Professional Football League), integrated by a total of 42 football clubs, forms part of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) but has autonomy in its organization and functioning. It is responsible for organising state football leagues in coordination with RFEF.

The Spain national football team once won the FIFA World Cup and succeeded in the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic tournament. The biggest success achieved by the national team was the historic treble of winning tournaments in a row: the 

UEFA European Championship in 2008, the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and the UEFA European Championship in 2012. They also won the UEFA European Championship in 1964 and in 2024. The Spain women&#x27;s national football team became world champions following their victory in the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, therefore making Spain only the second nation after Germany to win both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s senior World Cup. In all categories, Spain&#x27;s men&#x27;s national teams have won 27 titles in FIFA, UEFA, and Olympic tournaments within the European continent and beyond. In qualifying for the UEFA championships, the team ranked highest in the number of shots (227) and possession (70%) and completed with the highest pass percentage (91%) out of all qualifying teams. The team was also the first to retain the Henri Delaunay trophy.

The First Division of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional – commonly known in the English-speaking world as La Liga – is one of the strongest football leagues in both Europe and the world. At the club level, Spanish football clubs have won a total of 66 international tournaments. They are the most successful in different current European competitions, such as UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and UEFA Europa League; and were also the most successful in the extinct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

During its most successful time, Tiki-taka was the characteristic football style of play developed by the Spain national football team (and at the club level, by FC Barcelona). This football style is characterized by possessing the ball for large portions of the game and moving the ball quickly from one player to the next, with short and quick passes, keeping the ball away from the opponent, and then delivering an incisive pass to score a goal.

Professional football in Spain is a sociocultural event that significantly contributes to the Spanish economy in terms of demand and supply. In economic terms, during 2013, professional football generated more than €7.6 billion, including direct, indirect, and induced effects, representing 0.75% of the Spanish GDP. Moreover, due to the financial crisis in the last few years, many Spanish football clubs in the top two divisions have been facing severe economic troubles due to paying bank debts. In addition, the European Union authorities have warned the Spanish authorities to halt public funding of debt-ridden clubs.

Spain&#x27;s national futsal team is one of the strongest teams in the world, being six times champion in the UEFA Futsal Championship and two times champion in the FIFA Futsal World Championship.

==History==
===19th century===
Modern football was introduced to Spain in the late 19th century by a combination of mostly British immigrant workers, visiting sailors, and Spanish students returning from Britain. In the late 1870s, various English workers scattered throughout the peninsula began to establish informal groups that were dedicated to different recreational practices, especially cricket and football, particularly in Spanish ports of Vigo, Andalusia, Huelva, Seville, and Bilbao.
The first kick to a football ball on Spanish soil occurred in 1873 in either Huelva or Vigo. The investigations about which one was the dean of football in Spain remained inconclusive and open to debate by historians. That year, in Huelva, British workers of the Rio Tinto Company Limited (RTCL) began to arrive at the Minas de Ríotinto after the company won a concession to exploit the copper mines of Rio Tinto. The Englishmen who worked in the mines gathered to play their favourite sports, like cricket, rugby, and football. Meanwhile, in Vigo, a group of British workers for the Eastern Telegraph Company arrived there from Porthcurno, a small isolated town in the far west of England, thus earning the nickname &quot;Exiles&quot;. These two colonies gave birth to the first Spanish football teams: Exiles Foot-Ball Club (1876) and Río Tinto Foot-Ball Club (1878). These teams were never officially established, so there is no legal record of their existence. The first legally established Spanish football club was the Cricket and Football Club of Madrid, founded in October 1879 under the protection of King Alfonso XII, who was named the Honorary President of the club. Together with Exiles FC and Rio Tinto FC, it was one of the three proto-clubs that pioneered and expanded football in Spain. Even though the Madrid team disappeared a few years later, Exiles FC and Rio Tinto FC lasted decades and played a pivotal role in the amateur beginnings of football in Spain.

Rio Tinto FC catalyzed the (&#x27;Ball Game Society&#x27;) in 1884, which organized football games and other typical British sports. These meetings were initially contested between the club&#x27;s members and later against crews of English ships that docked in the port of Huelva. The earliest known example of this dates to March 1888, when the club played football and cricket matches against the mariners of a merchant ship called &quot;Jane Cory&quot;. This society developed into the oldest official football club in Spain, Recreativo de Huelva, founded in December 1889 by two Scottish doctors of the Rio Tinto Company, Alexander Mackay and Robert Russell Ross. Exiles FC lasted until the early 1910s; the club had good relations with the first football clubs to emerge in the city, and collaborated with them by providing knowledge, players, coaches, and even sharing its field, &quot;El Relleno&quot;.

After Recreativo de Huelva, Sevilla FC is the next-oldest club in Spain, having been founded on 25 January 1890, by Isaias White and the then British vice-consul of Seville, Edward Farquharson Johnston, who became the club&#x27;s first president. Unlike previous clubs, Sevilla FC was solely devoted to football, leading it to be considered Spain&#x27;s first football club. The first official football match in Spain was contested between Sevilla FC and Recreativo de Huelva in Seville on 8 March 1890, at an abandoned mine near Calle Sanz. There were two Spanish players on each team; all other players were British, mostly Scottish, including Sevilla&#x27;s captain Hugh MacColl. Sevilla FC won .

Football was introduced in the Basque Country by two distinct groups, both with British connections: British shipyard workers and Basque students returning from schooling in Britain. The British employees of the Nervión Shipyards, located in Sestao (Vizcaya), organized and played the first known football match in the region, which was held on 4 April 1890, between the &quot;Machinery Department&quot; (engineers) and the Shipyard Workers. This group of football pioneers were part of a multi-sports club called &quot;Club Atleta&quot;, which had been founded in late 1889. In November 1892, the president of &quot;Club Atleta&quot;, Enrique Jones Bird, successfully asked for permission to play in the Hippodrome of Lamiako, which thus became the new home of organized football in the Basque Country. It was from Lamiako that the sport of football took off in Bilbao, with several Bilbainos swarming the field to watch the teams of British workers challenge each other every weekend, and eventually, the local citizens themselves decided to challenge a British team in 1894, which ended in a 6–0 win for the British. The result, however, did not discourage the enthusiastic locals who were quick to play another match and soon the sport gained followers among the young students of the Gymnasium Zamacois, and in 1898, a group of seven students of that gym led by Juan Astorquia founded the first Basque football club: Athletic Club. This early British influence was reflected in the use of English names such as Recreation Club, Athletic Club, and Football Club. Although Athletic was founded in 1898, the club was not officially established until the historic meeting in Café García on 5 September 1901, where the club&#x27;s first board was elected.
In the late 19th century, Catalonia enjoyed the country&#x27;s most developed industry, largely thanks to its cotton industry. For this reason, Barcelona was home to a group of British immigrants. The first known football match in the city was held on the grounds near the Hippodrome of Can Tunis in late 1892. Very little is known about that meeting, only that it was the work of members of the Club Regatas de Barcelona (a club of rowing and sailing) and cricket players of the British Club de Barcelona located on Rambla dels Capuchins. James Reeves, the spokesman of the British members of Club Regatas, convinced some members of the two clubs to practice football, thus forming a society known as the Barcelona Football Club. This group of football pioneers in the city played several matches in the 1892–93 season, most of which were training matches between the Blue and Red teams. The last game of the season on 12 March 1893 was the subject of the first proper chronicle of a football match in Spain, appearing in &quot;La Dinastía&quot;. The photograph of the two sides before the game is regarded as Spain&#x27;s oldest image of a football team. However, Palamós FC was the first official and registered Catalan football club in 1898. The Swiss Hans Gamper founded FC Barcelona on 29 November 1899. Other clubs founded in 1900 – such as Escocès FC (previously Sant Andreu), Hispania AC (previously Team Rojo), University SC, FC Internacional, and Irish Football Club – competed for local support in the first competitions, including the first-ever tournament held in Spain, the Copa Macaya.

In Madrid, the first games were promoted by Institución Libre de Enseñanza (ILE; &#x27;Free Educational Institution&#x27;), an educational and cultural centre. The first official and registered football club in Madrid was Football Club Sky, founded in 1897. A conflict between its members caused the club to split in two in 1900. Then, several clubs also emerged in Madrid, most notably Madrid Football Club, officially established in March 1902 by Catalan brothers Juan and Carlos Padrós.

The rapid growth of football enthusiasts and entities led to the creation of the first football associations in charge of its regulation. The first football association founded in Spain was the Catalan Football Federation (Catalan: ), established in Catalonia on 11 November 1900, as the Football Association of Catalonia (Catalan: ). With the first associations also came the first competitions and tournaments, such as the Copa Macaya on 6 January 1901, which was organized on the initiative of Alfonso Macaya: the then honorary president of Hispania AC, who went on to win the first edition of the competition, thus becoming the very first Spanish club to win an official title. Copa Macaya was the first tournament ever played in Spain and all Iberian Peninsula and was the predecessor of the Catalan football championship (Catalan: &quot;Campionat de Catalunya&quot;). The Copa Macaya is recognized as the first Catalan championship. The Catalan Championship emerged just a few days after the Campeonato de Madrid, whose first edition was won by Moderno FC.

The poorly organized sport still found many detractors that hindered further expansion because it was considered dangerous in its early years. In 1902 the first national championship played in Spain was organized, the Copa de la Coronación, by the recently established Madrid Football Federation, which was the catalyst for the current Copa del Rey due to its success.

===20th century===

The Copa del Rey (English: King&#x27;s Cup) competition was founded in 1903, one year after a previous football tournament named Coronation Cup. It was Spain&#x27;s national football Championship from 1903 until the establishment of the League Championship in 1928.
The Spanish Federation of Football Clubs was formed in 1909. However, there were discrepancies between the member clubs years later, and some of the clubs formed another association called the Royal Spanish Union of Clubs of Football. Finally, the two associations reached an agreement, and the Royal Spanish Football Federation was founded in 1913, which allowed Spanish football to enter FIFA. In these years, Athletic was the most dominant club in the country, and the first idols in Spain began to appear, like Pichichi and Paulino Alcántara.

The Spain national team was created in 1920 during the dispute of the Olympic Games in Antwerp. The success of the Spanish national team in the Olympic Games, which won the silver medal, was huge in the development of football as a mass social event in Spain. The interest in football grew, more people attended stadiums, more football information appeared in the newspapers, and football was used as an element of national prestige and political propaganda.

After the Olympic triumph, football experienced a popularity boost among Spanish fans, and as a result, stadium attendance increased, and the pressure of professionalism grew. Spanish football eventually turned professional in 1925. An agreement between several clubs was made on November 23, 1928, officially establishing Spain&#x27;s national football division and the birth of the Spanish League. The first league championship began in 1929.

The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) disrupted national competitions. Although the Spanish League was suspended, the Catalan and Valencian clubs continued contesting the Mediterranean League in early 1937. Barcelona later toured Mexico and the United States, supporting the Spanish Republic.

The Spanish League and the Cup were restored in the 1939–40 season after the Civil War had ended. Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime, a fascist political system, began to use football as a propaganda tool for the new regime. In 1941, as part of his policy of eradicating regional identities, the Franco regime banned using non-Castilian names. As a result, many clubs that had chosen English prefixes previously, such as Athletic or Football clubs, had to amend their initial names for other Castilian (such as Atlético or Club de Fútbol). The Catalan Championship was banned, and the Catalan shield was taken from FC Barcelona&#x27;s badge. Spanish football began to rebuild slowly after the War, but Spain&#x27;s isolated international position meant they did not properly re-enter International football until 1950. Later, Franco&#x27;s regime could use football, based on the European triumphs of Real Madrid in the 1950s, for political purposes. In this manner, Real Madrid was used as a Spanish brand of success to promote Spain&#x27;s image abroad and the pride of being Spanish in the country itself.

Spain was selected as the host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and the national team was eliminated in the second group stage.

Until the 1984–85 season, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) organized the league tournament. Since then, the competition has been organized by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP)(English: Professional Football League), an independent body that was formed at the initiative of the clubs themselves after disagreements with the RFEF regarding the management professionalization and economic division of the League benefits.

Since the entry into force of Spanish Law 10/1990, almost all clubs competing professionally in Spain are companies under the legal status of sports companies, whose ownership is in the hands of its shareholders. Only three professional clubs (Athletic Club, Barcelona, and Real Madrid) kept their original structure, such as sports clubs directly controlled by their members.

=== Recent years ===

After the appearance of private television in Spain, clubs&#x27; revenue increased due to lucrative contracts signed to broadcast matches on television, allowing the teams to sign top players. However, as a result, most clubs also vastly increased their spending.

La Liga has been in significant financial turmoil in the last few years. , Real Madrid and Barcelona were at the top of the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of most valuable football teams, while the remaining Spanish clubs had a debt of around €4.1 billion. For this reason, most clubs had to cut their budgets drastically. In 2013, the third biggest club, Atlético Madrid, had a debt of around €180 million; to relieve the debt, the club sold star player Radamel Falcao for €60 million. Television companies also began to lose subscribers; Digital+ said it had lost 15% of subscribers since 2012, and Mediapro lost 25% from 2011 to 2013, also having to shut down MARCA TV.

==Women&#x27;s football==
Social interest in women&#x27;s football has been growing in recent years, leading to increased economic investment. A record crowd for a European women&#x27;s club football match was recorded at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium in Madrid on 17 March 2019, when 60,739 fans came to a game between Atlético Madrid and FC Barcelona; that attendance exceeded the previous record of 48,121 – also set in Spain in 2019 when Athletic Bilbao played Atlético Madrid at the San Mamés stadium. This record has since been broken again, with the highest attendance for a Spanish women&#x27;s football match being the game at Camp Nou with FC Barcelona against VfL Wolfsburg on 22 April 2022, at 91,648 fans.

There are two national competitions, the Liga F and the Copa de la Reina (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s Cup&#x27;).

The first teams and informal women&#x27;s football competitions in Spain emerged in the 1970s. However, they were not officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation until 1980, with the founding of the National Women&#x27;s Football Committee. The first official national competition was the Copa de la Reina (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s Cup&#x27;), established in 1983. The Women&#x27;s National League began playing in the 1988–89 season.

The Spain women&#x27;s national football team has qualified three times in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, becoming World Champions in 2023 following their victory over England; and twice in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship. Its youth division has had success in recent times. The under-20 team won the FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2022 (runners-up in 2018). The under-19 team won the UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-19 Championship in 2004, 2017, and 2018 (runners-up in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016). The under-17 team won the UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-17 Championship in 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2018 (runners-up in 2009, 2014, 2016, and 2017), as well as the FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2018 and 2022 (runners-up in 2014, and third-place in 2010 and 2016).

==Spain men&#x27;s national football team (&quot;La Roja&quot;)==

Within Spain, regional teams, most notably the Catalonia national football team, the Basque Country national football team, and even the Galicia national football team, began to compete against each other from 1915 onwards. Despite not being officially recognized by FIFA, these regional teams still occasionally play friendly games, with some national team players playing for both teams. Some autonomous governments and social sectors in the historical communities (especially in Catalonia and Basque Country) prefer to call their regional teams the national team while claiming to participate in international tournaments.
The Spain national team, commonly referred to as &quot;La selección&quot; (English: The selection) or &quot;La Roja&quot; (English: The Red one), made their international debut at the 1920 Olympic Games in Belgium and came away with the silver medal. Since then, the Spain national team has participated in fifteen of twenty-one FIFA World Cups and nine out of fourteen UEFA European Championships. Historically, the Spain national team did not achieve important results in terms of trophies or develop an attractive playing style. Surprisingly, this fact contrasted with the huge success of the main Spanish football clubs at the European level. Nevertheless, the triumphs of the Spain national team in the 2008 and 2012 European Championship, and 2010 FIFA World Cup, with an attractive playing style, marked a turning point that divided the history of the Spain national football team into two parts.

The Spain national football team won FIFA Team of Year in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, and the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2011.

The Spain national football team won six trophies in FIFA and UEFA tournaments: one FIFA World Cup in 2010, UEFA European Championships in 1964, 2008, 2012, and 2024, as well as the Nations league in 2023. In addition, it was runner-up in the UEFA European Championship in 1984 and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013.

The Spain national under-23 team won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympic tournament and the silver medal in 2000.

The Spain national football team won the gold medal at the Mediterranean Games in 2005, 2007, and 2018, the silver medal in 1955, and the bronze medal in 1963 and 1967.

In addition, the honours list includes numerous titles at junior-level teams:

* UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 1986, 1998, 2011, 2013, and 2019.
* FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1999.
* UEFA European Under-19 Championship (formerly Under-18) in 1995, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2019.
* UEFA European Under-17 Championship (formerly Under-16) in 1986, 1988, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, and 2017.
* 1999 Meridian Cup.

Spain has won the Maurice Burlaz Trophy, the prize awarded to the national association that has achieved the best results in UEFA&#x27;s men&#x27;s youth competitions (UEFA European Under-19 Championship and UEFA European Under-17 championship) over the previous two seasons, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2011.

== Spain women&#x27;s national football team (&quot;La Roja&quot;) ==
The Spain national football team represents Spain in international women&#x27;s football since 1980, after the ban on women&#x27;s football was lifted. The Spain national team made their debut on February 5, 1983, in Pontevedra.

Spain achieved second place in the 1997 European Championship, the first time they had ever been in this tournament. Spain first qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 2015. A place in the top 10 of the FIFA World Rankings was secured for Spain in 2021, when their players won all categories of the UEFA awards, the first time this was done all from one nation.

In 2023, Spain were crowned World Champions, being only one of five national teams to have been so since the first Women&#x27;s World Cup in 1991. Together with their youth teams, Spain became the first nation ever to hold all three Women&#x27;s World Cups at the same time when they won the senior 2023 World Cup, 2022 U-20 World Cup, and 2022 U-17 World Cup.

Junior teams of Spain have been successful, having the following victories:

* U-17 European Championship in 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2018.
* U-17 World Cup in 2018 and 2022.
* UEFA U-19 European Championship in 2004, 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2023.
* FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2022.

==Football club competitions==


Currently, the three most essential competitions between clubs in Spain are La Liga (English: League), the Copa del Rey (English: King&#x27;s Cup), and the Supercopa de España (English: Spanish Supercup). Other extinct competitions were the League Cup, the Eva Duarte Cup, and the President&#x27;s Cup of the Spanish Football Federation. Up to a total of sixteen clubs have been winners of some of the official competitions in Spain at the highest level, and FC Barcelona is the most awarded club with seventy-five national titles,

The Spanish football league system consists of several leagues bound together hierarchically by promotion and relegation. In addition, Spanish Royal Federation Cup is a football competition for teams from the Segunda División B, the Tercera División and sometimes from the Preferente Regional who have failed to qualify or have been eliminated in the first round of the Copa del Rey.

===The League (La Liga) ===




In April 1927, Álvaro Trejo, a director at Arenas Club de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the league&#x27;s size and who would participate, the RFEF eventually agreed on the ten teams forming the first &quot;Primera División&quot; in 1928. FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Arenas Club de Getxo, and Real Unión were selected as previous Copa del Rey winners. Athletic Madrid, RCD Español, and CE Europa qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knock-out competition against Sevilla FC. Barcelona was the first winner of the competition. Only three founding clubs, Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao, have never been relegated from the &quot;Primera División&quot;; six other clubs have never been below the top two tiers: Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Sporting de Gijón, Valencia, Espanyol, and Atlético Madrid.

Historically, some of the best football players in the world have played in the Spanish football league, including Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ladislav Kubala, Ferenc Puskás, Raymond Kopa, Héctor Rial, Telmo Zarra, Francisco Gento, Luis Suárez, Johan Cruyff, Diego Maradona, Bernd Schuster, Andoni Zubizarreta, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov, Romário, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Raúl, Ronaldinho, Carles Puyol, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Iker Casillas, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi, among others.

La Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP) is responsible for administering the two professional football leagues in Spain. Professional Spanish football is divided into the &quot;Primera División&quot; (First Division) and &quot;Segunda División&quot; (Second Division). For sponsorship reasons, the First Division is Liga Santander, while the Second Division is La Liga SmartBank. The First Division has 20 professional teams, and the Second Division has 22. There are also lower Spain national football divisions. Every year, the three lowest-ranked teams in the First Division pass to the Second Division, and the top three ranked teams in the Second Division pass to the First Division.

La Liga is one of the world&#x27;s most popular professional sports leagues. The average stadium attendance was 21,000 in the 2014–15 season, with a range of average attendance from 4,780 people with the lowest average attendance to 77,632 people with the highest average attendance. In addition, La Liga is one of the wealthiest professional sports leagues in the world by revenue ($2.2 billion in 2016).

In La Liga&#x27;s 90-year history (except the three seasons in which the league was suspended due to the civil war), Barcelona and Real Madrid have won 60 titles. Barcelona and Real Madrid are two fierce rival clubs, and the matches between both two clubs are named &quot;El Clásico&quot;. Those football matches are one of the most viewed sports events in the world.

Although a total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception, only nine clubs have won the title: Real Madrid (36), Barcelona (27), Atlético Madrid (11), Athletic Bilbao (8), Valencia (6), Real Sociedad (2), Sevilla (1), Deportivo La Coruña (1), and Real Betis (1).

=== King&#x27;s Cup (Copa del Rey) ===


The King&#x27;s Cup is the oldest Spanish football competition organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. In 1902, Carlos Padrós, later president of Madrid FC (later to be Real Madrid), suggested a football competition to celebrate the coronation of Alfonso XIII. Four other teams entered the Copa del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, later developing into the Copa del Rey (English: &quot;King&#x27;s Cup&quot;). These included Barcelona, Club Español de Fútbol, Club Bizcaya, and New Foot-Ball de Madrid. The competition featured the first recorded game between Barcelona and Madrid FC, with the former emerging 3–1 winners. Club Bizcaya, which consisted of players from both Basque teams, eventually beat Barcelona in the final. Alfonso XIII subsequently became the patron of many Spanish football clubs, permitting them to use &quot;Real&quot; (Spanish for &quot;royal&quot;) in their names. Among the many clubs to add the prefix to their name was Madrid FC, which subsequently became Real Madrid.

The Copa del Rey was Spain&#x27;s football national championship from 1903 (the first edition won by Athletic Bilbao with Juan de Astorquia as captain and president) until the foundation of the &quot;Campeonato de Liga&quot;—League Championship—in 1928. It was initially known as the &quot;Copa del Ayuntamiento de Madrid&quot; (Madrid City Council&#x27;s Cup). Between 1905 and 1932, it was known as the &quot;Copa de Su Majestad El Rey Alfonso XIII&quot; (His Majesty King Alfonso XIII&#x27;s Cup). During the Second Spanish Republic, it was known as the &quot;Copa del Presidente de la República&quot; (President of the Republic Cup) or &quot;Copa de España&quot; (Spanish Cup). During the years of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spanish State, it was known as the &quot;Copa de Su Excelencia El Generalísimo&quot; or &quot;Copa del Generalísimo&quot; (His Excellency, The Supreme General&#x27;s Cup).

Fourteen clubs have won the title: Barcelona (31), Athletic Bilbao (24), Real Madrid (20), Atlético Madrid (10), Valencia (8), Real Zaragoza (6), Sevilla (5), Espanyol (4), Real Unión (4), Real Betis (3), Deportivo de La Coruña (2), Real Sociedad (2), Arenas Club de Getxo (1), and Mallorca (1).

=== Spanish Supercup (Supercopa de España) ===
The Spanish Super Cup (Supercopa de España) is a championship organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation and contested by the winners and runners-up of La Liga and the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey. The competition was founded in 1982.

Ten clubs have won the title: Barcelona (15), Real Madrid (13), Athletic Bilbao (3), Deportivo La Coruña (3), Atlético Madrid (2), Valencia (1), Zaragoza (1), Mallorca (1), Sevilla (1), and Real Sociedad (1).

=== Spanish clubs in international competitions ===
The Spanish football clubs are very successful in international competitions. They are the most successful in different current European competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and UEFA Europa League ; and they also were the most successful in the extinct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

They greatly benefit from their political and historical success as a colonial power. After the Big War (a.a. WW II), Spanish Football Clubs had their most prolific period of the century. Because of their political and economic positioning during Civil War and Cold War, they were able to win several UEFA Champions Leagues in a row. Real Madrid CF was the only club that managed to win the competition between 1956 and 1960. They were in a great position due to their economic advantage and lack of competition. Most countries were still recovering from a long and devastating World War II and could not participate in the competition due to financial or political reasons. France, Germany, England, Yugoslavia, and Russia are some of the countries that could not compete in the European Competitions for at least a decade. Real Madrid was the one who benefited and won the title five years in a row. Therefore, Real Madrid is the most successful club in international competitions, followed by Barcelona in recent years. In addition, other Spanish clubs have also won titles in international tournaments, such as Valencia, Atlético Madrid, Sevilla, Zaragoza, Villarreal, Deportivo de La Coruña, Celta Vigo, and Málaga.

Spanish football clubs hold different records in international competitions.

Real Madrid is the most successful European Cup/UEFA Champions League club. They have won fifteen titles and were runners-up three times. Real Madrid is also the most successful club in the Intercontinental Cup (three titles, sharing the record with Milan, Peñarol, Boca Juniors, and Nacional), FIFA Club World Cup (four titles), and UEFA Super Cup (six titles).

Barcelona is the second-most successful club in the FIFA Club World Cup, with three titles, and also the second-most successful club in the UEFA Super Cup (five titles, tied with Milan). In addition, Barcelona became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year (2009), completing the sextuple, and the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice (2009 and 2015).

Sevilla is the most successful club in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, with seven titles.

In total, Spanish football clubs have won 82 international titles. Over the years, Spanish clubs have won the European Cups/Champions League twenty times, the UEFA Super Cup seventeen times, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup seven times, the UEFA Cup/Europa League fourteen times, the UEFA Intertoto Cup seven times, and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup six times. In addition, Spanish clubs have also won the Intercontinental Cup four times and the FIFA Club World Cup seven times.

=== Primera División de la Liga de Fútbol Femenino ===

The Primera División, also known as Liga F, is the highest level of league competition for women&#x27;s football in Spain. It is organized by the &quot;Liga Profesional Femenina de Fútbol&quot;. Ranked among the top six national leagues by UEFA, it is considered one of the most important leagues in Europe. Since the 2021–22 season, the top three teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League.

Founded in 1988, a total of twelve different clubs have been champions. Barcelona is the most successful team with nine wins.

=== Queen&#x27;s Cup (Copa de la Reina) ===

The Copa de la Reina is an annual cup competition organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. The full name is &quot;Campeonato de España - Copa de Su Majestad la Reina&quot; (Championship of Spain - Her Majesty the Queen&#x27;s Cup). The tournament&#x27;s first edition took place in 1983, five years before the Spanish women&#x27;s league was created.

In 1981 and 1982 two editions were held under the name Copa Reina Sofía and won by Karbo. The first official recognized version of the tournament was the 1983 edition.

From 2004 to 2017, it was played in knockout style at the end of the league season, with the top eight clubs qualifying for it. Since 2018, all 16 teams of the first division join the competition, which starts to be played during league season.

The 2021–22 season featured 52 clubs; all 16 teams team of the Primera División, all 32 teams from the Segunda División Pro, and the four promoted teams from the Primera Nacional de Fútbol.

Barcelona is the most successful team with ten wins, often winning the double with the league. Espanyol and Levante have six wins each.

=== Spanish Women&#x27;s Super Cup (Supercopa de España Femenina) ===

The Supercopa de España Femenina is a super cup tournament, contested by the winners and runners up of the Copa de la Reina and the remaining highest ranked teams from the Primera División that had not already qualified through the cup final.

From 1997 to 2000, four editions of the Supercopa were played between the winners of the League and the Copa de la Reina, with San Vicente CFF winning its first edition, Atlético Málaga the second, Eibartarrak FT achieving the third edition and Levante (after absorbing San Vicente) winning the last.

The competition was re-instated in December 2019 by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. It was announced the Supercopa would expand to four teams, the winners and runners-up of the Copa de la Reina and Primera División.

Barcelona is the most successful team with four wins.

==Ethnic issues in Spanish football==
While relatively calm today, ethnic issues in Spain have long been problematic. As for the legacy result from the totalitarian and repressive Francisco Franco regime, there has been a strong sense of racial segregation in Spanish football, whereas racism and previous tensions are frequently used to exploit as a sign of defiance, which has contributed to the lack of national success of Spain in international football despite its enormous talents and club powers; it is strongly reflected in Basque Country and Catalunya.

The famed El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona has been marred with several issues in the relationship between ethnic Catalans. The majority supported Catalan independence and Barcelona and the Spanish-based Real Madrid, which sought to preserve Spain as an entity. The issue has been traced to Francoist Spain when Barcelona and Catalan&#x27;s identity was strongly suppressed. The Francoist regime usually favoured the Madrid clubs (Real and Atlético Madrid). Following Franco&#x27;s death, decades of political healing helped solve the country&#x27;s dark past. However, hostility between the Catalan and Castilian populations remains persistent and often contributes to significant football hostility regarding Catalan identity and perceived suppression of the Catalan language. Catalan-born players and coaches like Xavi, Carles Puyol, and Pep Guardiola have strongly demonstrated the idea of an independent Catalunya, which often creates chaos several times.

Alongside the tensions between Catalans and Castilians, the tensions between Basques to the central Spanish government also extended to football, where Basques sought to preserve their identity and, in several cases, clash against the Spanish officials and other pro-government clubs. Basque football officials have tried unsuccessfully to gain recognition from the UEFA and FIFA several times as a separate team from Spain. The nationalist issue is also influenced by Basque football&#x27;s relations with Spanish football.

There are also tensions between various ethnic regions in Spanish football, such as Valencia, Andalusia, Asturias, and Galicia, between either themselves or the central government. However, it has never extended to the level of tensions between Catalans and Basques.

<text>The Skyflash, or Sky Flash in marketing material, was a medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile derived from the US AIM-7 Sparrow missile and carried by Royal Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms and Tornado F3s, Italian &quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot; and Royal Saudi Air Force Tornados and Swedish &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; Saab Viggens.

Skyflash replaced the original Raytheon conical scanning seeker with a Marconi inverse monopulse seeker that worked with the F-4&#x27;s radar. Monopulse seekers are more accurate, less susceptible to jamming, and able to easily pick out targets at low altitudes. It offered significantly better performance than the original seeker, allowing British Aerospace to dispense with upgrades to the warhead that were carried out in the US to address poor accuracy.

Skyflash was tested in the US, but after trials against experimental monopulse seekers from Raytheon, the United States Navy elected to order a different monopulse-equipped version of the Sparrow, the AIM-7M. Both Skyflash and AIM-7M were later replaced by the more capable AMRAAM.

==History==
Skyflash came out of a British plan to develop an inverse monopulse seeker for the Sparrow AIM-7E-2 by General Electric Company (GEC) and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at the end of the 1960s. Having shown this was feasible, Air Staff Requirement 1219 was issued in January 1972, with the project code XJ.521. The contractors were Hawker Siddeley and Marconi Space &amp; Defence Systems (the renamed GEC guided weapons division) at Stanmore. Major changes from the Sparrow were the addition of a Marconi semi-active inverse monopulse radar seeker, improved electronics, adapted control surfaces and a Thorn EMI active radar fuze. The rocket motors used were the Bristol Aerojet Mk 52 mod 2 and the Rocketdyne Mk 38 mod 4 rocket motor; the latest is the Aerojet Hoopoe.

Tests of the resulting missile showed it could function successfully in hostile electronic countermeasures (ECM) environments and could engage targets under a wide variety of conditions. It could be launched from as low as 100 m to attack a high-altitude target or launched at high level to engage a target flying as low as 75 m. In testing, it repeatedly intercepted target drones at 1,000 ft altitude, the minimum altitude that the tracking cameras could be set to.

The missile entered service on the F-4 Phantom in 1978 as what was later called the 3000 Pre TEMP series (Tornado Embodied Modification Package). In 1985, these aircraft were replaced with the Panavia Tornado ADV. Both the Phantom and the Tornado carried the Skyflash in semi-recessed wells on the aircraft&#x27;s underbelly to reduce drag. In the Tornado, however, Frazer-Nash hydraulic trapezes projected the missile out into the slipstream prior to motor ignition. This widened the missile&#x27;s firing envelope by ensuring that the launch was not affected by turbulence from the fuselage. Skyflash was therefore converted to the 5000 TEMP series to incorporate the Frazer-Nash recesses in the body of the missile, Launch Attitude Control electronics in the autopilot section and improved wing surfaces. The Tornado-Skyflash combination became operational in 1987 with the formation of the first Tornado F.3 squadron.

From 1988 a further modification (6000 series) nicknamed &quot;SuperTEMP&quot; included the Hoopoe rocket motor to change the missile&#x27;s flight profile from boost-and-glide (with a 3-second burn) to boost-sustain-glide (3 second boost - 4 second sustain), increasing its range from 17nm to 18.4nm at a height of 30,000ft and at a height 5,000ft the range increase was more substantial, raising from 14nm to 16nm. The maximum flight time was also raised from 40 to 50-60 seconds. 

In RAF service the missiles were usually carried in conjunction with four short-range air-to-air missiles, either AIM-9 Sidewinders or ASRAAMs.

A version with an active Thomson CSF-developed radar seeker and inertial mid-course update capability, Skyflash Mk 2 (called Active Skyflash), was proposed for both the RAF and Sweden. British interest ended with the 1981 Defence Review; British Aerospace (BAe) kept the proposal around until the early &#x27;90s but there were no buyers.

Further advanced Sky Flash derivatives were studied under the code name S225X, and a ramjet-powered version, the S225XR became the basis for the MBDA Meteor.

In 1996 the RAF announced the launch of the Capability Sustainment Programme which called for, among other things, the replacement of the Skyflash with the AIM-120 AMRAAM. AMRAAM incorporates an active seeker with a strapdown inertial reference unit and computer system, giving it fire-and-forget capability. The first Tornado ADV F.3 with limited AMRAAM capability entered service in 1998. In 2002, a further upgrade enabled full AMRAAM capability. The first mention of AMRAAM as a replacement for Skyflash dates back to 1986.
