<text>Anthony John Herrera (January 19, 1944 – June 21, 2011) was an American actor.

==Early life and family background==
Herrera was born on January 19, 1944, in Wiggins, Mississippi, to Theresa Jewel (née Blackburn) and Rafael Antonio Herrera. His paternal grandfather was French-born Gaston Louis Malécot, an instructor at Columbia University and a World War I veteran, and his paternal grandmother was Spanish.

Reared in Stone County, Mississippi by his maternal grandparents, he graduated from Wiggins High School. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Mississippi and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. He was the biological father of actress Gaby Hoffmann. Herrera and Gaby&#x27;s mother, Viva, were estranged shortly before Gaby&#x27;s birth. She was raised by Viva, in the Chelsea Hotel.

==Career==
Herrera&#x27;s professional acting career began in 1969. He became best known for his role as the evil James Stenbeck on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, a role he played periodically between 1980 and 2010. Herrera also played Mark Galloway in 1974 and 1975 on the same show. From the fall of 1975 to 1977, he played Jack Curtis, a college professor who cheated on his wife, driving her to obesity, on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and played Dane Hammond on &quot;Loving&quot; from 1984–1986 and again in 1990–1991.

Herrera produced and directed a short documentary titled &quot;Mississippi Delta Blues&quot;, about the life of James &quot;Son&quot; Thomas. In 1987, he wrote and directed an episode of &quot;American Playhouse&quot; titled &quot;The Wide Net&quot;, starring Kyra Sedgwick. He also appeared as Lee Falk&#x27;s Mandrake the Magician, alongside Ji-Tu Cumbuka as Lothar, in a failed TV series pilot.

==Last years==
Herrera was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive and normally fatal type of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, in 1997. He went to Memorial Sloan-Kettering and underwent chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and an autologous stem cell transplant, but all these treatments were unsuccessful. In 1999, he received an allogenic stem cell transplant using bone marrow donated from his brother, John. Herrera&#x27;s disease went into remission for at least nine years, and was considered a &quot;pioneer case&quot; and proof that donor stem cells could induce long-term remission.

In 2005, Herrera wrote a book about his experiences, which he titled &quot;The Cancer War&quot;. In October of that year he testified before U.S. Congress on the importance of stem cell research. In October 2010, Herrera was the featured guest speaker at the Cardiology &amp; Oncology International Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee. His remission from cancer ended, however. He died on June 21, 2011, aged 67, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<doc id="947362" wikidata="Q7488565" url="?curid=947362" title="Shangqing Bridge">
<text>Shangqing Bridge () is an overpass in Beijing.

It is an intersection where the northern stretch of the 5th Ring Road and the Badaling Expressway meet.

Before tolls on the 5th Ring Road were abolished in early 2004, the bridge received little attention, apart from being the bridge where the first stretch of the 5th Ring Road was opened to traffic. However, as of 2004, it has become a major focus point, as the bridge is, more often than not, home to stunning traffic jams.

The problem is that vehicles switching expressways must pick up an entry card when heading in either direction. For cars heading toward the Badaling Expressway from the 5th Ring Road (especially if they are heading towards central Beijing), it is not a big problem (cards are handed and handed back to the Qinghe toll gate, where drivers heading into central Beijing continue without paying a cent; cards are also handed back to a toll gate on the Badaling Expressway if the driver heads out of Beijing). However, the problem &quot;is&quot; significant for cars entering the 5th Ring Road from the Badaling Expressway, where tolls must be paid before the vehicle enters the 5th Ring Road.

The heart of the problem is that the two longer parts of the bridge stretching into the 5th Ring Road consist of only one drivable lane. As a result, long lines at Shangqing Bridge are routine.

Because of this, it is not uncommon to see the two parts of Shangqing Bridge stretching into the 5th Ring Road jam-packed with vehicles. Unfortunately the toll gate problem is difficult to solve as there is only one lane to the toll gate, and the 5th Ring Road was never designed as a toll-free express road, but as a standard expressway (with tolls).

A few months into 2004, the authorities banned lorries over 2 t in weight from the bridge, for fear that Shangqing Bridge might collapse, due to the enormous weight of the vehicles.

On September 16, 2004, further actions were taken. Lorries heading for the eastern stretch of the N. 5th Ring Road (if coming into Beijing) were simply to be denied access and this included buses as well (apparently, the bridge has too much stress on it). All affected traffic is rerouted using the 6th Ring Road, placing longer travel routes and more tolls on the drivers. All lorries over 2 t can only enter areas inside of the 6th Ring Road during the night.

This measure, although easy to dismiss as extreme, actually takes a fair bit of credit. Lorries stockpiling on the bridge is a scene reserved now only during peak hours (previously, it was virtually &quot;any time of the day&quot;). Although the very issue of &quot;traffic jams&quot; is yet to be fully solved, the measure is a step towards solving it. Meanwhile, the bridge is further saved from collapse.

Despite this, public opinion is rather negative on the traffic situation at Shangqing Bridge. Calls for the repositioning of the toll gates and the addition of further toll gates have been mounting upon Shoufa, the expressway company. The authorities and Shoufa respond by saying that technical and physical constraints are the major obstacle. Still, the problem is mitigated with the addition of a few more toll gates—although only in a line (vertically instead of horizontally).

To solve the problem, some toll officials now collect tolls by actually walking to cars in the line and collecting tolls and handing over receipts. This somewhat alleviates the problem, even though the core of the problem is still existent to this day.

<doc id="947365" wikidata="Q524200" url="?curid=947365" title="Max Manus">
<text>Maximo Guillermo Manus DSO, MC &amp; Bar (9 December 1914 – 20 September 1996) was a Norwegian resistance fighter during World War II, specialising in sabotage in occupied Norway. After the war he wrote several books about his adventures and started the successful office supply company &quot;Max Manus AS&quot;.

==Early life==
Manus was born in Bergen, Norway in 1914, to a Norwegian father and a Danish mother. His father&#x27;s name was originally Johan Magnussen, but he changed his name to Juan Manus after living several years in foreign (mainly Spanish-speaking) countries.

==Career==
After many years of extensive travelling, Manus returned to Scandinavia before the outbreak of World War II, upon which he soon joined up with the Norwegian Army and went to fight in a volunteer detachment with the Finns against the Soviets. Manus returned to Norway upon hearing the news of the German invasion on 9 April 1940. He fought during the Norwegian campaign, after which he decided to return to Oslo and work underground against the occupiers, both organising a resistance movement, illegal public propaganda and the manufacture of weaponry. He and his comrades tried to assassinate Himmler and Goebbels when they visited Oslo.

His work was effective, and he soon became a wanted man by the Gestapo. He was eventually captured and was injured trying to escape. He had to be treated in the main Oslo hospital. The doctor at the hospital lied to the Gestapo officers, saying Manus needed treatment for a broken back, an injured shoulder and a serious concussion. The truth, however, was that he was only bruised and had a light concussion. After 27 days, with the aid of a nurse, he managed to escape through a second-floor window using a rope. In a dramatic escape, he crossed the border into Sweden. By then, the Soviet Union had entered the war against Nazi Germany, so Manus travelled through the Soviet Union, Turkey, Arabia, by ship via Cape Town to the US, to eventually return to fight in Europe.

He reconnected with the Norwegian military in the US and went on to further training in Canada, before crossing the Atlantic again to Belfast, then England. There, and in Scotland, he trained further and developed professional skills in sabotage and undercover work. He was then required to learn parachuting and was dropped in the forests near Oslo with a sabotage team.

In Norway, he resumed his organizational work and made various sabotage attempts on ships in the Oslofjord with home-designed limpet mines and even &#x27;swimmer-assisted torpedoes&#x27;. The former were the more successful, sinking and damaging some vessels. It was a long but intense learning process of great practical difficulty and danger. He made numerous hazardous trips back and forth across the border to Sweden, where he was able to get a respite from the constant mental and physical pressures of being undercover. Many of his comrades-in-arms were killed, captured and tortured, but Manus managed to survive through a combination of determination and luck, with some very narrow escapes.

Shortly after the end of the war, Manus wrote two books about himself. The first, &quot;Det vil helst gå godt&quot; (&quot;It Usually Ends Well&quot;), describes some of his enterprising and event-filled wandering and working in the jungles of South America and Latin America. Manus&#x27; second book was &quot;Det blir alvor&quot; (&quot;It Gets Serious&quot;), in which he continues the saga of his resistance work and personal successes in the 1945 sinking of two large vessels of great importance to the German war machine. When peace was declared, Manus found himself chosen to be the personal protection officer of the then Crown Prince of Norway on his triumphal parade in Oslo, and then also with King Haakon VII. This was a great honour, and he was lauded as one of Norway&#x27;s most resilient and successful fighters, aged only 30 at the time.

Manus&#x27; books have been translated into English twice; initially an American, very loose and somewhat brief translation entitled &quot;9 Lives Before Thirty&quot;, and, a few years later, &quot;Underwater Saboteur&quot;, a one-book adaptation of both of Manus&#x27; books, also somewhat concise. Both of these translations were made in the early years after the war, and names were changed in the interest of &quot;protecting the guilty&quot;, although Manus himself never changed any names.

==Recognition==
He was twice awarded Norway&#x27;s highest decoration for military gallantry, the War Cross with sword (twice means he got one cross with two swords; no recipient received several crosses). In addition to his Norwegian decorations, Manus received the British Distinguished Service Order (DSO) as well as the Military Cross (MC) and Bar (see list below).

==Peacetime==
Manus went into the office supply business after the war: in the fall of 1945, he and Sophus Clausen went to the United States to set up contracts for office machines. Together they started the company &quot;Clausen og Manus&quot;. In the years after the war, Manus also hired people who had been convicted for collaborating with Nazi Germany, among them Walter Fyrst. Manus did this after internal discussions and was motivated by a wish for reconciliation, as well as professional considerations. In 1952, the company was split into Sophus Clausen AS and Max Manus AS which now distributed Olivetti and Philips office machines. The company still exists today.

==Personal life==
Manus married Ida Nikoline &quot;Tikken&quot; Lindebrække in 1947, and they moved to Landøya, Asker. They met while she was working as liaison for the Norwegian saboteurs at the British consulate in Stockholm. Tikken was the daughter of the County Governor of Bergen and was the sister of Sjur Lindebrække, a bank manager who later became chairman of Høyre. In 1947, Lindebrække gave birth to Max Manus Jr.

Manus suffered from nightmares, alcoholism and bouts of depression after his experiences in the war, some of which he talked about in interviews.

==Death==
After retirement, Manus and Tikken moved to Spain. Max died there in 1996 aged 81.

==Film==

In December 2007, it was announced that a film about the life of Max Manus was to be made in Norway, starring Aksel Hennie in the leading role. The film premiered on 19 December 2008 and received mostly positive reviews.

==Ship renamed &quot;Max Manus&quot;==
A ship that was destroyed and sunk as a result of planning by the Pelle group, was recovered after the war and renamed &quot;Max Manus&quot; (formerly M/S Troma).

==Other uses==

&quot;Max Manus&quot; is used as a &quot;tail fin hero&quot; on a Boeing 737-800 aircraft from Norwegian Air Shuttle.

<text>The Cincinnati Enquirer is a morning daily newspaper published by Gannett in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. First published in 1841, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; is the last remaining daily newspaper in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, although the daily &quot;Journal-News&quot; competes with the &quot;Enquirer&quot; in the northern suburbs. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; has the highest circulation of any print publication in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. A daily local edition for Northern Kentucky is published as The Kentucky Enquirer. &quot;The Enquirer&quot; won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting for its project titled &quot;Seven Days of Heroin&quot;.

In addition to the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Enquirer&quot;, Gannett publishes a variety of print and electronic periodicals in the Cincinnati area, including 16 &quot;Community Press&quot; weekly newspapers, 10 &quot;Community Recorder&quot; weekly newspapers, and &quot;OurTown&quot; magazine. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; is available online at the &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot; website. In the 1864 presidential election, the newspaper opposed the reelection of Abraham Lincoln. On his second inauguration the paper wrote, &quot;Mr. Lincoln commences today, a second term unfettered by constitutional restraint as if he were the Czar of Russia or the Sultan of Turkey.&quot; From 1920 to 2012, the editorial board endorsed every Republican candidate for United States president. By contrast, the current editorial board claims to take a pragmatic editorial stance. According to then-editor Peter Bhatia, &quot;It is made up of pragmatic, solution-driven members who, frankly, don&#x27;t have much use for extreme ideologies from the right or the left. ... The board&#x27;s mantra in our editorials has been about problem-solving and improving the quality of life for everyone in greater Cincinnati.&quot; On September 24, 2016, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, its first endorsement of a Democrat for president since Woodrow Wilson in 1916. &quot;The Kentucky Enquirer&quot; consists of an additional section wrapped around the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; and a remade Local section. The front page is remade from the Ohio edition, although it may contain similar elements.

Reader-submitted content is featured in six zoned editions of &quot;Your HomeTown Enquirer&quot;, a local news insert published twice-weekly on Thursdays and Saturdays in Hamilton, Butler, Warren, and Clermont counties. Since September 2015, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and local Fox affiliate WXIX-TV have partnered on news gathering and have shared news coverage and video among the paper, broadcasts, and online media. In 2016, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; launched a true crime podcast called Accused that reached the top of iTunes&#x27; podcasts chart.

Under then-editor Peter Bhatia, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; became the first newsroom in the nation to dedicate a reporter to covering the heroin epidemic full time. That reporter, Terry DeMio, and reporter Dan Horn helped lead a staff of about 60 journalists to report the heroin project that won the newspaper its second Pulitzer Prize. The award was the first the newsroom won for its reporting, but its second win overall. The first Pulitzer win was awarded to Jim Borgman for editorial cartoons in 1991.

==History==

===Early years===
The &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s predecessor was the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, edited by Moses Dawson as early as 1828. It later became the &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot; and in 1838 the &quot;Cincinnati Advertiser and Journal&quot;. By the time John and Charles Brough purchased it and renamed it the &quot;Daily Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, it was considered a newspaper of record for the city. The &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s first issue, on April 10, 1841, consisted of &quot;just four pages of squint-inducing text that was, at times, as ugly in tone as it was in appearance&quot;. It declared its staunch support for the Democratic Party, in contrast to the three Whig papers and two ostensibly independent papers then in circulation. A weekly digest edition for regional farmers, the &quot;Weekly Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, began publishing on April 14 and would continue until November 25, 1843, as &quot;The Cincinnati Weekly Enquirer&quot;.

In November 1843, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; merged with the &quot;Daily Morning Message&quot; to become the &quot;Enquirer and Message&quot; (the &quot;Daily Enquirer and Message&quot; beginning in May 1844). In January 1845, the paper dropped the &quot;Message&quot; name, becoming &quot;The Cincinnati Daily Enquirer&quot;. Finally, in May 1849, the paper became &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;.

===McLean ownership and Washington trust===
In 1844, James J. Faran took an interest in the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. In 1848, Washington McLean and his brother S. B. Wiley McLean acquired an interest in the &quot;Enquirer&quot;.

On March 22, 1866, a gas leak caused Pike&#x27;s Opera House to explode, taking with it the &quot;Enquirer&quot; offices next door. A competitor, the &quot;Cincinnati Daily Times&quot;, allowed the &quot;Enquirer&quot; to print on its presses in the wake of the disaster. As a result, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; missed only one day of publication. However, archives of the paper&#x27;s first 25 years were lost.

Washington McLean was a leading Copperhead whose editorial policies led to the suppression of the paper by the United States government during the Civil War. After the war, McLean pursued an anti-Republican stance. One of his star writers was Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote for the paper from 1872 to 1875. James W. Faulkner served as the paper&#x27;s political correspondent, covering the Ohio State Legislature and Statehouse, from 1887 until his death in 1923. The &quot;Faulkner Letter&quot; was a well-known column often carried in regional newspapers.

In the 1860s, Washington McLean bought out Faran&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. In 1872, he sold a half interest in the newspaper to his son, John Roll McLean, who assumed full ownership of the paper in 1881. He owned the paper until his death in 1916. Having little faith in his only child, Ned, John Roll McLean put the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and another paper he owned, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in trust with the American Security and Trust Company of Washington, D.C., as trustee. Ned successfully broke the trust regarding &quot;The Post&quot;, an action that led to its bankruptcy and eventual sale to Eugene Meyer in 1933. The &quot;Enquirer&quot;, however, continued to be held in trust until 1952.

In the 1910s, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; was known for an attention-getting style of headline in which individual words or phrases cascaded vertically, beginning with a single word in large type. According to a 1912 college textbook on newspaper making, &quot;The &quot;Enquirer&quot; has printed some masterpieces replete with a majesty of diction that is most artistic; but there are few papers that can imitate it successfully.&quot; During the 1930s and 1940s, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; was widely regarded among newspapers for its innovative and distinctive typography.

In the 1920s, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; ran a promotion that offered a free plot of land near Loveland, Ohio, along the Little Miami River, after paying for a one-year subscription to the daily. The Loveland Castle was built on two such plots. The surrounding community is now known as Loveland Park.

By the late 1940s, sales of the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, Cincinnati&#x27;s last remaining morning daily, had increased dramatically, fueled in part by the success of its Sunday morning monopoly; meanwhile, &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; and especially &quot;The Cincinnati Times-Star&quot; faced a declining afternoon market.

===Employee ownership===
In February 1952, &quot;The Cincinnati Times-Star&quot; offered to buy the &quot;Enquirer&quot; from the American Security and Trust Company for $7.5 million. In response, the 845 employees of the paper pooled their assets, formed a committee, and obtained loans to successfully outbid the &quot;Times-Star&quot; with an offer of $7.6 million, with the Portsmouth Steel Company as their agent. The deal closed on June 6, 1952. In its first year under employee ownership, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; reported a net earnings of $349,421.

===Scripps ownership===
The employees lacked sufficient capital and managerial expertise to run the paper. City editor John F. Cronin led a revolt against management on November 25, 1955; he was fired the following month. Beset by financial problems and internal strife, they sold the paper to The E. W. Scripps Company, owner of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;, on April 26, 1956. Scripps purchased a 36.5% controlling interest in the &quot;Enquirer&quot; for $4,059,000, beating out The Times-Star Company&#x27;s $2,380,051 and Tribune Publishing&#x27;s $15 per share, or $2,238,000. Two years later, Scripps also acquired the &quot;Times-Star&quot;, merging the afternoon paper with the &quot;Post&quot;.

With the &quot;Times-Star&quot; and &quot;Enquirer&quot; acquisitions, the Scripps family owned all of Cincinnati&#x27;s dailies, along with WCPO-AM, WCPO-FM, and WCPO-TV. The E. W. Scripps Company operated the &quot;Enquirer&quot; at arm&#x27;s length, even omitting the Scripps lighthouse logo from the &quot;Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s nameplate. Nevertheless, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against the company in 1964.

===Gannett ownership and joint operating agreement===
In 1968, Scripps entered into a consent decree to sell the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. It was sold to influential Cincinnati millionaire Carl Lindner Jr.&#x27;s American Financial Corporation on February 20, 1971. In turn, Lindner sold the &quot;Enquirer&quot; to a Phoenix-based company of his, Combined Communications, in 1975, for $30 million plus 500,000 shares of common stock and 750,000 shares of common stock warrants in Combined Communications. Combined Communications merged with Gannett Company in 1979.

On September 22, 1977, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; signed a joint operating agreement (JOA) with &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;. For two years, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; had secretly negotiated the terms of the JOA with the &quot;Post&quot; while securing concessions from labor unions. The two papers petitioned the Justice Department for an antitrust exemption under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970. This was the second JOA application under the Newspaper Preservation Act; the first, involving the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; and &quot;Anchorage Times&quot;, was summarily approved but already seen as a failure.

The &quot;Enquirer&quot;–&quot;Post&quot; agreement was approved on November 26, 1979, taking effect after negotiations and legal battles with unions. As the more financially sound paper, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; received an 80% stake in the business and handled all business functions of both papers, including printing, distribution, and selling advertising. Gannett opened a new printing press off Western Avenue in the West End to print both papers.

In August 1980, William J. Keating appointed George Blake to serve as the &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s first new editor since the Gannett acquisition. Blake, who was previously editor at &quot;The News-Press&quot; of Fort Myers, Florida, had a tendency to delegate that contrasted with the hands-on style of his predecessor, Luke Feck. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; underwent a staff reorganization and introduced a new format in September 1982.

Under Blake, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; had a reputation for friendliness to corporate interests, exemplified in its weak coverage of the savings and loan crisis that engulfed financier Charles Keating, brother of &quot;Enquirer&quot; publisher William J. Keating. The paper&#x27;s approach changed dramatically in January 1993 with the arrival of president and publisher Harry Whipple and editor Lawrence Beaupre from Gannett Suburban Newspapers in White Plains, New York. Beaupre emphasized investigative reporting, beginning with aggressive coverage of Charles Keating&#x27;s conviction. By 1995, he had brought his team of aggressive investigative reporters from White Plains to the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. The paper won awards for Michael Gallagher&#x27;s 1996 investigation into Fluor Daniel&#x27;s cleanup of the uranium processing plant at Fernald Feed Materials Production Center.

On May 3, 1998, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; published a special 18-page section, titled &quot;Chiquita Secrets Revealed&quot;, that accused the Cincinnati-based fruit company of labor abuses, polluting, bribery, and other misdeeds. Chiquita, owned by former &quot;Enquirer&quot; owner Lindner, denied all of the allegations. Gallagher was charged and convicted for illegally obtaining some of the evidence through voicemail hacking, and the &quot;Enquirer&quot; fired him for lying about his sources. Faced with a potential lawsuit over the voicemail hacking, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; settled with Chiquita out of court, paying the company $14 million. Under the terms of the agreement, the paper published an unprecedented three-day-long, front-page retraction of the entire series, destroyed any evidence they had gathered against Chiquita, and transferred Beaupre to Gannett headquarters. The paper largely reverted to its former approach to business coverage.

On April 10, 2000, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; downsized from a traditional broadsheet format to an format similar to Berliner. They also began publishing in color every day of the week. Gannett promoted the narrower format as being &quot;easier to handle, hold, and read&quot; but also cited reduced newsprint costs.

In May 2003, Gannett replaced Harry Whipple with Cincinnati native Margaret E. Buchanan as president and publisher. Buchanan, previously publisher of the &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot;, was the newspaper&#x27;s first woman publisher. The same year, Tom Callinan became editor of the &quot;Enquirer&quot; after stints as editor of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; of Rochester, New York, and the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot;. One of his first moves was to reassign media critics to reporting positions.

Callinan originally attempted to address declining circulation by focusing on lifestyle content aimed at younger readers; however, this approach alienated the paper&#x27;s older core audience. The paper responded by reemphasizing national news in the newspaper and creating niche, crowdsourced products online for younger audiences. In October 2003, &quot;The Enquirer&quot; began publishing and distributing &quot;CiN Weekly&quot;, a free lifestyle magazine aimed at younger readers, to compete against &quot;Cincinnati CityBeat&quot;. In 2004, Gannett purchased local magazines &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Inspire&quot; and increased coverage in &quot;The Kentucky Enquirer&quot;. In November 2004, Gannett purchased HomeTown Communications Network, publisher of a daily newspaper and 62 weekly and biweekly newspapers branded &quot;The Community Press&quot; in Ohio and &quot;The Community Recorder&quot; in Kentucky. The Department of Justice cleared the purchase the following March.

In January 2004, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; informed the &quot;Post&quot; of its intention to let the JOA expire. The &quot;Post&quot; published its final print edition upon the JOA&#x27;s expiration on December 31, 2007, leaving the &quot;Enquirer&quot; as the only daily newspaper in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. Following the &quot;Post&quot;″s closure, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; made efforts to appeal to &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot;″s former readership, for example referring to the Cincinnati metropolitan area as &quot;Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky&quot; rather than simply &quot;Greater Cincinnati&quot;.

In April 2006, &quot;The Enquirer&quot; was cited by The Associated Press with the news cooperative&#x27;s General Excellence Award, naming &quot;The Enquirer&quot; as the best major daily newspaper in Ohio. Earlier that year, parent Gannett Co. named &quot;The Enquirer&quot; the most improved of the more than 100 newspapers in the chain.

In December 2010, Callinan left for a professorship at the University of Cincinnati and was succeeded by Carolyn Washburn as editor.

In October 2012, the online version of the &quot;Enquirer&quot; went behind a metered paywall.

In March 2013, Gannett closed its West End printing facility and contracted with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; to print the &quot;Enquirer&quot; in Columbus. Shortly after, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; began publishing in a smaller compact tabloid format. Former &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Enquirer&quot; pressman Al Bamberger purchased the former &quot;Enquirer&quot; facility that June and sold it to Wegman Company, an office furniture installation company.

Buchanan retired in March 2015. Gannett named Rick Green, the editor of &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; and a former &quot;Enquirer&quot; assistant editor, as president and publisher. In August 2016, Gannett eliminated the &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s Publisher position, transferring Green to the North Jersey Media Group in New Jersey.

==Facilities==
The &quot;Enquirer&quot; has published from many downtown Cincinnati locations. From Fifth Street between Main and Sycamore, it moved to Third Street, then to the corner of Third and Main, then to Main between Third and Pearl. In 1866, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; began publishing from offices in the 600 block of Vine Street, near Baker Street. From 1916 to 1928, the newspaper constructed a new headquarters and printing plant, the Cincinnati Enquirer Building, on this property. In 1992, the newspaper moved to 312 Elm Street.

At the end of 2022, the newspaper&#x27;s 30-year lease agreement at Elm Street expired, and the &quot;Enquirer&#x27;s&quot; news operation moved one block west, to 312 Plum Street.

The &quot;Enquirer&quot; operated two news bureaus until July 2013. The Northern Kentucky bureau produced &quot;The Kentucky Enquirer&quot; and &quot;The Community Recorder&quot;, while the West Chester bureau covered Butler and Warren counties for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;″s northern zones and produced some editions of &quot;The Community Press&quot;.

From 1977 to 2013, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; was printed from a press off Western Avenue in the West End. Until 2007, this facility also printed &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; under a joint operating agreement. Since March 2013, Gannett has contracted with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; in Columbus to print all its Cincinnati publications, including the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. Similarly, Gannett has contracted with the Lafayette, Indiana, &quot;Journal &amp; Courier&quot; to print &quot;Community Press&quot; and &quot;Community Recorder&quot; editions since 2007.

==Online presence==
The &quot;Enquirer&quot; launched its first website, &quot;Enquirer.com&quot;, on November 1, 1996. Due to a joint operating agreement with &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;, it launched concurrently with the &quot;Post&quot;″s site, &quot;@The Post&quot;. A shared website, &quot;GoCincinnati!&quot;, located at gocinci.net, displayed classified advertising and offered dial-up Internet access subscriptions. Local access numbers were available in cities throughout the country through a network of Gannett publications. Both papers&#x27; home pages moved to a more memorable domain, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot;, on November 1, 1998. The new brand encompassed about 300 local commercial sites and some community organizations.

From May 2002 to March 2007, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot; also included &quot;WCPO.com&quot;, the website of &quot;Post&quot; sister company WCPO-TV. The &quot;Post&quot; closed at the end of 2007, ending Scripps&#x27; involvement in &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot;. The &quot;CiN Weekly&quot;, &quot;Community Press&quot;, and &quot;Community Recorder&quot; weekly newspapers have also been online partners with the &quot;Enquirer&quot;.

In October 2005, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; launched &quot;NKY.com&quot;, a website covering news from Boone, Campbell, and Kenton counties in Northern Kentucky. &quot;NKY.com&quot; was one of the first newspaper-published websites to make extensive use of user-created content, which it featured prominently on 38 community pages. In August 2006, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot; launched 186 community pages covering towns and neighborhoods in Ohio and Indiana and began soliciting and publishing stories and articles from readers, which appear in &quot;Your Hometown Enquirer&quot; inserts.

Since October 2012, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot; has operated behind a metered paywall that allows readers to view 10 stories a month before paying a subscription fee. As a Gannett property, &quot;Cincinnati.com&quot; is branded as &quot;part of the USA Today Network&quot;. Its primary competitor in the market is WCPO-TV&#x27;s website, &quot;WCPO.com&quot;.

Archives of &quot;Enquirer&quot; articles can be found in online subscription databases. ProQuest contains full text of articles from 1841 to 1922 and from 1999 to present, as well as &quot;digital microfilm&quot; of articles from 2010 to 2012. , Newspapers.com has scans of 4.2 million pages from 1841 to present.

<text>The Beechcraft Travel Air is a twin-engine development of the Beechcraft Bonanza. It was designed to fill the gap between the single engine Model 35 Bonanza and the much larger Model 50 Twin Bonanza, and ultimately served as the basis for its replacement, the Baron.

==Design and development==
Designed as a competitor to the Cessna 310 and the Piper Apache, the Travel Air (developed as the Badger) took many design features from previous Beechcraft airplanes. It took its basic design from the Model 35 Bonanza, fitted with the vertical stabilizer from the T-34 Mentor, and two four-cylinder engines. Its wing spar was borrowed from the large Model 50 Twin Bonanza, along with thicker gauge aluminum on the leading edge; landing gear systems had been taken from the United States Navy Mentor, which was a stronger structure built for training pilots for later aircraft carrier landings. Power came from, in the 1958 model year, two Lycoming O-360-A1A at at 2700rpm each. With 75% power, the Travel Air was capable of 200mph at 7,500ft.

Although developed and initially marketed as the &quot;Badger&quot;, a 1956 letter from the United States Air Force notified Beechcraft that the name had been previously chosen as a reporting name for the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 bomber; therefore, Beechcraft elected to reuse the Travel Air name, which came from the predecessor company to Beechcraft, the Travel Air Manufacturing Company. Beechcraft set in initial pricing of the Travel Air at $49,500; $10,450 below Cessna&#x27;s 310 price, yet still $13,510 higher than Piper&#x27;s Apache pricing.

==Variants==
During its ten-year model run, between 1958 and 1968, the Travel Air saw four distinct variants emerge. All use the ICAO aircraft type designator &quot;BE95&quot;.

===Model 95===
The initial model was built for the 1958 and 1959 model years; the 1959 model had a fifth &#x27;jumpseat&#x27; added. A total production of the 95 for 1958 and 1959 were 173 and 128, respectively.

===Model B95/B95A===
Changes in the B95 version included a cabin stretch to increase rear cabin area and the horizontal stabilizer and elevators were enlarged for better pitch control. A curved vertical stabilizer dorsal fairing is the most noticeable change. It also included a fifth seat, wider chord flaps, and an increased gross weight of 100 pounds. The 1961 Model B95A featured fuel injected Lycoming IO-360-B1A engines. A total of 150 B95s were built in 1960, and 81 B95As were built between 1961 and 1962 (serial numbers TD-453 through TD-533). The 1960 model was priced at $51,500 and the 1961–62 model was priced at $49,500.

===Model D95A===
In 1963 the Travel Air featured a larger rear window that is common with the Model A55/B55 Barons. The nose cone was lengthened for improved baggage space. Interior features such as the instrument panel and heaters were redesigned. There were a total of 174 D95s built between 1963 and 1967.

===Model E95===
The E95 featured a one piece, &#x27;speed-slope&#x27; windshield and a more pointed spinner design. The interior design was fully re-done. A total of 14 Model E95s were built in 1968; with pricing of $53,500. The production drop off was due to the more costly but faster and powerful Model 55 Baron (developed from the Model 95, and initially designated Model 95-55).

<text>The Chevrolet Suburban is a series of SUVs built by Chevrolet since the 1935 model year. The longest-used automobile nameplate in the world, the Chevrolet Suburban is currently in its twelfth generation, introduced for 2021. Beginning life as one of the first metal-bodied station wagons, the Suburban is the progenitor of the modern full-size SUV, combining a wagon-style body with the chassis and powertrain of a pickup truck. Alongside its Advance Design, Task Force, and C/K predecessors, the Chevrolet Silverado currently shares chassis and mechanical commonality with the Suburban and other trucks. 

Traditionally one of the most profitable vehicles sold by General Motors, the Suburban has been marketed through both Chevrolet and GMC for nearly its entire production. Along sharing the Suburban name with Chevrolet, GMC has used several nameplates for the model line; since 2000, the division has marketed it as the GMC Yukon XL, while since 2003 Cadillac has marketed the Suburban as the Cadillac Escalade ESV. During the 1990s, GM Australia marketed right-hand drive Suburbans under the Holden brand. 

The Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, Chile, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Peru, Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel), while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to the United States, Canada, and Mexico) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).

A 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year. A 2019 iSeeCars.com study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle. In December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in &quot;1,750 films and TV shows since 1952.&quot;

==History==
Several automotive companies in the United States used the &quot;Suburban&quot; designation to indicate a windowed, station wagon–type body on a commercial frame including DeSoto, Dodge, Plymouth, Studebaker, and Nash, in addition to Chevrolet and GMC. The (Westchester) Suburban name was, in fact, a trademark of U.S. Body and Forging Co. of Tell City, Indiana, which built wooden station wagon bodies for all of these automobile and light truck chassis and more.

Chevrolet began production of its all-steel &quot;carryall-suburban&quot; in 1934. GMC brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the &quot;Suburban Carryall&quot; until GM shortened the name to simply &quot;Suburban.&quot; GMC&#x27;s equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named &quot;Suburban&quot; as well, until being rebranded as &quot;Yukon XL&quot; for the 2000 model year.

With the end of production of the Plymouth Fury Suburban station wagon in 1978, only General Motors continued to manufacture a vehicle branded as a &quot;Suburban,&quot; and GM was awarded an exclusive trademark on the name in 1988. The Chevrolet Suburban is one of the largest SUVs on the market today. It has outlasted competitive vehicles such as the International Harvester Travelall, Jeep Wagoneer, and the Ford Excursion. The latest competitor is the extended-length Ford Expedition EL, which indirectly replaced the Excursion.

The Suburban as of today is a full-size SUV (upgraded to extended-length from 1967 onward to make room for the then-new K5 Blazer that debuted in 1969) with three rows of seating, a full pickup truck frame, and V8 engine. It is one of the few station wagons available with all bench seating rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the Chevrolet Tahoe, except that the Suburban is longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the nine-passenger seating area.

From 1973 to 2013, it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions. Chevrolet discontinued this option for the public during the tenth-generation model&#x27;s tenure after 2013 because of slow sales. However, for the 2016 model year, a one-ton model debuted as an exclusive to rental, fleet, and government services as the eleventh generation in 4WD and with LS and LT trim options, but soft sales would result in Chevrolet discontinuing production on this model after 2019.

In recent years, the Suburban has been used as a police truck, fire chief&#x27;s vehicle, and EMS vehicle. Suburbans are also used as taxicab livery and limousines. Gothic black Suburban vehicles are commonly used by federal intelligence services, such as the Secret Service. The Secret Service operates fully-armored versions of the Suburban for the President of the United States when he attends less formal engagements. The Suburban (as well as the Tahoe and GMC variants) is very popular with the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a service vehicle.

In the late 1990s, GM also introduced a RHD version of the Suburban, badged as a Holden, for the Australian market. Sales were low and GM withdrew the model in 2000 from Holden&#x27;s lineup. In 2019, Chevrolet considered bringing the Suburban back to the region as a converted RWD import through Holden Special Vehicles but using the Chevrolet badge, but is holding off on those plans because of numerous factors, including the situation involving GM&#x27;s decision to retire the Holden brand in 2020.

In 2015, the Suburban commemorated its 80th anniversary at General Motors&#x27; Arlington Assembly Plant where the 10 millionth Suburban was produced. A video was posted on Chevrolet&#x27;s YouTube channel about its eighty-year legacy.
In a February 26, 2018, article celebrating the vehicle&#x27;s 83rd year, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; notes that the Suburban&#x27;s longevity is due to being one of GM&#x27;s best-selling brands, its appeal to customers across the board regardless of race, gender, class, or political affiliation, and a unique loyalty to the SUV. In an interview from Chevrolet&#x27;s truck/SUV marketing executive Sandor Piszar, who recalls an event celebrating the truck division&#x27;s 100th anniversary when they asked about what they named their vehicles, &quot;It&#x27;s a funny question, but it really is an intriguing point,&quot; Piszar says. &quot;People name what they love. And they love their Suburbans.&quot;

On December 5, 2019, the Chevrolet Suburban became the first vehicle to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for its excellence in film and television, having appeared in more than 1,750 films and television series since 1952, and can also claim to have appeared in at least one television series every year since 1956, and at least one film every year since 1960, the most ever for an automobile of any type. The star, placed at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, also carried the Chevrolet &quot;Bowtie&quot; symbol instead of the entertainment symbols (film, stage, television, radio, musical instruments, and recording artist), another first for the Walk of Fame.

There have been a total of twelve generations of Chevrolet Suburbans since its 1934 debut.
==First generation (1935)==

Prior to the first-generation Suburban, in 1933, the Chevrolet Master had offered a station wagon body built on the 1/2-ton truck frame. This model was specifically built for National Guard and Civilian Conservation Corps units. Much of the body was constructed from wood and could seat up to eight occupants.

The actual first-generation model was offered by Chevrolet as a &quot;Carryall Suburban&quot; – a utility vehicle featuring a station wagon body on the chassis of a small truck. Focused on functionality, the concept was indeed to &quot;carry all&quot;: the whole family and their gear were to find sufficient space in one truck. It shared the front sheet metal and frames of the half-ton pickup models of the same year, but featured all-metal wagon bodies differing very little in shape from contemporary &quot;woodie&quot; station wagons.

Seating for up to eight occupants was available, with three in the front row, two in the middle row, and three in the rear row. Either the side-hinged rear panel doors or a rear tailgate/lift window could be selected for cargo area access while only having two doors for passenger access.

==Second generation (1941)==
Suburbans were built in model years 1941, 1942, and 1946. It was also produced during World War II as a military transport vehicle. Seating for up to eight occupants was available. Models with rear panel doors were designated &quot;3106,&quot; while those with tailgates were designated &quot;3116.&quot; The Chevrolet versions were equipped a 216-cubic-inch 6-cylinder engine. The GMC version was equipped with a 228-cubic-inch 6-cylinder engine. It shared much of its mechanicals with the AK Series trucks.

==Third generation (1947)==

This model generation was based on the Chevrolet Advance Design series of pickups.

Beginning in 1953, the Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission was available in GMC models and in the 1954 model year Chevrolet Suburbans. Models with rear panel doors were designated &quot;3106,&quot; while those with tailgates were designated &quot;3116.&quot; In 1952, the Suburban came with either a tailgate or panel doors. The front bench seat was split, with two seats on the driver&#x27;s side and a single seat on the passenger side, which slid forward for access to the rear two rows of seats. The second row was a &quot;2/3&quot; seat, requiring occupants to move past the front passenger seat, as well as the second-row seats to access the third row.

This was the last series to feature &quot;canopy express&quot; models.

The design of the 1947 Suburban would inspire the design of the Chevrolet HHR over half a century later.

==Fourth generation (1955)==

Updated engineering and styling on Chevrolet trucks was not introduced until March 25, 1955, in the middle of the model year that GM called the Chevrolet Task Force/GMC Blue Chip series. All Chevrolet and GMC truck models received new styling that included a flatter hood, front fenders flush with the body, and a trapezoid grille. The trucks&#x27; V-shaped speedometer was shared with passenger car models.

Engines included I6 and the small-block V8s. Chevrolet used its 265 V8 engine, later evolving it to a 283-cubic-inch version. GMC based their V8 on a Pontiac design. Standard Suburban model numbers continued from the previous series, but the introduction of four-wheel-drive models in 1957 added the numbers &quot;3156&quot; for 4WD Suburbans with panel doors, and &quot;3166&quot; for 4WD Suburbans with tailgates.

The &quot;Suburban&quot; name was also used on GM&#x27;s fancy 2-door GMC 100 series pickup trucks from 1955 to 1959, called the Suburban Pickup, which was similar to the Chevrolet Cameo Carrier, but it was dropped at the same time as Chevy&#x27;s Cameo in March 1958 when GM released the new all-steel &quot;Fleetside&quot; bed option replacing the Cameo/Suburban Pickup fiberglass bedsides. The Suburban name was never used again on a 1/2 ton pickup after the discontinuance of the Suburban Pickup. Although not documented because of a fire that destroyed the records, the production of Suburban Pickups is understood to be 300 or fewer each model year it was offered from 1955 to 1958.
==Fifth generation (1960)==

The styling of the 1960–1961 model year took cues from the late-1950s Chevrolet vehicles and had large oval ports above the grille. An independent front suspension was new for 1960. The cab featured a &quot;wrap around&quot; windshield, while tailgate and panel door rear openings were available.

From 1962 onwards, the hood styling was more conservative, with hoods that eliminated the large ports. In 1964, the front glass area was updated to a flatter windshield and larger door glass. of cargo could be carried in the back.

This model series introduced a factory-equipped 4WD (&quot;K&quot;) option for the first time. The 2WD (&quot;C&quot;) models introduced a torsion bar-based independent front suspension and trailing arm and coil spring rear, but by 1963, returned to a more conventional coil-spring approach.

Engine options included straight-sixes and small-block V8s. A GMC V6 engine was also available on GMC models. This 305 was actually from GMC&#x27;s medium-duty truck line. It featured high torque but had notoriously poor fuel economy. Transmissions were a 3-speed and 4-speed manual, the automatic Powerglide, and in the GMC models, the dual-range Hydra-Matic from 1960 to 1962.

A 15-passenger conversion was done by Stageway of Fort Smith, Arkansas. These modified Suburbans had three doors on the right, a wheelbase, were long, and weighed .

One-ton (C-30), panel truck models were no longer available after 1966.
=== Chevrolet Veraneio (Brazil) ===

In 1964, Chevrolet in Brazil introduced a 5-door version of the Suburban called C-1416 (known as Veraneio from 1969 onwards, which is Portuguese for &quot;summertime&quot;). It was based on the contemporary Brazilian Chevrolet C-14. Like the C-14, the C-1416/Veraneio used the instrument cluster from the U.S. C/K series, although the exterior sheet metal layout is exclusive to Brazil. It was initially powered with a Chevrolet 4.2L inline-six based on the pre-1962 &quot;Stovebolt&quot; engines. Later, it used the engine from Chevrolet&#x27;s Brazilian mid-size sedan – the Opala. The original version of the Veraneio was kept in production, with another grille and interior, until 1988 (1989 model year), but it was eventually replaced with an updated version based on the Série 20 family. The second generation of Veraneio was produced from 1989 to 1995.

In 1997, GM introduced the then-current North American pickups to the Brazilian market, replacing the long running C-series. The Brazilian version of the Suburban was also converted to the current generation at the time and lasted until 2001 as the &quot;Grand Blazer&quot;, succeeding the Veraneio. The 4.1L inline-six engine with was offered on both models with option for a MWM 4.2L turbodiesel unit with .

In 2015, &quot;Autoweek&quot; ranked the Veraneio fourth among Chevrolet station wagons never sold in the U.S. It also cited the vehicle&#x27;s design as &quot;baroque&quot; and summed it up as &quot;a 1960s Brazilian crossover.&quot; Autoweek noted that the Veraneio is eligible for import to the United States under the 25-year exemption.
==Sixth generation (1967)==

The sixth-generation Suburban debuted alongside the &quot;Action-Line&quot; generation of C/K trucks. Growing in size over its International Travelall rival, the Suburban moved from a 115-inch to a 127-inch wheelbase (shared by pickup trucks with 8-foot beds). In another change, a -ton C-20 Suburban was introduced for the first time. Alongside the standard rear-wheel-drive configuration, 4×4 K-10/K-20 models were also offered.

In a configuration distinct to this generation, Action-Line Suburbans are configured with a single driver-side door and two passenger doors. For 1969, the Suburban was joined by the shorter K5 Blazer (GMC Jimmy), a two-door utility vehicle with a lift-off hardtop.

The rear-wheel-drive Suburban was also available as a panel truck for commercial purposes. Following the 1970 model year, the configuration was retired, with the model functionally replaced by the G-Series Chevrolet Van/GMC Vandura for 1971.

Through its production, the Action-Line Suburban shared a large amount of mechanical commonality with its pickup-truck counterpart, sharing the same powertrain offerings. A 250-cubic-inch inline-6 was standard, with a 292-cubic-inch inline-6 offered as an option. Small-block V8s initially were 283 and 327 V8s (later 307 and 350 V8s); a 396 (402) V8 served as a big-block V8 offering. GMC Suburbans were fitted with a 305 V6 as a standard engine until 1970.

Sharing the styling revisions of Action-Line pickup trucks, the Suburban introduced front disc brakes for 1971. Automatic-transmission vehicles received an optional tilting steering column. For 1972, the optional rear-seat air conditioning was redesigned with a smaller housing (previously fitted with a housing that ran the full length of the roof).

The Action-Line Suburban was produced alongside the rapid growth of the recreational vehicle market in the late 1960s. While only about 6,200 Suburbans were produced for 1967, by 1972, production had grown to approximately 27,000. Alongside the retirement of the panel truck configuration, this generation marked the final use of the GMC Carryall name.
==Seventh generation (1973)==
For 1973, the Suburban became part of the Rounded-Line C/K series, with both the Chevrolet and GMC divisions adopting the Suburban nameplate. Growing nominally in size over its Action-Line predecessor, the seventh-generation Suburban completely abandoned its carryall past, introducing a station wagon–style body with four full passenger doors (more than a decade after its Wagoneer and Travelall rivals). As the term &quot;sport-utility vehicle&quot; was more closely associated with off-road vehicles (such as the K5 Blazer), GM designated the Suburban as a truck-based station wagon.

From the rear of the passenger doors, the Suburban shared its bodywork (both its doors and roofline) with the C/K crew-cab pickup (a new configuration introduced for 1973). The -ton and -ton 10 and 20 payload series made their return alongside the rear-wheel-drive C-series and 4×4 K-series. Alongside the long-running twin-panel rear doors, the Suburban adopted an optional tailgate-style rear door with a retractable rear window (lowered manually or electrically).

Initially offered in Custom, Custom Deluxe, and Cheyenne Super trims, the Chevrolet Suburban adopted a base Custom Deluxe, mid-level Scottsdale, and flagship Silverado trim nomenclature for 1975. GMC Suburbans were initially Custom, Super Custom, and Sierra Grande; in 1975, Sierra Classic replaced Super Custom. In 1981, GMC replaced Custom with Sierra. A rare variant for both Chevrolet and GMC was the Estate option package, offering woodgrain exterior trim (in line with sedan-based wagons); the option was offered through the 1979 model year.

Though technically fitted with only with a front bench seat as standard equipment, the Suburban was offered in multiple interior configurations, offering up to nine-passenger seating. Bucket front seats became a front-seat option in 1978, with the third-row seat changed to a quick-release design (without tools) for 1979.

The Rounded-Line Suburban shared the same exterior revisions of its pickup-truck counterpart. Along with minor revisions in 1975, 1977, and 1980, the model line underwent a more substantial revision in 1981, followed by updates in 1983 and 1985.

=== Powertrain details ===
The Suburban shared several engines with the C/K pickup truck line. A 250-cubic-inch inline-six was the standard engine through 1979. The model line was offered with a 307- (1973 only) and 350-cubic-inch small-block V8s; a 454-cubic-inch big-block V8 was optional in C-series Suburbans. For 1976, the 350 V8 was joined by 305- and 400-cubic-inch V8s; the latter was discontinued for 1981. For 1980, V8 engines became standard for the model line, with the 305 returning as the standard engine for 1981. For 1982, GM introduced a 6.2L Detroit Diesel V8 as a higher-efficiency alternative to the 454 V8.

A 3-speed manual transmission was offered through the 1980 model year, with a 4-speed manual offered through 1987. Initially offered with 3-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 and 400 automatic transmissions, a 4-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 became an option in 1981.

For 1980, K-series Suburbans moved from full-time four-wheel drive to a part-time system, allowing the front axle to freewheel. For 1981, the shift-on-the fly 4×4 system adopted automatic-locking front hubs; the NP208 transfer case replaced the NP205 in most examples.

=== R/V series (1987–1991) ===
For 1987, GM redesignated the Rounded-Line C/K series as the R/V series to accommodate the launch of the 1988 GMT400-platform C/K trucks, which were being launched in the spring of 1987. For 1987, the gasoline engines of the model converted from carbureted fuel delivery to electronic fuel injection (using throttle body injection/TBI)&quot;.&quot; For 1988, the 5.0L engine was dropped from the line, with the 5.7L V8 becoming the standard engine. In a trim revision, the R/V line adopted the nomenclature of its GMT400 successor, with all vehicles adopting the 1500/2500/3500 payload series (previously used by GMC) and the base Custom Deluxe trim retired and replaced by a revived Cheyenne trim.

For 1989, the exterior underwent its largest revision since its 1973 introduction. Adopting a style similar to the GMT400, the black-painted grille was offered with quad headlights (economy trims were equipped with two). After using the same design nearly unchanged since 1973, the steering wheel was replaced (adopting the same design as the GMT400).

For 1990, the Suburban introduced power-operated sideview mirrors, also adding the option of rear-wheel ABS. Alongside the Suburban and Blazer/Jimmy, the R/V line was pared down nearly exclusively to 1-ton crew-cab pickup and chassis-cab trucks.

For 1991, the 4-speed 700R4 automatic transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled 4L80-E unit. After an 18-year production run, the Rounded-Line Suburban ended production as GM shifted crew-cab pickup trucks and full-size SUVs to the GMT400 platform for 1992.


==Eighth generation (1992)==

The GMT400-based Suburbans were introduced in December 1991 for the 1992 model year. The C/K pickup had already switched to the newer platform in 1987 for the 1988 model year. Both 2WD and 4WD models were offered, as well as half-ton and three-quarter-ton (&quot;1500&quot; and &quot;2500&quot;) models.

The GMT400 series introduced an independent front suspension. The 2WD models used coil springs and 4WD models used torsion bars in the front suspension. All models used a live axle and leaf springs in the rear. The GMT400-series Suburbans underwent steady but minor changes from 1994 until production ended in favor of the ninth generation Suburban in October 1999. This generation was also imported from Mexico to Australia and New Zealand by Holden; fitted with right-hand-drive it was sold as the Holden Suburban between February 1998 and January 2001 with various minor changes.

==Ninth generation (2000)==


The GMT800-based Suburbans were introduced in late December 1999 (Texas-only) and January 2000 (nationally) for the 2000 model year. They were sold in two series: 1/2-ton 1500 and 3/4-ton 2500. Suburbans came in Base, LS, and LT trims. Optional was a push-button 4WD with a low-range transfer case. A tow hitch with a trailer wiring plug was optional.

For 2000, Chevrolet&#x27;s long-serving 5.7L and 7.4L V8 engines were retired along with the 6.5L diesel (except in Mexico, until 2002). New engines were the LS-based 5.3L Vortec for the 1500 series and 6.0L Vortec for the 2500 series.

Where Chevrolet kept the Tahoe/Suburban branding, GMC renamed its GMT800 products Yukon and Yukon XL, a change that continues to the present day. The shorter 116&quot; wheelbase became the Yukon and the full-length 130&quot; wheelbase became the Yukon XL. Yukons were built in SLE, SLT, and Denali trims.

New features included:
* A spare tire relocated beneath the vehicle (instead of in the cargo area as on previous models)
* &quot;Puddle lamps&quot; in the exterior mirrors on LS and LT models
* Electronic climate control available on LT models
* Four-wheel disc brakes
* Load-leveling Autoride suspension available on LT models
* Premium Ride rear self-leveling suspension available on LS models
* Digital components
* Redesigned wheels
* Redesigned interior with new dashboard and instrument panel including a driver message center and engine hour meter
* Taillights with separate amber-colored turn signal indicators

=== Yearly changes ===

* 2001: The 6.0-liter V8 in 2500-series Suburbans gained from a number of changes including aluminum cylinder heads. The new Vortec 8100 V8 was added as an option for the 2500 as well. OnStar became standard on LT models and LS models with the new Z71 package. The exterior ‘1500’ and ‘2500’ door badges on Chevrolet models began being slowly phased out partway through the model year.
* 2002: Several optional features were made standard equipment on the LS model, including front and rear air conditioning, alloy wheels, power windows, power front seats, side steps, fog lamps, and heated outside rearview mirrors. Base models were discontinued, leaving LS and LT. Door badges on the Chevrolet models were completely removed. The Vortec 5300 L59 variant in the 1500 series added flex-fuel capability.
* 2003: All GM full-size trucks received an upgraded interior, with better-quality materials and other enhancements. New radios offered Radio Data System compatibility, XM satellite radio, Bose sound and improved ergonomics. Adjustable pedals were added as an option, and the instrument cluster-mounted Driver Information Center was improved and monitored up to 34 vehicle functions. A Panasonic DVD system was added as an option. GM&#x27;s Stabilitrak system was added, and Quadrasteer became available on 2500 series Suburbans. Towing capacity for Quadrasteer-equipped vehicles was reduced by (the weight of the system). Although the pickup trucks received a revised front fascia, it was not carried over to the SUVs (except for Suburban/Tahoe ~ Sonora, in Mexico only).
* 2004: 1500-series Suburbans received the Hydroboost braking system that was previously introduced in the 2500 series. The Mexican-market Suburban received a front-end update that year, matching that of the Silverado.
* 2005: New updated body side moldings, barn doors were discontinued in favor of the formerly optional liftgate. All 1500 model engines switched to electrically driven radiator e-fans to reduce power loss and fuel consumption, updated side assist steps and lower air deflector were put in place for fuel economy gains of about 1 MPG. The Z71 package, long exclusive to 4WD models, became available on 2WD Suburbans. Z71 also featured updated side pillar emblems, the Chevrolet tailgate emblem returned on Z71 models were a gold Z71 logo had been in previous years (2000-2004). OnStar also became standard across the board. Last year for Quadresteer option. Finally, Stabilitrak became standard on all models shortly after the start of the model year. The 2005 Suburban 1500 won the J.D. Power and Associates award for highest initial quality among large SUVs, beating out its rivals the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.
* 2006: The GMT800 Suburban&#x27;s last year. A special LTZ trim package became available, featuring wheels, all-wheel drive, and the LQ4 6.0L engine from the GMC Yukon Denali. The catalytic converters were relocated closer to the engine. The XM radio antenna and the OnStar antenna were combined into a single &quot;Shark Fin&quot; antenna.

=== Engines ===

In addition, a &quot;Vortec 5700&quot; L31 V8 remained in use in 2000–2002 Suburbans, Tahoes (called Sonora), and Silverado pickup trucks in the Mexican market.
==Tenth generation (2007)==


The 2007 model year Suburban and Yukon XL were unveiled at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show in January. Production of the redesigned GMT900 Suburban and Yukon XL began at Janesville Assembly and Silao Assembly in January 2006 (Suburban) April 2006 (Yukon XL), with the vehicles arriving at dealerships in April 2006.

The new models were redesigned with more modern and rounded styling, already seen on the previously released 2007 Tahoes and Yukons. For the first time, the SUVs did not share any exterior parts with the pickup trucks except for the doors. The exterior features a more aerodynamic shape, made partly by a steeply raked windshield angle.

The interior had a redesigned dashboard and improved seats. It still retained its 9-passenger seating availability, which was available on LS and SLE models only. LT2 and LT3 models have leather seating and available 6-, 7-, and 8-passenger seating. A Z71 package was available on LT2 and LT3 models which included two-tone leather seats. All Mexican-built Suburbans including the 9-seat models offered the special two-tone leather seating used by the Z71. The Suburban LTZ came standard with a DVD player and a GPS-enhanced touchscreen radio.

For the 2010 model year, in which &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it as the number-one affordable large SUV, the Suburban added a premium interior package that included tri-zone climate control and handy features like Bluetooth and rear audio controls. Additionally, radios added a USB port, allowing for music to be played from auxiliary devices through the radio, as well as charging other small electronics. Side blind zone alert became an option on LT and standard on LTZ. The 6.0-liter engine in the 2010 models was also flex-fuel capable. Minor front-end changes including a slightly raised front bumper and side torso airbags were also made standard for 2010.

In February 2010, Chevrolet unveiled a 75th-anniversary edition of the Suburban, which had the LTZ trim with white diamond tricoat exterior paint and cashmere interior, along with standard 20-inch chrome-clad wheels, revised roof rails, integrated navigation radio, XM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth phone connectivity, rearview camera, rear park assist, remote starting, adjustable pedals, and leather upholstery with heated/cooled front seats. According to Chevrolet, only 2,570 units of this special edition would be produced because of the amount of white diamond paint GM could procure.

The 5.3-liter and 6.0-liter engines were improved, and a new 6.2-liter Vortec V8 was added for the Yukon XL Denali. The 8.1-liter engine was dropped.

For the 2011 model year, the Suburban added three new exterior colors to the lineup: Mocha Steel Metallic, Green Steel Metallic, and Ice Blue Metallic. More features became standard on each trim, with the rear audio system, Bluetooth, floor console/storage area, woodgrain interior, luggage rack rails, body-color exterior door handle/mirror caps, and premium-cloth front bucket seats now standard on the LS trim, and chrome recovery hooks, two-speed transfer case, and 20-inch chrome wheels standard on LTZ 4WD models. In addition, the trailering package featured the trailer brake controller as standard on all trims.

For the 2012 model year, trailer sway control and Hill Start Assist become standard on all trims, while the LTZ trim added a heated steering wheel as standard. Also, the LT1/2 options for the Suburban and SLE1/2 and SLT1/2 options on the Yukon XL were discontinued, leaving the Suburban with only an LS, LT, and LTZ trim and the Yukon XL with an SLE and SLT trim. In 2012, GMC celebrated its 100th anniversary by releasing a special edition of its Yukon XL, offering a Heritage Edition trim package. This was the final year that three colors, Graystone Metallic, Gold Mist Metallic, and Blue Topaz Metallic, would be offered, along with the all-season blackwall P265/65R18 tires.

For the 2013 model year, two new colors were offered: Champagne Silver Metallic and Blue Ray Metallic (extra charge). Also new was Powertrain Grade Braking, normal mode. The 2013 model arrived at Chevrolet dealers in June 2012.

For the 2014 model year, power-adjustable pedals, remote vehicle starter system, and rear parking assist along with rear vision camera and inside mirror with camera display became standard on the Suburban LS trims. Concord Metallic (which was supposed to be available for the 2013 MY) was added to the Suburban color offerings for the 2014 models. For the Yukon XL, a convenience package became standard on its SLE models, along with a new color, Deep Indigo Metallic. In February 2014, The Suburban came in second behind the Tahoe among the top-ranked large affordable SUVs by &quot;U.S News &amp; World Report.&quot; This would be followed by being acknowledged as an award recipient in the large SUV category by JD Power and Associates in July 2014.

The three-quarter-ton model&#x27;s towing capacity is , being one of the best of any 4×4 SUV and unmatched by any other SUV. The towing capacity of the Suburban 2500 was unmatched, but also uncontested because of the discontinuation of the Ford Excursion in 2006. The three-quarter-ton model also has a GCVW of .

The 2500 Suburban was originally sourced from Silao, Mexico, from 2007 to 2008 but was moved to the Arlington, Texas, assembly plant for the 2009 model year, where production of all GM fullsize SUVs was consolidated after the closing of the Janesville plant.

GM discontinued the 2500 versions of both Suburban and Yukon XL models after the 2013 model year.

==Eleventh generation (2015)==


The eleventh generation Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon XL, and Yukon Denali XL were introduced to the public on September 12, 2013, and GM unveiled the vehicles in different locations (the Suburban in New York, Yukon XL in Los Angeles) on that date. Both vehicles are based on the GMT K2XX platform and carried specific model numbers, identified by platform (K2), brand (YC for Chevrolet, YG for GMC), drivetrain (C for 2WD; K for 4WD), tonnage (15 for half-ton, 25 for 3/4-ton, 35 for 1-ton), wheelbase (7 for short, 9 for long), and 06 for SUV, which means that a K2YC-K-15-9-06 would be identified as a Chevrolet Suburban 1500 4WD. The Suburban and Yukon XL went on sale in February 2014 as a 2015 model, with the vehicles built exclusively in Arlington, Texas.

===Production details===
The newly redesigned Suburban and Yukon XL were showcased to the public for the first time on September 27, 2013, at the State Fair of Texas. This move comes on the heels of the 80th anniversary of the first production of the Suburban in 1934.

The designs and concepts were created by GM&#x27;s exterior design manager Chip Thole (before his transfer to GM&#x27;s Buick design studio in 2013), who told &quot;Truck Trend&quot; &quot;I start with what intuition tells me about the market and get the team going on that. You look at trends around the industry – fashion, culture, what people are buying, what they say they want now – and project that into the future. The fun part is putting those ideas to paper and going from there.&quot; He then added, &quot;We wanted to take what was good about today&#x27;s vehicles, bring that forward and make them new and different with that spark of freshness that people recognize, without making them gimmicky or overdone.&quot; Thole also challenged his design team to help bring ideas to the SUVs, which lead to the split headlamps and a more graphic feel for the Suburban design, while a more industrial but sculptured look was added to the Yukon XL to give it a unique identity of its own.

Production on the Suburban and Tahoe began in December 2013 with the first completed SUVs being used for testing purposes. GM then officially started shipping the vehicles to dealerships on February 5, 2014. It is estimated that it took 8–10 weeks to assemble the SUVs, save for the upgrades on the level trims and destination scheduling.

===Features===
The front fascia of the Chevy Suburban and GMC Yukon XL is distinct, but from the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels are made of aluminum to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that were located on the liftgate door were moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear liftgate window. Also noticeable is the SUV&#x27;s length, which expands from (the Yukon XL&#x27;s length is shorter at ) and its width from , while the height decreases from , thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a little bit wider, more streamlined, and roomier.

A more efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 V8 powertrain (5.3 for the Suburban, 6.2 for Yukon XL/Yukon Denali XL) coupled with improved aerodynamics, helped the SUVs offer greater estimated highway fuel economy and improving its fuel economy estimates to (city), (highway), and (combined) for 2WD, and (city), (highway), and (combined) for 4WD. The increased fuel economy also vaulted the Suburban/Yukon XL into the top spot among large SUVs with the most efficient fuel economy rating numbers for this segment. However, when &quot;Motor Trend&quot; (which placed the 2015 Suburban on the front cover of its June 2014 issue) did a road test review on the SUVs, it estimated the 4WD MPG on the Suburban LTZ to be slightly better at around city and highway, while the 4WD Yukon Denali XL, whose fuel economy (MPG) is rated at city and highway, was estimated lower at city and highway.

Like the 2007–14 version, both the Suburban and Yukon XL did not share a single piece of sheet metal or lighting element with the brands&#x27; full-size pickup trucks, and the front grilles of both vehicles were slightly altered to give it their own identity. The front headlights featured projector-beam headlamps flanking the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille – chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while the Tahoe/Suburban LTZ and Yukon/XL Denali trims featured projector-beam high-intensity discharge headlamps and LED daytime running lamps. The Yukon and Yukon XL also featured projector-beam halogen headlamps on SLE and SLT trims. The improved safety features included a 360-degree radar detection for crash avoidance and occupant protection and a high-tech anti-theft system that now included vertical and interior sensors, in-glass and window breaking, a triggering alarm, and a shutdown device preventing the vehicle from moving. The latter was expected to address the issues regarding the constant thefts of the vehicles, especially with the previous generation&#x27;s removable seats and items left in the cargo space, which has become a target for carjackers who see the third-row seats as valuable on the black market. According to General Motors&#x27; head of Global Vehicle Security Bill Biondo, &quot;We have engineered a layered approach to vehicle security ... With new standard features and the available theft protection package, we are making the vehicles less attractive target to thieves and more secure for our customers.&quot;

Also new were the addition of fold-flat second and third-row seats (replacing the aforementioned removable third seats), which was now a standard feature but could be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of legroom for second-row passengers. HD radio became a standard feature on all trims. Multiple USB ports and power outlets were now spread throughout their interiors, including one 120V three-prong outlet on both Suburban and Yukon XL, with the Suburban adding an available eight-inch color touch screen radio with next-generation MyLink connectivity along with an available rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens and Blu-ray DVD player, while the Yukon XL added a standard eight-inch-diagonal color touch screen radio with enhanced IntelliLink and available navigation. A 4G LTE WiFi access system, along with Siri Eyes Free and text messaging alerts, was included in all vehicles featuring the OnStar device around the second quarter of 2014.

===Suburban HD===
With the change to the K2 platform, GM discontinued the -ton Suburban 2500; however, plans were revealed to offer a K2-based Suburban HD for fleet sales according to an updated VIN decoding document filed in March 2015. This version, identified as a Class 3 vehicle (around GVWR), was only available as a 4WD vehicle with the same design as the eleventh generation (K2XX), but was equipped with a different engine altogether. The Suburban HD was offered only in LS and LT trims, reserving the LTZ trim for a more luxurious offering (like limousine or taxi-related services). It also was not offered with 2WD or upgraded packages. In addition, there were no plans to offer a -ton GMC Yukon XL as GM made the design exclusive to Chevrolet.

The Suburban HD was officially named the &quot;Suburban 3500HD,&quot; indicating a one-ton truck rating, and was introduced for the 2016 model year. This was available exclusively for fleet sales and equipped with the &quot;L96&quot; 6.0L V8 engine, &quot;6L90&quot; 6-speed heavy-duty automatic transmission (RPO MYD), 17-inch machined aluminum wheels (8-lug), a high-capacity air cleaner, 220-amp alternator, external engine oil cooler, and auxiliary transmission cooler. The 3500HD did not include HD radio. Although the vehicle had a high GVWR of , it is intended to provide a larger payload but minimal towing capacity, as it primarily was intended for conversion to an armored transport.

The 2019 model year would be the last year for the K2-based Suburban HD; chassis production ceased in August 2018.

===2015 mid-year update===
The Suburban added a hands-free power liftgate feature that is standard on the LTZ but included on the LT with the optional Luxury Package. The added 4G LTE WiFi and Siri features became standard on both LT and LTZ trims, while the MyLink with Navigation feature was upgraded from optional to standard on the LTZ trim. The E85 capability feature is removed from retail orders.

The Yukon XL&#x27;s 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine was updated with the new 8L90E eight-speed automatic transmission for the interim model year, allowing it to improve fuel economy. The Yukon XL Denali, however, saw its MSRP bumped up by $1,300 (~$ in ) in part because of the loaded features.

All GM full-sized SUVs received a body-colored painted Shark Fin antenna as part of the 2015 mid-year refresh.

This refresh is often referred to as the 2015i, &quot;i&quot; for interim processing code.

===2016===
For the 2016 model year (which commenced sales in July 2015), the Chevrolet Suburban received more upgraded changes and new features that included power-adjustable pedals, forward collision alert, IntelliBeam headlamps, lane keep assist, and a safety alert seat as part of the newly introduced enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the LS trim. The inside floor console with storage area-SD card reader was removed, while a new AM/FM audio integrated system with Sirius XM, HD Radio, and CD/MP3 capabilities was introduced as a standard feature on all trims; the 8-inch MyLink feature was expanded to the LS trim and became standard (replacing the 4-inch display), although the navigation feature remained as an option on LT and standard on LTZ. A new liftgate shield was added to the Theft Protection Package, along with the new lane keep assist which replaced the lane departure warning. The capless fuel fill tanks became standard on all trims. &quot;Siren Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;Iridescent Pearl Tricoat&quot; became the new color trims, replacing &quot;Crystal Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Diamond Tricoat&quot;. The instrument cluster was re-configured with a new multi-color enhancement and a heads-up display was introduced as a standard only on the LTZ trim. The 2016 models also saw a price hike as well.

The 2016 GMC Yukon XL also sees similar changes, with the new enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the SLE trim, liftgate, power, hands-free now packaged on SLT trims, a free-flow feature that replaced the Premium package, a lane keep assist added to all trims, and two new premium colors (&quot;Crimson Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Frost Tricoat&quot;) replacing &quot;Crystal Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Diamond Tricoat&quot; respectively.

Chevrolet added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features to the Suburban starting with the 2016 models. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used, while the Android Auto option was only available on LT and LTZ trims featuring 8-inch screens.

GM expanded newer 4G LTE features (like detecting battery failure and monitoring insurance discounts based on driver performance) to 2016 model year vehicles, including the Suburban, which GM cited as being the vehicle that is the most used among data subscribers.

=== 2017 ===
The 2017 model year Chevrolet Suburban received upgraded changes after it went on sale in August 2016. The level trims LS and LT are retained but the LTZ is renamed Premier, the latter serving as the equivalent to the Yukon XL Denali. The LS trims also saw the badged &quot;LS&quot; lettering removed. The new features include two new colors (&quot;Blue Velvet Metallic&quot; and &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot;), two new 22-inch wheel options (a 7-spoke Silver wheels with Chrome inserts for all trims; Ultra Bright machined aluminum wheels with Bright Silver finish for Premier trim only), black roof rack cross rails (as part of the Texas Edition Package and All-Season Package), front active aero shutters (all trims), and heated and vented seats (Premier trim only). The MyLink was updated to incorporate Teen Driver, App Shop, Rear Seat Reminder customization, and Low-Speed Forward Automatic Braking (as part of Enhanced Driver Alert Package on the LS trim, but standard on LT and Premier). The Rear Seat Entertainment System was overhauled to include a new video voiceover feature for the visually and hearing impaired, an HDMI/MHL connector, digital headphones, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) technology incorporated into the Wi-Fi system, and a second USB port with the capability of charging up to a 2.1-amp at the back of the console.

The 2017 model year Yukon XL also received similar changes, but with a few exceptions. Two new colors, &quot;Dark Blue Sapphire Metallic&quot; and &quot;Mineral Metallic&quot; were introduced, the latter exclusive to the Denali, which also added a new 22-inch ultra-bright aluminum wheels with midnight silver premium paint and a head-up display to its features. The interior backlights changed from red to blue. The heated and vented driver and front passenger seats became standard on the SLT and Denali trims.

=== 2018 ===
The 2018 model year Suburban had a few upgrades and deletions. LED daytime running lights became standard on all trims, along with a new color, &quot;Havana Metallic&quot; and &quot;Satin Steel Metallic&quot;. The Cocoa/Mahogany interior that was combined with the &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; exterior was dropped along with the wireless/inductive phone charging that was part of the Luxury and Texas Edition LT level trims. The fleet/commercial level trim, which had fewer features, was upgraded to include MyLink, HD Radio, multi-color driver information center, LED daytime running lights, and an optional driver alert package.

The 2018 Yukon Denali XL received a new grille with a layered appearance like the ones on its redesigned 2018 Acadia and Terrain brands, featuring high-intensity-discharge headlights and LED daytime running lights. The refreshed design provided better airflow to the radiator, and when less cooling air is needed, shutters behind the grille closed to improve aerodynamics and efficiency. The interior featured new ash wood trim that, according to GMC, gave the cabin a richer appearance. A new 10-speed automatic transmission was mated to its , 6.2-liter V8 engine, replacing the 8-speed transmission.

=== 2019 ===
The 2019 Suburban will have both &quot;Havana Metallic&quot; and &quot;Tungsten Metallic&quot; deleted in favor of a new &quot;Shadow Gray Metallic&quot; exterior color, while the top-of-the-line Premier now had the name displayed on the tailgate. The LS trim continued to make HD Radio a standard feature, but could be deleted if customers opted for the OnStar feature.

The 2019 model year GMC Yukon XL added three new exterior colors, &quot;Dark Sky Metallic&quot;, &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot;, and &quot;Smokey Quartz Metallic&quot;, while deleting two others, &quot;Mineral Metallic&quot; and &quot;Iridium Metallic&quot;. GMC also introduced two new package features, &quot;Graphite Edition&quot; and &quot;Graphite Performance Edition&quot;, which were available in the SLT trim only.

=== 2020 ===
The 2020 Chevrolet Suburban dropped the LT Signature Package and the LS All-Season Package, along with the &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; color, while the 2020 GMC Yukon XL replaced its &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; color with &quot;Carbon Black Metallic&quot; and made no additional changes.

===Accolades===
The 2015 Suburban was ranked third among the top affordable SUVs and fifth among affordable SUVs with 3-row seats by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and was among the finalists in &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; SUV of the year for 2015. It also received a 2015 MotorWeek Drivers&#x27; Choice Award for best large SUV, while &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; ranked the Suburban as the best SUV with a third row seat, topping its competitors in this category.

The Chevrolet Suburban took third place behind the Tahoe and GMC Yukon in the 2016 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study among full-size SUVs, based on responses from owners of the vehicles.

&quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; named the 2018 Suburban the &quot;Best New Car of Year 2018&quot; in the Large SUV category. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; added the 2018 Suburban to their recommended list due to high owner satisfaction scores.

The Suburban was given a Hollywood Walk of Fame star on December 5, 2019, one of two inanimate objects to be awarded such (Disneyland being the other), for its frequent appearances in film and television. Because city regulations prohibit placing corporate names on public sidewalks including the Walk of Fame, the star was instead placed in an area adjacent to the Walk of Fame.

===Sales===
The eleventh-generation Suburban saw an increase in sales; April 2014 brought a 109.8 percent spike, with most dealers reporting that the vehicles are being sold within 10 days after arriving on the lot, with customers opting for the fully loaded LTZ model, making it one of Chevrolet&#x27;s fastest selling brands in 2014. The eleventh generation Suburban is also a hot seller in the Middle East, where in August 2014 posted a 37% increase in sales, with most of the purchases coming from Saudi Arabia (65%), the United Arab Emirates (15%) and Qatar (108%). By the end of September 2014, GM sold more than 4101 units of the Suburban (up 50.1%), while the Yukon XL posted 2165 units sold (up 64%), with GM boasting that 80% of the vehicles sold were its large SUVs.

In Canada, sales of the Suburban reached 966 units (up 43%) in 2014, although the Yukon XL was the best seller in that country with 1,760 vehicles sold (up 50.3%) that same year. Overall, they accounted for 70 percent of GM Canada&#x27;s SUV sales for 2014.

On August 17, 2015, GM confirmed plans to increase production on its large SUVs, especially on the Suburban/Yukon XL, citing lower gas prices and a higher demand for the vehicles. The move also resulted in its Arlington Assembly adding more hours and increasing its production from 48,000 SUVs to 60,000 based on the expanding hours and added Saturday overtime shifts.

The 2017 MY Suburban saw its biggest sales increase in January 2017, when it posted a 72.3% gain (5,634 units), the most ever since January 2008 when it had the 2008 MY Suburban.

==Twelfth generation (2021)==
On December 10, 2019, Chevrolet introduced the twelfth-generation Suburban at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan. This time around, GM chose to introduce the Chevrolet full-size SUVs first. The GMC Yukon XL was later introduced on January 14, 2020. Although the fifth-generation Cadillac Escalade made its debut on February 4, 2020, its extended length sibling Escalade ESV was the last GM full-size SUV to be introduced online in April 2020 after it was withdrawn from the cancelled 2020 New York International Auto Show. Originally scheduled to start in April 2020, due to the COVID-19 recession, GM postponed production of the Suburban to 13 July, 2020. The Suburban began entering dealerships in August 2020.

===Chevrolet Suburban===
====2021====

Based on the same GMT T1XX platform as the Silverado 1500, the Suburban distinguished itself by swapping that truck&#x27;s live axle and leaf springs for an independent rear multilink suspension setup with coil springs, thus lowering the floor of the vehicle and creating more room, in both the cargo area and the second- and third-row seats. The Suburban expanded its length to , and the wheelbase to while shortening down by longer than the Tahoe (as its wheelbase was moved back by ), making it the largest and longest SUV in the extended-length segment. It gains of cargo space behind the third row and of third-row legroom. The towing capabilities were increased with the twelfth-generation models.

The trims feature the primary basic LS, LT, and Premier levels, with the 4WD-exclusive Z71 and RST moving from package to premium levels, along with the newly added High Country level, the latter being the top of the line. Chevrolet rolled out the LT, Z71, Premier, and High Country levels first, with the LS and RST levels arriving in late Fall 2020.

Quad exhaust tailpipes are added to the vehicle, giving it a more unique look, although this feature is only standard on Premier and High Country. This feature isn&#x27;t offered on the LS, LT, Z71 and RST because of their configuration as regular base, off-road, and street-centric level trims respectively, nor on all trims with a Duramax option. The RST Suburban, which had photos released in April 2020, has a unique fascia and a sportier design similar to its Cadillac Escalade ESV Sport level trim. Both Premier and High Country trims have power-retractable assist steps that was optional on the Premier trim from the previous generation.

Although it retained a boxy look, it added a more curvaceous design with this change and adopted the same Chevrolet design language featuring the front grille and distinct LED lighting that is also used on the Silverado, save for the black-grilled Z71 (without the bumper) and RST. The tailgate is more front and center, with the signature &quot;Suburban&quot; name stretched across it. A combination of sheet metal and aluminum was used to ensure a more lightweight vehicle.
The dashboard and entertainment system have been fleshed out, moving away from the traditional design. Newly updated features include a 10.25-inch touch screen that is now standard on all trims, and a pair of 12.6-inch LCD rear screens that can play movies and offer content from passengers&#x27; smartphones and can play different programs on the two screens. A new push-button shifter column (P, R, N, D) is placed on the dashboard. Nine camera displays for enhanced towing capabilities and a total of 30 additional safety features have been implemented throughout the Suburban. An Air Ride Adaptive Suspension is standard on the higher trims, likewise with an 8-inch driver screen. Another new feature, a power sliding console that became available in late Summer 2020. The High Country Suburban also has a Deluxe package option with advance features that is exclusive to this trim only. The 40/20/40 front seat option that was available on the LS trim is now exclusive to fleet orders with this generation using the same base trim.

The Suburban also featured a Duramax diesel engine as an option (available on all trims and packages except for the Z71) for the first time, and so far the only brand outside its competitors to have this option; a 3.0-liter I6 is used which produces and of torque. The 6.2-liter EcoTec engine that was reserved for the RST trim in the previous generation is exclusive to the High Country level trim. The engine choices added up to improved fuel economy numbers, albeit with an increased MPG for city and a decreased MPG for highway. GM has no plans to offer this model in a 2500 or 3500 series version.

====2022====
For the 2022 model year, the Suburban saw an increased availability of the 6.2-liter V-8, which continues to be standard on High Country but can now be fitted to the RST, Z71, and Premier trim levels, and expands the Magnetic Ride Control damping system to the RST. The 12.3-inch screen (with Google Assistant, Google Maps, and the Google Play Store embedded) becomes standard on the higher trims except for the LS. A newly optional electronic limited-slip differential is now available on the Z71 trim and can be used in the 4WD Low setting.

==== 2025 refresh ====

On November 29, 2023, GM unveiled a refresh for both the Suburban and Tahoe models. The Suburban features a refreshed front and rear fascia with redesigned headlights and taillights similar to those from the 3rd-generation 2024 Chevrolet Traverse. Other changes include new 24-inch wheels, a new upgraded 3.0L Duramax diesel engine option with 10 percent more horsepower than the outgoing option (thus now being available on the Z71 trim level for the first time), a new revised interior with an all-new standard 17.7-inch-diagonal freeform infotainment screen paired with the 11-inch-diagonal driver information center and redesigned center console, new ride and handling enhancements, upgraded safety and technology including GM Super Cruise, and improved towing and trailering technology. The refreshed models will go on sale in late 2024 for the 2025 model year.

===Yukon XL===
====2021====
GMC unveiled its twelfth generation Yukon XL in Vail, Colorado on January 14, 2020, alongside its short-wheelbase sibling Yukon. Like the Suburban, the Yukon XL also featured an independent rear suspension, a 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel engine, and a top-shelf suspension option featuring air springs and magnetic-ride shocks, a standard 5.3-liter V8, an optional 6.2-liter V8, and a 10-speed automatic transmission that is standard across the lineup. It also gained in the wheelbase but only in overall length, making it still short of the Suburban&#x27;s length. The dashboard has two versions, one identical to the Suburban while a different one with a larger entertainment screen is exclusive to the Denali. The Yukon XL&#x27;s design follows GMC&#x27;s design language, with the front grille mimicking the Sierra but the tailgate mimicking the GMC crossover SUV lineup with the lights extended to the tailgate doors.

The lineup of level trims also expanded as well, with the SLE, SLT, and Denali now joined by the 4WD-exclusive AT4, the latter of which comes standard with the Magnetic Ride Control electronically adaptive dampers, AT4-exclusive leather-appointed seats, and stitching with a unique Jet Black interior color and Brandy accents, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, a two-speed transfer case, 20-inch Goodyear all-terrain tires, Traction Select System with off-road mode, hill descent control, and skid plates. The Denali level offers three packages for this generation, with Deluxe joining the Premium and Ultimate options, and became the only trim to offer quad exhaust tailpipes.

====2022====
For the 2022 model year, the Yukon XL added a few additions similar to the Suburban, among them a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that is now standard on all trims, with Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store embedded. The power sliding center console is now standard on the Denali trim. Redwood Metallic is added as a new color option.

===Suburban Shield / HD SUV===
In 2021, GM Defense was awarded a $36.4 million contract by the United States Department of State Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) for ten GMT T1XX-based prototype Suburban HD vehicles, with uprated suspension and an undisclosed powertrain; deliveries were scheduled for Spring 2023. The first prototype was shown to DSS leadership during a ride-and-drive event held at Summit Point Raceway on June 29, 2023. Under the terms of the contract, one prototype will be tested for survivability by shooting it with small arms and detonating small blasts; the other prototypes will be tested for durability.

The vehicle is named the Suburban Shield and was known as the Heavy-Duty Sport Utility Vehicle (HD SUV) during development. It is offered in 1LT and 2LT trims with 4WD and the &quot;L87&quot; 6.2L V8 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission standard; the 3.0L &quot;Duramax&quot; I-6 turbodiesel is an option. The primary differences between the trims is the seating configuration, with the 1LT featuring second and third row bench seats, which are captain&#x27;s chairs and jump seats, respectively, for the 2LT. The chassis is designated &quot;eBOF&quot; (Electric Body on Frame) and can accommodate a diverse set of powertrains, including battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell. Armor is integrated during the initial build, rather than having a finished vehicle torn down and reassembled by an aftermarket upfitter. Although many components and systems are shared with the commercial T1XX Suburban, including the body, exterior, interior, powertrain, and brakes, the chassis and frame are specific to the HD SUV to accommodate the increased weight; the chassis is based on the Silverado HD ZR2.

GM Defense was awarded an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract in November 2023 with a ceiling value of US$300 million; serial production is scheduled to commence in June 2024, resulting in up to 2,000 Shields being delivered over 10 years. It is assembled at a new GM Defense facility in Concord, North Carolina, near Charlotte Motor Speedway. The first regular production Shield was completed in October 2024.

===Availability===
For international regions, Chevrolet started selling the twelfth generation Suburban in Mexico in August 2020, but unlike the United States and Canada, Mexico only offered the Suburban in the LT, RST, and High Country trims; the LS, Z71, and Premier level trims and the Duramax option are not offered for that country. The American-built models will use the GM 10-speed automatic transmission with Electronic Precision Shift technology, manufactured at the GM Silao Complex in the state of Guanajuato in central Mexico. The Philippines began selling the 2021–present Suburban (with a possibility that it would offer a Duramax engine option in the country should Chevrolet make it available) in fall 2020, followed by the Middle East region. In November 2020, GM announced that their large SUV lineup would be imported to China, marking the Suburban&#x27;s maiden entry into the country, starting with the 12th generation models. GM put those plans on hold in February 2021, citing the difficulty of having an import sold alongside its Chinese-built offerings, the makeup of the facilities that would be required to assemble the large full-size SUVs, and concerns that the full-size SUVs would not be able to comply with China&#x27;s emission standards, as well as concerns that China&#x27;s internal combustion engine excise taxes imposed on all vehicles sold in China that are powered by ICE engines more than 3.0 liters will hurt sales of GM&#x27;s large full-size SUVs in the East Asian country.

A right-hand-drive version of Suburban for Australia and right-hand-drive markets to be done by Holden Special Vehicles, which was announced in December 2019, is on hold, citing the low demand, capacity issues at HSV, and highly competitive large luxury SUV and towing market in Australia, although that could change due to GM&#x27;s partnership with HSV to bring more American vehicles like the Suburban back down under the newly announced GMSV arrangement.

The Yukon XL officially went on sale for the first time ever in Mexico, starting in the Fall of 2020 with the 2021 models (GMC had only offered the Yukon in that country because GM did not want to have the Yukon XL cannibalized in terms of sales with the Suburban, which is also that country&#x27;s best-selling SUV), where it is only available in the Denali trim.

==Signature Editions==
Beginning with the 2018 model year, Chevrolet offered a &quot;Signature Edition&quot; package/trims of the Suburban. Each of the specialty versions were available at the LT and Premier level trims. Both the Z71 and RST became the fourth and fifth level trims starting with the twelfth generation Suburban for the 2021 model year, while the remaining continues as package features.

===Z71 and Texas Edition===
On September 26, 2014, Chevrolet debuted the updated Z71 Suburban at the State Fair of Texas, along with the debut of the Texas Edition Suburban, the latter due to Texas having the most units of Suburbans sold in the United States (As of August 2014, sales of the Chevrolet SUVs in Texas were up 37 percent) and to celebrate the 60th anniversary of GM&#x27;s Arlington Assembly plant; production of the Z71 Suburban began in October 2014.

As with the previous Z71 Suburbans, this version continued to be offered in a 4WD LT trim only, featuring a front skid plate, off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, a unique grille, running boards, and &quot;Z71&quot; identification inside and out. Fog lamps, front tow hooks, and front parking assist are also included. The 2016 Z71 package was modified again, as portions of the Z71 items added on the Texas Edition package as an optional feature by request from customers was discontinued, making it a stand-alone package. The Z71 package was upgraded to a level trim starting with the twelfth generation models.

The Texas Edition Suburban, which became part of the Texas Edition lineup along with the Tahoe and Silverado, was available in both LT and LTZ trims for the 2015 model year, featuring a maximum trailering package, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels (on LT models), twenty-two-inch premium painted aluminum wheels (on LTZ models), and an exclusive &quot;Texas Edition&quot; badge. For the 2016 model year, Chevrolet discontinued the LTZ package but modified for the LT package without the requested Z71 features. The twelfth-generation Suburban continues to offer the Texas Edition for the LT and Premier trims only when combined with the Luxury, LT Signature, and Premium packages.

===LT Signature Edition===
The Suburban LT Signature Edition, introduced in the 2018 model year, was an optional package trim, similar to the luxury package but with less expensive features, available in the LT level trim only. This option was discontinued after the 2019 model year but will be offered for the 2021 model year.

===Midnight Edition===
A Midnight Edition Suburban, an all-black optional package available in 4WD LT and Z71 versions, was introduced for the 2017 model year. This version became part of the Signature Edition Suburban feature for the 2018 model year up until the 2020 model year.

===Premier Plus===
On August 13, 2018, Chevrolet introduced a more upgraded version of the top-of-the-line Premier level trim of the Suburban, packaged as the Premier Plus, featuring a 6.2-liter engine, the classic gold bowtie emblems, chrome nameplate badging, and new polished 22-inch wheels. The interior is unique to these models, boasting with heated/ventilated Black-and-Mahogany leather front seats, Jet Black trim surround, a head-up display, and an eight-inch cluster. The exterior features standard cross rails, chrome power steps, and chrome exhaust tips. This feature was discontinued in the 2020 model year.

===RST Edition===
Chevrolet added a new package to the 2018 model year Suburban with the introduction of the street-themed RST (Rally Sport Truck) Special Edition Suburban. Originally at the time of the announcement, it was supposed to be available as an option for the LT and Premier trims as a Performance Package that included a , 6.2-liter V-8 engine, a Magnetic Ride Control with performance calibration, and an all-new Hydra-Matic 10L80 10-speed automatic transmission. The press release also detailed additional features; The chrome elements are absent as body-color grilles surround the door and handles, along with an added gloss-black grille and mirror caps, black roof rails, window trim, badging and Chevy bowties, an exclusive 22-inch wheels wrapped in Bridgestone P285/45R 22 tires, a Borla performance exhaust system, massive front red Brembo six-piston, fixed aluminum calipers with brake pads clamping on larger-than-stock Duralife rotors, coupled with an 84 percent increase in brake pad area and a 42 percent increase in rotor area to increase system thermal capacity.

However, after the press release, Chevrolet confirmed that the RST Suburban would only be available as an appearance package, as the 6.2-liter engine would not be used for the 2018 model year. But on May 4, 2018, Chevrolet expanded the RST package to the Suburban as an option for the 2019 model year that will now include the 10-speed automatic transmission and 6.2L engine, reversing a decision made by GM that it would be exclusive to GMC and Cadillac&#x27;s Suburban siblings Yukon XL and Escalade ESV. The packaged trim went on sale in July 2018. The RST package option became a level trim with the twelfth-generation Suburban for the 2021 model year.

==Additional changes==
===Upgrades===
GM offered another off-road variant or trim for the Suburban and Yukon XL starting with the eleventh generation. With the relaunch of the Z71 package in the Suburban for the 2015–2020 models, GM filed papers to trademark the Trail Boss name for use on future Chevrolet truck and SUV models, although they were never used for the Suburban trims.

===Concept versions===
On November 4, 2013, Chevrolet unveiled a concept design for the Suburban called the Half-Pipe, whose features include roof racks and crossbars to mount skis, at the SEMA Show. Afterwards, Chevrolet made its parts available for order at Chevrolet Accessories.

At the 2017 SEMA Show, a 4×4 off-road Suburban concept inspired by Country singer (and Chevrolet spokesman) Luke Bryan based around his 2016 song &quot;Huntin&#x27;, Fishin&#x27; and Lovin&#x27; Every Day&quot; was introduced, decked out in custom Hunter Bronze exterior color with Dark Carbon accents and camo graphics, a roof-mounted light rack and a custom lower fascia, a liftgate re-engineered to swing outward rather than upward and incorporates a custom spare tire mount, 22-inch wheels with 35-inch-tall tires, roof-mounted equipment carrier with a fishing rod holder, an interior design consisting of Black and Two-Tone Olive with Argon Orange, unique seating featuring Argon piping and Platinum camo-pattern perforated designs, and the &quot;Huntin&#x27;, Fishin&#x27; and Lovin&#x27; Every Day&quot; badges (designated by symbols in lieu of the words) displayed on both the exterior and interior. The rear windows are removed. The concept was inspired by Bryan himself and collaborated with Chevrolet on this project as he is an owner of a Suburban: &quot;Chevy has been part of our family and a part of our work life on the farm for as long as I can remember,&quot; says Bryan. &quot;If you were a Bryan, you drove a Chevy — and I&#x27;m a longtime Suburban owner. This partnership is a natural fit for me and this unique Suburban represents everything I and my family want for our outdoor adventures.&quot;

===Aftermarket options===
In 2011, Callaway Cars offered an upgraded Eaton supercharger package to the Suburban for an additional $15,995 (~$ in ).

In 2014, Callaway once again offered a supercharged version of the new 2015 K2XX Suburban.

In 2015, Corsa Performance added a cat-back exhaust system package for customers looking to upgrade their K2XX Suburban or Yukon XL, which would give the 5.3-liter versions a 669% flow increase and the 6.2-liter versions a 342% flow increase.

In 2018, Freedom Mobility partnered with GM to have their trucks and SUVs equipped with features that will make it accessible to disabled and visible/hearing impaired drivers or passengers. The Suburban is among the selected vehicles that will be available with this option.

==Military applications==
When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6-liter turbo diesel engine. As GM has periodically redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001 to the present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.

The militarization of the standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook, tow shackles, and a 24/12-volt electrical system. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie-down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories. In the Canadian Army these vehicles are nicknamed &quot;Milverado&quot;.

The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking rear differential, beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system, and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units have been sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.

==Recalls==
On March 28, 2014, GM announced a recall on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL in order to fix a &quot;transmission oil cooler line that is not securely seated in its fitting,&quot; causing the vehicle to stop and rupture the oil cooling line, resulting in the engine to malfunction and catch fire immediately. The move comes on the heels on an incident that happened on March 23, 2014, when a 2015 GMC Yukon caught fire in Anaheim, California during a test drive. Despite being an isolated incident, the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL are not tied to GM&#x27;s announced recall of its vehicles (from previous generation models and discontinued brands that were produced prior to, during, and after GM&#x27;s restructuring in 2010) that was made on March 17, 2014.

On June 6, 2014, GM issued another recall on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL because their radio control modules may not work, and thus prevent certain audible safety warnings. This would be followed on June 27 with another recall, in which the transfer case &quot;may electronically switch to neutral without input from the driver,&quot; adding that if this occurs while the vehicle is moving, power will not be sent to the wheels, meaning that if the vehicle is parked, it may roll away unexpectedly if the parking brake has not been set.

On December 5, 2014, GM announced that it is replacing ignition key units on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL after customers made complaints that the shift lever strikes the head of the key if the tilt-adjustable steering column is in the fully up position. The lever only can be moved out of &quot;park&quot; into a gear when the engine is running and the driver&#x27;s foot is on the brake. The push-button ignition features are not affected.

On January 4, 2015, GM issued a recall on tenth-generation Suburbans and Yukon XLs from the 2011 and 2012 model years for a potential ignition lock actuator issue, citing that they are not the right size and can cause the ignition to get stuck in the &quot;Start&quot; position, and then either due to a jarring event or a &quot;cool interior temperature&quot; the ignition could switch back to the &quot;Accessory&quot; position, resulting in a loss of power assistance and prevent the airbags from deploying.

On December 30, 2015, the NHTSA revealed that it had received complaints from 2015 Suburban/Yukon XL owners about buffeting and vibration problems causing drivers and passengers to endure an annoying vibration inside the cabin so severe that it leads to dizziness and headaches. GM is aware of this and has moved to correct the situation and try to pinpoint the source, but assures the vehicles are safe to drive.

On May 3, 2016, GM placed a recall on both 2016 model Suburbans and Yukon XLs over inadequate welds on their upper front control arms, which could result in an accident or injury.

On February 4, 2017, GM issued a recall of 2016 and 2017 Chevrolet Suburban HD models over an improperly fixed right-hand rear-view outside mirror which GM says will be replaced for free. The recall affected 211 vehicles.

<text>Bevan John Docherty (born 29 March 1977) is a triathlete from New Zealand, who won medals twice at the Olympic Games. Docherty attended Tauhara College, Taupō.

==Life==
Docherty and his sister Fiona grew up in Taupō, in the North Island of New Zealand and attended Tauhara College. Their father Ray was a keen triathlete and their mother, Irene, her sister and Bevan trained and competed with him.

In 2004, Docherty won the ITU world championship, and the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, behind fellow New Zealander Hamish Carter. He added another silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and claimed the bronze at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The former world champion has started a new initiative, called &quot;The Docherty Dares programme&quot;, aimed at supporting Kiwis to achieve goals they previously never thought possible.

The programme was inspired when Docherty saw Christchurch local, Scott Kotoul, crossing the finish line at the Round Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. Near exhaustion after only doing half the distance (80 km), Kotoul said he was only going to target the distance of 40 km by the following year. However, Docherty dared Kotoul to enter the entire 160 km bike, so the latter accepted the challenge.

<text>In structural engineering, a tensile structure is a construction of elements carrying only tension and no compression or bending. The term &quot;tensile&quot; should not be confused with tensegrity, which is a structural form with both tension and compression elements. Tensile structures are the most common type of thin-shell structures.

Most tensile structures are supported by some form of compression or bending elements, such as masts (as in The O2, formerly the Millennium Dome), compression rings or beams.

A tensile membrane structure is most often used as a roof, as they can economically and attractively span large distances. Tensile membrane structures may also be used as complete buildings, with a few common applications being sports facilities, warehousing and storage buildings, and exhibition venues.

== History ==

This form of construction has only become more rigorously analyzed and widespread in large structures in the latter part of the twentieth century. Tensile structures have long been used in tents, where the guy ropes and tent poles provide pre-tension to the fabric and allow it to withstand loads.

Russian engineer Vladimir Shukhov was one of the first to develop practical calculations of stresses and deformations of tensile structures, shells and membranes. Shukhov designed eight tensile structures and thin-shell structures exhibition pavilions for the Nizhny Novgorod Fair of 1896, covering the area of 27,000 square meters. A more recent large-scale use of a membrane-covered tensile structure is the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, constructed in 1958.

Antonio Gaudi used the concept in reverse to create a compression-only structure for the Colonia Guell Church. He created a hanging tensile model of the church to calculate the compression forces and to experimentally determine the column and vault geometries.

The concept was later championed by German architect and engineer Frei Otto, whose first use of the idea was in the construction of the West German pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. Otto next used the idea for the roof of the Olympic Stadium for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

Since the 1960s, tensile structures have been promoted by designers and engineers such as Ove Arup, Buro Happold, Frei Otto, Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, Eero Saarinen, Horst Berger, Matthew Nowicki, Jörg Schlaich, and David Geiger.

Steady technological progress has increased the popularity of fabric-roofed structures. The low weight of the materials makes construction easier and cheaper than standard designs, especially when vast open spaces have to be covered.

== Types of structure with significant tension members ==

=== Linear structures ===

*Suspension bridges
*Stressed ribbon bridge
*Draped cables
*Cable-stayed beams or trusses
*Cable trusses
*Straight tensioned cables

=== Three-dimensional structures ===

*Bicycle wheel (can be used as a roof in a horizontal orientation)
*3D cable trusses
*Tensegrity structures

=== Surface-stressed structures ===

*Prestressed membranes
*Pneumatically stressed membranes
* Gridshell
* Fabric structure

== Cable and membrane structures ==

=== Membrane materials ===

Common materials for doubly curved fabric structures are PTFE-coated fiberglass and PVC-coated polyester. These are woven materials with different strengths in different directions. The warp fibers (those fibers which are originally straight—equivalent to the starting fibers on a loom) can carry greater load than the weft or fill fibers, which are woven between the warp fibers.

Other structures make use of ETFE film, either as single layer or in cushion form (which can be inflated, to provide good insulation properties or for aesthetic effect—as on the Allianz Arena in Munich). ETFE cushions can also be etched with patterns in order to let different levels of light through when inflated to different levels.

In daylight, fabric membrane translucency offers soft diffused naturally lit spaces, while at night, artificial lighting can be used to create an ambient exterior luminescence. They are most often supported by a structural frame as they cannot derive their strength from double curvature.

=== Cables ===

Cables can be of mild steel, high strength steel (drawn carbon steel), stainless steel, polyester or aramid fibres. Structural cables are made of a series of small strands twisted or bound together to form a much larger cable. Steel cables are either spiral strand, where circular rods are twisted together and &quot;glued&quot; using a polymer, or locked coil strand, where individual interlocking steel strands form the cable (often with a spiral strand core).

Spiral strand is slightly weaker than locked coil strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a Young&#x27;s modulus, &quot;E&quot; of 150±10 kN/mm2 (or 150±10 GPa) and come in sizes from 3 to 90 mm diameter. Spiral strand suffers from construction stretch, where the strands compact when the cable is loaded. This is normally removed by pre-stretching the cable and cycling the load up and down to 45% of the ultimate tensile load.

Locked coil strand typically has a Young&#x27;s Modulus of 160±10 kN/mm2 and comes in sizes from 20 mm to 160 mm diameter.

The properties of the individual strands of different materials are shown in the table below, where UTS is ultimate tensile strength, or the breaking load:

=== Structural forms ===

Air-supported structures are a form of tensile structures where the fabric envelope is supported by pressurised air only.

The majority of fabric structures derive their strength from their doubly curved shape. By forcing the fabric to take on double-curvature the fabric gains sufficient stiffness to withstand the loads it is subjected to (for example wind and snow loads). In order to induce an adequately doubly curved form it is most often necessary to pretension or prestress the fabric or its supporting structure.

=== Form-finding ===

The behaviour of structures which depend upon prestress to attain their strength is non-linear, so anything other than a very simple cable has, until the 1990s, been very difficult to design. The most common way to design doubly curved fabric structures was to construct scale models of the final buildings in order to understand their behaviour and to conduct form-finding exercises. Such scale models often employed stocking material or tights, or soap film, as they behave in a very similar way to structural fabrics (they cannot carry shear).

Soap films have uniform stress in every direction and require a closed boundary to form. They naturally form a minimal surface—the form with minimal area and embodying minimal energy. They are however very difficult to measure. For a large film, its weight can seriously affect its form.

For a membrane with curvature in two directions, the basic equation of equilibrium is:

: formula_1

where:

*&quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2 are the principal radii of curvature for soap films or the directions of the warp and weft for fabrics
*&quot;t&quot;1 and &quot;t&quot;2 are the tensions in the relevant directions
*&quot;w&quot; is the load per square metre

Lines of principal curvature have no twist and intersect other lines of principal curvature at right angles.

A geodesic or geodetic line is usually the shortest line between two points on the surface. These lines are typically used when defining the cutting pattern seam-lines. This is due to their relative straightness after the planar cloths have been generated, resulting in lower cloth wastage and closer alignment with the fabric weave.

In a pre-stressed but unloaded surface &quot;w&quot; = 0, so formula_2.

In a soap film surface tensions are uniform in both directions, so &quot;R&quot;1 = −&quot;R&quot;2.

It is now possible to use powerful non-linear numerical analysis programs (or finite element analysis) to formfind and design fabric and cable structures. The programs must allow for large deflections.

The final shape, or form, of a fabric structure depends upon:

*shape, or pattern, of the fabric
*the geometry of the supporting structure (such as masts, cables, ringbeams etc.)
*the pretension applied to the fabric or its supporting structure

It is important that the final form will not allow ponding of water, as this can deform the membrane and lead to local failure or progressive failure of the entire structure.

Snow loading can be a serious problem for membrane structure, as the snow often will not flow off the structure as water will. For example, this has in the past caused the (temporary) collapse of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, an air-inflated structure in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Some structures prone to ponding use heating to melt snow which settles on them.

There are many different doubly curved forms, many of which have special mathematical properties. The most basic doubly curved from is the saddle shape, which can be a hyperbolic paraboloid (not all saddle shapes are hyperbolic paraboloids). This is a double ruled surface and is often used in both in lightweight shell structures (see hyperboloid structures). True ruled surfaces are rarely found in tensile structures. Other forms are anticlastic saddles, various radial, conical tent forms and any combination of them.

=== Pretension ===

Pretension is tension artificially induced in the structural elements in addition to any self-weight or imposed loads they may carry. It is used to ensure that the normally very flexible structural elements remain stiff under all possible loads.

A day to day example of pretension is a shelving unit supported by wires running from floor to ceiling. The wires hold the shelves in place because they are tensioned – if the wires were slack the system would not work.

Pretension can be applied to a membrane by stretching it from its edges or by pretensioning cables which support it and hence changing its shape. The level of pretension applied determines the shape of a membrane structure.

=== Alternative form-finding approach ===

The alternative approximated approach to the form-finding problem solution is based on the total energy balance of a grid-nodal system. Due to its physical meaning this approach is called the stretched grid method (SGM).

== Simple mathematics of cables ==

=== Transversely and uniformly loaded cable ===

A uniformly loaded cable spanning between two supports forms a curve intermediate between a catenary curve and a parabola. The simplifying assumption can be made that it approximates a circular arc (of radius &quot;R&quot;).


By equilibrium:

The horizontal and vertical reactions :

:formula_3
:formula_4

By geometry:

The length of the cable:

:formula_5

The tension in the cable:

:formula_6

By substitution:

:formula_7

The tension is also equal to:

:formula_8

The extension of the cable upon being loaded is (from Hooke&#x27;s Law, where the axial stiffness, &quot;k,&quot; is equal to formula_9):

:formula_10

where &quot;E&quot; is the Young&#x27;s modulus of the cable and &quot;A&quot; is its cross-sectional area.

If an initial pretension, formula_11 is added to the cable, the extension becomes:

:formula_12

Combining the above equations gives:

:formula_13

By plotting the left hand side of this equation against &quot;T,&quot; and plotting the right hand side on the same axes, also against &quot;T,&quot; the intersection will give the actual equilibrium tension in the cable for a given loading &quot;w&quot; and a given pretension formula_11.

=== Cable with central point load ===

A similar solution to that above can be derived where:

By equilibrium:

:formula_15

:formula_16

By geometry:

:formula_17

This gives the following relationship:

:formula_18

As before, plotting the left hand side and right hand side of the equation against the tension, &quot;T,&quot; will give the equilibrium tension for a given pretension, formula_11 and load, &quot;W&quot;.

== Tensioned cable oscillations ==

The fundamental natural frequency, &quot;f&quot;1 of tensioned cables is given by:

:formula_20

where &quot;T&quot; = tension in newtons, &quot;m&quot; = mass in kilograms and &quot;L&quot; = span length.

<doc id="947385" wikidata="Q1454911" url="?curid=947385" title="Lockheed X-7">
<text>The Lockheed X-7 (dubbed the &quot;Flying Stove Pipe&quot;) is an American unmanned test bed of the 1950s for ramjet engines and missile guidance technology. It was the basis for the later Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher, a system used to test American air defenses against nuclear missile attack.

==Early development==
Development of the Kingfisher was first initiated in December 1946. The X-7 was called into production by the United States Air Force requirement for the development of an unmanned ramjet test plane with a top speed of at least .

The X-7 project was developed under the AMC designator MX-883 and was given in the Lockheed in-house designation L-171. The L-171 was initially designated the PTV-A-1 by the USAF but was later designated the X-7 in 1951. Despite its first launch being a failure, after re-development of the original ramjet, following test flights were successful. A total of 130 X-7 flights were conducted from April 1951 to July 1960.

==Purpose==
The X-7 laid the foundation for the AQM-60 Kingfisher. Being the testbed for several yearlong projects, the X-7 underwent many structural changes to adapt more closely for its intended purpose. The Kingfisher was put up against three surface to air missiles designed to test the capabilities of the X-7; SAM-A-7/MIM-3 &quot;Nike Ajax&quot;, SAM-A-25/MIM-14 &quot;Nike Hercules&quot;, and IM-99/CIM-10 &quot;Bomarc&quot; were the missiles used in the tests. During the testing of the SAMs, the X-7 outperformed the missiles and a very small number of critical hits were achieved. Due to pressure and embarrassment of the military, the X-7 project was terminated in the mid-1960s.

Besides the surface to air missile tests, the X-7 project was also used to test communication equipment for acceleration tests, testing aerodynamics, booster propellants, thermodynamics, and parachutes.
==Construction==
The X-7 was constructed from steel, unlike its successors such as the A-12 and YF-12 which used titanium. These X-7 planes had wings constructed from stainless steel and a fuselage made from a nickel alloy. The use of steel was due to the inability of aluminum to endure air friction heating at hypersonic speeds, years before the widespread introduction of titanium.

The engines developed for the X-7/AQM-60 were designed to operate for a short time, to test the design for the CIM-10 Bomarc. They were redesigned with better materials for use on the hypersonic Lockheed D-21 drone launched from the back of a Lockheed M-21, a derivative of the Lockheed A-12, or from under the wing of a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.

==Launch and recovery==

The X-7 was launched at speed release from the underside of either a B-29 or B-50 carrier plane. The jet would then take over and build up speed to its top speed of , but was later redesigned to push .

The recovery method of the X-7 rocket plane was a new and simple design for a test plane of its kind but functioned as designed. A multi-stage parachute was deployed after the jet had exhausted its fuel, slowing its descent. Once it had reached the ground, the long metal rod on the end of the nose penetrated the ground, keeping the plane upright and preventing damage to the structure of the X-7. 

In 1954, the modified X-7 underwent significant changes and was renamed the X-7A-3. The wing shape was altered, and two small boosters were added to the plane, one under each wing. Due to these alterations, the drop method previously used was changed. The previous version was a complicated, bulky under-wing system, while the new design allowed for a simple fuselage-mounted dropping system. This system was used until its final flight in July 1960.

<text>The Chevrolet Tahoe (), and its badge-engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs and other trucks from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their &quot;Blazer&quot; and &quot;Jimmy&quot; nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the &quot;Yukon&quot; in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer the &quot;new Blazer,&quot; while renaming the full-size Blazer as the &quot;Tahoe.&quot; The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States, and was originally used as a trim level on S-10 models. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada.

For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer four-door model, slotting in size between the two-door models and the longer-wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.

The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines, and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand-drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.

The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon are part of General Motors&#x27; full-size SUV family and are differentiated from the similar Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C-pillar. An upscale trim GMC Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup as the top-of-the-line trim for the 1999 model year; the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform. The Denali is available on both standard and XL versions.

The Tahoe has regularly been the best-selling full-size SUV in the United States, frequently outselling its competition by two to one.


== First generation (1992) ==

The new GMC Yukon was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, succeeding the 2nd generation (K5) Jimmy, while Chevrolet continued to use the Blazer name on its third-generation K5 model, through the 1994 model year. Removable hard-tops were dropped. All models now had a full-length steel roof, and were 2-door wagons only, through 1994.

However, for 1995, the &quot;Blazer&quot; nameplate was discontinued (now used only on the mid-size GMT325 Blazer), and the model was rebranded as the all-new Chevrolet Tahoe, while also adding all-new, longer 4-door versions, for both brands. Four-door Yukon and Tahoe production started on January 20, 1995, at Janesville Assembly. The Tahoe was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year for 1996.

The Tahoe and Yukon are considerably shorter than the Suburban on which they are based, but share that vehicle&#x27;s &quot;GMT400&quot; platform. It is built on a true truck chassis, derived from the one in the C/K 1500 full-size pickup truck. Both two-door and four-door models were produced in rear- and four-wheel drive versions. Four-door models had a longer wheelbase, and greater length than the two-door models. Two-door models weighed roughly while four-door models weighed about . Tahoes were available in base, LS, and LT trim levels, and the Yukon in base, SLE, and SLT. A &quot;Yukon GT&quot; trim level on 1992–1994 2-door Yukons was also available, featuring monochromatic grille, front and rear bumpers, &quot;Yukon GT&quot; badges on both doors, and bucket seating with center console. &quot;AutoTrac&quot; full-time all-wheel drive and a programmable Homelink garage door transmitter were added for 1998. The upscale Denali trim line for the Yukon was introduced in 1999.

The standard engine was Chevrolet&#x27;s small-block V8, while a turbocharged Detroit Diesel V8 was available beginning in 1994. The 6.5-liter turbo diesel was only available in two-door 4WD models and was detuned to torque to account for the Tahoe&#x27;s rear axle capacity. Transmissions included a four-speed automatic and five-speed manual; the latter transmission was only offered on two-door 4WD models and was discontinued after 1995.

In Mexico, the two-door Tahoe was released in 1995, called the Chevrolet Silverado, and in 1998, the four-door model was released as the Silverado 4-door. Both models were available with the Base, LS, or luxury LT trim packages. In Venezuela, the two-door Tahoe was released in 1993 (4WD only), called the Chevrolet Grand Blazer, and in 1996, the four-door model was released as the Grand Blazer 4-door (2WD). In 1996, the 2-door was discontinued and only the Grand Blazer 4-door 4WD was available. In Bolivia, the four-door model was released in 1995 as the Tahoe 4-door (4WD).

Beginning in 1994, GM began making numerous annual changes to the Blazer/Yukon, including:
* Revised front clip – Blazer and Yukon (1994)
* Revised interior including a driver-side airbag and other new features, revised side mirrors, Blazer renamed Tahoe, four-door option included (1995)
* Revised &quot;Vortec 5700&quot; (350 cu in) engine with increased power and fuel efficiency, 2-door models now available with 2WD, electronic 4WD shifting, daytime running lights, and illuminated entry (1996)
* Revised front clip – Mexican-market Silverado (1996)
* Revised automatic transmission, new EVO (electronic variable orifice) speed-sensitive power steering system and added passenger-side airbag, last year of the two-door Yukon (1997)
* Programmable Homelink garage door transmitter, PassLock security system, heated front seats optional, air conditioning for rear seat passengers, AutoTrac automatic 4WD option added, second-generation airbags, transmissions revised again (1998)
* Last year of the two-door Tahoe (1999)

=== Tahoe Limited and Tahoe Z71 ===

When the GMT800-based Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon was released for the 2000 model year, a 2WD Tahoe Limited and 4WD Tahoe Z71 remained in production on the GMT400 platform as special edition vehicles. These vehicles were produced in the Arlington, Texas, assembly plant for the 2000 model year only.

The Chevrolet Tahoe Limited was based on the Chevrolet Tahoe SS concept vehicle introduced in 1996 that never made it to production. It is reported that GM disliked the idea of an SS-badged vehicle at a time when insurance companies were already demanding higher premiums for SUVs. The Tahoe SS prototype vehicles made in 1996 were painted either an unspecified metallic green or metallic blue, but the Tahoe Limited was produced only in &quot;Onyx Black&quot;. The Tahoe Limited had a distinctive exterior appearance that included a factory equipped ground effects package, a monochromatic theme with bumpers and grille painted in the same high gloss black as the body, removal of the roof rack, and fog lamps integrated into the front bumper. Other notable features of the Tahoe Limited included the Z60 high-performance chassis package (commonly known as the police package) which places the body of the vehicle lower than the 4WD Tahoe, two-tone gray and charcoal leather interior seating surfaces, a gauge cluster, Bilstein shock absorbers, a 3.42:1 or optional 3.73:1 rear axle ratio, a limited slip rear differential, an engine oil cooling system, and distinctive 16-inch Ronal R36 five-spoke aluminum wheels wearing 255/70R16 tires.
The Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 also exhibited a monochromatic appearance similar to the Tahoe Limited, but instead of &quot;Onyx Black&quot;, the Tahoe Z71 was offered in either &quot;Light Pewter Metallic&quot;, &quot;Victory Red&quot;, &quot;Emerald Green Metallic&quot;, or &quot;Indigo Blue Metallic&quot;. Features of the Tahoe Z71 were similar to those of the Tahoe Limited with a few key differences to distinguish the 2WD Tahoe Limited from the 4WD Tahoe Z71. Features that differ from those previously mentioned on the Tahoe Limited included the Z71 off-road chassis package ( Bilstein shock absorbers, a standard 3.73:1 rear axle ratio for the G80 locking differential), color-keyed wheel flares, trim, grille, and bumpers, underbody skid plates, inset driving lights built into the center of the front bumper, oversized two-row radiator, two-tone leather seating surfaces in either a gray or neutral theme, distinctive taillamp lens protectors, black tubular side assist step bars, black brush guard, and distinctive 16-inch Alcoa five-spoke six-lug polished aluminum wheels.

The L31 5.7L Vortec V8 powerplant and 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission shared with other GMT400 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles were not modified in these special edition vehicles, and as such, these special editions were mostly appearance packages, albeit with unique-handling suspension options.

=== GMC Yukon Denali ===

In 1998, at the time of its introduction, the Yukon Denali was GM&#x27;s answer to the Lincoln Navigator. GM, however, soon introduced the Escalade – a Yukon Denali clone under the Cadillac nameplate, which competed directly with the Lincoln. The Yukon Denali&#x27;s exterior was shared with the Escalade, with the entire front clip and lower side body panels differing from those of the standard Yukon. In the interior, the Denali featured luxury options not available in the Yukon. These included an upgraded leather interior, power seats, heated front and rear seats, Bose stereo system, and woodgrain trim on the dashboard. The 1999 Yukon Denali and Escalade also saw the first application of GM&#x27;s OnStar communications system in a full-size SUV. This generation Yukon Denali (and the Escalade) was kept on the GMT400 platform for the 2000 model year, while the remainder of the lineup was changed to the new GMT800.

=== Engines ===

== Second generation (2000) ==

Other than the Tahoe Limited and Z71, the vehicle was redesigned and launched in January 2000 for the 2000 model year on the new &quot;GMT800&quot; platform, still shared with the full-sized pickups and SUVs. Two new engines replaced the 5.7 L (350 cu in) Chevrolet small-block V8, and while both were smaller, both produced more horsepower but less torque. In Mexico, the GMT800 Chevrolet Tahoe is called the Chevrolet Sonora. A 2-door GMT800 Tahoe prototype was made but never entered production. Suburban and Tahoe models sold in Mexico still offered the 5.7 L small-block Chevrolet V8 (RPO code L31) as an option in early models, whereas it was replaced by the new 5.3 L Vortec V8 engine (or the 4.8 L Vortec V8 in base Tahoe models) in all other markets.

Both vehicles received significant updates with only the grille, headlights and body-side moldings distinguishing one from the other. Both vehicles now featured softer lines as part of a more aerodynamic design. The interior was also updated with new seats, dashboard, and door panels.

=== GMC Yukon Denali ===

Even though the Yukon was redesigned alongside the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe in 2000, the Denali and Escalade remained on the GMT400 platform. It was not until 2001 that the Denali and Escalade were redesigned. While the Escalade departed from its Yukon-based exterior design scheme in attempt to hide its roots, the Yukon Denali&#x27;s exterior is almost the same as that of a post-2000 model year GMT800 Yukon. A larger 6.0 L engine, embossed side body panels, slightly reworked headlights with projector-beam lenses and reworked turn signal indicators, exclusive six-spoke 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with &quot;GMC&quot; embossed center caps, unique chrome &quot;punch&quot; grille, monochromatic front bumper with unique rounded fog lamps, monochromatic rear bumper, &quot;DENALI&quot; lettering on both front doors, exclusive two-tone leather seating surfaces with heated second row seats, a Driver Information Center module located in the center console, premium Bose Lux sound system with optional rear DVD entertainment system, and &quot;YUKON DENALI&quot; stitching on interior door surfaces and front headrests differentiate the Yukon Denali from the regular Yukon. 2001 also saw the introduction of the aforementioned &quot;punch&quot; grille, which has since become a hallmark of the Denali submodel. The Yukon Denali of this generation is powered by the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 V8, which was also found in the 2001 GMC Sierra C3 Denali. The Yukon Denali received a minor interior refresh for the 2003 model year. This refresh updated the gauge cluster, center console/armrest, and steering wheel. Ths redesign relocated the revised Driver Information Center/odometer to the bottom of the gauge cluster, and was now operated by buttons along the bottom of the newly revised steering wheel (the top portion of the wheel held newly revised audio controls). A storage cubby was placed in lieu of the 2001–2002 Driver Information Center module, and the armrest was no longer a locking armrest. This refresh also saw the removal of the &quot;Yukon Denali&quot; interior embossments that were previously used on the 2001–2002 Denali&#x27;s interior panels and headrests. The second row seating arrangements were now standard heated captain&#x27;s chairs instead of the previous second row bench seat. A premium Bose DVD-based navigation system and Bose subwoofer were also added as available options for 2003.

A new all-electric cooling system helps with quiet operation as well as fuel efficiency. New aerodynamic changes, including a new front air deflector, help the Tahoe improve fuel efficiency by about 1 MPG.

New colors include &quot;Sandstone Metallic&quot; and &quot;Bermuda Blue Metallic&quot;.

==== 2006 ==== 
2006 marked the final year of the Tahoe and Yukon on the GMT800 platform, and because of this, only minor changes were made. These changes included StabiliTrak becoming standard on all models, button for StabiliTrak now located were dashboard cubby was in previous years. Combining the OnStar and XM Satellite Radio antennas into one single &quot;Shark Fin&quot; antenna, removal of the Chevrolet badging on the liftgate, removal of front lower door carpet, relocating the catalytic converter closer to the engine to improve emissions performance, and a new manual parking brake adjuster.

&quot;Bermuda Blue Metallic&quot; now becomes an extra-cost option.

The flex-fuel capable Vortec 5300 V8 is now rated at on regular gasoline, and is now available on all retail packages. The Vortec 4800 V8 was no longer available on 4WD models.

== Third generation (2007) ==

General Motors redesigned the Tahoe and Yukon on the new &quot;GMT900&quot; platform for the 2007 model year. A hybrid version of the Tahoe/Yukon, which uses the shared GM/Chrysler Advanced Hybrid System 2, followed with the 2008 models. The GMT900-based Tahoe and Yukon exceeded initial sales expectations and continued to sell well despite a weakening market for large SUVs. The short-wheelbase Tahoe and its police counterpart began production at Arlington Assembly on December 1, 2005. SWB Yukon production began in early 2006, with Janesville Assembly coming online as well. For the first time, GM used the Tahoe name in Mexico.

For 2007, the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe received different front fascias, hood, and tail lights. The GMC Yukon boasted a monolithic grille and headlights, while the Chevrolet Tahoe grille was divided by a body-colored bar similar to the chrome bar found on the GMT800 Tahoe. Both the redesigned Yukon and Tahoe featured a more crisp, upright, angular design that gave the vehicles a prominent, more upscale appearance than that of their predecessors. The interior was significantly redesigned as well, with features such as a faux wood trim dashboard with chrome-accented instrument controls and new inset gauge cluster design. New door panels, as well as new seats, were also added to the interior. The interior still retains its nine-passenger seating availability, but only on the base Tahoe 1LS/Yukon SLE models, like the Suburban and Yukon XL counterparts. The Tahoe/Suburban 1LS would now become the base model for 2007, adding the premium LTZ trim level as the upper Tahoe/Suburban equipment level. The Yukon/Yukon XL would retain its SLE/SLT/Denali trims.

Highway mileage was improved from to with the addition of Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation. For 2009, the 6.2 L engine in the Yukon Denali got a power increase to , while a 6.2L was added as an option for the Tahoe LTZ. A 6-speed 6L80 automatic transmission replaced the 4-speed on all trucks except 2WD models with the 4.8L engine. The 2011 model has a NHTSA rollover risk of 24.6%, and a lateral roadholding of 0.79g.

In 2008, a two-mode hybrid was introduced with two trim levels, HY1 or HY2. This paired a &quot;LFA&quot; 6.0L Vortec 6000 V8 with a hybrid drive unit that acted as an infinitely variable transmission, which included a pair of / torque electric motors. The coefficient of drag improved from 0.36 to 0.34 by using upgraded body panels; the vehicles retained a 12V battery for most accessory electrical gear and added a high-voltage (288V) traction battery system. The hybrid version uses aluminum body panels and driveline components which collectively offset the increased weight from the drive unit and battery, putting the hybrid at . The hybrid models also included 300V Electric AC, 42V power steering, and LED taillights (only an option from 2008 to 2013). This variant was named the Green Car of the Year for 2008 by &quot;Green Car Journal&quot;, a decision which was later lampooned during a segment of the BBC series &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Fuel consumption improved from city/highway to .

During the 2009 model year, LTZ models had the option of the 6.2L Vortec 6200. The option was dropped after only one model year.

2010 models underwent a mild mid-cycle refresh including a slightly raised bumper, removal of the GM &quot;Mark of Excellence&quot; door badge, revised interior door trim, improved side structure, side torso airbags and optional side blind zone alert.

For 2012, the GMC Yukon offered a special Heritage Edition package, featuring unique Heritage Edition exterior badging, embroidered color-keyed carpeted floor mats, embroidered headrests, SLT-2 Equipment Group standard features (such as 10-way memory leather seats and power liftgate), and optional 20-inch wheels. The Heritage Edition added $1,970 to the price of the Yukon and Yukon XL and was offered in three colors, &quot;Heritage Blue&quot;, &quot;White Diamond Tricoat&quot;, and &quot;Onyx Black&quot;.

=== GMC Yukon Denali ===

The Yukon Denali was redesigned for the 2007 model year alongside the regular mainstream Yukon. The biggest change was in the styling, such as the flattened tailgate reminiscent of the new Tahoe, and particularly the grill and headlight shapes, which made the Yukon look less aggressive than previous models. The only exterior difference between the Yukon Denali and the standard Yukon are the chrome grille and extensive use of chrome accents and the Escalade rear bumper; and of course the insignias, embeveled rocker panels, chromed headlights, and the Vortec 6200 engine, which it shares with the Cadillac Escalade. For the 2009 model year, the Yukon came fitted with a standard power-tilting steering wheel, exclusive to the Denali trim.

=== &quot;The Apprentice&quot; make-your-own-ad contest ===
In 2006, the 2007 Tahoe was featured on and promoted through Donald Trump&#x27;s TV series, &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, where the two teams put together a show for the top General Motors employees to learn about the new Tahoe. Also, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; sponsored a controversial online contest in which anyone could create a 30-second commercial for the new Tahoe by entering text captions into the provided video clips; the winner&#x27;s ad would air on national television. An early example of user-generated marketing, headed by ad agency Campbell Ewald, the campaign began to backfire when hundreds of environmentally conscious parodies flooded YouTube and Chevrolet&#x27;s website critiquing the vehicle for its low fuel economy. Over 400 negative ads were created in total; however, over 20,000 positive ads were created which Chevrolet viewed as successful in spite of the negative media attention.

== Fourth generation (2015) ==

The Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, Cadillac Escalade, and Cadillac Escalade ESV had a shortened 2014 model year starting in June 2013, and was replaced with a new version in February 2014 as a 2015 model. This generation marks the discontinuation of this model and all Chevrolet vehicles in European and right-hand markets.

The Tahoe and Yukon were built on the GMT K2XX platform and assigned as K2UC (for Chevrolet Tahoe) and K2UG (for GMC Yukon). Production on the Tahoe and Yukon began in December 2013 with the first completed SUVs being used for testing purposes, and started officially shipping the vehicles to dealerships on February 5, 2014. The 2015 Tahoe was later named the fastest-selling vehicle for February 2014, averaging seven days of sales upon its release. On September 12, 2013, GM released photos and press release of the fourth-generation Tahoe and Yukon. Like its larger siblings Suburban and Yukon XL, the front fascias of the Tahoe and Yukon are distinct, but from the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics and fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels now are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight. A more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 powertrain coupled with improved aerodynamics help increase fuel economy for the SUVs. Both fourth-generation SUVs no longer share a single piece of sheet metal or lighting element with the brands&#x27; full-size pickup trucks, and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give them their own identity. The front headlights feature projector-beam headlamps flanking the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille – chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while the LTZ trims feature high-intensity discharge headlamps and LED daytime running lamps.

Also new were the addition of fold-flat second- and third-row seats, now a standard feature but could be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of leg room for second-row passengers. The Tahoe now had an available power-tilt, telescoping steering wheel. For the Yukon variant, this feature was carried over from 2009–2014 Yukon Denali, now available in the SLT trim as well. The third-row fold-flat feature was accomplished using a raised platform that reduces available cargo space behind the third-row seats. Standard third-row seats and raised &quot;fold-flat&quot; platform significantly reduced available cargo space compared with previous Tahoe models. Multiple USB ports and power outlets were now spread throughout their interiors, including one 110-volt, three-prong outlet, with the Tahoe adding an available eight-inch color touch-screen radio with next-generation MyLink connectivity along with an available rear-seat entertainment system (but did not feature a Blu-ray option which was exclusive to the Suburban for 2015), while the Yukon added a standard eight-inch-diagonal color touch screen radio with enhanced IntelliLink and available navigation.

The Yukon interior had more features including seats stuffed with dual-firmness foam, a standard Bose sound system and SD card slots, and laminated glass for the windshield and front windows, decreasing interior noise. GM&#x27;s third-generation magnetic ride control suspension is optional on the Tahoe LTZ models, whose upgraded features included third-generation magnetic ride control, a real-time damping system that delivers more precise body motion control by &quot;reading&quot; the road every millisecond, and changing damping in just five milliseconds.

The new platform was based on the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 1500. Both SUVs featured sound-deadening material to improve cabin quietness. A new Cadillac Escalade and Cadillac Escalade ESV arrived in dealerships in April 2014. Models continued for the Tahoe and Suburban as LS, LT, and LTZ, and the Yukon and Yukon XL as SLE, SLT, and Denali. The Tahoe and Yukon went on sale in February 2014 as an early 2015 model year vehicle. Prices for the all-new GM SUVs were similar to the previous-generation GMT900 SUVs. The Hybrid models were all dropped along with their powertrains, and the Yukon Denali AWD was also dropped as well.

On September 26, 2014, Chevrolet debuted the updated Z71 Tahoe at the State Fair of Texas, along with the debut of the Texas Edition Tahoe, the latter because of Texas having the largest units of Tahoes sold in the United States (as of August 2014, sales of the Chevrolet SUVs in Texas were up 37 percent) and to celebrate the 60th anniversary of GM&#x27;s Arlington Assembly plant; production began in October 2014. As with the previous Z71 Tahoe, this version continued to be offered in a 4WD LT trim only, featuring a front skid plate, off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, a unique grille, running boards, and &quot;Z71&quot; identification inside and out. Fog lamps, front tow hooks, and front parking assist were also included. The Texas Edition was available in both LT and LTZ trims, featuring a maximum trailering package, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels (on LT models), 22-inch premium painted aluminum wheels (on LTZ models), and an exclusive &quot;Texas Edition&quot; badge. The Texas Edition Tahoe package was part of a lineup that also used the Texas Edition package, alongside the Suburban and Silverado.

The demand and interest in the redesigned Tahoe also translated into a 108 percent sales spike since it went on sale in February 2014, with most dealers reporting the units being sold within 17 days after they arrive on the dealership lots, with most customers opting for the fully-optioned LTZ model, making it one of Chevrolet&#x27;s fastest-selling vehicles in 2014 along with the Suburban, which posted even quicker inventory turnovers.

=== GMC Yukon Denali ===
The Yukon Denali was redesigned and updated along with other GM SUVs in September 2013 and went to dealerships on February 5, 2014 as a 2015 model. The Yukon Denali continued with the top-of-the-line features (using similar features as found on the Tahoe LTZ trim) and the front grille honeycomb design. It was now also equipped with a new active noise-cancellation technology and GM&#x27;s third-generation magnetic ride control suspension as a standard feature. For the first several years, the 6.2-liter V8 was unique to the Denali (and Russian-market Tahoes), but in 2018, this was also made available on the Tahoe LTZ. In November 2014, the Yukon Denali saw its MSRP bumped up by $1,300, partly as a result of the loaded features added to its 2015 mid-year updates. For the 2018 model year, the Yukon Denali received a ten-speed automatic transmission in place of the 8-speed units used on other models.

=== Safety recalls ===
On March 23, 2014, a 2015 GMC Yukon caught fire and went up in flames in Anaheim, California, after a couple, who along with the sales representative who was giving them a test drive, noticed the vehicle stopping and that smoke was starting to make its way into the cabin, prompting the three individuals to park the car and escape before it was destroyed within 15 minutes. The cause of the fire was traced to an oil leak and an engine malfunction. Despite being an isolated incident, the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon were not believed to be tied to GM&#x27;s announced recall of its vehicles that was made on March 17, 2014. But five days later on March 28, 2014, GM announced a recall on the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon in order to fix a &quot;transmission oil cooler line that is not securely seated in its fitting,&quot; causing the vehicle to stop and rupture the oil cooling line, resulting in the engine to malfunction and catching fire immediately. On June 6, 2014, GM issued another recall on the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon because their radio control modules may not work, and thus prevent certain audible safety warnings.

=== Changes by year ===
==== 2015 mid-year update ====
The Tahoe received 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and Siri capability, a new color palette, Brownstone Metallic, and added a hands-free power liftgate feature that is standard on LTZ, but included on LT with the optional Luxury Package. The MyLink with Navigation feature became standard on the LTZ trim, while E85 capability is removed from retail orders.

The Yukon, in addition to receiving the aforementioned features, saw the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine being updated with the new 8L90E eight-speed automatic transmission for the interim model year, allowing it to improve fuel economy.

A body-colored shark-fin antenna was added with the 2015 mid-year refresh for all models.

==== 2016 ====
For the 2016 model year, the Chevrolet Tahoe received more upgraded changes and new features, similar to the ones added to the Suburban. The changes included power-adjustable pedals, forward collision alert, IntelliBeam headlamps, lane keep assist, and a safety alert seat as part of the newly introduced enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the LS trim. The inside floor console with storage-area SD card reader was removed and a new infotainment system was introduced, officially ending the CD player era for the Tahoe; the 8-inch MyLink feature was expanded to the LS trim and became standard (replacing the 4-inch display), although the navigation feature remains as an option on LT and standard on LTZ. A new liftgate shield was added to the Theft Protection Package, along with the new lane keep assist which replaced the lane departure warning. The capless fuel fill tanks became standard on all trims. &quot;Siren Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;Iridescent Pearl Tricoat&quot; became the new color trims, replacing &quot;Crystal Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Diamond Tricoat&quot;. The instrument cluster was re-configured with a new multi-color enhancement and a heads-up display was introduced as a standard only on the LTZ trim.

The 2016 GMC Yukon also saw similar changes, with liftgate, power, hands-free now packaged on SLT trims, a free-flow feature that replaced the Premium package, and two new premium colors (&quot;Crimson Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Frost Tricoat&quot;) replacing &quot;Crystal Red Tintcoat&quot; and &quot;White Diamond Tricoat&quot; respectively.

The 2016 Tahoe came equipped with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used. The 2014 and 2015 LTZ and Denali packages came equipped with a &quot;wireless&quot; charging accessory. while the Android Auto option will only be available on LT and LTZ trims featuring 8 inch screens.

In 2015, the Russian-built Chevrolet Tahoe received the 6.2L V8 L86 EcoTec engine, which was the only engine offered in the region as an exclusive to the Russian and CIS markets only, as GM had no plans to make it available to North America.

==== 2017 ====
For the 2017 model year, Chevrolet made upgraded changes to the Tahoe. New additions include the teen driver feature, the App Store feature, a rear seat reminder, and low speed forward automatic braking. Two new colors, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot;, were added to replace four colors. The 22-inch wheels option was expanded to three, and the rear seat entertainment system was overhauled. Chevrolet also made changes in the level trims, with the c-pillar badge now removed from LS models and the LTZ trim is renamed to Premier, which will continue to be the top-of-the-line model.

The 2017 model year Yukon also received similar changes, but with a few exceptions. Two new colors, &quot;Dark Blue Sapphire Metallic&quot; and &quot;Mineral Metallic&quot; were introduced, the latter exclusive to the Denali, which is also adding a new 22-inch ultra bright aluminum wheels with midnight silver premium paint and a head-up display to its features. The interior backlights changed from red to blue. The heated and vented driver and front passenger seats are now standard on the SLT and Denali trims.

==== 2018 ====
For the 2018 model year, the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine became available in the Tahoe RST (when bought with the Performance Package). All 2018 Tahoe and Suburban trim levels came standard with LED daytime running lights, replacing the low beam projector DRLs on LS and LT trim levels. The 2018 Tahoe was also available with the Custom Edition package for the base LS trim level. The Tahoe LS trim level featured a chrome grille, 18&quot; painted aluminum wheels, 18&quot; all-season blackwall tires, and third-row seat delete (reducing seating capacity to 5 from 8) if ordered with the Custom Edition package. The GMC Yukon received a 10-speed automatic transmission on the Denali trim level and the GMC Yukon is facelifted for 2018 with a refreshed grille similar to the one from the 2017 GMC Acadia and 2018 GMC Terrain.

==== 2019 ====
The 2019 Tahoe/Yukon saw only minor changes. One exterior color, &quot;Shadow Gray Metallic&quot;, replaced both &quot;Havana Metallic&quot; and &quot;Tungsten Metallic&quot;, and the Premier model received a newly redesigned badge on the liftgate.

==== 2020 ====
The 2020 model year Tahoe/Yukon was shortened to make way for the upcoming fifth generation. From the Tahoe, the All Season Package and the LT Signature Package were removed, along with the &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; exterior color, while the 2020 GMC Yukon replaced its &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; color with &quot;Carbon Black Metallic&quot; with no additional changes.

==Fifth generation (2021)==
On December 10, 2019, Chevrolet introduced a fifth-generation Tahoe at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan. This time around, GM chose to introduce the Chevrolet full size SUVs first, followed by the GMC Yukon in January 2020 and the Cadillac Escalade in February 2020. Following the industry shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, the SUVs started production at the Arlington plant on May 18, 2020, and arrived in dealerships in June 2020.

===Tahoe===
Based on the same GMT T1XX platform as the Silverado 1500, the Tahoe distinguishes itself by swapping that truck&#x27;s live axle and leaf springs for an independent rear multilink suspension setup with coil springs, thus lowering the floor of the vehicle and creating more room in both the cargo area and the second-and third-row seats. The Tahoe expanded its length to , and the wheelbase to , making it the largest SUV in the full-size length segment. It gains of cargo space behind the third row and of third-row legroom.

Carryover trims include the basic LS, LT, and Premier, with Z71 and RST moving from package to trim level, along with the newly-added top-of-the-line High Country trim, giving the Tahoe the highest number of trims of any vehicle in its segment. Quad exhaust tailpipes are available on LT and standard on Premier and High Country.

Although the Tahoe retains a boxy look, it adds a more rounded design and adopts the same Chevrolet design language as the Silverado, featuring a sharply curved front grille and LED lighting. The Tahoe nameplate is given greater prominence, being placed front and center on the higher liftgate.
The dashboard and entertainment system have been fleshed out, moving away from the traditional design. Newly updated features include a 10.25-inch touch screen that is now standard on all trims and a pair of 12.6-inch LCD rear screens that can play movies and offer content from passengers’ smartphones and can play different programs on the two screens. A new push-button shifter column (P, R, N, D) is placed on the dashboard, nine camera displays for enhanced towing capabilities, and a total of 30 additional safety features have been implemented throughout the Tahoe. An Air Ride Adaptive Suspension is standard on the higher trims, likewise with an 8-inch driver screen.

It also features a Duramax diesel engine as an option (available on all trims and packages except for the Z71) for the first time; a 3.0-liter I6 which produces and of torque, a segment-exclusive. The fifth generation Tahoe went on sale in the second half of 2020 as a 2021 model.

Although GM had been making plans to bring the Tahoe to right-hand-drive countries for the first time, those plans were temporarily put on hold for the Australasian region because of low demand for large SUVs and a local company (expected to be Holden Special Vehicles) that was prepared to do the conversions focusing on other productions.

In November 2020, GM announced that its large SUV lineup would be imported to China, marking the Tahoe and Yukon Denali&#x27;s maiden entry into the country, starting with the 5th generation models. 

In November 2021, GM announced that it would begin selling the Chevrolet Tahoe in South Korea starting for the 2022 model year, surpassing the Chevrolet Traverse as the largest Chevrolet vehicle in that East Asian country&#x27;s Chevrolet lineup. The Korean-spec Tahoe is exclusively available in the High Country and Dark Night Edition trim levels only and is powered by the 6.2L L87 V8 petrol engine as its only engine option for that country. Just like with the Mexican-spec Chevrolet Tahoe, the Korean-spec Tahoe is not available with the Duramax l6 diesel engine. All Korean-spec Tahoe SUVs are manufactured at the Arlington Assembly plant. Sales of the Tahoe in that country began on April 18, 2022. 

==== 2025 facelift ====

The Tahoe received a facelift for the 2025 model year. The facelift includes refreshed front and rear fascias with redesigned LED headlights and LED taillights similar to those from the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse. Output for the 3.0 L Duramax turbodiesel is increased to and , and the engine is available on the Z71 trim level for the first time. Other changes include new 24-inch wheels, a revised interior with a standard 17.7-inch-diagonal infotainment screen and redesigned center console, ride and handling improvements, and additional towing and trailering technology. The facelifted fifth-generation Tahoe entered production on October 9, 2024.
===Yukon===
GMC unveiled its fifth-generation Yukon in Vail, Colorado on January 14, 2020, alongside its extended length sibling Yukon XL. Like the Tahoe, the Yukon will also feature an independent rear suspension, a 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel engine, and a top-shelf suspension option featuring air springs and magnetic-ride shocks, a standard 5.3-liter V-8, an optional 6.2-liter V8, and a 10-speed automatic transmission that is standard across the lineup. It also gains 4.9 inches in the wheelbase. The dashboard will have two versions, one similar to the Tahoe while a different one with a larger entertainment screen will be exclusive to the Denali. The Yukon&#x27;s design follows GMC&#x27;s design language, with the front grille mimicking the Sierra but the tailgate mimicking the GMC SUV lineup with the lights extended to the tailgate doors.

The lineup of level trims also expanded as well, with the SLE, SLT, and Denali now joined by the 4WD-exclusive AT4, the latter of which comes standard with the Magnetic Ride Control electronically adaptive dampers, AT4-exclusive leather-appointed seats, and stitching with a unique Jet Black interior color and Brandy accents, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, a two-speed transfer case, 20-inch Goodyear all-terrain tires, Traction Select System with off-road mode, hill descent control, and skid plates.

The fifth-generation Yukon debuted in July 2020 as a 2021 model.

==== GMC Yukon Denali ====
The fifth-generation Yukon Denali was introduced in January 2020. The updated and redesigned vehicle was moved upward in its top-of-the-line level trim, because of the introduction of the AT4 that was slotted above the SLT level. It also featured a dashboard design exclusive to this trim.

==== 2025 facelift ====

The fifth-generation GMC Yukon received a facelift for the 2025 model year. The facelift includes a redesigned front fascia with redesigned LED headlights and LED taillights similar to those from the 2024 GMC Acadia. Other changes include the Elevation trim level being introduced to replace the SLE and SLT trim levels as the entry-level trim, the deletion of the nine passenger seating configuration with 1st row bench seating (which was an available seating option exclusive to the SLE and SLT trim levels on the pre-facelift version of the fifth-generation GMC Yukon), the introduction of the Denali Ultimate and AT4 Ultimate trim levels, new towing technology, and the same upgraded Duramax Diesel engine output seen on the 2025 Tahoe. The facelifted fifth-generation Yukon entered production in November 2024.

===Recalls/safety issue===
On August 3, 2020, GM sent out a new TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) that addresses a potential issue related to the engine oil cooler lines on the 2021 Tahoe and Yukon. The issue was sent out to dealerships ahead of receiving the vehicles and were instructed to inspect the engine oil cooler lines at the quick connector on the radiator in order to ensure they are properly seated before selling or dealer-trading the vehicle. No parts were needed for replacement but cautioned customers to have it checked as catastrophic engine failure could occur if not repaired.

== Hybrid vehicle ==
The Tahoe made its hybrid electric debut in late 2007. In January 2008, the starting price was US$50,540. The starting price of the 2009 model was increased to US$51,405.

The Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid uses a combination of its 6.0L V8 engine that can also run on V4 mode and two (continuous) electric motors with a 300-volt, 1.53 kWh nickel–metal hydride battery. The vehicle can run on either gasoline, electricity, or a mixture of the two using its automatic Two-Mode Hybrid system that monitors the vehicle&#x27;s torque and state of the battery to choose the most efficient source of power. The battery is charged either directly by generating electricity through driving one or both electric motors using the gasoline engine (while the vehicle is coasting or being driven by the gasoline engine), or by the wheels driving one or both electric motors through regenerative braking when the vehicle is decelerating, thus regaining some of the energy invested in forward momentum. The Tahoe is considered a strong or full hybrid, in that it can run entirely on the battery (for a limited range) at low speeds. In city driving, the EPA rating of fuel consumption for the 2WD version of the hybrid is . In comparison, non-hybrid varieties of the Tahoe are rated no higher than in city driving. In highway driving, the EPA rating is .

The Tahoe and Yukon Hybrid models were discontinued after the 2013 model year as GM moved to make its SUVs more fuel-efficient with the introduction of the EcoTec engine that would later be installed in the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon.

== Outside the United States ==
In Brazil, the Tahoe GMT400 was sold under the name of &quot;Grand Blazer&quot;, sourced from Argentina with rear-wheel drive only, regionally-sourced 6-cylinder engines (the late-type 4.1L MPFI Chevrolet straight-6 gasoline and the 4.2L MWM Sprint 6.07T diesel) and manual transmission. The GMT400 is used by Brazilian elite police units, such as the BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais) in Rio de Janeiro and the ROTA (Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar) and GATE (Grupo de Ações Taticas Especiais) in São Paulo. It is also used by the São Paulo State Police and the Rio Grande do Sul State Police. But as the cars grew old, the great majority of them were substituted, mainly by the smaller Chevrolet Blazer midsize SUV. The Tahoe name was not used in Brazil because it would be unfamiliar to most Brazilians since it refers to the Lake Tahoe on the border of Nevada and California.

Elsewhere in South America, Chile has incorporated the Tahoe as a transport vehicle for the special operations unit (GOPE) of the Chilean Police (Carabineros de Chile) to carry communication equipment.

The Tahoe was also assembled in Venezuela from CKD kits for three generations, being phased out in 2014 along most of the local Chevrolet range due to unfavorable economic conditions and political circumstances. The fourth generation of the Tahoe has not been available in Venezuela.

In Ecuador, due to the tax benefits offered by hybrid vehicles, the third-generation of the Tahoe was offered only in the hybrid version until 2011. A review of the benefit to exclude hybrid vehicles with a displacement greater than 1.8L rendered the Tahoe Hybrid less cost-effective than the non-hybrid in Ecuador.

In November 2023, it was announced that the GMC Yukon would launch in Australia in 2025, as part of the GM-operated General Motors Special Vehicles business.

In early 2024, General Motors announced for the first time that it will begin selling the Chevrolet Tahoe in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Mainland China only) in 2024 for the 2025 model year. The Tahoe for Mainland China will be the first vehicle to be powered by GM&#x27;s new TurboMax engine (which will be the only powertrain option available on the Chinese-market Tahoe). Unlike most Chinese-market GM vehicles (which are manufactured locally in China by SAIC-GM), the Chinese-market Tahoe will be imported from GM&#x27;s Arlington Assembly plant located in Arlington, Texas, United States and be the first GM vehicle sold under the GM Durant Guild Imported Vehicle platform (which is aimed at selling imported GM vehicles in China). The Tahoe is expected to surpass the Chinese-market third generation Chevrolet Traverse as the largest vehicle in the Chinese Chevrolet lineup. The Chinese-market Tahoe will be available in two trim levels, Base (which is based on the Chevrolet Tahoe RST) and High Country. General Motors also plans to begin selling the GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and Chevrolet Suburban in China under the GM Durant Guild Imported Vehicle platform at a later date, which will complement the Tahoe in China. 

In November 2024, General Motors announced for the first time that it will begin selling GMC vehicles in the PRC (Mainland China only) from late 2024 under the GM Durant Guild Imported Vehicle platform, with the 2025 GMC Yukon being the first GMC vehicle available in China. The Chinese-market GMC Yukon will be available in two trim levels which are Denali and Denali Ultimate. Just like the Chinese-market Tahoe, the Chinese-market Yukon will be imported from GM&#x27;s Arlington Assembly plant located in Arlington, Texas, United States and will be powered by GM&#x27;s TurboMax engine. The GMC Yukon will complement the Chevrolet Tahoe in the Chinese GM lineup.

== Police package ==


In North America, the Tahoe is used by many law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies. Prior to the announcement of the Z56 police package model, the civilian base and LS models based on the GMT400 were used in police service. During the 1997 model year, the Tahoe was offered with the Z56 police option using suspension components from the discontinued 454SS truck – the first Tahoe Z56s were available only in 2WD until the GMT400 was phased out. The original prototype had rear disc brakes based on the B-body 9C1s whereas the production Z56s came with rear drum brakes. Plans for outfitting the Tahoe with the Z56 police package originated around the 1994 model year when GM broke news about phasing out its B-platform sedans (Caprice, Impala SS, Roadmaster) at the end of the 1996 model year where a replacement was imminent since GM ended production of its body-on-frame passenger sedans amid growing SUV sales. Since the introduction of the GMT900, Chevrolet currently offers two versions of the police package Tahoe: a four-wheel-drive version and a two-wheel-drive version. Just like the GMT400-based models, civilian GMT800 Tahoe base and LS models were also used for police use until the Z56 police package option was reintroduced in 2004 late in the GMT800&#x27;s life cycle by some agencies.

Chevrolet refers to the four-wheel-drive (4WD) version as &quot;Special Service Vehicle&quot; (SSV) which has the 5W4 RPO code. This version of the Tahoe can be used for all purposes except pursuits and high-speed responses because of its high center of gravity just below the front window (height, not location), thus having a higher probability of rolling-over at high speeds. This version is preferred by agencies where snow, ice, flooding, rough terrain, and ground clearance are common issues.

Chevrolet refers to the two-wheel-drive (2WD) version—also known as the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) version—as &quot;Police Pursuit Vehicle&quot; (PPV). This version can be used for all purposes including pursuits and high-speed responses. The center of gravity in this vehicle is lower than that of the four-wheel-drive version and the ground clearance is about 1 in (25 mm) less, with a standard rear bumper replacing the tow hitch on civilian Tahoes. Highway patrol agencies prefer the two-wheel-drive version, where pursuits and long-distance responses are more common. As of the 2012 model year, the Tahoe was the last body-on-frame, rear-wheel-drive police vehicle manufactured for the United States market since Ford phased out its aging Panther platform. Other SUVs like the Ford Expedition are used by many law enforcement and EMS agencies, but are not pursuit-rated.

Chevrolet built a 2015 Tahoe Police Patrol Vehicle that was previewed as a concept at the 2013 SEMA Show in Las Vegas. The vehicle became available in 2WD and 4WD drivetrains with orders coming in the first quarter of 2014 for special service models, followed by the orders for the police pursuit models afterwards.

===2021 PPV===
The 2021 Tahoe PPV marks the most drastic change from the standard Tahoe. Rocker covers are borrowed from the GM LT4 engine found in high-performance Corvettes, Camaros, and Cadillacs. Engine and transmission coolers are PPV-specific. Bridgestone co-developed &quot;Firehawk Pursuit&quot; tires with GM for the 20-inch steel wheels. Six-piston, 16-inch rotor Brembo brakes are standard-issue on the PPV. The suspension is lowered and further fortified. All-wheel drive is standard and sent to the front as needed with a limited slip clutch in the transfer case. The alternator almost doubles the amperage of the standard Tahoe. This version of the PPV uses the 9C1 code instead of the Z56 code.

Unlike the standard Tahoe, the 2021 Tahoe PPV (along with the related Commercial/Fleet model) includes a standard eight-inch Chevrolet Infotainment touchscreen in lieu of the 10.25-inch unit found on all other models. It also does not include wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (although still offers wired versions of both), SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L, or the Google-based operating system (on 2022 and newer models). A standard 4.2-inch color LCD screen is also included with an analog instrument cluster in lieu of the ten-inch full-color LCD instrument cluster on 2022 models.

==Military applications==


When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by the 5.3 L V8 for the Tahoe, 6.0 L V8 for the Suburban, and a Duramax 6.6 L V8 turbo diesel engine for the pickup trucks. As GM has periodically redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs since 2001, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.

The militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook, tow shackles and a 24/12-volt electrical system. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories. In the Canadian Army, these vehicles are nicknamed &quot;Milverado.&quot;

The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking rear differential, beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units have been sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.

<text>The M36 tank destroyer, formally 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage, M36, was an American tank destroyer used during World War II. The M36 combined the hull of the M10 tank destroyer, which used the M4 Sherman&#x27;s reliable chassis and drivetrain combined with sloped armor, and a new turret mounting the 90 mm gun M3. Conceived in 1943, the M36 first served in combat in Europe in October 1944, where it partially replaced the M10 tank destroyer. It also saw use in the Korean War, where it was able to defeat any of the Soviet tanks used in that conflict. Some were supplied to South Korea as part of the Military Assistance Program and served for years, as did re-engined examples found in Yugoslavia, which operated into the 1990s. Two remained in service with the Republic of China Army at least until 2001.

The vehicle is also known by the nickname General Jackson, or just Jackson, which was originally assigned to the vehicle by the Ordnance Department in November 1944 for publicity purposes, such as in newspapers, but does not appear to have been used by troops in the field during the war.

==Doctrine==
U.S. combined arms doctrine on the eve of World War II held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas. Separate GHQ tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses, and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemy&#x27;s vulnerable rear areas. U.S. tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack, but the mission of defeating massed enemy armored counterattacks was assigned to a new branch, the Tank Destroyer Force. Tank destroyer units were meant to counter German blitzkrieg tactics. They were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level, and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough, maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics (charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited) to destroy enemy tanks. This led to a requirement for fast, well-armed vehicles. Though equipped with turrets (unlike most self-propelled anti-tank guns of the day), the typical American design was more heavily gunned, but more lightly armored, and thus more maneuverable, than a contemporary tank. The idea was to use speed and agility to bring a powerful self-propelled anti-tank gun into action against enemy tanks.

==Design==

With the advent of heavy German tanks such as the Panther and Tiger, the standard U.S. tank destroyer, the M10, was rapidly becoming obsolete, because its main armament, the 3-inch gun M7, had difficulty defeating the thick frontal armor of the newer tanks past several hundred yards. In late summer 1942 American engineers had begun examining the potential of a new tank destroyer armed with a 90mm gun, and produced the prototype 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T53, which placed the 90 mm gun in an open mounting at the rear of an M4 Sherman chassis. In August 1942, it was agreed to immediately produce 500 vehicles, with 3,500 more later. The Tank Destroyer Force objected, arguing that the design of the T53 was too rushed. The 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T53E1 proved to be even worse, and the contract was canceled.

In October 1942, the Ordnance Department tested mounting the experimental 90 mm gun T7 into the turret of an M10 tank destroyer. General Andrew Bruce, head of the Tank Destroyer Force, objected to the project, favoring the lighter Gun Motor Carriage M18 &#x27;Hellcat&#x27;, but was ignored. Mounting the 90 mm gun was straightforward, but the gun proved too heavy for the M10&#x27;s turret, and a new turret was designed with power traverse, and a massive counterweight to balance the gun. The first two M36 prototypes, designated 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T71 were completed in September 1943. Initially, a request for full production was denied as 90 mm guns were already being studied for use on tanks, but Army Ground Forces approved the project in October 1943, and tests began. The ring mount on the left side of the turret for the .50 caliber Browning M2HB antiaircraft machine gun was changed to a pintle mount at the rear. It was decided that production vehicles would use the chassis of the M10A1 tank destroyer, as the M10A1 had superior automotive characteristics, and significant numbers were available. After testing, an initial order for 300 vehicles was issued. The T71 was designated upon standardization on 1 June 1944 as the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36.

==Production==

After July 1943, the appliqué armor (add on armor) bosses on the hull side of later M10A1s were omitted as the armor kits were never manufactured. The M36 initially retained the M10A1&#x27;s &quot;stirrup&quot; gun rest on the rear hull; crews were unhappy about the lack of a travel lock to hold the 90 mm gun in a fixed position when in motion, and many improvised their own from travel locks taken from tanks. A double-baffle muzzle brake was fitted to all vehicles after the first 600, beginning in early November 1944. A folding travel lock better-suited to the 90 mm gun was added to the rear hull at about this time. The gun itself was also modified with a better equilibrator and more powerful elevating mechanism.

As the initial contract was for 300 vehicles, General Motors&#x27; Fisher Tank Arsenal produced the last 300 M10A1 tank destroyers in January 1944 without turrets for immediate conversion to M36s, which took place from April to July 1944. The contract was later increased to 500 vehicles, as it was decided that existing M10A1s were also to be converted to M36s. The requirement was later increased to 600 vehicles on 15 May 1944. As it was found that the M10 tank destroyer had struggled against German tanks like the Panther and especially the Tiger during the Normandy campaign, the contract was increased to 1,400 vehicles on 29 July 1944. This caused problems, as only 913 of the 1,413 M10A1s that had been completed could be requisitioned from training units. Due to the lack of M10A1 hulls, it was decided to finish up the initial production run by mounting M36 turrets onto M4A3 Sherman hulls (which had the same engine as the M10A1) with the necessary internal changes; these were designated M36B1. The production of 187 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36B1 ran from October to December 1944. From June to December 1944, Massey-Harris converted 500 M10A1s into M36s. From October to December 1944, American Locomotive Company converted 413 M10A1s into M36s. The Army reduced the 1,400-vehicle objective for 1944 to 1,342 vehicles. 350 more conversions were scheduled for 1945; this number was increased to 584. A final batch of 200 M10A1s was converted by the Montreal Locomotive Works in May 1945.

The supply of M10A1s eventually ran out, so it was decided in January 1945 that M10 hulls would be used for all further conversions. American Locomotive Company converted 672 M10 hulls into the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36B2 beginning in May 1945. A further batch of 52 M36B2s was completed by the Montreal Locomotive Works in May 1945.

==Combat use==

=== World War II ===
The first 40 M36s were not shipped overseas until September 1944, and entered combat in October 1944. The US First and Ninth Armies used M36s to re-equip tank destroyer battalions attached to armored divisions. The 703rd Tank Destroyer Battalion began re-equipping on 30 September 1944. The Third US Army used them to re-equip towed battalions. The 610th Tank Destroyer Battalion (Towed) began retraining on 25 September 1944. The first tank destroyer battalion to receive the M36 in early September, the 776th, was in transit from Italy at the time and did not use them in combat until October 1944. By the end of 1944, seven tank destroyer battalions had converted to the M36; the M36 had mostly replaced the M10 by the end of the war.
The M36 was well-liked by its crews, being one of the few armored fighting vehicles available to US forces that could destroy heavy German tanks from a distance. An 814th gunner, Lt Alfred Rose, scored a kill against a Panther at 4,600 yards (4200 meters), the maximum range of the telescopic sight. However, the Panther&#x27;s 82 to 85mm thick glacis plate could deflect shots at certain angles from the 90 mm gun at just 150 yards (137 meters). Testing done in December 1944 by the 703rd Tank Destroyer Battalion concluded that the M36&#x27;s 90mm Gun would theoretically not be able to penetrate the frontal armor of a Tiger II at any range with the ammunition that was available to them. and that it was tactically viable to engage Panther tanks from the side.

=== Korean War ===
The M36 was used by the US Army in the Korean War. It could destroy any Soviet-made AFV deployed in that theater of operations. One postwar modification was the addition of a ball-mounted machine gun on the co-driver&#x27;s side, as in many other armored fighting vehicles of the time. Due to the shortage of M26 and M46 tanks, the M36 became one of the preferred armored vehicles for MAP (Military Assistance Program) transfers.

The M36 was treated as a tank by the Republic of Korea Army despite technically being considered a self-propelled gun. The South Korean military, which faced the war without having a single tank, pushed for the creation of an armored unit and acquired the first six M36s for training in late October 1950. During the war, the South Korean Army had about 200 M36s and operated 9 tank companies. Each company was assigned to the frontline infantry division, and each tank platoon, consisting of five M36s, was attached to an infantry regiment for fire support missions. The M36 played a powerful role by direct firing at the enemy&#x27;s position during the battle for high ground. Since it was operated by Koreans, command and communication between infantry and armored units were smooth, and it had a significant effect on boosting morale.

During the Battle of White Horse during 6–15 October 1952, the 53rd Tank Company, assigned to the 9th Infantry Division, contributed to the victory by bombarding the side of the enemy&#x27;s offensive force and suppressing heavy weapons deployed on the enemy-occupied highlands. In the Battle of Betty Hill on 15–16 July 1953, the 57th Tank Company of the 3rd Tank Battalion provided direct fire support for a platoon defending the highlands overnight, which claimed the lives of 300 communist soldiers. However, the M36 had limitations for large-scale operations due to the equipment already being retired from the U.S. military: spare parts were scarce, and it was difficult to obtain further fully functional vehicles. Servicing became even harder because units were scattered around infantry units. Therefore, the Korean Army began operating in large numbers, forming three armored battalions in early 1953.

=== Indo-Pakistani Wars ===
Pakistan procured between 25 and 75 M36B2s in 1956, which were refurbished second-hand units from US stocks. Its 90 mm gun had better performance than the 76 mm M4A1E6 Shermans used by the Pakistani Armoured Corps. The M36s were called &quot;Tank Busters&quot; in the Pakistan Army, though due to constant mechanical failures probably because of inexperienced maintenance personnel and drivers, they were disliked by soldiers of the Pakistani Armoured Corps.
Colonel M. Yahya Effendi who served with the 11th Cavalry in the 1965 war recollects that:
It was an awkward fighting vehicle in every sense. The synchronization of the engines was a nuisance for the mechanics, and while driving, an inexperienced or flappy driver could smash the single plate clutch by sudden release, thus immobilizing the vehicle.

Their first combat use by the Pakistan Army was in early September 1965 during Operation Grand Slam at Chumb when 11 M36B2s under the command of Major Mian Raza Shah of the 11th Cavalry fought against AMX-13s of the Indian 20 Lancers. Despite winning the battle, the M36s had performed poorly; only two M36s were in fighting condition after the confrontation; most had broken down in the early hours of the battle, with a few (including the CO&#x27;s M36) being knocked out by Indian fire.

The M36s saw more action on the Lahore Front. In the Battle of Phillora, the Pakistani 11th Cavalry, which had twelve M36B2s along with its main force of M48s, fought an intense five-day battle against Centurion MBTs of the Indian Poona Horse and Hodson&#x27;s Horse. At one instance on 11 September, mechanic Daffadar Haq Nawaz took command of an M36B2 whose commander had been injured, and destroyed two Indian Centurions before his M36B2 was fatally hit. At the Chawinda, the Guides Cavalry was equipped with a squadron of M36B2s, deployed to guard the artillery units. 
The M36B2 was phased out of the Armoured Corps after the war.

Despite being obsolete by the time of the 1971 War, some independent squadrons of the Pakistani Armored Corps received a number of M36B2s. A depleted squadron of M36B2s of &quot;Manto Force&quot; saw action during the Battle of Chumb while 14th Independent Armored Squadron took part in the Battle of Barapind.

=== Other wars ===

M36s were also exported after World War II to various countries. They were used by the French army during the First Indochina War. The Republic of China Army acquired eight ex-French examples in 1955. They were stationed in Kinmen Island group, and saw combat during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. They were deemed more maneuverable than the bigger M48A3 and later CM11/12 MBTs, while being more powerful than M24 and M41 light tanks. As of April 2001, at least two still remained in service with troops in Lieyu Township.

Another recipient was Yugoslavia, which received 399. The engine was later replaced by the 500 hp Soviet-made diesel engine used in T-55 main battle tanks. Yugoslavian M36s participated in the Slovenian War of Independence (1991) and Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), but they were withdrawn immediately from service with the Croatian Armed Forces after the war. M36s were also used by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Croatia, and they were used during the Kosovo War as decoys for NATO air strikes.

==Armor==

American tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor. As the M10 and M36 were not purpose-built tank destroyers (they were based on tank chassis) they were not as fast as the Tank Destroyer Force wanted. General Andrew Bruce criticized the M36 due to it being too slow. The armor configuration of the M36 was identical to that of the M10A1, save the turret. The thickness of the M36&#x27;s armor ranged from .

The lower hull had thick armor on the sides and rear. The rounded, cast transmission cover was thick. Like the M10, the M36 did not have an extra floor plate under the driver&#x27;s and assistant driver&#x27;s stations to provide additional protection against mines. The glacis plate was thick, sloped at 55 degrees from the vertical, and had eight large bosses on it to attach appliqué armor plates. The sides and rear of the upper hull were thick, sloped at 38 degrees from the vertical. Earlier M10s converted to M36s had 12 appliqué armor bosses on each side of the M36&#x27;s upper hull. The rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicle&#x27;s pioneer tools; an axe, a crowbar, a mattock handle and head, a double-sided sledgehammer, and a track tensioning wrench, so no appliqué armor bosses could be fitted there. The sides and rear of the upper hull had angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track. These extensions often got in the way of fitting &quot;duckbill&quot; extended end connectors, used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground, and were often removed, along with the front fenders, by maintenance units. The hull roof plate ranged from thick over the driver&#x27;s and assistant driver&#x27;s stations and turret ring, to thick over the engine compartment.

The M36B1 had the hull armor configuration of the late production M4A3 Sherman tank.

The sides of the M36&#x27;s rounded turret were made of rolled armor plate thick. A massive hollow cast counterweight was welded to the rear of the turret to balance the heavy gun. The top was thick, the sides were thick, and the rear was thick. The rounded cast gun shield was thick.

==Armament==
===Primary===

The M36 tank destroyer used an M10A1 chassis (the M36B1 used an M4A3 Sherman chassis, while the M36B2 used an M10 chassis) mounting a large, open-topped turret mounting a 90 mm gun M3. The gunner aimed the gun using the M76F telescope. The 90 mm gun M3 was the standardized version of the experimental T7, a derivative of the 90 mm gun developed as a vehicle-mounted antitank weapon. The M36 carried 47 rounds of main gun ammunition, 11 of which were stowed in the hollow counterweight, while 36 rounds were stowed in the sponsons. For combat use, the 90mm gun M3 could fire five types of ammunition:
* M77 AP-T shot
* T33 AP-T shot
* M82 APC/HE-T shell
* M71 HE shell
* T30E16 (M304) HVAP-T shot

The M82 armor-piercing capped shot was the main round used for engaging enemy tanks. It had a large explosive filler to increase damage after penetration. It was capable of penetrating of armor angled at 30 degrees from the vertical at and of armor at . The T30E16 HVAP shot was capable of penetrating of armor angled at 30 degrees from the vertical at , and of armor at . The T30E16 HVAP round had difficulty with the highly sloped glacis plate of the German Panther tank, so the T33 AP shot was developed to solve this problem. The T33 shot was a normal substitute standard M77 armor piercing shot that was heat-treated to improve its hardness and fitted with a ballistic &quot;windshield&quot; to improve its drag characteristics. The T33 and T30E16 were only issued in very small numbers towards the end of World War II. The M71 high explosive shell was used for indirect fire, or engaging enemy infantry, antitank guns, light vehicles, or other soft targets.

===Secondary===
The M36 tank destroyer was equipped with a single .50 caliber (12.7 mm) Browning M2HB machine gun for anti-aircraft or anti-personnel use, with 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Due to the difficulty in firing the .50 caliber machine gun directly to the front, the pintle was often repositioned to the front of the turret, or a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) Browning M1919A4 machine gun mounted there. The M36B1 retained the bow machine gun of the M4A3 Sherman tank, and had 2,000 rounds of ammunition for it. The crew had their personal weapons for self-defense.

<doc id="947390" wikidata="Q488154" url="?curid=947390" title="Chevrolet Aveo (T200)">
<text>The Chevrolet Aveo (T200) ( ) is the first generation of the Chevrolet Aveo, a subcompact automobile nameplate from the Chevrolet division of the American manufacturer General Motors. The T200 was launched in 2002, developed by the initially-independent South Korean manufacturer Daewoo, later GM Korea. It was originally marketed as the Daewoo Kalos and prominently marketed with the Chevrolet brand as the Aveo. The model received the &quot;T200&quot; internal codes during the car&#x27;s development. The &quot;T250&quot; code was designated for the model&#x27;s major facelift.

Designed, engineered and originally marketed by GM Daewoo, the Aveo superseded the Daewoo Lanos and was marketed worldwide in 120 countries under seven brands (Chevrolet, Daewoo, Holden, Pontiac, Ravon, Suzuki and ZAZ).

Production ended in 2023.
== Nameplate ==
In its home market of South Korea, the &quot;T200&quot; was known as Daewoo Kalos, before being rebranded Daewoo Gentra.

In several Asian, Australasian, and European export markets, the &quot;Daewoo Kalos&quot; name was also used, only to be later renamed &quot;Chevrolet Aveo&quot; or Holden Barina in the case of Australia. In Indonesia this generation sold under 3 nameplates, &quot;Chevrolet Aveo&quot; for hatchback, Chevrolet Kalos for sedan and sedan for taxi fleet as &quot;Chevrolet Lova&quot;.

Other names used include ZAZ Vida in Ukraine, Ravon Nexia in Russia, Chevrolet Nexia in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, Chevrolet Lova in China and Pontiac G3 in the United States, selling alongside the &quot;Chevrolet Aveo&quot; version. In Canada, the name Pontiac Wave was originally used, followed by Pontiac G3 Wave, before adopting the &quot;Pontiac G3&quot; name used in the United States. Since 2003, Suzuki has also sold a version in Canada as the Suzuki Swift+ alongside the Chevrolet and Pontiac badged versions. T200&#x27;s successor, the T300 was released in 2011. The Swift+ was dropped after the 2011 model year due to poor sales along with the entire Suzuki brand, although Suzuki Canada lists 2010 as the final model year Swift+. In addition, the release of the Pontiac Wave5 is also very relevant to determine the difference of production years and production model names.

== T200 ==
The Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2002, based on a then-new Daewoo platform named &quot;T200&quot;, replacing the Daewoo Lanos (&quot;T100&quot;). Under development before Daewoo&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Kalos was the company&#x27;s first new model introduction following its subsequent takeover by General Motors. Manufacture of the Kalos began in early March 2002, with pre-production prototypes shown at the Geneva Motor Show in April 2002. The nameplate &quot;Kalos&quot; derives from the Greek word καλός (&quot;kalós&quot;) for &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;good&quot;.

Designed by Italdesign, the Kalos derives directly from the Kalos Dream concept vehicle first presented at the 2000 Paris Motor Show and subsequent developmental concepts at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, 2002 Geneva Motor Show, and 2003 Geneva Motor Show. During this three-year development period Daewoo was struggling financially, with the ultimate fate of the company and the concept vehicle remaining uncertain.

Two different T200 front-end styling designs were sold. When released in 2002, the T200 headlamps were detached from the horizontal amber turn signal strip, located directly below. This detached style, used primarily in South Korea and North America, was used in conjunction with a semi-elliptical grille. When sales in Europe began in 2003, the headlights were an integrated unit that slanted upwards from the &quot;V-shaped&quot; grille towards the front fenders. In Australia, when the Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2003, the hatchback featured the integrated lighting arrangement, with the detached style used to differentiate the sedans. In South Korea, where the detached lights were used at first, the integrated design was later utilized as a facelift.

The T200 sedan and five-door hatchback featured a swage line running along the lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a side window in the C/D pillar with a distinctively angled lower edge. Interiors feature a circular motif throughout. Upon introduction the initial European models carried an emblem reading &quot;Design Giugiaro.&quot; Referring to his firm&#x27;s design of the Kalos, Giorgetto Giugiaro said: &quot;When we designed it, we set out to produce an alternative to conventional lines and tread new paths in terms of design.&quot;

The Kalos was sold in three available body styles: a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback from the beginning of production in 2002, and a 3-door hatchback available in certain European markets beginning in 2005. All body styles meet North American subcompact and European supermini or B-segment size classifications. The interior volume was (5-door) and (sedan) according to the EPA, meeting the minimum criterion for a compact vehicle despite being marketed as a sub-compact. Headroom was unmatched in its class at the time of its introduction. Per the German Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA) standard, 5-door hatchbacks featured of cargo space with the rear seats in their upright positions and with the rear seats folded down, with a maximum payload rating of . Per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ratings, the 5-door hatchbacks featured cargo volume of (rear seats up) to (rear seats down), with available in the sedan.

=== Design development ===
Daewoo&#x27;s now disbanded Worthing Technical Centre in the UK conducted the initial research and platform engineering, with Daewoo&#x27;s main Technical Center in Bupyong, Incheon, South Korea completing the majority of the later development programme. Daewoo engineers refined the chassis in Britain, on the proving ground at Motor Industry Research Association near Nuneaton, UK. Long-term testing covered nearly 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) with further testing outside South Korea on test sites in Arjeplog, Sweden; Granada and El Vendrell, Spain; Kapuskasing, Canada and Beijing, China. According to an April, 2003 GMDAT press release, Daewoo built 119 prototypes during the Kalos&#x27;s design and development, crashing 31 for research and data-gathering purposes, and manufacturing 39 pilot production vehicles to verify standards and quality.

The body&#x27;s sheet metal panel gaps were kept to and all but the roof panel were galvanized steel. 46% of the Kalos&#x27; underlying structural components were produced with high-strength steel, with tailor-welded blanks used in the production of the vehicle to put strength where needed while saving weight. The front suspension used MacPherson struts with offset coil springs and a stabilizer bar, while the rear featured a semi-independent torsion beam axle.

The body featured a drag coefficient of 0.35, with a frontal area of giving aerodynamic resistance of . All Kalos iterations featured high H-point seating within a relatively narrow, short and high-roofed body that combined a long wheelbase with short front () and rear (, hatchback) overhangs to maximize the outward visibility, interior space and maneuverability for the vehicle&#x27;s footprint. Rear seat H-points are higher in all body types, giving the car theatre seating.

=== Design features ===
* The interior features Isofix child seat anchorages.
* The T200 features a slot specifically for holding toll tickets in the instrument panel adjacent to the steering wheel.
* The optional four-speed automatic has a “hold” feature that causes the four-speed automatic to behave like a three-speed manual: that is, it &#x27;holds&#x27; the transmission in the gear which is selected. Useful for engine braking down long grades.
* Kalos models and their variants are marketed as entry-level vehicles in various trim levels globally with options unusual at entry-level: including AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio, steering wheel mounted radio controls, power locks and windows, remote keyless entry, and heated sideview mirrors and power sunroof.
* Common equipment includes tilt steering column, six-way adjustable driver seat, rear-window defroster, remote fuel door and a 60/40 split-bench folding rear seat. The instrument panel includes a tachometer, speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and lighting dimmer control. The IP also has a center storage tray, lighter, extra 12-volt outlet, digital quartz clock and lighted glove box.

=== Safety ===
The Aveo has generally not been rated highly by consumer agencies and automotive reviewers. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported in 2011 that &quot;The Aveo does poorly in IIHS crash tests and receives the second lowest score of Marginal in roof strength, side impact and rear crash tests. It receives a higher score of Acceptable in front offset tests.&quot; The relatively high profile of the hatchback model, in particular, makes it susceptible to crosswinds and degrades handling somewhat.

The Kalos models have been tested in at least four international New Car Assessment Programs, the results reflecting varying equipment and the differences in the tests themselves. Based on market priorities and price point control, some safety equipment is either unavailable or available only as extra-cost options (including side airbags, ABS, foglights and a rear center position three-point seatbelts and headrests.)

South Korea: models received four stars for both driver and front-seat passenger in crash tests conducted by the Korean Automobile Test and Research Institute (KATRI).

Europe: models received the following European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) ratings:
* Adult Occupant: , score 17
* Child Occupant: , score 26
* Pedestrian: , score 11

Australia: Holden Barina models received scored 2 stars (of 5) from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP), a rating that is lower than the previous European-built, Opel-based Barina had scored, and the lowest ANCAP rating since 2004. Notably, the Australian Barina models do not feature the front-seat mounted side airbags offered in other markets (e.g., USA), nor are the ANCAP ratings directly comparable to the ratings of other NCAP programs.

== T250 ==
A revised sedan was introduced in April 2005 at the Shanghai Motor Show, designed in cooperation with the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC). Bearing the internal code &quot;T250&quot; and sold in South Korea as the &quot;Daewoo Gentra&quot;, the revision comprised primarily interior and exterior styling changes, a new interior instrument panel and minor equipment changes, including increased sound deadening. Incorporation of the radio antenna into the rear glass and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326. It was subsequently launched in Europe in September 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

A restyled hatchback with the sedan&#x27;s updated instrument panel was presented as the Chevrolet Aveo during the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, to be marketed in Europe and North America. The Korean market&#x27;s restyle of the hatchback, the Gentra X, featured a less distinct/more &quot;normal&quot; grille treatment that formed the basis for the Holden, Pontiac and Suzuki-branded variants.

Later iterations, including the Kalos, Aveo, Barina and Gentra sedans, the Gentra X hatchback and the 2007 &quot;Frankfurt Show&quot; hatchbacks were styled in-house and with the assistance of PATAC, and depart notably from the original Giugiaro exterior and interior styling designs.

With launch of the Gentra X in South Korea, GMDAT had replaced engines of T250. 1.2 L S-TEC II inline-four engine was updated with features such as dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) and timing chain (older version has timing belt) system. 1.6 L E-TEC II engine had replaced with ECOTEC (GEN-III) engine with new features such as variable valve timing mechanism.

=== Safety ===
US Aveo safety features include available four-channel, four-sensor ABS system with electronic brake force distribution (EBD), and front (dual-stage) and side air bags for front row occupants with a passenger-sensing system. Beginning with 2008, Aveo standard equipment includes a tire pressure monitoring system.

The T250 model has been tested by the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP):
* Adult Occupant: – 21 calculated as 3 for front plus 15 for side, with a struck out star: &quot;The driver&#x27;s chest made contact with the steering-wheel, distorting the rim. Compression of the driver&#x27;s chest indicated an unacceptably high risk of life-threatening injury. As a result, the final star of the adult occupant rating is struck through.&quot;
* Child Occupant: , score 39
* Pedestrian: , score 19
These ratings apply only to 4-door sedan Aveo. The 5-door/3-door hatchback model has not been tested by EuroNCAP but since it has the same floor as T200 model it earns 3 stars without side airbags and 4 stars with side airbags. The Australian version of the T250 three-door, the Holden Barina, was crashtested by ANCAP and gained a four-star rating.

The American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Aveo an &quot;Acceptable&quot; overall rating in the frontal offset crash test and overall &quot;Marginal&quot; rating in the side impact crash test.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s (www.safercar.gov) ratings (5dr):
* Passenger: 
* Driver: 
* Side Impact Front: 
* Side Impact Rear: 
* Rollover Rating:

=== Asia ===

==== South Korea ====
The T200 was sold as Daewoo Kalos; the hatchback named &#x27;Kalos V&#x27; and the sedan simply Kalos. The tagline from the very first advertisements was &#x27;It&#x27;s beautiful – Hi! Kalos&#x27;. Daewoo began selling the T250 sedan in September 2005 as the Daewoo Gentra, replacing the Kalos sedan. &quot;Gentra&quot; is derived from the English word &quot;gentleman&quot; and &quot;transportation&quot;. The tagline in the advertising campaign introducing the Gentra in Korea was &quot;Are you gentle?&quot;, and the campaign starred Daniel Henney. In October 2007, the Kalos hatchback adopted the T250 underpinnings and was renamed Gentra X. The Kalos won, twice consecutively (2003 and 2004), the Korea Design Power Index (KDPI) conducted by the Korean Management Association (KMA) and deriving from interviews and an internet polling of 20,000 consumers in Korea&#x27;s six largest cities.

==== China ====

The T250 sedan is sold as the &quot;Chevrolet Lova&quot; in China. It was facelifted in March 2009, receiving the front end of the T250 hatchback.

In January 2010, Shanghai GM launched the similar-sized Chevrolet Sail sedan. It was developed in China and is based on the second generation of GM&#x27;s Gamma platform, which has been designed by GM Korea. This was followed by a hatchback version, introduced the same year, in the month of June.
==== India ====
The T250 was launched in India in 2006 as Chevrolet Aveo along with the slogan &quot;An Indian Revolution&quot;, referencing Chevrolet&#x27;s An American Revolution ad campaign. The T200 hatchback has been sold in India since December 2006 as the Chevrolet Aveo U-VA. The Aveo was promoted in the Bollywood film Ta Ra Rum Pum with decals on the race cars, but the cars were ARCA-spec Chevrolet Monte Carlos.The television commercial of the Chevrolet Aveo UV-A features Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

==== Thailand ====
The T250 Sedan is sold as the Chevrolet Aveo in Thailand. In February 2008, the Aveo was awarded the ‘Green Label’ environmental certificate by the Thailand Environmental Institute, being recognized for its &#x27;minimal impact on the environment in comparison to other passenger cars in Thailand&#x27;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://media.gm.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This made Chevrolet the first automobile brand in Thailand to have won this award twice in a row.
As of 2010, the Chevrolet Aveo is sold with either a 1,399 cc or 1,598 cc 16V DOHC E-TEC II engine with VGIS variable length intake manifold. The 1.4 grades are MT Manual transmission or AT Automatic transmission &#x27;Base&#x27;, MT/AT &#x27;LS&#x27; and AT &#x27;LSX&#x27;. The 1.6 grades are AT only &#x27;LT&#x27;, &#x27;LSX&#x27;, &#x27;LUX&#x27; and &#x27;SS&#x27;. All models except the 1.6 LT are configured to use E20 fuel.

==== Vietnam ====
As of 2011, VIDAMCO of Vietnam produces the T250 sedan in complete knock-down (CKD) form at its Hanoi production facility. The VIDAMCO model was launched in Vietnam on January 20, 2006, under the name &quot;Daewoo Gentra&quot;.

=== Australia ===
The T200 model was available as the &quot;Daewoo Kalos&quot; before Daewoo&#x27;s Australian operations ceased at the end of 2004 and was absent from the Australian market until re-introduced in December 2005 as the TK Holden Barina (3-door and 5-door). The TK Barina replaced the previous XC Barina, which was an imported and rebadged European Opel Corsa. The T250 sedan was introduced in February 2006, and both the T200 and T250 models are sold together as the Barina lineup. The switch from the Opel-sourced Corsa was criticized, given the Kalos&#x27; lower ANCAP safety performance. The T250 hatchback, both 3-door and 5-door, was introduced in August 2008.

=== Europe ===
Until the end of 2004, the T200 was sold as &quot;Daewoo Kalos&quot; in Western Europe. In early 2005, the Chevrolet brand replaced the Daewoo brand and the Kalos was rebadged the &quot;Chevrolet Kalos&quot;, coinciding with the introduction of the three-door. The new T250 sedan is marketed as the &quot;Chevrolet Aveo&quot; replacing the Kalos sedan in 2006. A revised hatchback was introduced in the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, to go on sale in early 2008 as the Aveo—replacing the Kalos. In Italy there exists a variant of the Aveo called the &quot;Chevrolet Aveo Eco Logic&quot;. This low emission version has a dual power LPG engine 1.2 and 1.4 16V.

The T200 was sold in Eastern Europe as &quot;Chevrolet Aveo&quot; from its introduction in 2003. The T250 has replaced the T200 sedan in 2006, retaining the same name. Versions sold in this region had 1.4 L engines, and were available as both five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. In 2006 it was announced that FSO in Warsaw, Poland, would begin assembling the Aveo under a joint venture between GM and FSO&#x27;s owner, the Ukrainian company UkrAVTO. Production of the sedan started in November 2007, while the hatchback was assembled from July 2008. Starting from April 2008, they were delivered in the rest of the European markets too. Production in Poland ended in February 2011, when UkrAVTO decided moving it to Ukraine, where it would be assembled only for the local market and the CIS states. This comes also as an effect of the free trade agreement reached between South Korea and the European Union, that took effect from 1 July 2011. In March 2012, UkrAVTO began to manufacture the car on full-scale under the ZAZ brand.

In Russia, it was produced by the Kaliningrad-based company Avtotor, since 2005, using semi-knock down technology. It was removed from the range at the beginning of 2012, when the new generation of the Aveo was introduced on the market.

=== North America ===
The T200 models were introduced to the US and Canada 2004 models at the February 2003 Chicago Auto Show as the Chevrolet Aveo to replace the Daewoo Lanos when Daewoo withdrew from many markets outside South Korea in 2002. The US 5-door and 4-door models went on sale in November 2003, and as reported by the Boston Globe in November 2006, &quot;the Aveo (was) the largest-selling subcompact in the United States&quot;.

The Aveo was introduced for its market debut in a 60-second television advertisement that first appeared on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2003, created by the firm of Campbell-Ewald, directed by Michael Bay and featuring the song Magic Carpet Ride by Steppenwolf. The advertisement was titled &quot;An American Revolution, Car Carrier&quot; and featured six yet to be introduced cars and trucks boarding a car carrier as it traversed the United States. It featured the Aveo descending the Twin Peaks of San Francisco and making an airborne leap highly reminiscent of Steve McQueen&#x27;s Ford Mustang in the movie Bullitt, before boarding the car carrier. Two other fifteen second TV ads also created by the firm of Campbell-Ewald, spotlighted the Aveo: &quot;Pachyderm&quot; showing an elephant, chased down a city street by an Aveo and &quot;Big Little,&quot; in which four basketball players who enter the car appear tiny in big seats, highlighting the vehicle&#x27;s interior volume.

In February 2004, GM issued a &quot;stop delivery&quot; order, to investigate five accidents that occurred in a tight time frame just as the Aveo was introduced to the US market. The order was lifted shortly thereafter, after an investigation revealed no connection among the accidents.

The T250 sedan debuted in January 2006 as the 2007 Chevrolet Aveo at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show. Sales commenced in North America in August 2006. 
Also, 2007 is the first model year of the Pontiac G3 and 2009 is the first model year of the Aveo for Mexican sales, replacing the Opel-based Chevrolet Corsa.

The Aveo 5-door hatchback was marketed as the &quot;Aveo5&quot; in Canada since its inception and in the US beginning with model year 2007. The models were sold as Pontiac Wave (4-door and 5-door, since the 2005 model year) and Suzuki Swift+ (5-door) in Canada. The T200 Wave sedan was replaced for the 2007 model year with the T250, coinciding with the release of the 2007 T250 Aveo. For the 2009 model year, Pontiac Wave was renamed to Pontiac G3 Wave in Canada. In the United States, Pontiac sold the 5-door hatchback as the Pontiac G3 starting in the spring of 2009. Because of General Motors phasing out the Pontiac brand, the Pontiac G3/Wave is no longer manufactured after the 2010 model year, and the last Pontiac G3 Wave rolled off the line in December 2009, making this the last overall Pontiac vehicle to roll off the line, even though the last Pontiac for the American market was the 2010 Pontiac G6. The Pontiac G3 has the distinction of being the last Pontiac-badged model introduced to the United States market before the brand&#x27;s 2010 demise. For the 2010 model year, Canadian models are simply referred to as Pontiac G3.
In Mexico, the T250 sedan went on sale as a 2009 model, replacing the Opel-based Chevrolet Corsa and GM Daewoo-built Pontiac G3, after the GM announcement of discontinuing the Pontiac brand following the 2009 model year in Mexico and the 2010 model year elsewhere. It is produced in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. From the May 2010 model year, the GM badges next to the doors were removed. From the 2012 model year, the Aveo underwent a facelift, receiving a similar front-end with the one of the hatchback. It is no longer sold in the United States and Canada. The Aveo T250&#x27;s production in Mexico ended in 2017 and it will be replaced by a China assembled Chevrolet Sail carrying the Aveo name.
For the Canadian market the Swift+ was created with a joint between GM Daewoo and Suzuki, after Suzuki stopped selling the previous model Swift in 2001. The Swift+, a version of the Daewoo Kalos, was introduced in fall 2003 and marketed solely as a 5-door hatchback. For the 2009 model year, the Suzuki Swift+ was updated in styling and a new Opel ECOTEC 106 hp 1.6 engine receiving 7.9 L/100 km for city and 5.7 for highway from the previous 8.9/5.9, shared with the Pontiac G3 Wave and Chevrolet Aveo.

2005: Sidemarker lights change from orange to clear. Black trim applied to B-pillars of all models and C-pillars of hatchbacks.

2006: Rear Spoiler changes from &quot;hugger&quot; style to pedestal style spoiler with several inches of clearance from body.

2007: The four-door Aveo sedan is redesigned, while the five-door hatchback remains unchanged. A new trim level structure for the sedan is introduced that includes base 1LS, midlevel 1LT, and range-topping 2LT trims. Wheel choices are revised, and include both black steel wheel with plastic wheel covers, or aluminum-alloy wheels, in either fourteen-inch or fifteen-inch diameters. Exterior changes include new lighting with &quot;Altezza-Style&quot; rear tail lamps and available front fog lamps, and new front headlamps. A new chrome front grille is added that takes cues from other vehicles in the Chevrolet lineup. Interior changes include new audio systems (an A/M-F/M stereo radio for base models, or an A/M-F/M stereo radio with a single-disc CD/MP3 player (upgradeable to a newly available, six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer) on upgraded models, both with a 3.5-millimeter (3.5mm) auxiliary audio input jack, and either a four-speaker audio system or a six-speaker audio system with separate &quot;A&quot;-pillar mounted tweeters), a redesigned dashboard, and an available Neutral (Beige) interior color combination. Power is still delivered by a 1.6L EcoTec Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine producing 103 horsepower and 107 lb. ft. of torque, and mated to either a four-speed automatic transmission, or a five-speed manual transmission, regardless of trim level.

2009: The five-door Aveo hatchback is redesigned and renamed the Aveo 5. A new emblem signifying the name change is applied to the rear hatch. A wider, split front grille and more angular front headlamps, as well as optional front fog lamps, are added. All Aveos are still powered by the 1.6L EcoTec Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, though horsepower is up by 3 horsepower to 106 horsepower (up from 103 horsepower), and torque is down to 105 lb. ft. of torque from 107 lb. ft. of torque. Transmission choices remain either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic, regardless of trim level. Trim levels are also restructured to base 1LS, midlevel 1LT, and range-topping 2LT. Upscale features available on upper trims include the OnStar in-vehicle telematics system, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a six-speaker premium audio system with &quot;A&quot;-pillar mounted tweeters, a power, tilt-and-sliding sunroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with available remote audio system and cruise controls, fifteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and perforated leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces with perforated front and rear door panel inserts, and faux wood interior trim panels on Aveos equipped with the Neutral (Beige) interior. A rebadged version of the Aveo 5 becomes available in the United States, called the Pontiac G3 (also called the Pontiac Wave in other markets), although unlike the Wave, the United States version is not available in four-door sedan form. The G3 is only offered for the 2009 model year, as Pontiac also enters its last full model year.

2010: GM badges disappear on Chevrolet Aveo models, even though early 2010 models did have GM badges. Also, the G3 enters its final model year only in Canada, but drops the &quot;Wave&quot; name, making the Pontiac G3 nameplate exclusive to Canada after the United States &amp; Mexico dropped the Pontiac G3 name.

2011: The Aveo enters its final model year in North America with few changes, as it is replaced by the all-new Chevrolet Sonic for the 2012 model year, based on the Chevrolet Aveo that keeps its name in other countries.

The Aveo has received mixed reviews, while it has earned praise from many for its very low price tag, it has been criticized for poor fuel economy (compared with other vehicles in its class) and poor reliability by reviewers such as Consumer Reports and JD Power and Associates.

<text>Daewoo Motors ( ) was a South Korean automotive company established in 1937 as &quot;National Motors&quot;. The company changed its name several times until 1982 when it became &quot;Daewoo Motors&quot; following its acquisition by the Daewoo Group. After running into financial difficulties, it sold most of its assets in 2002 to General Motors at $1.2 billion, becoming a subsidiary of the American company. In 2011, the name &quot;Daewoo&quot; was definitively removed with the company being renamed GM Korea and the Daewoo brand replaced by the Chevrolet marque.

== History ==

The company was established as &quot;National Motor&quot; in 1937 in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon, Japanese Korea. The name was changed to &quot;Saenara Motor&quot; in November 1962. Saenara was assembling and selling the Datsun Bluebird PL310. The first automobile company in South Korea, Saenara was equipped with modern assembly facilities, and was established after the Automobile Industry Promotion Policy was announced by the South Korean government in 1962.
Saenara Motor was then bought by Shinjin Industrial in 1965, which changed its name to Shinjin Motors after establishing collaborations with Toyota.

After Toyota&#x27;s withdrawal in 1972, Shinjin Motor started a joint venture with General Motors under the name &quot;GM Korea&quot;, but was renamed again in 1976 to &quot;Saehan Motors&quot;. GM Korea shortly sold their Rekord model under the GM Korea marque, together with the Chevrolet 1700, a rebadged Holden Torana.

===Member of the Daewoo Group===
After the Daewoo Group gained control in December 1982, from January 1983, the name was officially changed to &quot;Daewoo Motor Co.&quot; Until 1996, all cars were based on models from General Motors. All Saehan models were named &#x27;Daewoo&#x27;, the Maepsy being refreshed became the Maepsy-Na. The Royale Series models were kept, Daewoo adding the Royale XQ and Royale Duke (March 1982), Royale Prince (July 1983) and Royale Salon Super (March 1986). Above the Royale range, the Daewoo Imperial flagship luxury car was added in 1989, with styling reminiscent of the contemporary Chrysler Imperial and New Yorker, but also luxury Japanese sedans. It was produced until 1993.
The first Daewoo addition was the 1986 LeMans model, based on the Opel Kadett E. Its three-door versions were called the Racer and the five-door version were called Penta-5. This car had an international ambition for GM, as it was sold almost worldwide, as the Pontiac LeMans, Asüna GT and SE, or Passport Optima. This car was produced until February 1997, being one of Daewoo Motor&#x27;s greatest successes. In 1986, Daewoo also offered a badge-engineered version of the Nissan Vanette.

In 1990, they created the Espero, designed by Bertone, initiating a tradition at Daewoo Motor of models created by Italian designers. Daewoo Heavy Industries (DHI) introduced in 1991, the Tico mini car which was sold at Daewoo Motor&#x27;s dealers. DHI was also selling since 1981 the Damas minivan and the Labo mini pickup, all three being based on Suzuki models. When the Royale Series range was discontinued, its models were slightly refreshed and offered under the Prince and Super Salon or Brougham model names until respectively 1997 and 1999.

In 1992, the joint-venture with General Motors ended, leaving Daewoo Motor as an independent company.

In 1994, Daewoo started importing the second-generation Honda Legend to replace the discontinued flagship Imperial, under the name of Arcadia. This year, the LeMans also got a slight refresh, and all variants (three, four and five-door) were then sold under the Cielo model name.
The first authentic Daewoo Motor product, the Lanos, was introduced in late 1997. It spawned three variants: four-door, three-door, called Romeo, and a five-door, the Juliet, being the first model of a whole new family of cars to be created. Styling was by Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign firm. One of its main features was the new three-parts corporate grille, reminiscent of the Daewoo Motor emblem which was to be used on many of the following Daewoo cars. In September 1997, the Nubira was launched, the first Daewoo model to be produced in their new Kunsan motor plant. It was designed by the Italian-based I.DE.A Institute. Also in late 1997, the mid-sized Leganza followed, also designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, borrowing some styling cues from the existing 1990 Jaguar Kensington concept car.

In 1998, one of Daewoo&#x27;s best-known cars was introduced, the Matiz. The design was signed by Fabrizio Giugiaro and based on his 1992 &quot;Lucciola&quot; concept car which was initially imagined as a replacement for the Fiat Cinquecento. This car became Daewoo Motor&#x27;s best-seller for the next four years. In 1999, Daewoo presented the Magnus which was a development of the existing Leganza. Sold in South Korea, alongside the Leganza, until the end of the latter&#x27;s production in 2002, it existed in two variants: Classic and the sportier Eagle, the Nubira received a facelift in the same year. The Rezzo minivan was also introduced in early 2000. The Matiz got a facelift in 2001. In 2002, the Magnus L6 was introduced, equipped with Daewoo&#x27;s first straight-six engine, with a new front grille and lamps. The same year, Daewoo also presented the Kalos subcompact, designed to replace the Lanos.

===Acquisition and later sale of SsangYong Motor===
In 1998, after the Asian financial crisis, Daewoo Motor took over the troubled four-wheel-drive specialist SsangYong Motor, only to sell it off again in 2000, because the conglomerate ran into deep financial trouble. Its models were sold under the Daewoo-SsangYong badge in South Korea, contrary to other areas where they were sold under the Daewoo brand name. SsangYong&#x27;s flagship limousine, the Chairman, was integrated to the Daewoo range, becoming the Daewoo Chairman, with a new three-part Daewoo corporate grille.

===Sale of Daewoo to General Motors===
By 1999, the whole Daewoo Group ran into financial trouble, and was forced to sell its automotive division. Candidates for the operation included Hyundai associated with DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company and the GM-Fiat alliance. Finally, General Motors was the one who acquired Daewoo Motor&#x27;s assets at $1.2 billion in 2002.

In 2002, Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company was spun off from parent Daewoo Motor Co. Ltd. In 2004, it was acquired by Tata Motors, India&#x27;s largest passenger automobile and commercial vehicle manufacturing company.

== Overseas engagements ==
Daewoo owned a share of AvtoZAZ, an automobile manufacturer based in Ukraine, from 1998 to 2003, establishing the AvtoZAZ-Daewoo joint venture. The CKD assembly of the Daewoo Lanos started in 2002 in Ukraine and later it was adopted for full-scale production as the ZAZ Lanos. A version of the Daewoo-developed Chevrolet Aveo has been assembled for local market at the Chornomorsk subsidiary. Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motor in 2001, UkrAVTO corporation bought out the AvtoZAZ holding in 2002. All of the AvtoZAZ manufacturing facilities (most notably MeMZ and the Chornomorsk assembling plant) were reincorporated into ZAZ. The company even adopted a new logo. The Daewoo part in the joint venture was bought out by the Swiss venture Hirsch &amp; CIE in 2003.

In August 1992, Daewoo set up Uz-DaewooAuto, a joint venture in Asaka, Uzbekistan, leveraging the presence of a large local ethnic Korean minority. Currently, the plant assembles the Matiz and the Nexia for both the local market and export, as well as the Lacetti hatchback and sedan for the domestic market only.

In 1994, Daewoo acquired the Automobile Craiova company in Craiova, Romania, which was producing a derivate of the Citroën Axel model, the Oltcit Club. The company&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Romanian Daewoo Motor&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Rodae&quot;, and later &quot;Daewoo Automobile Romania&quot;. The entire production facility was refurbished to mainly produce the Cielo model and later, other models. Until 2008, it was producing the Daewoo Cielo, Matiz and Nubira models for the Romanian market, but also car parts for export, such as engines and gearboxes to GM Daewoo and to other companies. The factory was acquired by the Romanian government and sold to Ford in 2007 (the official agreement was signed on 21 March 2008). The production of Daewoo models was stopped in May 2008, and Daewoo Automobile Romania became Ford Romania.
Daewoo also invested into Poland&#x27;s Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych (FSO) in 1995, forming a joint venture called Daewoo-FSO, for the assembly of the Matiz city car, a successor of the Tico, that was very popular in the Central European market. Since January 2005, FSO began to produce Matiz and Lanos under their own trademark.

When making a joint venture with the Polish company Fabryka Samochodów Ciężarowych (FSC) in 1995, Daewoo also created &quot;Daewoo Motor Polska&quot; which produced the Daewoo Lublin van and the Daewoo Honker pick-up truck, based on the former Tarpan Honker. Daewoo Motor Polska and the British van manufacturer LDV developed together during this period of time the Maxus van and, after Daewoo Group&#x27;s bankruptcy, LDV secured the exclusive rights to the vehicle, purchased the tooling and moved it from Daewoo&#x27;s plant in Poland to the LDV site in Birmingham. FSC was then sold by Daewoo&#x27;s new parent company General Motors to the British investment group Intrall and the Honker&#x27;s design to the Polish company Andoria-Mot.

In 1998, Daewoo Motor bought 50.2% of Avia, a Czech automotive company. The year after, the trade name of the company was changed to Daewoo-Avia. In the same year, the company became the exclusive importer and distributor of Daewoo vehicles for the Czech Republic, and started manufacturing the Polish Lublin van and the new Avia D60/90 series truck range. General Motors&#x27; buyout plan did not include Daewoo-Avia in 2001. In the year 2005, the company was overtaken by the investment group Odien Capital Partners and in October 2006, the division of light trucks moved under the concern of Ashok Leyland of India, becoming Avia Ashok Leyland Motors Company (AALM).

In 1998, the low-volume assembly of the Lanos, Nubira and the Leganza started in Taganrog, Russia, at the TagAZ-Doninvest factory The cars were sold on the local market under the Doninvest brand, as the Assol, Orion and Kondor respectively. The project did not have much success, so TagAZ turned to Citroën to produce the Berlingo, and Hyundai to produce the Accent.

Following the General Motors buyout in 2002, Daewoo lost interest in its overseas assets. The deals on supplies of pre-assembled CKD kits ended in 2005 and the facilities were forced to rely on their own production capabilities from that point on.

==Marketing outside South Korea==
Before the General Motors buyout, Daewoo cars were available in different countries.
In Europe, Daewoo Motor started selling the Espero and the Cielo (or Nexia) from the beginning of 1995, and achieved reasonable sales success, particularly with British buyers, where Daewoo proved popular largely due to its competitive prices and revolutionary dealership network, where cars were sold at fixed prices with a revolutionary aftersales service which included free servicing for three years. In 1996, it gained a 1% share of the new car market in Britain with some 20,000 sales.

The European Daewoo range was updated in 1997 with the launch of the Lanos, Nubira and Leganza from 1997. The Matiz city car was released in 1998, and was a great success for the company, most notably in non-Asian countries such as Italy, where it won many awards such as the Car of the Year award three times in a row, in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

The Rezzo (or Tacuma), Evanda (Magnus) and Kalos models were then released, before the SsangYong-based SUVs : Korando, Musso and Rexton. After the General Motors buyout, the Daewoo models received a new badge, and were sold under the Daewoo name until 2003. The Lacetti was the last car to bear a Daewoo badge in Europe. The other Daewoo models were later rechristened as Chevrolets.

Daewoo cars were also available in the United States and Canada between 1997 and 2002, Australia and many other countries, until Daewoo&#x27;s bankruptcy. Since Daewoo&#x27;s withdrawal from many markets, the Lanos was replaced with Chevrolet&#x27;s as the Aveo, whereas the Nubira and Leganza were given replacements from either the Chevrolet or Suzuki brands.
In January 2005, the Chevrolet brand was introduced in Europe, the whole Daewoo range being simply re-badged as Chevrolet. General Motors&#x27; official tagline was that: 
&quot;“Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet.”&quot; 
It was also considered that this new name was an opportunity for Daewoo to become stronger. Unofficially, after Daewoo&#x27;s bankruptcy, former chairman Kim Woo-Choong&#x27;s escape and most notably the &quot;Daewoo Affaire&quot; in France (closure and conflagration of the Daewoo-Orion Electronics plant in Longwy, France), the Daewoo brand name had a very bad image, so that GM simply decided to extend the Chevrolet strategy that was already used in most other markets (Canada, India, Israel, Russia) since 2003 to create a real global brand, replacing the Daewoo &quot;dual kidney&quot; with the Chevrolet &quot;bowtie&quot;.

The Winstorm and Tosca were presented as the Chevrolet Captiva and the Chevrolet Epica. Some of the former Daewoo models changed their names after the re-branding decision. Examples are the Matiz which became Chevrolet Spark in some markets (although Chevrolet Matiz was also used), or the Kalos which became the Aveo (alongside the Chevrolet Kalos in other countries). Later, the tendency went towards a uniformisation in the Chevrolet Europe range: the Spark and the Cruze bear the same model names throughout all European markets.
However, besides in South Korea, the Daewoo brand continued to exist in some overseas markets several years after its replacement with Chevrolet, particularly in those countries where Daewoo Motors&#x27; former facilities were not part of the General Motors take over plan. Examples of markets where it continued to be used for former Daewoo models are Romania (Daewoo Automobile Romania, until 2008), Ukraine (ZAZ, licensed production, under the Daewoo brand until 2012), Egypt (Daewoo Motor Egypt, until 2012) and, as an exception, Vietnam (Vietnam-Daewoo Motor, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of GM Daewoo, produced models under the Daewoo brand until 2011, when it was discontinued in South Korea).

Furthermore, the brand continued to exist in Uzbekistan (as Uz-DaewooAuto) until 2015, whereas in Poland the Daewoo models continued to be produced (under the Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych) until 2008.

<doc id="947404" wikidata="Q5036688" url="?curid=947404" title="Captain January (novel)">
<text>Captain January is an 1891 children&#x27;s novel, about a lighthouse keeper and his adopted daughter,
written by Laura E. Richards. First published by Estes &amp; Lauriat in Boston, it was also published in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and London, England. There have been two film adaptions of the novel, the 1924 silent film &quot;Captain January&quot;, starring Baby Peggy and the 1936 musical film &quot;Captain January&quot;, starring Shirley Temple.

==Plot summary==
Ten-year-old Star Bright learned about her past, and that of her Daddy Captain, from the stories Captain January told her. 
Januarius Judkins (the captain&#x27;s birth name) had run off to sea as a young boy and worked his way up to being ship&#x27;s captain. His last vessel was destroyed in a cyclone, and the captain was shipwrecked on a desert island. He spent five years on the island with a shipmate, then ten years alone after the mate died. After the captain had been rescued he couldn&#x27;t get used to being around people, so he became a lighthouse keeper on an island off the coast of Maine.

He lived in solitude until a gale-induced shipwreck occurred on the lighthouse island&#x27;s rocky coast, and the only survivor was a baby girl. The next day Captain January sent for the minister to give a proper burial to the bodies he recovered, but refused to give up the baby he named Star Bright. He was sure the Lord wanted him to raise her. 

Captain January obtained a milk cow named Imogen, and later asked the minister for a couple of books to use in educating his girl. He was given the Bible, plus a book of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and they became Star’s only school books.

Other than the minister, who occasionally checked up on Star and the captain, the only person encouraged to visit the lighthouse was quiet Bob Peet, the young pilot of the steamer Huntress that regularly went past the island. Captain January liked Bob because he could &quot;belay his jaw&quot; and sit for hours without speaking. One day Bob came by for a visit, and admitted he wasn&#x27;t on the Huntress because he&#x27;d run her aground on the sand during a thick fog. All aboard would have to wait until high tide before finishing their journey. 

With the captain&#x27;s approval Bob rowed Star close to the grounded steamer. A lady passenger saw the girl, and was shocked by the resemblance to her sister, who&#x27;d been lost at sea, along with her husband and baby, ten years ago. The next day the minister was rowed to the island to tell Captain January that wealthy Mrs. Morton was sure Star was her niece, Isabel Maynard, and wanted to have the girl come live with her. In an hour&#x27;s time Bob Peet would row Mr. and Mrs. Morton to the lighthouse. The captain was heartbroken, but thought it might be the Lord’s will for Star to live in a better home. 

When Mr. and Mrs. Morton arrived the captain declared his lighthouse island to be &quot;Good anchorage for a shipwrecked mariner like me, but no place for ladies or – or them as belongs to ladies.&quot; When Star was asked to go off with her relatives she replied that they could kill her and take away her body, but she would never leave when she was alive. Mrs. Morton left her niece with the lighthouse captain. 

On Christmas day Bob Peet came with pockets filled with candy and oranges, plus he brought a large box containing presents and a letter from Star&#x27;s aunt. When Star took her gifts up to her bedroom Captain January told Bob that the Lord was letting him know that he would soon receive his &quot;final sailing orders&quot; and Star needed to be taken care of. The captain would fly a blue pennant as a signal, and when Bob went past as pilot of the Huntress he would look for that pennant, and if he saw it he&#x27;d know all was well. When the time came that Bob didn&#x27;t see the signal pennant he was to tell the steamer&#x27;s captain to send a telegram to Mr. and Mrs. Morton, and Bob was to row to the lighthouse and comfort Star.

Several months later the captain felt his body grow cold and numb, and he told Star to go down to the island’s shore and wave as the Huntress went by. He said Bob Peet might be stopping by that day, and she was to wait for him to come ashore. After Star left Captain January used the last of his strength to lower the blue pennant, then he sat down and waited to die.

==Sequel==
In 1927 Star Bright, Laura E. Richards&#x27; sequel to Captain January, was published by L. C. Page &amp; Co. It tells of Star Bright, now called by her birth name of Isabel Maynard, and her life with fashionable people. In the end she returns to her beloved lighthouse and marries Bob Peet, who is now the lighthouse keeper.

<text>The Chevrolet Colorado (sharing mechanical commonality with the GMC Canyon) is a series of compact pickup trucks (mid-size since second generation) marketed by American automaker General Motors. They were introduced in 2004 to replace the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15/Sonoma compact pickups. The Colorado is named after the U.S. state of Colorado, while the Canyon took its name from the deep chasm between cliffs.

==First generation (2004)==

The Chevrolet Colorado and its twin, the GMC Canyon, were jointly designed by GM&#x27;s North American operations, GM&#x27;s Brazil operations, and Isuzu, which began selling its own version worldwide in 2002. Production began in October 2003. In late 2005, Isuzu offered a version in North America called the Isuzu i-series. This North American model Isuzu shared North American powertrains, styling, and equipment with the Colorado/Canyon twins and differed from Isuzu&#x27;s worldwide offering. All Chevrolet, GMC, and Isuzu versions worldwide are based on the GMT355, itself the basis for the GMT 345-based Hummer H3. Most vehicles for markets outside North America are manufactured at a GM plant in Rayong, Thailand. All North American-market vehicles were manufactured by Shreveport Operations.

The cooperation between GM and Isuzu to build a light-duty truck and offer it in North America returns to an original arrangement the two companies had in the 1970s with the Chevrolet LUV, a rebadged Isuzu Faster.

===Markets===

====North America====

The Colorado/Canyon trucks in the North American market offer both manual and automatic transmissions. GM also offers either a rear-wheel drive (4x2) or four-wheel drive (4x4) drivetrain with standard, extended, and four-door crew-cab body styles. Most models come with the LK5 I4 engine as standard, but a more powerful 3.5 L I5 comes with the Z71 package on four-door versions and is optional on all others. The 4-door Z71s also get the four-speed automatic transmission standard. This package was later dropped in favor of LT2 and LT3.

The Colorado was offered in three basic trim levels: Base, LS, and LT, while the Canyon was also offered in three trim levels, but with different names: Canyon, SLE, and SLT.

Three different cab configurations were offered on Colorado and Canyon: a two-door regular-cab model with a box and seating for either two or three passengers, a four-door extended-cab model with a box and seating for either four or five passengers, and a four-door crew-cab model with a shorter box and seating for either five or six passengers. Top trim levels in crew-cab configuration offered upscale features such as leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats with lumbar support and heat, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, XM satellite radio, and rear side-impact airbags.

Three different suspension options were offered on the Colorado and Canyon: The base Z85 suspension, which offered a comfortable ride quality; the Z71 Off-Road suspension, which added a locking rear differential axle (RPO code G80), heavier-duty shock absorbers for improved performance off-road, and an increased ride height for better clearance;the ZQ8 Sport suspension (see below), which offered a lower ride height than the standard Z85 suspension, as well as firmer suspension for improved handling. All suspension packages were offered on 4x2 or 4x4 models in all cab configurations, except for the ZQ8 Sport suspension, which was only offered on 4x2 models.

A ZQ8 edition is available with a lower and more road-tuned &quot;sport&quot; suspension than the standard Z85 and comes with 17 inch wheels, color-matched bumper and grille, and low profile fender flares. There is also a Xtreme edition of the ZQ8 which has a different front bumper, rear bumper, side skirts, fender flares, grille, headlights, and 18-inch wheels. The Xtreme edition is basically a continuation of a trim package from its predecessor, the Chevrolet S-10.

For 2007, Colorado/Canyon was facelifted and offered new engines, which include the LLV I4 and LLR I5 which were both introduced due to numerous head problems, new colors — Deep Ruby (Sonoma Red for the Canyon), Pace Blue (Sport Blue for the Canyon), and Imperial Blue (Midnight Blue for the Canyon), and new tires and wheels. Minor changes to the grille and interior for the LT models; the LS models kept the same pre-facelift look, similar to the facelift of the TrailBlazer in 2005. In addition, the &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Canyon&quot; badges were phased out from the doors in favor of GM&#x27;s corporate logo. For model year 2009, the Colorado was facelifted again and a new LH8 V8 engine was added, producing and . For the 2010 model year, the GM badges were phased out, although a few 2010 models had the GM logo on the doors.

In 2009, both trucks, as with most 2009 GM vehicles (and combined with OnStar), received a Bluetooth hands-free phone system for the first time as optional equipment. The six-disc in-dash CD changer was discontinued as well, leaving the single-disc CD/MP3 player, and a standard A/M-F/M only radio, with two-, four-, or six-speaker audio systems. Most later trucks received alloy wheels as standard equipment, with optional polished and chrome-plated wheels, in 16, 17, or 18-inch diameters. Only later base-model trucks received 16-inch steel wheels, which were a new wheel design. In addition, most newer trucks also featured standard SiriusXM satellite radio, when equipped with a CD/MP3 player.

Colorado/Canyon U.S. sales peaked in 2005 at 163,204 units, surpassing the perennial segment leader, the Ford Ranger, by almost 35% and just 3.3% behind the new best-seller, the Toyota Tacoma. In 2006, however, while still leading the Ranger by 27.5%, the Colorado/Canyon&#x27;s sales lagged their Toyota competitor&#x27;s by almost 34%. One 2005 Canyon owned by successful U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown became famous as it was widely featured in his TV advertisements.

====Safety====
In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s frontal offset test, the Colorado (extended version) is given a &quot;Good&quot; overall score, however the crew cab is rated &quot;Acceptable&quot;. In the side impact test, the Colorado crew cab is rated &quot;Poor&quot; with or without side curtain airbags. Side curtain airbags were made standard on all 2010 models; side torso airbags are not offered.

====Isuzu i-series====

The Isuzu i-series midsized pickup truck line was manufactured from 2005 to 2008. Launched at the 2005 New York International Auto Show, for the 2006 model year, the i-series replaced the Hombre, which had been out of production since 2000. Like the Hombre, which was based on the compact Chevrolet S-10/GMC Sonoma, the i-series was based on the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon. Two models were offered at launch: the i-280, powered by the 2.8 L I4 engine, and the i-350, powered by the 3.5 L I5 engine. The i-280 was available only with an extended cab, while the i-350 could be had with either an extended cab or crew cab. The i-280 and i-350 were replaced by the i-290 and i-370 respectively for 2007, with the introduction of the 2.9L and 3.7L engines.

The sales for the i-series were poor, with just 1,377 sold from the start of production through February 2006 according to &quot;Automotive News&quot;. As part of Isuzu&#x27;s withdrawal from the United States market after the 2008 model year, the i-series was discontinued.

====Thailand====

GM Thailand manufactured the Colorado from March 2004 with a mildly altered styling compared to the North American version. In late January 2006, Chevrolet introduced a G-80 differential lock system as optional for most Colorado trim levels. This feature is not available on the D-Max. Thai-market Colorados received a minor redesign in late 2007, with the front fascia being altered by toning down the American influence. The facelifted model was exported to Australia as the Holden Colorado from 2008.

In 2008, GM also introduced the Colorado 4x2 2.5 with diesel dual fuel system via CNG tank. It is switchable between diesel fuel and compressed natural gas with the ratio of 65:35. It is also compatible with pure diesel and biodiesel B5 fuel. Location of the tank is on the bed behind the cab. It was available for two cab styles.

====Australia and New Zealand====
The Colorado was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2008 as the Holden Colorado. It replaced the D-Max-based Holden Rodeo due to the split between General Motors and Isuzu. Imported from Thailand, it is essentially a rebadged version of the facelifted Thai-specification Colorado, retaining its front styling. As with the Rodeo, the Colorado is available as either 4x2 or 4x4 and in a range of body styles, including single-cab, space-cab, and crew-cab. Power is provided by a range of gasoline and diesel engines. Of the gasoline engines, Holden offers a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and the Australian-made 3.6-liter &quot;Alloytec&quot; engine. The diesel powerplant is a four-cylinder Isuzu 4JJ1 unit displacing 3.0 liters. It was replaced by the second-generation Holden Colorado in 2012.

==Second generation (RG; 2011)==

=== Global version ===
In March 2011, Chevrolet revealed the prototype version of the all-new Colorado at Bangkok International Motor Show. It was shown as an extended cab with a rear access system, and some of the high-tech equipment. In June 2011, Chevrolet revealed its crew cab in adventure concept at Buenos Aires, Argentina (this car also shown at Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011), and in July 2011, a Holden version of crew-cab version concept got its premiere at Australian International Motor Show.

The production model is available in three different cab styles: regular cab (single cab), extended cab (space cab), and crew cab (double cab), and either 4x2 or 4x4 drivetrain.

On 9 September 2011, General Motors (Thailand) opened the diesel engine manufacturing plant, to make the Duramax engine used by the Colorado. The engine is a rebranded VM Motori turbodiesel engine with 2.5- or 2.8-liter, paired with a manual or automatic transmission.

====Holden Colorado====
The Colorado was revealed at the 2011 Australian International Motor Show and went on sale in June 2012 in both Australia and New Zealand, sourced from the Rayong factory in Thailand. In Australia and New Zealand, the Colorado is badged as a Holden. Only one engine is offered, the 2.8 L turbo diesel, built by GM in the Rayong factory. It is available in four trim levels: DX (single cab chassis only), LX, LT, and LTZ. An LS trim was introduced in 2014. Single-cab and crew-cab models are available as either 4x2 or 4x4.

The facelifted Colorado model for the Australian and New Zealand markets was released in 2017 with GM&#x27;s MyLink infotainment system including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The model is built in right-hand drive at the GM Thailand plant.

A &quot;Thunder Edition&quot; is available on 4x4 LX, LT, and LTZ models. Among the features included with the pack are a nudge bar and towing kit, front carpet floor mats and a one-piece rear carpet floor mat, a bonnet protector, slimline weather shields, and &quot;Thunder&quot; badging.

Production of the Colorado in Thailand ended in 2020 as General Motors ended operations in the country. A refresh in line with the global Colorado was planned for the 2021 model year.

=====Trim levels=====
* DX features a manual transmission, electronic stability control, side-curtain airbags, Bluetooth capabilities, and 16-inch steel wheels.
* LX features either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, power mirrors, and cruise control.
* LT features fog lamps.
* LTZ features 17-inch alloy wheels, optional leather seats, LED taillamps, projector headlamps, sports bar, soft tonneau cover, and side steps.
* Z71, the top trim, includes off-road gear and 18-inch wheels.

=== North American version ===

The North American model was revealed on November 20, 2013, at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Production began at Wentzville Assembly in 2014, and vehicles started arriving at dealerships nationwide by mid- to late 2014, as an early 2015 model year vehicle. It competes with other midsized pickup truck offerings.

The North American model features a different front fascia, with its design being similar to the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado (particularly the taillamp lenses, tailgate and rear bumper), and different engines. The North American Colorado&#x27;s frame is 40% lighter than the global version, it uses high-strength steel, and is much longer. General Motors&#x27; Wentzville assembly plant received a $380 million expansion of 500,000 sq ft that was constructed to support the new Colorado&#x27;s assembly. In September 2014, GM added workers to the Wentzville factory after it received advanced orders of 30,000 Colorado/Canyons from its dealerships.

For the initial launch, the Colorado was available with either a 2.5 L &quot;Ecotec&quot; I4 engine or the 3.6 L &quot;LFX&quot; V6 engine. The 2.8 L &quot;Duramax LWN&quot; turbodiesel engine was added in 2016, and is a first for its class in the US market. It is also available in three cab configurations: extended cab with a bed, crew cab with a bed, or crew cab with a bed, with four-wheel drive being optional.

16-inch or 17-inch steel wheels or alloy wheels are available, as well as a Decor package for the WT model that adds a chrome front grille and body-colored door handles and side-view mirrors.

==== Trim levels ====
* Base trim level (2015-2020)
* WT base trim level (&quot;Work Truck&quot;)
* LT mid-level trim and most common
* Z71, the top trim, includes off-road equipment.
* ZR2 for off-road performance is the halo model.

The base Colorado trim level includes as standard equipment: 16-inch steel wheels, vinyl seating surfaces, an A/M-F/M stereo with auxiliary audio input and a six-speaker audio system, power windows and door locks (no keyless entry), a 2.5 L Ecotec I4 gasoline engine, a six-speed manual transmission (until mid-2019, when the manual transmission was discontinued and a six-speed automatic transmission became standard), carpeted flooring, and a chrome front grille. This model is available exclusively as an extended cab.

The W/T includes the same standard equipment as the base Colorado trim level, but has more optional equipment, such as a seven-inch color touch-screen MyLink radio, cloth seating surfaces, keyless entry, 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, color-keyed door mirrors, an automatic transmission, and a 3.6 L V6 gasoline engine. It is available as either an extended cab, or as a crew cab with either a short or long box.

The LT adds this equipment to the base Colorado and W/T trim levels: 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, 3.6 L V6 gasoline engine, automatic transmission, eight-inch color touch-screen MyLink radio, SiriusXM satellite radio, OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity (later models only), cloth seating surfaces, and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes a 2.8 L Duramax I4 turbodiesel engine, remote start, a rearview backup camera system, a premium Bose seven-speaker audio system, a GPS navigational radio with MyLink, and chrome exterior accessories. It is available as either an extended cab, or as a crew cab with either a short or long box.

The Z71 is the top-of-the-line trim level, and adds this to the LT trim level: unique aluminum-alloy wheels, vinyl and cloth combination seating surfaces, and a black front grille. Optional equipment is the same as the LT. It is available as either an extended cab, or as a crew cab with either a short or long box.

Later 2015 Colorado and Canyon models offered 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities through the OnStar system, standard on higher trim levels, and optional on lower trim levels. For 2016, trucks equipped with the eight-inch MyLink or GMC IntelliLink touchscreen infotainment system received standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.

Starting with the 2017 model year, base Colorado and Canyon models received a standard seven-inch Chevrolet MyLink (or GMC Intellilink) touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless stereo audio streaming, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, an A/M-F/M radio, and auxiliary and USB audio inputs, along with a six-speaker audio system. Most models also included a rear backup camera system. OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities was optional on base Colorado and Canyon models.

The six-speed manual transmission was discontinued during the 2019 model year and is no longer available in the Colorado or Canyon.

Starting with the 2020 model year, both the 4x2 Z71 Extended Cab and Z71 crew-cab long-box models were removed from the lineup, along with the RST and Redline editions, as both will be combined with the luxury edition.

The ZR2 is the &quot;off-road&quot; trim level, and adds to the Z71 trim level: 2-inch taller suspension, 3.5-inch wider track, 31-inch off-road tires, unique aluminum-alloy wheels, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, functional rock sliders, Multimatic DSSV position-sensitive shock absorbers, aluminum skid plates to protect the radiator, oil pan, and front differential, locking front and rear differentials, and high approach-angle front bumper. Optional equipment is the same as the LT and Z71 trim levels, except for the availability of a rear bed-mounted light bar. It is available as either an extended cab with a long box, or as a crew cab with a short box.

The 2021 model year Colorado received a revised appearance and an updated grille in line with the Chevrolet design language, but will see its level trims reduced to four: Work, LT, Z71, and ZR2. The 2WD Base trim was eliminated.

In Mexico, three configurations are available: WT Double Cab, with a 2.5-liter engine, six-speed automatic transmission, and rear wheel drive; the LT Extended Cab, with a 2.5-liter engine, six-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive; and the LT Extended Cab, with a 3.6-liter V6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, connectable transmission, and 4x4.

==== GMC Canyon ====
The all-new GMC Canyon was introduced on January 12, 2014. GMC introduced in an official press and video release and made its public debut the following day (January 13, 2014) at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Sales started at dealerships in the second quarter of 2014 as a 2015 model.

The Canyon offers the same features as its cousin, but will have a higher MSRP and more options. It also sports a front grille design that closely resembles its full-size sibling, the GMC Sierra. The Canyon comes in three trims and either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The base model is only available with the 2.5 L Ecotec I4 engine, a 6-speed manual transmission (until mid-2019 when the manual transmission was discontinued and a six-speed automatic transmission became standard), and two-wheel drive.

Optional features (based on trim) will include active aero grille shutters, available OnStar 4G LTE connectivity with on-board Wi-Fi, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and an available Teen Driver feature that limits speed and audio volume.

On February 16, 2015, GMC posted spy shots of a Canyon with Denali styling, indicating plans to add the mid-size truck to the Denali lineup as a 2016 model.

Both the Canyon and Colorado received a facelift for the 2021 model year, prior to the debut of a third generation in the 2023 model year.

GMC also saw its level trims reduced and renamed for the 2021 model year: Elevation Standard, Elevation, AT4, and Denali. It is unknown why the SLE and SLT trims were deleted.

==== Colorado ZR2 ====

The ZR2 concept was shown at the 2014 LA Auto Show. Due to positive feedback, a production ready version was introduced two years later at the 2016 LA Auto Show, which joined the 2017 lineup.

The Colorado ZR2 offers the same amenities as its brother the Z71, but is heavily tailored towards off-road performance. The ZR2 model is available in 2 body configurations: crew cab with 5 ft bed or extended cab with 6 ft bed. Engine options are the 3.6 L &quot;LGZ&quot; V6 engine and the 2.8 L &quot;Duramax LWN&quot; turbodiesel engine.

Chevrolet designed many new parts specifically for the ZR2 to improve off-road performance. New features and parts standard or optional on the ZR2 include:
* 3.5&quot; Wider Track
* 2&quot; Lift
* Multimatic Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) Dampers
* Electronic Locking Front and Rear Differentials
* Longer, Cast Iron Control Arms

* Optional Bed-Mounted Full Size Spare Tire
* Optional Carpet Delete

The 2018 Colorado ZR2 was featured in Season 9 Episode 99 of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Head 2 Head, where it faced off against a 2017 Ram 2500 Power Wagon.

==== Colorado ZH2 (Military Truck) ====
GM Defense and U.S. Army TARDEC partnered in 2016 to develop and successfully test the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 fuel cell electric truck, with low acoustical and heat signatures as well as the advantages of on-board water production, exportable electric power and off-road capability.

==== Infantry Squad Vehicle ====
The US Army&#x27;s Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) is heavily based on the diesel variant of the ZR2, with 90% of the vehicle coming from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components.

===Engines===
== Third generation (2023) ==

The third-generation Colorado and Canyon debuted in July 2022 for the 2023 model year. The new model is available only with a Crew Cab and a single bed length.

It shares its L3B engine with the full-size Silverado.

Despite being a mid-size, in some dimensions it is somewhat bigger than the full-size Silverado, being built around the same chassis and frame while sharing the same L3B engine.

<text>The Chevrolet Equinox is a crossover SUV introduced by Chevrolet in 2004 for the 2005 model year. It was intended to replace the North American Chevrolet Tracker and Chevrolet S-10 Blazer. The third-generation Equinox also replaced the first-generation Chevrolet Captiva.

An all-electric battery-powered (BEV) version called the Equinox EV was introduced in 2022 with sales starting in 2023 for the 2024 model year. It adopts a separate design and underpinnings from the internal combustion engine powered Equinox.


== First generation (2005) ==
The Chevrolet Equinox was introduced in 2004 at the 2003 North American International Auto Show for the 2005 model year; its mechanical twin, the Pontiac Torrent, was introduced in 2005 at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show for the 2006 model year. A unique feature on the Equinox was its sliding rear bench seat dubbed &quot;Multi-Flex&quot;.

Riding on the GM Theta platform, the unibody is mechanically similar to the Saturn Vue and the Suzuki XL7. However, the Equinox and the Torrent are larger than the Vue, riding on a wheelbase, longer than the Vue. Front-wheel drive is standard, with optional all-wheel drive. They are not designed for off-roading unlike the truck-based Chevrolet Tahoe and TrailBlazer.

For the 2006 model year, GM updated the Equinox for the first time, adding GM badges on the front doors, as well as recoloring the dashboard panel from grey to black. Heated seats became available with the cloth interior, and the rear seats now featured smaller headrests for improved rear visibility. The transmission shifter knob and HVAC controls were also updated. Outside, LS models now featured a standard body-color front bumper (instead of black), while LT models now featured body-color outside mirrors.

The Equinox and Torrent received several interior and mechanical updates for 2007. The instrument cluster was redesigned with a trip computer display, replacing the Saturn-sourced unit. There were also some mechanical updates: the gear ratios of the five-speed transmission were revised for improved fuel economy, brakes now have rear vented discs instead of drums, and the fuel tank size is now 20.5 US gallons (on FWD) or 16.6 US gallons (on AWD), instead of the previous 17-US-gallon size on both models.

The first-generation Equinox and Torrent were produced exclusively at the CAMI Automotive GM/Suzuki joint venture plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. The 3.4 L &quot;LNJ&quot; V6 engine is made in China (by Shanghai GM), while the Aisin AF33 transmission is made in Japan. Starting with the 2008 model year, the Equinox Sport and Torrent GXP were available with a 3.6-liter DOHC V6 engine that was made in the United States.

Production ended in May 2009.

The Chevrolet Equinox was not sold in Mexico during the 2009 model year.

=== Pontiac Torrent ===

While the Torrent shares its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox, it does have a different front and rear styling.

The Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year as part of the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand, with the last one rolling off the assembly line on September 2, 2009. A Buick Theta crossover SUV was to be made, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent. Instead, GM replaced the Torrent with the GMC Terrain, which shares the Theta platform with the second-generation Equinox.

=== Engines ===
=== Sport trims ===

For the 2008 and 2009 model years, GM offered different versions of the Equinox and Torrent; called Sport and GXP, respectively. Featuring a 3.6-liter &quot;LY7&quot; DOHC V6 engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability). This larger and more powerful ( or 40% increase) engine allowed acceleration from in under seven seconds.

These models also received a lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension and unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18-inch 5-spoke chrome wheels and the absence of the roof rack, giving them a smoother design flow compared to the standard models. The GXP had twin hood scoops, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim with unique gauges, and a dual chrome-tipped exhaust.

Optional features included navigation, heated sport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, a sunroof, and all-wheel drive. GM stated the Equinox Sport was the first vehicle to reflect its more cautious naming standards. GM also prominently promoted the Pontiac Torrent GXP in television advertisements by touting its horsepower advantage over the BMW X3, in an effort to brand Pontiac more as a direct, low-cost rival to BMW.

=== Equinox LTZ ===
An Equinox LTZ model was added for the 2008 model year. It is differentiated by its 17-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, chrome door handles, and chrome luggage rack side rail inserts. Standard interior features include heated front seats, leather seating inserts, head curtain side-impact airbags, AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD changer and MP3 capability, and a Pioneer premium seven-speaker audio system. The Equinox LTZ came with the same ride and handling package as LS and LT models.

=== Olympic-themed special editions ===
For the 2008 model year, in tribute to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the Equinox and Torrent each received a special edition, the Team Canada Edition and the Podium Edition, respectively. This package added chrome-clad wheels, sunroof, premium sound system, and special badging. These trims were sold only in Canada.

== Second generation (2010) ==

The second-generation Equinox was announced by GM on December 21, 2008, and debuted at the 2009 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The 2010 Equinox went on sale in June 2009. It is built on a stiffened version of the same &quot;Theta&quot; platform used in the previous model. The second-generation Equinox was built with a pair of upgraded gasoline direct injection engines, with better fuel economy claimed by GM. Earlier 2010 models had the GM badges on the front doors but were later deleted. It also features the Multi-Flex sliding rear bench seat and an optional height-programmable power liftgate.

Marketing of the Chevrolet Equinox resumed in Mexico in late November 2009, for the 2010 model year after a year of absence, but ceased after the 2011 model year. However, in October 2015, the Equinox was reintroduced in Mexico to replace the Captiva Sport for the 2016 model year.

The second-generation Equinox is available standard with a 2.4-liter Ecotec I4 engine produced in Tonawanda, New York, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, while a 3.0-liter V6 engine is available as an option on LT and LTZ trims. Four-cylinder models have electric power steering, while V6 models have the more conventional hydraulic power steering. Both powertrains are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission and an optional all-wheel-drive system, with front-wheel drive being standard.

=== Model year changes ===

A new FE2 suspension package, with front dual-flow dampers, was offered, optional on the LTZ V6 and packaged with 18-inch or 19-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels. 

Additional new features for 2013 models included a dual-player DVD entertainment system, a power convenience package, and a safety package with lane departure warning system, forward collision warning, and rear park assist (available on 2LT and LTZ). A USB port became standard on all models.

====2014====
For the 2014 model year, chrome-clad wheels became standard on LTZ models. Chrome exterior door handles and mirror caps were also available on LT models as part of the Chrome Package. 

====2015====
The 2015 model year saw the addition of OnStar with 4G LTE and built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, which included a 3GB/three-month data trial, standard on LT and LTZ models, with navigation available on LTZ and 2LT. A new level trim, L, was introduced as the base trim; derived from the LS trim, it was exclusively available in front-wheel drive and with the 2.4-liter Ecotec engine, and did not come with rear floor mats, the digital compass, or SiriusXM radio. The flex-fuel capability option for the 3.6-liter V6 was discontinued.

====2016====
For 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox received its first mid-cycle refresh (along with its cousin, the GMC Terrain), which was unveiled at the 2015 Chicago Auto Show on February 12, 2015. This Equinox received a new grille, headlights, wheels, and front fascia, as well as reworked tail lights. On the interior, the Equinox gained a new gear selector, a second storage shelf underneath the dashboard (in the place of the discontinued CD player), as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard. The 1LT and 2LT trims were merged into a single LT trim. Also, front-wheel-drive models could no longer be had with the 3.6-liter V6 engine.

All Equinox trims featured projector-style front headlights, backup camera, and the Chevrolet MyLink 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system. The OnStar delete feature was removed along with the rear-seat DVD entertainment system and 19-inch wheels.

==== 2017 ====
For 2017, the final model year of this generation, the Equinox received two new appearance packages—a Midnight Edition package and a Sport package. Both packages featured 18-inch black-painted five-spoke aluminum wheels, black exterior Chevrolet emblems, black accented grille and rear fascia, black roof-rack cross bars, Jet Black perforated leather-appointed seats, and memory driver seat and exterior mirrors. The Midnight Edition had black exterior paint, while the Sport package had white exterior paint; both packages were only available with the 2.4-liter Ecotec engine. The 18-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels were discontinued. The LTZ trim was renamed Premier, while the Equinox badge was moved from the right side of the liftgate to the left.

=== Engines ===

Notes:

* All four-cylinder models have a single rear exhaust port, while all V6 models have dual rear exhaust ports.
* All ratings are on regular gasoline.

=== EPA fuel economy ratings ===
Skepticism about the Equinox&#x27;s EPA fuel economy ratings has been raised after a number of road tests at the model&#x27;s launch achieved 20 to 30% lower fuel economy than the official EPA ratings. After achieving in a road test, &quot;Edmunds InsideLine&quot; stated, &quot;...our testing didn&#x27;t come close to achieving [the EPA&#x27;s numbers], even though we&#x27;re usually within 1 mpg of the EPA combined number.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; recorded another figure and noted its &quot;...fuel economy that won’t live up to the / EPA ratings in real-world use...&quot;. Green Car Reports recorded as much as on a road trip, driving almost exclusively highway miles in &quot;Eco&quot; mode; this is about 20% below the published highway EPA rating. AutoWeek only averaged . The Truth About Cars published an editorial suggesting that GM &quot;inflated&quot; the Equinox&#x27;s fuel economy ratings for public relations purposes and that the trip computer inaccurately reports fuel economy reported to the driver.

Motorweek, however, managed to achieve with their test car during mixed driving. LeftlaneNews.com was also able to average average in mixed city and highway driving.

=== Safety ===
The 2010 Equinox was awarded &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; by IIHS.

== Third generation (2018) ==

Chevrolet unveiled the third-generation Equinox on September 22, 2016. Gasoline-powered variants of the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox went on sale in early 2017, while diesel-powered variants arrived in fall 2017. This generation was developed as a smaller vehicle to align itself with other vehicles in the compact crossover SUV segment, with its former role occupied by the new Chevrolet Blazer.

The third-generation Equinox also introduced a new AWD system from GKN Driveline, allowing the driver to disengage the driveshaft to reduce friction and rotational inertia when AWD is not needed by the push of a button. Other new features that were standard on all models included a start-stop system, passive entry, active grille shutters, electronic parking brake, second-row HVAC, and umbrella storage in the front door panels.

New safety features introduced on the third-generation Equinox include a surround-view camera, forward collision warning, low-speed automatic braking, and a Safety Alert Seat, as well as a standard Rear Seat Alert system, a feature first introduced on the 2017 GMC Acadia. While the Equinox no longer features a sliding rear seat, the rear seats can be folded by disengaging the latches on the top of the rear seats, or additionally on LT and higher trims, by using the levers on the right side of the cargo area.

For 2019, the infotainment systems were upgraded with all models now featuring two USB ports on the center stack, while the second-row 12-volt power outlet was replaced with two USB charge-only ports; an SD card reader and higher-quality backup camera and sound system became available on higher trims. All LT models now feature a multi-color LCD display on the gauge cluster. New safety features, including adaptive cruise control, front pedestrian braking, became available. The Premier badge on the liftgate was changed from a single rectangular emblem to individual letters.

For 2020, the diesel engine was discontinued because of low consumer demand. (GM originally planned to discontinue AWD on diesel models.) All Equinox models now came standard with a host of additional safety features, including forward collision alert, following distance indicator, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, forward automatic emergency brakes, and &quot;IntelliBeam&quot; automatic high-beam headlamps. The rear passive entry buttons were also removed from the exterior door handles.

For 2021, the 2.0-liter &quot;LTG&quot; turbocharged inline-four was discontinued as it only comprised around seven percent of all Equinox sales. Leather seating became available on LT models with the Confidence and Convenience Package.

The Equinox was discontinued again in the Mexican market in July 2021 because of poor sales, being indirectly replaced by the Captiva, although it is still produced in Mexico for export markets.

===Trim levels===
The third-generation Equinox is available in four trim levels: L, LS, LT, and Premier. The 1.5-liter turbo I4 is standard on all trims. The 2.0-liter turbo I4 and 1.6-liter turbo-diesel is available on LT and Premier. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trims, while all-wheel drive is available on LS and higher trims.

An appearance package was available as the Redline Edition. The Redline Edition was only available on the LT trim without the panoramic sunroof or diesel engine. The Redline Edition became available in October 2017.

For the 2020 model year, the Midnight Edition and Sport Edition packages became available on LT models. Both packages featured blacked-out trim, including leather seating (cloth for 2021), 19-inch aluminum wheels, Chevrolet bowties, grille, fog lamp bezel surround, and window trim. The Midnight Edition was only available in the &quot;Mosaic Black Metallic&quot; exterior color, while the Sport Edition was available with most of the other colors. The Midnight trim line went on sale in Mexico in September 2019.

=== Powertrain ===
The third-generation Equinox is available with up to three turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine choices. Gasoline engines are identical to the 2016 Malibu: a 1.5-liter unit that produces ( less than the 2.4-liter engine in the previous Equinox but more torque), or a 2.0-liter unit that produces ( less than the 3.6-liter V6 engine in the previous Equinox). For the first time, a 1.6-liter turbo-diesel I4 engine that produces became available, but only on LT and Premier trims. The 2.0-liter unit is mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission, while the other two engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.

===2022 refresh===
On February 6, 2020, Chevrolet unveiled a refreshed Equinox at the Chicago Auto Show. The updated vehicle sports a new front grille, which extends into the redesigned headlamps, along with a restyled lower fascia with different fog lamps. The rear also sees redesigned tail lamps and rear bumper. On the interior, the cloth seats are redesigned, featuring a zig-zag pattern instead of a honeycomb pattern, and all models now have wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay and an auto stop-start deactivation switch.

The trim levels changed slightly, with the RS joining the primary LS, LT, and Premier offerings. The sport/street-centric RS trim is set apart by its unique front and rear stylings, black exterior accents, black badges, &quot;Dark Android&quot; 19-inch wheels, and quad-tip exhaust. Inside, the sport-inspired crossover features black upholstery with red contrasting stitching and an RS-branded shift knob and front passenger seat tag.

The base L trim level was dropped, making the LS trim level the base model. The Midnight and Sport editions were replaced by the new RS trim level, while the Redline edition was later offered, but on Premier instead of LT. The refreshed Equinox went on sale in the first quarter of 2021 as a 2022 model, a year later than originally planned because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2022 model was only available with the 1.5-liter &quot;LYX&quot; turbo inline-four. A 2.0-liter turbo inline-four did not return for the 2022 refresh.

For 2023, the 1.5-liter &quot;LYX&quot; turbo inline-four was replaced by the 1.5-liter &quot;LSD&quot; turbo inline-four which adds a higher-pressure fuel system (from 20 MPa to 35 MPa), enhanced piston design with PVD coating, and precise intake phaser positioning optimizing efficiency which together contribute to a 5 hp increase to 175 hp over the &quot;LYX&quot;. All Equinox models now featured electro-hydraulic brakes, and the Midnight and Sport editions returned on the LS trim. 

===Engines===
===Holden Equinox===

Holden launched the Holden Equinox (EQ series) in Australia in November 2017, with the first cars arriving in Australia and New Zealand in December. It was available with a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine on the base LS and LS+ models, while the more potent 2.0-liter turbocharged model was available for all other models – LT, LTZ, and LTZ-V. The 1.6-liter turbo-diesel engine launched in 2018. It was produced at GM&#x27;s Ramos Arizpe assembly facility in Mexico and replaced the Korean-built five-seat Captiva.

The Australasian Equinox was sold alongside the seven-seat Holden Acadia, known as the GMC Acadia in the Americas.

On October 17, 2018, Holden halted orders on the Equinox because of slow sales and unsold inventory at its dealerships. The Holden Equinox was discontinued in 2020, along with the rest of the Holden lineup, following GM&#x27;s decision to terminate the marque in Australia and New Zealand and withdraw from all right-hand-drive markets because of poor sales and adequate investments not being returned for demand and funding needed continue to serve and remain present in right-hand-drive markets.

== Fourth generation (2025) ==
Chevrolet unveiled the fourth-generation Equinox on January 23, 2024, for the 2025 model year. The model adopts a new electrical architecture and a new platform spun off the existing D2XX platform, called the VSS-S. It also carries over the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine used by the outgoing Equinox. Trim levels are reduced from four to three, which are LT, RS, and ACTIV, with each trim having its unique front fascia. 

The fourth-generation Equinox is built at the San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico (alongside the GMC Terrain) and sales commenced in mid-2024. It is sold alongside the battery-electric powered Equinox EV.

The Equinox shares similar exterior styling from the Traverse, with its front fascia and shark-fin style C-pillar. It features all-LED lighting and for the first time, it is available with 20-inch alloy wheels.

The ACTIV model features 17-inch machine-finished alloy wheels in all-terrain tires, an available white-colored roof option for a dual-tone exterior color, blacked badging, a unique front fascia with vertical grille inserts and gray metallic accents, a Maple Sugar and Black interior theme, and ACTIV logo stitched on front seat headrests.

The interior has an 11-inch configurable Driver Information Center and an 11.3-inch infotainment touchscreen system (30% larger screen compared to the previous model) that features Google built-in connected services; it has a similar screen layout to the Trax. The gear selector for the automatic transmission is now located on the steering wheel column which allows the drive mode selection dial to be placed in the center console, and the physical headlight controls were omitted to reduce microchip usage.

The 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine is carried over from its predecessor, with the option of FWD and AWD drivetrains. GM has dropped the 6-speed automatic transmission; instead, the FWD models use a continuously variable transmission (CVT) while the AWD models use an eight-speed automatic transmission. For the first time, the Equinox features drive mode selection on the RS and ACTIV trims.

It also debuted in March 2024 in China, where it is marketed as the Equinox Plus to differentiate it from the previous generation. It is available as a plug-in hybrid vehicle, powered by a similar 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine.

== Equinox EV ==

The battery-electric version of the Equinox was introduced in January 2022 in a set of artist impression images at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and went on sale in 2024 for the 2024 model year. It received a completely separate design and underpinnings to the ICE-powered Equinox. The vehicle is equipped with GM Ultium batteries shared with other GM battery electric vehicles.

== Fuel cell version ==

The Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell Vehicle uses hydrogen for fuel with water as its only exhaust. The Equinox Fuel Cell uses the fourth-generation hydrogen technology found in the Chevrolet Sequel concept, which was unveiled in September 2009. The fuel cell is designed for only of driving, but is engineered to be operable in sub-freezing temperatures throughout its life. GM states that the Equinox Fuel Cell is about heavier than the original Equinox and has one inch shorter ground clearance. To reduce weight, it has aluminum doors and a carbon fiber hood. It uses headlights from the Pontiac Torrent.

A dashboard mounted screen calculates the fuel savings to that of a gasoline-powered Equinox. It also includes a kilowatt meter and a fuel cell energy display. The fuel cell has four vapor outlets that replace the exhaust pipe. Three carbon-fiber fuel tanks store up to a maximum of 9.25 pounds (4.2 kg) of gaseous hydrogen at 10,000 psi (70 MPa), and give the Equinox a range of . The Equinox Fuel Cell is certified by the EPA as a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV). GM built 115 Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell vehicles and deployed them in 2007–2008 in several target areas including New York and California as part of a comprehensive plan dubbed &quot;Project Driveway&quot;.

The Equinox Fuel Cell includes safety features such as ABS, traction control system, and GM&#x27;s OnStar telematics service, which offers drivers advice on operating the vehicles as well as information on nearby hydrogen filling stations. The vehicle complies with all 2007 federal safety standards.

=== Performance ===
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; assessed the vehicle&#x27;s performance as nearly the same as the 3.6-liter gasoline-powered equivalent, while bemoaning the dearth of high-pressure hydrogen filling stations near Riverside, California, in 2008.

==Natural gas version==
In 2013, Nat G CNG Solutions and AGA Systems announced that it had begun offering a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) version of the Chevrolet Equinox and the GMC Terrain using the 2.4-liter direct-injected engine. The natural gas version is a &quot;bi-fuel&quot; CNG vehicle, meaning that it can run on either gasoline or natural gas, giving it extended range. The Terrain/Equinox were the first direct-injection natural gas vehicles ever approved by the US EPA.

Silver Eagle Distributors, a distributor of Anheuser-Busch products, was the launch customer for the natural gas version with an initial order of up to 100 of the natural gas GMC Terrains. CenterPoint Energy was an early customer of the natural gas Chevy Equinox.

=== CNG configurations ===
The CNG version was available as a newly purchased Equinox through select dealers or as a retrofit on 2013 and 2014 models. Nat G CNG Solutions offered the vehicle in two options: a two-seater &quot;cargo version&quot; and a five-seat &quot;passenger version.&quot; The cargo version has an 837-mile combined gasoline / natural gas (9.2 GGE of CNG) while the passenger version has a 775-mile combined highway range (6.8 GGE of CNG).

=== Emissions and performance ===
The companies claimed that the natural gas version had tested at the EPA lab at highway on natural gas and had achieved a Bin 3 emissions equivalent to the Toyota Prius.
== Electric conversion ==

Amp Electric Vehicles has sold an all-electric conversion of the Chevrolet Equinox. It sold its first converted Equinox to Dayton Power &amp; Light, and had a five-year, thousand-SUV order from Northern Lights Energy in Iceland.

<text>Funny Lady is a 1975 American biographical musical comedy-drama film and the sequel to the 1968 film &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. The film stars Barbra Streisand, James Caan, Omar Sharif, Roddy McDowall and Ben Vereen.

Herbert Ross, who helmed the musical sequences for &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (which had been directed by William Wyler), serves as the director. The screenplay, written by Jay Presson Allen and Arnold Schulman as based on a story by Schulman, is a highly fictionalized account of the later life and career of comedienne Fanny Brice and her marriage to songwriter and impresario Billy Rose. The primary score was by John Kander and Fred Ebb. The film was nominated for numerous awards including Golden Globe nominations for Streisand as Best Actress and Best Actor for Caan. Streisand revisited the soundtrack to the film in her 2016 concert.

==Plot==
Fanny Brice, now finishing her Broadway show after its success has come and gone in the midst of the Great Depression, finds only flowers and a divorce decree from her estranged husband Nicky Arnstein. Fanny and her confidant Bobby Moore are now out of work since Florenz Ziegfeld is not available to produce a new musical show. During a meeting with Bernard Baruch, her financial advisor, she meets his former secretary Billy Rose. When Fanny and Bobby go into nightclubs looking for material to &quot;borrow&quot;, they hear a torch song in &quot;More Than You Know&quot; that was written by Rose. Although irritated by his pushy nature in trying to sell the song to her, Fanny soon records the song at a studio before being shocked to read in the newspaper that she will star in a show by Rose called Crazy Quilt.

The show ends up getting $50,000 from Buck Bolton when Rose promises to cast Bolton&#x27;s mistress Norma Butler as one of the stars. Despite having a big number for Fanny in “I Found A Million Dollar Baby In A Five And Ten Cents Store”, opening night proves to be a disaster in terms of collapsing sets and more. Fanny considers leaving the production but stays when hearing that Billy borrowed money from mobsters that would kill him if he can&#x27;t make the money back. The two work together to scale down the show. The improved show opens in New York to applause and great reviews before Fanny sees Nicky backstage with a ring on his finger from a rich woman, to whom he&#x27;s now married. Billy, ready to travel to Fort Worth, Texas for a new show, offers to marry Fanny beforehand. She accepts only to find that Billy was bluffing about borrowing money from the mob to keep her close.

The wedding party finds Billy treated roughly by Fanny&#x27;s society friends before the honeymoon in Texas turns to bickering between the newlyweds. During the next few years their careers are so busy that they only talk to each other when they telephone their publicist at the same time. Billy does a show called Aquacade, featuring Eleanor Holm, a 1932 Olympic gold medalist as the star. Later on, Fanny encounters Bobby Moore and Norma Butler in Los Angeles and sees Nicky on the field of a polo game in Beverly Hills and feels that her friends tricked her. She calls Billy, but he cannot leave his Aquacade show. While Fanny and Nicky reminisce about old times, Fanny notes that Nicky hasn&#x27;t asked about their daughter Frances, whom he hasn&#x27;t seen in six years. Fanny travels to Cleveland only to find Billy in bed with Eleanor. She goes to the train station where Billy arrives to apologize. She states that her love for Nicky was gone for good while blaming herself for Billy&#x27;s infidelity. She then asks him to leave her alone to wait for her train. Years pass and in the 1940s Fanny is starring in The Baby Snooks Show on radio while Billy works as a writer of popular songs and plays. They meet each other again and he plays &quot;Me And My Shadow&quot;, a song he tells Fanny he wrote about their marriage. He tells her about his recent purchase of the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and an idea for her to star in his new show. Fanny says she will think it over as the two kiss and part once again.

==Production==
===Development===
Although contractually bound to make one more film for producer Ray Stark (Fanny Brice&#x27;s one-time son-in-law), Streisand balked at doing the project. She told Stark &quot;that it would take litigation to make her do a sequel.&quot; However, Streisand liked the script, which showed Fanny to be &quot;...tougher, more acerbic, more mature...&quot;, and she agreed.

===Casting===
The first to read for Billy Rose was Robert Blake. Other actors were mentioned, including Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, but ultimately James Caan was chosen. Streisand explained: &quot;It comes down to whom the audience wants me to kiss. Robert Blake, no. James Caan, yes.&quot;

===Filming===
Stark, unhappy with the scenes shot by original cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, lured an ailing James Wong Howe out of retirement to complete the film. It proved to be his final project, and it earned him an Academy Award nomination.

===Post-production===
Studio executives forced Ross to trim the film to a manageable 136 minutes before release. Much of Vereen&#x27;s performance ended up on the cutting room floor, together with a recreation of Brice&#x27;s &quot;Baby Snooks&quot; radio show and dramatic scenes involving her and her daughter.

In addition to Howe, Oscar nominations went to Ray Aghayan and Bob Mackie for Best Costume Design, Kander and Ebb for Best Original Song (&quot;How Lucky Can You Get&quot;), Peter Matz for Best Scoring of an Original Song Score and/or Adaptation, and the sound team. Streisand, Caan and Vereen all received Golden Globe Award nominations, as did Kander and Ebb and the film itself, but it was shut out of any wins in both competitions.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Funny Lady&quot; opened Wednesday, March 12, 1975 and grossed $2,254,3851 in its first five days from 111 theatres to be number one at the US box office. It went on to gross $40,055,897 at the U.S. and Canadian box office, making it the seventh highest grossing picture of 1975. It was one of Caan&#x27;s most successful films at the box office.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. 

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;As long as Miss Streisand as Fanny is singing the blues, or singing anything else, &quot;Funny Lady&quot; is superb entertainment, but the minute she stops the movie turns into a concrete soufflé. It&#x27;s heavy and tasteless ... Moments meant to be dramatic are embarrassingly bad.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and called it &quot;a big, messy flop of a movie that&#x27;s almost cruel in the way it invites our memories of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and doesn&#x27;t match them.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded two and a half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;It takes few chances and delivers mostly what you&#x27;d expect ... What was missing, for me at least, was a sense of surprise, of unpredictability—the sort of wit or pacing that separates a memorable musical like &quot;Cabaret&quot; from the merely tuneful.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Streisand is in beautiful voice, and her singing is terrific—too terrific. It&#x27;s no longer singing, it&#x27;s something else—that strident overdramatization that turns a song into a big number. The audience&#x27;s attention is directed away from the music and onto the star&#x27;s feat in charging it with false energy. Streisand is out to knock you cold, and you get cold, all right.&quot; Kael also criticized the plot as &quot;right out of those terrible forties movies in which couples who break up spend a lifetime thinking about each other, with encounters every five or ten years. And we get a double load of it here, with two graying ex-husbands.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Barbra Streisand was outstanding as the younger Fanny Brice in &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and in &quot;Funny Lady&quot; she&#x27;s even better ... However much of a letdown the plot becomes, there&#x27;s no denying the superior integration of drama, comedy, show music and personal dramatic music en route.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Barbra Streisand, like the picture, extends the characterization she launched so dazzlingly in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; ... What I find most impressive and likable about the performance is the softened, bittersweet maturity that Streisand lets us see in Fanny Brice. You sense that Streisand understands the star as well as she understood the impetuous young hopeful. An extraordinary presentation is the power and delight of both movies.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;lavish but uninspired&quot; film that &quot;seems to be celebrating stardom for stardom&#x27;s sake. It&#x27;s a joyless, mechanical Big Movie Musical.&quot;

Caan thought there were &quot;too many cooks messing around&quot;, although he liked his performance.

==Accolades==
==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Chart at number 6 and was certified gold. A majority of the songs were written by Kander and Ebb.

<text>The Chevrolet Express (also known as the GMC Savana) is a series of full-size vans produced by General Motors since 1996. The successor to the Chevrolet G-series van, the Express is produced in passenger and cargo variants. Alongside the standard van body, the line is offered as a cutaway van chassis, which is a chassis cab variant developed for commercial-grade applications, including ambulances, buses, motorhomes, and small trucks.

In production for a single generation since 1996, over three million examples of the Express and the Savana have been produced. One of the longest-produced designs in American automotive history, the Express/Savana are rivaled only by the Jeep Wagoneer and Dodge Ram Van for longevity. 

Since 1995, General Motors has assembled the Express and Savana at its Wentzville Assembly facility (Wentzville, Missouri). Also, since 2017, GM has sourced commercial cutaway-chassis production from Navistar through its Springfield Assembly Plant (Springfield, Ohio).

== Model history ==

=== Pre-facelift (1996–2002) ===

For the 1996 model year, Chevrolet replaced the G-series Chevrolet Van with the Chevrolet Express (retaining Chevrolet Van for cargo vans). The first all-new design for the General Motors full-size van line since 1971, the model line was offered in passenger-van and cargo-van variants (the latter initially retained the Chevrolet Van name), with GMC replacing the Vandura/Rally with the Savana. Alongside the first substantial redesign of the model line in 25 years, GM predicted substantial growth in the full-size segment through the end of the 1990s.

In a major functional change, the front axle was moved forward 10 inches, effectively moving the front wheels out of the passenger compartment; along with improving front legroom, the design allowed a reduction in step-in height (improving access). While sharing the same engine sizes as the previous model line, the size of the engine cover was reduced, further increasing front passenger space. On all vehicles below 8,500 lbs GVWR (1500 and 2500 series), the Express was introduced with standard dual airbags; for 1997, dual airbags were standardized for all versions of the model line.

Cargo and base models were equipped with a single sealed beam halogen headlamp on each side. The LS trim changed this to a composite headlamp assembly.

For 1999, a few minor functional changes were made to the model line. In a more noticeable update, Chevrolet retired the Chevrolet Van nameplate entirely, with the cargo van renamed the Express Cargo Van.

=== Facelift (2003–present) ===
For 2003, the Express and Savana underwent a mid-cycle revision. Alongside substantial frame and chassis upgrades, the bodywork forward of the windshield was revised. Distinguished by a higher hood line, the newer front fascia (developed as an improved crumple zone) was brought closer in line with the GMT800 full-size pickup trucks introduced for 1999; the model line also introduced a degree of parts commonality between the two model lines. The dashboard underwent a redesign; along with the addition of dual-stage airbags, the interior added multiplex wiring (adding increased functionality to the interior electrical system).

The Express and Savana offered with 60/40 split panel doors on the passenger-side of the vehicle; in a first (since the Corvair cargo van), an option was added for the driver-side to receive the same split panel doors; this option was limited to the standard-length body (requiring doors on both sides). The option for the driver-side split 60/40 panel doors was available through the 2014 model year.

Since its 2003 model revision, the Express has seen incremental updates to the model line. The light-duty 2500 vans (below 8,500 pounds GVWR) were discontinued for 2006. For 2008, the Express passenger van received side-curtain airbags and standard stability control (introduced for 3500-series vans for 2005); the steering wheel, seats, and gauge cluster were also redesigned. For 2011, the dashboard received upgrades (including Bluetooth compatibility and a USB port). For 2013, higher-trim passenger vans received an optional navigation system, rearview camera, and parking assist system.

For 2015, all radios became digitally tuned and a 120-volt three-prong AC outlet was added to the dash. For 2018, the Express dropped sealed-beam headlights from all models, adopting the four composite headlamps of higher-trim passenger vans. A blind spot monitoring system also became optional. For the 2019 model year, higher-trim passenger vans received lane departure warning systems and collision alert warning features.

An all-wheel drive option was offered for the model years 2003–2014 on 1500 and light-duty 2500 vans (below 8,500 lbs GVWR). AWD vans came exclusively with a 135&quot; wheelbase and GM&#x27;s 5.3L V8.

For 2022, the Express entered its 26th year of production, overtaking the 1971–1996 Chevrolet Van in production longevity. As the music format had been phased out of automobiles (in favor of Bluetooth-based content), the CD player was discontinued as an option.

For 2024, the Express and Savana received updated 8-speed automatic transmissions for both V6 and V8 engines. Later in the model year, infotainment availability was reduced to a single option, an AM/FM/MP3 stereo with auxiliary jack, urethane steering wheel, and two front door speakers. For 2025, an auxiliary 12-volt starter battery was no longer available to order. 

As of current production, the GMT610 platform is anticipated to be produced in its current form through the 2026 model year. Originally intended for replacement by a fully-electric vehicle (using GM Ultium battery technology) derived from the BrightDrop Zevo, plans were later revised in favor of a substantial revision of the existing platform for the 2027 model year (under the model code GMT620); no details of GMT620 were released, though Ultium technology was dropped entirely in favor of retaining a lineup of internal combustion engines. 

In February 2024, GM abandoned its plans to produce an electric full-size van; the status of the GMT620 redesign is also unknown, leaving the model line without a replacement beyond the 2025–2026 model year. 

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana use the GM GMT600 chassis, developed exclusively for full-size vans. Derived loosely from the GMT400 chassis of the fourth-generation C/K trucks, the model line uses a full-length ladder frame with boxed forward frame rails. The GMT600 chassis was offered in two wheelbases: standard-length 135-inch and extended 155-inch (though the latter was only available on the 2500 and 3500 series). A replacement for the 110-inch short-wheelbase van (discontinued after 1992) was not included as part of the GMT600 design, as the short-body van had functionally been superseded by the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari mid-size vans.

For 2003, the GMT600 chassis underwent a substantial revision and was redesignated GMT610. In line with the GMT800 chassis, the GMT610 adopted a three-section fully-boxed frame. With slight modifications, the GMT610 also adopted the front suspension of the GMT800 pickup trucks, with short-long arm front suspension (rear-wheel drive) and torsion-bar front springs (all-wheel drive). In another change, four-wheel disc brakes were introduced, standardizing anti-lock brakes (ABS). In a first for the full-size van segment, the GMT610 platform was also offered with full-time all-wheel drive as an option.

==== Powertrain details ====
The Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana were initially available with five engine options. Shared with C/K pickup trucks, a 4.3 L V6 was standard, while 5.0 L, 5.7 L, 6.5 L turbo-diesel, and 7.4 L V8s were options. All gasoline engines adopted the &quot;Vortec&quot; port-fuel injection upgrades for 1996, increasing power and torque outputs; the 6.5 L turbo-diesel was offered in a GM full-size van for the first time. All engines were paired with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission, carried over from the previous van; the 1500 and light-duty 2500 series (below 8,500 pounds GVWR) used a 4L60E transmission while the heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 series (above 8,500 pounds GVWR) used a heavier-duty 4L80E unit.

For 2001, the Vortec 7400 was replaced by the longer-stroke Vortec 8100 (at 496 cubic inches, this is the largest-displacement engine ever factory-marketed by Chevrolet); the engine was offered for the Express through 2002.

For 2003, the engine lineup underwent a series of revisions. The 4.3 L V6 was retained but was only available on the 1500 and light-duty 2500 series. The &quot;Generation III&quot; small-block V8 engines (based on the LS-series engines) were introduced, with the Express and Savana receiving the 5.3 L V8 (on light-duty vans) and the 4.8 L and 6.0 L V8s (on heavy-duty vans).

For 2006, the Express and Savana were once again offered with a diesel engine option, adopting a detuned version of the 6.6 L Duramax V8 (LGH) from the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick. For 2007, the 5.3 L V8 was available with flex-fuel (E85) capability; this was made standard in 2008.

For 2010, 2500- and 3500-series vans used the six-speed 6L90 transmission, and the 4.8 L and 6.0 L V8s gained flex-fuel (E85 capability).

Coinciding with the discontinuation of the 1500 series, the Vortec 4300 V6 (the final engine derived from the original Chevrolet small-block V8) was discontinued in 2014.

After 2016, the 6.6 L Duramax diesel V8 was discontinued; a 2.8 L inline-4 Duramax (the first four-cylinder in a full-size Chevrolet van since 1964) replaced it as the diesel engine offering. For 2018, an &quot;EcoTec3&quot; 4.3 L V6 was introduced as the base gasoline engine; the same year, CNG/LPG capability was added as an option to the 6.0 L V8.

For 2021, the 6.0 L V8 was replaced by an all-new 6.6 L V8 (L8T) first introduced in the 2020 Silverado HD.

The 1500 and light-duty 2500 series had a 3.42 or 3.73 axle ratio, while the heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 series vans have either a 3.73 axle or 4.10 axle ratio.
=== Body design ===
Far more aerodynamic than its predecessor, the Chevrolet Express derived much of exterior styling from the Chevrolet Astro mid-size van (including its flush-mounted exterior glass), deriving its grille from multiple trims of the Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks. Similar to the APV minivans, the Express adopted high-mounted taillamps next to the rear windows, placed above the rear door hinges. In a design advancement for the market segment, the rear doors are hinged to open nearly 180 degrees, allowing the vehicle to back up to a loading dock.

The cargo van is offered as a two-passenger vehicle (initially with an optional passenger seat delete); the passenger van is offered as a 5-, 8-, 12-, or 15-passenger vehicle (the latter, only with the extended 155-inch wheelbase).

In reverse of its predecessor, 60/40 split side doors were standard, with a sliding door offered as an option (initially at no cost). From 2003 to 2014, side doors were offered on the driver side; only the split-panel doors were offered, and only on standard-wheelbase bodies.

=== Trim ===

For its 1996 launch, Chevrolet used the Chevrolet Express model name for full-size passenger vans, with Chevrolet Van returning for cargo vans (renamed Express Cargo Van for 1999).

The Express passenger van was introduced with two trim lines: an unnamed base trim (geared largely towards fleet sales) replacing the Sportvan and the upgraded LS, replacing the Beauville. For 2001, an upgraded LT trim was introduced, but was dropped for 2003. For 2006, the trim line was revised again to the current nomenclature, with the base trim renamed LS, and LS renamed LT. For 2007, the 2500 and 3500 badges on the front doors were dropped.

In line with the previous Chevrolet Van, the Express uses &quot;G&quot; as its internal model designator (&quot;H&quot; was used for all-wheel drive vans during their production). In line with the fourth-generation C/K pickup trucks, the Express/Savana adopted the 1500/2500/3500 payload series designations. After the 2014 model year, the -ton 1500-series was discontinued (with GM citing it as the lowest-selling version).

== Variants ==
=== GMC Savana (1996–present) ===

Since 1996, GMC has marketed the GMC Savana as its version of the Chevrolet Express. In line with Chevrolet, GMC consolidated the previous GMC Vandura (cargo van) and GMC Rally/Rally STX (passenger van) under a single nameplate, with Savana offered as a passenger van, cargo van, and as a cutaway-chassis vehicle (see below).

With the exception of its grille and GMC divisional badging, the GMC Savana is essentially identical to the Chevrolet Express. Using the same LS and LT trims as Chevrolet, the Savana is the only current GMC model line not offered with the Denali or AT4 trim.

Sharing the same model development as its Chevrolet counterpart, the Savana has undergone only minor detail changes since 2003. As of current production, the Express outsells the Savana approximately three-to-one.

=== GMT560 (2003–2009) ===

For 2003, General Motors introduced the GMT560 medium-duty truck architecture for Chevrolet, GMC, and Isuzu. The vertically oriented cab from the full-size van line replaced the pickup-truck cab previously used. Alongside a two-door configuration, GMT560 vehicles offered a four-door crew cab configuration.

Produced as a Class 5–7 truck, the GMT560 vehicles (the Chevrolet Kodiak, GMC TopKick, and Isuzu H-Series) were offered in 4×2, 4×4, and 6×4 drive for multiple applications.

After 2009, General Motors ended medium-duty truck production, leading to the discontinuation of the GMT560 chassis.

=== Cutaway chassis (1997–present) ===
For 1997, GM introduced a cutaway-chassis version of the 3500-series Express/Savana. Replacing the previous G30/G3500 (the larger &quot;HD&quot; variant was not replaced), the cutaway-chassis Express/Savana is an incomplete vehicle (a chassis produced with no bodywork aft of the front seats) intended for additional fabrication by a second-party manufacturer. Intended for a wide variety of potential applications, cutaway chassis are best known as the basis of ambulances, buses (shuttle buses and school buses), and recreational vehicles (RVs); they also are fitted with delivery truck bodies or utility bodies (increasing their storage space over a standard cargo van).

Offered with either Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana branding on both the GMT600 and GMT610 platforms, the cutaway chassis is offered on the 3500 series in both dual-rear-wheel and single-rear-wheel configurations (the latter, trading increased maneuverability for lower GVWR). For 2009, GM introduced a 4500-series Express/Savana developed specifically for cutaway applications, raising its GVWR to 14,200 pounds and effectively filling the void left by the G3500HD&#x27;s 1997 discontinuation.

Since 2017, GM has outsourced production of certain GMT610 cutaway-chassis vehicles, contracting production to Navistar International.

=== VTRUX Van ===
VIA Motors previously converted Chevrolet Express vans into electric vehicles since 2014. This was the first Chevrolet-derived van to be built with an electric powertrain ever since the 1980s with the Griffon van which was a heavily modified version of the British Bedford CF Electric.

== Other uses of nameplate ==
Chevrolet used the Express nameplate for the first time on an unrelated 1987 concept car designed for future limited-access highways. The vehicle was turbine-powered with drive-by-wire controls. A similar name was used on the Chevrolet City Express, a rebadged Nissan NV200.

<doc id="947430" wikidata="Q814002" url="?curid=947430" title="Beechcraft Baron">
<text>The Beechcraft Baron is a light twin-engined piston aircraft designed and produced by Beechcraft. The aircraft was introduced in 1961. A low-wing monoplane developed from the Travel Air, it remains in production.

==Design and development==
The direct predecessor of the Baron was the Beechcraft 95 Travel Air, which incorporated the fuselage of the Bonanza and the tail control surfaces of the T-34 Mentor military trainer. To create the new airplane, the Travel Air&#x27;s tail was replaced with that of the Beechcraft Debonair, the engine nacelles were streamlined, six-cylinder engines were added, and the aircraft&#x27;s name was changed. In 1960, the Piper Aztec was introduced, using two 250 hp Lycoming O-540 engines; Cessna too had improved its 310 with two Continental IO-470 D, producing 260 hp. Meanwhile, Beechcraft&#x27;s Bonanza had been improved with a Continental IO-470-N. But the answer to competition was to make a true twin-engined variant of the Bonanza. The first model, the 55, was powered by two six-cylinder IO-470-L engines producing 260 hp at 2,625rpm each; it was introduced in 1961. The first Baron included the fully-swept vertical stabilizer of the Debonair while still retaining the four to four+five place seating of the Travel Air.

==Variants==
Barons come in three basic types: the Baron 55 (short body), Baron 56 (short body) and Baron 58 (long body), with several sub-variants each.

===Baron 55===


The early Baron 55, A55 and B55 were fitted with Continental IO-470 engines and had gross weights of 4880 to 5100 lb (2,200 to 2,300 kg). These had a typical cruise speed of 190 knots (350 km/h) at 7000 ft (2100 m), and came with 116 or 136 US gallon (440 or 515 L) fuel tanks. Although its performance was eclipsed by the later variants, the B55 continued to be offered as the basic economy model until the end of the Baron 55 model run, and it would ultimately capture about half of total 55-series sales.

The C55, D55 and E55 models used Continental IO-520 engines, increasing cruise speed to . Gross weight increased to and the forward fuselage was lengthened by to increase baggage space in the nose. 136, 142, or 166 US gallon (515 or 628 L) fuel tanks were offered.

The Baron 55 was sold with four seats in two rows as standard equipment; a third-row fifth seat was optional initially, and a sixth seat became optional on the A55. However, the lack of a rear passenger door or a second-row pass-through hampers access to the third-row seats, and adults often find the rear fuselage taper confining. Additionally, the aircraft tend to exceed the aft center of gravity (CG) limit with all six seats occupied and no baggage in the nose compartment to act as counterbalance. Owners often remove the third-row seats and use the rear fuselage as additional baggage space.

Model 55 Barons were produced from 1961 to 1983, with 3,651 manufactured. All use the ICAO aircraft type designator &quot;BE55&quot;.

Priced at $83,950 in 1970, $219,500 in 1982. 434 aircraft built.

===Baron 56TC===

In 1967, Beechcraft had begun development of a faster, pressurized twin, the Model 60 Duke; the Duke was to go head-to-head with Cessna&#x27;s 320 Skyknight. The Duke was to use two turbocharged 380-hp Lycoming TIO-541-E1A4 engines, therefore, Beech wanted experience working with, and flying the new engine. The engine was fitted to a modified Baron C55, becoming the 56TC (that prototype, &quot;TG-1&quot;, was later retired after certification). The results of the 56TC were as planned, it proved a good testbed and experience building model for the Duke&#x27;s development. However, it was a noticeably loud airplane, especially so for a Beechcraft. Along with its increased noise, the 56TC had an increase in structural strength and thus empty weight to compensate for the higher power. When introduced in 1967, it was the fastest Beech aircraft, rivaling even the early King Airs sold at the time. 94 Baron 56TC aircraft were built between 1967 and 1971 and all use the ICAO type designator &quot;BE56&quot;.

;56TC: First flown on 25 May 1966. Introduced in 1967, built until the 1969 model year. Four to six seats. Power came from two 380-hp (283-kW) Lycoming TIO-540-E1B4 turbocharged piston engines. Priced at $89,950 in 1967. 82 aircraft sold. Prototype &quot;TG-1&quot; retained by the factory.

;A56TC: Introduced 1970, built until 1971. Only model change throughout the 56 production. Featured new exterior paint scheme and interior design, new instrument panel, smooth rotating beacon and navigation lights, nose wheel light. Priced at $101,750 in 1970. 11 sold.

===Baron 58===

Introduced for the model year 1969, the larger, more powerful Baron 58 was developed from the Baron 55, with an increased gross weight of 5,400 lbs. Depending on the variant, the Baron 58 is fitted with either Continental IO-520 or IO-550 300-hp engine. The Baron 58 can cruise at 200 knots (370 km/h) at 7000 ft (2100 m). The most significant change was a fuselage stretch of and the introduction of double rear fuselage doors and reversible club seats in the center row, eliminating the need for passengers to climb over the center seats or through the rear baggage door to access the rear seats. The entire fuselage was repositioned forward on the wing to address the aft CG issue that plagued the short-body models. The longer 58 fuselage has four side windows while the 55 and 56 fuselages have three. The larger fuselage and improved rear-cabin access have made the 58 far more popular with commercial air charter and cargo operators than the smaller 55 and 56.

ICAO type designator of all versions is &quot;BE58&quot;.

In 1976, the turbocharged Baron 58TC and pressurized Baron 58P were introduced. These variants were powered by turbocharged Continental TIO-520s of 310–325 hp (230–240 kW), had an increased 6100–6200 lb (about 2800 kg) gross weight, and were certified under FAR23 with a new type certificate. The Baron 58P/58TC models were capable of cruising at 200 knots (370 km/h) at 8000 ft (2400 m) and 220 knots (410 km/h) at 20000 ft (6100 m), and were typically equipped with 190 US gallon (719 L) fuel tanks.

In 1984, the instrument panel was redesigned to eliminate the large central control column and engine controls mounted high on the instrument panel to clear it. In pre-1984 aircraft with the optional dual control yokes, the arm to the right-hand yoke partially blocks the radios and some cockpit switchgear. The redesign provides a more industry-standard control arrangement and increases instrument panel space, but the aircraft lost the option of having a single yoke, which enhanced comfort for a passenger or relief pilot in the right-hand seat.

Although the turbocharged 58TC/58P variants were discontinued in 1984 and 1985, respectively, the normally aspirated Baron 58 was still in production as of 2021. The current production version is the G58, featuring a glass cockpit, improved passenger cabin and changes to selected airframe details.

;58 Baron: Original variant, first flown on 23 June 1969, introduced in 1969 and run through 2004 (production continued as G58). Four to six seats. Powered by two 285-hp Continental IO-520-C or Continental IO-550-C piston engines. 2,124 aircraft built.
;58P Baron: Introduced 1976, run through 1985. Pressurized cabin, powered by two Continental TSIO-520-L turbocharged piston engines. Priced at $200,750 in 1976. 495 produced.
;58TC Baron: Introduced in 1976, run through 1984. Turbocharged engines, powered by 310 hp Continental TSIO-520-L engines. First flew October 31, 1975. Priced at $170,750 in 1976. 151 aircraft sold.
;G58 Baron: Introduced in 2005, currently in production. Version of 58 Baron with Garmin G1000 glass cockpit avionics.
;G58 Baron ISR: Introduced in 2013, Beechcraft developed a low cost ISTAR aircraft for Fuerzas Unidas de Rapida Acción (FURA), an agency within the Puerto Rico Police Department. In 2014, the aircraft was upgraded with a FLIR 230-HD electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera system, operator&#x27;s console that housed the mapping/mission management computer, a recorder, a multi-band communications radio system and data link for special mission operators.

===T-42A Cochise (95-B55B)===
The T-42A Cochise is a military version of the Baron 95-B55 for use by the United States Army as an instrument training aircraft. 65 aircraft were purchased for the Army Aviation School in 1965–1966; a further five were bought commercial off-the-shelf by the U.S. in 1971 from civil B55 production, assigned U.S. military serial numbers, and sold to the Turkish Army. 

Three Army T-42s were transferred to the United States Navy. By 1993, the Army&#x27;s remaining T-42 aircraft had been transferred to the Army Reserve and the National Guard and were no longer in standard use. With the exception of three aircraft destroyed in accidents, three donated to technical schools for instructional use, and one at the United States Army Aviation Museum, all U.S. military T-42s were eventually transferred to civil owners as military surplus. In March 2023, the Army Aviation Museum T-42A, serial number &quot;65-12697&quot;, was in storage and not on public display.

===SFERMA SF-60A Marquis===

A twin Astazou X turboprop modification of the Baron first flown in 1961 developed from SFERMA&#x27;s 1960 Astazou IIA turboprop conversion of a Model 95 Travel Air (SFERMA PD-146 Marquis). At least ten converted to follow on from eight converted Travel Airs.

==Accidents and incidents==
The Beechcraft Baron has been involved in the following notable accidents and incidents.
*On 9 March 1967, a Baron B55, aircraft registration number &quot;N6127V&quot;, collided in mid-air near Urbana, Ohio, with TWA Flight 553, a Douglas DC-9-15 on approach to Dayton Municipal Airport. The collision and ensuing crashes destroyed both aircraft, killing all 21 passengers and 4 crew aboard the DC-9 and the pilot of the Baron, who was the sole aircraft occupant. The Baron pilot was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and was not in contact with air traffic control (ATC); the two pilots in the DC-9 were warned by ATC of VFR traffic in the area, but the pilots&#x27; conversation on the cockpit voice recorder never clearly indicated that they saw the Baron. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to the failure of the TWA crew to &quot;see and avoid&quot; the Baron under VFR, but recommended that ATC procedures be improved to ensure separation between fast-moving airliners flying under instrument flight rules and slower-moving VFR flights in terminal areas.
*On 20 July 1973, land artist Robert Smithson, a photographer, and the pilot died in the crash of a Baron E55, &quot;N814T&quot;, while inspecting the site of Smithson&#x27;s earthwork &quot;Amarillo Ramp&quot; on the ranch of Stanley Marsh 3 near Amarillo, Texas. The NTSB attributed the accident to the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain airspeed, with distraction being a contributing factor.
*On 3 August 1976, Jerry Litton, U.S. Representative from Missouri, his wife and two children, and two others died when their Baron 58, registration number &quot;N1553W&quot;, crashed shortly after takeoff from Chillicothe Municipal Airport in Chillicothe, Missouri, on the same day that Litton had won the Democratic Party primary for the 1976 United States Senate election in Missouri. The NTSB attributed the accident to an engine failure caused by breakage of the crankshaft; the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain airspeed and raise the landing gear were contributing factors.
*On 5 January 1977, in the Connellan air disaster, fired Connellan Airways pilot Colin Richard Forman deliberately crashed a stolen Baron 58, registration &quot;VH-ENA&quot;, into the Connellan Airways complex at Alice Springs Airport, killing himself, his former manager and three other Connellan employees, and injuring four others.
*On 23 November 1982, Southern Baptist religious humorist, television personality and author Grady Nutt and two air charter pilots died in the near-vertical crash of a Baron 95-B55, registration number &quot;N18411&quot;, shortly after takeoff from Folsom Field in Cullman, Alabama under nighttime instrument meteorological conditions. The NTSB was unable to conclusively determine the cause of the crash, but bad weather and poor visibility were thought to be contributing factors.
*On 15 June 1987, during the Nicaraguan Civil War, a Contra-operated Baron 56TC (reg. N666PF, msn. TG-60) which had been deregistered from the US two years prior, was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Nicaragua’s Nueva Segovia Department, in Sandinista government territory. The Baron had been modified to carry rockets for use in an air-to-ground light strike role, and was downed after an attack that reportedly included dropping leaflets and, possibly, reconnaissance. The aircraft crashed 6 km. inside Honduras, in an area known as &quot;Cerro El Tigre&quot; and its three occupants, all former elements of the US-backed Somoza dictatorship, were injured and captured after the crash landing and were treated in Honduras. The pilot, Juan Gomez, a former colonel in Somoza&#x27;s National Guard was also reported to be the head of the Contra air force. While a Western journalist reported that the plane was brought down by anti-aircraft artillery, a Russian source credits the Baron’s downing to an &quot;Strela-2&quot; (SA-7) man portable surface-to-air missile fired from Murra by Sandinista army soldier Jose Manuel Rodriguez. The Sandinistas denounced that the Baron took off from the &quot;Aguacate&quot; airbase in Honduras, the main base of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (NDF), a Contra group supported by the CIA. A Contra NDF spokesman in Miami confirmed that the aircraft was operated by them, but claimed that &quot;it was neither armed nor carried ammunition.&quot;
*On 14 February 2000, Champ Car racing team owner and 11-time Indianapolis 500 driver Tony Bettenhausen Jr., his wife and two others were killed when the Baron 58 piloted by Bettenhausen, registration number &quot;N875JC&quot;, crashed in Cynthiana, Kentucky. The aircraft had flown into known icing conditions and was properly equipped and certified to do so, but the NTSB found that Bettenhausen had allowed airspeed to decay below the certified minimum in icing conditions, causing the aircraft to rapidly lose altitude.
*On 20 September 2012, a Baron 95-C55, registration &quot;N265Q&quot;, ditched and sank in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana while en route from Baytown, Texas, to Florida, after a reported instrument panel fire. Owner and pilot Theodore Robert (T.R.) Wright III and copilot Raymond Fosdick were rescued by the United States Coast Guard; the aircraft was not recovered, and the NTSB attributed the crash to a fire of undetermined origin, noting that the wreckage was not examined. The crash garnered substantial publicity when Wright posted a video to social media showing himself and Fosdick in the water awaiting rescue. Suspicion was cast on the crash when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives determined that Fosdick started a 2014 fire at Athens Municipal Airport in Texas, destroying a parked Cessna Citation I owned by a corporation controlled by Wright. Both aircraft had been insured for substantially more than their recent purchase prices, and a federal court deemed the Baron crash and the Athens fire to be part of an insurance fraud scheme organized by Wright. The two men were convicted in 2017 of conspiracy to commit arson and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and were sentenced to federal prison in 2018.
*On 30 March 2013, Eric Hertz, chief executive officer of New Zealand telecommunications company 2degrees, was killed together with his wife when the Baron G58 he was piloting, &quot;N254F&quot;, crashed into the sea off Kawhia Harbour, New Zealand. The Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) concluded that for unknown reasons, the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed decreased to the point that control could not be maintained, causing it to enter a spin from which Hertz did not recover. Based on the left-hand engine control settings and anomalies found in the engine itself, the CAA speculated that Hertz was dealing with an undetermined left engine problem when the autopilot applied full nose-up trim to maintain altitude, causing the airspeed to steadily decay, which Hertz did not notice due to a lack of situational awareness.
*On 26 July 2018, Luis Gneiting, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock of Paraguay, the vice minister and the two pilots were killed when their Baron crashed shortly after takeoff from Juan de Ayolas Airport.
*On 24 January 2021, a Baron 95-B55, registration &quot;PT-LYG&quot;, belonging to the Palmas Futebol e Regatas, a Brazilian association football team, crashed on takeoff from Associação Tocantinense de Aviação Aerodrome, a private airfield near Porto Nacional, Tocantins, Brazil. The crash killed all six people on board: four members of the football team, the team&#x27;s owner, and the pilot. The Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center attributed the crash to improper loading; contributing factors were inadequate flight planning and poor judgment by the pilot, particularly his failure to perform a rejected takeoff when the aircraft would not climb.

<text>Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geißler (26 May 1814 in Igelshieb – 24 January 1879) was a skilled glassblower and physicist, famous for his invention of the hand pumped Geissler mercury vacuum pump in the mid-1850&#x27;s and in 1857, the Geissler tube, made of glass and used as a low pressure gas-discharge tube; these two inventions were critical technologies leading to the discovery of the electron.

Geissler descended from a long line of craftsmen in the Thüringer Wald and in Bohemia. He found work in different German universities, eventually including the University of Bonn. There he was asked by physicist Julius Plücker to design an apparatus for evacuating a glass tube. Plücker owed his forthcoming success in the electric discharge experiments in large measure to his instrument maker, the skilled glassblower and mechanic Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler. He learned the art of glassblowing in the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen... He finally settled down as an instrument-maker in a workshop of his own at the University of Bonn in 1852.

The Geissler tube was used for entertainment throughout the 1800s and evolved around 1910 into commercial neon lighting. Advances in Plucker and Geissler&#x27;s discharge tube technology developed into the Crookes tube, with which the electron was discovered in 1897, and in 1906 into the amplifying vacuum tube, the basis of electronics and long-distance communication technologies like radio and television.

Geissler was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1868.

<text>Ringsend () is a southside inner suburb of Dublin, Ireland. It is located on the south bank of the River Liffey and east of the River Dodder, about two kilometres east of the city centre. It is the southern terminus of the East Link Toll Bridge. Areas included in Ringsend are the south side of the Dublin Docklands, and at the west end is the area of South Lotts and part of the Grand Canal Dock area. Neighbouring areas include Irishtown, Sandymount and the Beggars Bush part of Ballsbridge to the south, and the city centre to the west. A key feature of the area is the chimneys of Poolbeg power station.

Formerly the point where ships arriving from across the Irish Sea would dock, Ringsend went into decline in the 19th and 20th centuries, when the shipping moved to other locations, although there is still some container shipping.

==Name==
Ringsend was originally a long narrow peninsula separated from the rest of Dublin by the then much broader estuary of the River Dodder. On early maps, its name is given as &#x27;Rin-Aun&#x27; meaning the point of the tide. Subsequently it was called &quot;Ring&#x27;s Ende&quot; and the nearest settlements to it are given the names Merryon (Merrion) and Donny Brook. In addition to it being a centre for transportation from England, Wales and elsewhere, it was well known from early times for having a saltworks there.

Ringsend has long been known colloquially as &quot;Raytown&quot;, reflecting its history as a fishing village and popularity of the stingray fish, which is sold in local takeaways as battered ray.

==History==
Ringsend was originally part of the parish of St Mary&#x27;s, Donnybrook.

At about the same time as the River Dodder was diverted at what is now the junction of Newbridge Avenue and Lansdowne Bridge, Sandymount (formerly known as The Brickfields) came into being. The English having moved the Irish outside the city walls started referring to the area towards the Ringsend peninsula as an &quot;Irishtown.&quot; Reclamation of Dodder estuary and Liffey areas, including the building of York and Pidgeon House Roads and the Great South Wall (South Bull Wall), and development in the 16th and 17th centuries, out to the Poolbeg Lighthouse, led to an expansion of the area.

Ringsend has traditionally been identified as a place of shipbuilders and boat builders in the 19th century who owned yards with slipways leading into the Dodder. Among the shipyards was Greg Foley&#x27;s which was located next door to Ringsend Catholic Church.

===Oliver Cromwell arrives in Ringsend===
Oliver Cromwell arrived in Ringsend on August 15, 1649, with 4,000 horses and 8,000 foot-soldiers, and was received with acclamation by the people of Dublin.

Areas of deep water off Ringsend Point were used as staging places where goods were trans-shipped for transport by light boat from here to the city. In 1640 the first Ringsend Bridge over the Dodder was built so that Ringsend and Dublin were linked by road and goods could be transported by packhorse to the city.

It was once within the administration of Pembroke Urban District Council.

===Ringsend during the Easter Rising===

Boland&#x27;s Mill, a once active flour mill which employed many local residents until its closure in 2001, is located in the Grand Canal Dock area; it was a location of considerable action during the Easter Rising. Local man Patrick Whelan (1893–1916) was killed in action on the third floor of Boland&#x27;s Mill on 26 April 1916, during the Battle of Mount Street. Whelan House, next door to St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Ringsend, is named in Whelan&#x27;s honour. It has been recorded that the most notable figure involved in the 1916 Easter Rising at Boland&#x27;s Mill bakery in Ringsend was Éamon de Valera who commanded a section of the 3rd Battalion volunteers.

===Recent times===
Recent years have seen significant growth in the area, particularly with the Grand Canal Dock Project. A number of high-tech multinationals including Google established major offices in the area adding to the rejuvenation.

In the late 1980s, the Windmill Lane Studios moved to Ringsend and became Ringsend Road Studios, where many prominent musicians, among them U2 and The Chieftains, have recorded. U2 also rehearses and records at The Factory, nearby in Barrow Street.

Thorncastle Street and adjacent Bridge Street were used in the 1999 film &quot;Agnes Browne&quot; as the location for the market stall and church scenes beside the flat blocks. Ringsend has also been a location for a number of other notable films including &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (Rita&#x27;s home was in Ringsend) and &quot;The General&quot;.

==The Great South Wall and Poolbeg Peninsula==

Ringsend and the southern part of Dublin Port are also home to the Great South Wall, connecting the Poolbeg Lighthouse to the mainland. The lighthouse lies at the extreme east end of the wall and was constructed in 1767. The stone wall that now stands was constructed over a period of many years and was completed in 1795. The wall and lighthouse are popular walk destinations. The area around Poolbeg also contains Dublin&#x27;s main power station, with its two huge chimneys for steam – Dublin&#x27;s tallest structures, the former Pigeon House Fort and a range of industrial buildings.


South of the Poolbeg peninsula and the Great South Wall lies the sandy area known as the South Bull.


===The chimneys===
At 207.8 metres and 207.48 metres, the Poolbeg Generating Station chimneys in Ringsend are the tallest structures in Dublin. The Poolbeg chimneys have been defunct since 2010 and were due to be dismantled, however by popular local demand the ESB decided to keep them standing.

==Amenities==

Ringsend has a range of shops, pubs, flats and businesses. It also has a branch of the city&#x27;s public library system, a Dublin City Council recycling depot and Ringsend Park, a 10.58-hectare grassy area which contains a renovated stadium, formerly &quot;Ringsend Stadium&quot;, now &quot;Irishtown Stadium&quot; in honour of the neighbouring area of Irishtown.

Ringsend College is a local Education and Training Board college. Formerly known as Ringsend Technical Institute.

Ringsend was home to one of Ireland&#x27;s first Scout Groups, founded around 1908 and Ireland&#x27;s first Sea Scout Group, founded in 1912. The group is called the 1st Port of Dublin (Ringsend) and meets at Focsle, its facility on Pigeon House Road, with the founder of world Scouting Baden Powell visiting Ringsend in 1915 and 1928.

==Religion==
Ringsend is served by St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, on Thorncastle Street, building began in 1858 and it was opened in 1859 by Archbishop Cullen, the parish was constituted in 1905 from Sandymount. St. Mathews Church of Ireland church in Irishtown (originally built between 1704 and 1706), which is in union with Donnybrook parish and serves the Ringsend area.

There was a Methodist Chapel in Ringsend first built in 1840, a replacement chapel was built in 1904. The congregation declined and it closed in 1961. The building was demolished and redeveloped. The World War One memorial was moved to the united Methodist and presbyterian, Christ Church in Sandymount.

==Politics==
Ringsend is part of the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Bay South, and the Dublin City Council electoral area of South-East Inner City.

==Sport==
The first major sports club was the Gaelic Football team Isles of the Sea. They won the All-Ireland Club competition on three successive occasions and got to keep the original trophy. After a dispute with the GAA members of the Isles of the Sea club went on to found Shamrock Rovers F.C. Shelbourne F.C. was also founded in the area. Bath Markievicz Celtic is a schoolboy club whose home pitch is in Ringsend Park. Cambridge Boys FC is a schoolboy club named after Cambridge Avenue and whose home pitch is in Ringsend Park.

The club&#x27;s home pitch is at Irishtown Stadium. There is also a tradition of rowing with two clubs, St. Patrick&#x27;s and Stella Maris. The Ringsend Regatta takes place twice annually, one for each club. More recently, the Poolbeg Yacht, Boat Club, &amp; Marina has established a centre for water-based sporting activities and hosts an eighteen-race sailing series from the marina to the Dublin Bay area during the summer months each year.

The ESB Swimming Club was established in Ringsend in 1949 as a recreational club for the employees of ESB Networks and still has strong links with ESB Group. The club is now affiliated with the Swim Ireland governing body and has trained many international swimmers, including Olympic athlete Aisling Cooney. ESB Swimming Club is currently based in the SPORTSCO Complex in Dublin 4, having use of their 6-lane 25m pool.

<text>Under Armour, Inc. is an American sportswear company that manufactures footwear and apparel headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

==History==
===20th century===

Under Armour was founded on September 25, 1996, by Kevin Plank, a then-24 year old former special teams captain of the University of Maryland football team. Plank initially began the business from his grandmother&#x27;s basement in Washington, D.C. He spent his time traveling along the East Coast with nothing but apparel in the trunk of his car. His first team sale came at the end of 1996 with a $17,000 sale. From his grandmother&#x27;s Washington, D.C.-area rowhouse, Plank moved to Baltimore.

As a fullback at the University of Maryland, Plank got tired of having to change out of the sweat-soaked T-shirts worn under his jersey; however, he noticed that his compression shorts worn during practice stayed dry. This inspired him to make a T-shirt using moisture-wicking synthetic fabric. 

After graduating from the University of Maryland, Plank developed his first prototype of the shirt, which he gave to his Maryland teammates and friends who had gone on to play in the National Football League, and soon improved the design, creating a new T-shirt built from microfibers that wicked moisture away. Major competing brands including Nike, Adidas and Reebok would soon follow with their own moisture-wicking apparel. Plank opted to use the British spelling &quot;armour&quot; in the company name because the toll-free vanity number was still available for that version.

People began to take notice of the brand when a front-page photo of &quot;USA Today&quot; featured Oakland Raiders quarterback Jeff George wearing an Under Armour mock turtleneck. Under Armour&#x27;s first major sale came when an equipment manager from Georgia Tech requested 10 shirts from Plank. Contracts with NC State, Arizona State, and other Division I football teams followed. That year, Under Armour launched several new apparel lines including ColdGear, TurfGear, AllseasonGear, and StreetGear. By the end of 1996, Under Armour had sold 500 Under Armour HeatGear shirts, generating $17,000 for the company. In 1997, Plank had $100,000 in orders to fill and found a factory in Ohio to make the shirts.

In 1999, Under Armour received its first big break when Warner Brothers used Under Armour in two of its feature films, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Replacements.&quot; Leveraging the release of &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, Plank purchased an ad in &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, which generated close to $750,000 in sales.

===21st century===

In 2000, Under Armour became the outfitter of the new XFL football league. In 2003, private equity firm Rosewood Capital invested $12 million into the company. The same year, the company launched its first television commercial, which centered on their motto, &quot;Protect this house.&quot; The company had its IPO on the NASDAQ in November 2005, raising $153m of capital. In late 2007, Under Armour opened its first full-line full-price retail location at the Westfield Annapolis mall in Annapolis, Maryland. It has since opened several specialty stores and factory outlet locations in Canada, China, and 39 states including the opening of its first Brand House in Baltimore in 2013 and second Brand House in Tysons, Virginia.

In 2009, the company formed an alliance with Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s Ripken Baseball, including providing uniforms for the minor league Aberdeen IronBirds and youth teams participating in the Cal Ripken World Series.

The company is reported to be the major commercial sponsor for the reality TV show &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; and has garnered attention for taking a stand supporting show &quot;patriarch&quot; Phil Robertson.

Under Armour provided the suits worn by speedskaters in the 2014 Winter Olympics. The US speedskaters were losing while wearing the new Mach 39 speedsuits, but when they reverted to the previous model suits, the skaters continued to lose. Although there did not appear to be a design flaw in the suit that caused the poor results, the news of the suits caused Under Armour stock to drop 2.38%.

The company bid hard over Nike to sign Kevin Durant to an endorsement deal. Offering a reported over 10 years. Nike ultimately re-signed Durant after agreeing to structure a contract, offering .

On January 21, 2014, it was announced that the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour had come to terms with providing uniforms and athletic equipment for the university. This 10-year deal was the largest of its kind in the history of college athletics and became effective July 1, 2014. As of 2014, Under Armour had an operating profit of more than 30%, accelerating from its 2013 pace. The company&#x27;s share price soared 62.5% that year.

After its November 2013 acquisition of digital app maker MapMyFitness for , in February 2015 Under Armour announced it had purchased the calorie and nutrition counting app maker MyFitnessPal for $475m, as well as the fitness app maker Endomondo for .

On January 6, 2016, Under Armour announced a strategic partnership with IBM to use IBM Watson&#x27;s cognitive computing technology to provide meaningful data from its IOT kit and UA Record app.

In July 2016, Under Armour leased the space formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz on New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue. FAO Schwarz had been paying $20 million in rent. The store&#x27;s opening, originally planned for 2019, was pushed back to 2021. Under Armour then announced in March 2021 that it was planning on subleasing approximately half of the overall space.
On December 5, 2016, Under Armour reached a 10-year agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB) to become its official on-field uniform provider beginning in 2020. Under Armour will replace Majestic, who has been MLB&#x27;s uniform provider since 2004. However, in May 2018, it was reported that Under Armour would be backing out of the deal with MLB, in order to save the company around $50 million. Nike would instead become the on-field uniform supplier of the league. MLB&#x27;s deal with Nike became official on January 25, 2019.

In October 2019, Kevin Plank announced he would be stepping down by 2020, and COO Patrik Frisk would succeed him as CEO in January 2020. In July 2020, the company received Wells Notices from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Plank the Under Armour&#x27;s CEO, David Bergman. The notices are the result of its accounting revelations for the years 2015 and 2016 and &quot;pull forward&quot; sales for the same period. The same month, the company reported revenue decline of 41% for the Q2 of 2020 or $707.6 million. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Under Armour had to close its physical stores earlier that same year. Despite the revenue decline, it still fared better than the analytic predictions, which had previously estimated profits of $541 million in sales for Q2.

Effective September 11, 2023, Under Armour appointment of John Varvatos to the position of chief design officer. 

Effective April 1, 2024 Kevin Plank returns to company as CEO. He will replace Stephanie Linnartz who served in this position a little more than a year. 

==Finances==
Under Armour&#x27;s global headquarters are located in Baltimore, Maryland, with additional offices located in Amsterdam (European headquarters), Austin, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Houston, Jakarta, London, Mexico City, Munich, New York City, Panama City (international headquarters), Paris, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Francisco, São Paulo, Santiago, Seoul, Shanghai (Greater Chinese headquarters), and Toronto.

For the fiscal year 2018, Under Armour reported losses of US$46 million, with annual revenue of US$4.977 billion, an increase of 9.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. Under Armour&#x27;s market capitalization was valued at over US$10.7 billion in November 2018.
=== Sales ===
In 2014, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 74.3%, 14% and 9.9% of net revenues, respectively. Revenue has grown steadily by 30% from 2010 to 2014. As of January 28, 2016, the fourth quarter net revenues for 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 Billion while the full year net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 Billion. Based on these numbers, Under Armour has updated its 2016 net revenues outlook to approximately $4.95 Billion (+25%).

==Products==

Products manufactured by Under Armour include athletic shoes, t-shirts, jackets, hoodies, pants, leggings, shorts, athletic bras, athletic bags, face masks and accessories such as bags, gloves, caps and protective gear. Under Armour also produces American football, basketball and soccer uniforms, among other sports.

The expansion of Under Armour&#x27;s product lines, such as TurfGear, AllseasonGear, and StreetGear put Under Armour at the forefront of the emerging performance apparel industry. In 2003, Under Armour launched their Women&#x27;s Performance Gear product line.
Under Armour announced an addition to their ColdGear product line, called Infrared, that was released in 2013. This line claims to dissipate and re-circulate heat around the wearer&#x27;s body using ceramic powder. This was purportedly designed so that the wearer&#x27;s heat signature will not be picked up. Under Armour also had released a product with scent control technology in 2012 titled, &quot;Under Armour Scent Control&quot;. This line claims to be designed so that the wearer&#x27;s scent cannot be detected.

Under Armour developed a new type of shirt called &quot;Coldblack&quot;, which is designed to reflect heat and keep athletes cool in the sun. Under Armour has come out with new styles for football uniforms. In October 2012, Under Armour created &quot;The Wounded Warrior&quot; project for football uniforms. The University of Hawaii and Boston College wore the star-studded cleats and the American striped jerseys. They were revealed when Boston College played Maryland on October 27, 2012, also when Hawaii played UNLV on November 24, 2012.

The company produces the Speedform shoe in a Chinese bra factory. It has no insole and little stitching. Shoes are Under Armour&#x27;s fastest growing product line, growing 31% from 2011 to $239 million in sales in 2012.

In 2018, Under Armour launched two new pairs of connected running shoes at CES. Inside each shoe is a Bluetooth module, accelerometer and gyroscope.

In November 2020, Under Armour announced a new brand in partnership with NBA star Stephen Curry called the Curry Brand. The launch follows Under Armour&#x27;s quarterly earnings, resulting in $1.43 billion in revenue, which was flat in comparison to 2019.

===Recalls===
On April 29, 2009, the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) announced a voluntary recall of all Under Armour brand athletic cups. The cups might break when hit, posing a risk of serious injury. They were sold from January 2006 to March 2009. On November 3, 2011, the CPSC announced a voluntary recall of all Under Armour Defender chin straps. The straps pose a laceration hazard when a player contacts the metal snap. They were sold from January 2008 to September 2011.

==Marketing and sponsorships==

Under Armour promotes its products by sponsorship agreements with athletes, celebrities, and sports teams, a field in which it competes with other sports apparel companies. One of its most fiscally beneficial marketing strategies has been its collaboration with actor Dwayne Johnson, who has endorsed the company since January 2016.

Under Armour has a partnership with PGA Tour player Jordan Spieth who they signed an endorsement with in 2013. Spieth has won three majors to date (the 2015 Masters, the 2015 U.S. Open and the 2017 Open Championship) and has launched his own golf shoe, &quot;Spieth One&quot;.

Under Armour has worked with Hollywood to boost its profile. Its product placement dates to the 1999 sports drama &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, and has since included &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2004), &quot;The Blind Side&quot; (2009), &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; (2013), &quot;The Martian&quot; (2015), and television series &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot;. Under Armour worked with costume designer Alexandra Byrne to create base-layer garments for characters in several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Under Armour has a partnership with NBA athlete Stephen Curry, who is considered to be the &quot;face of their footwear line&quot;. Originally signed to Nike, Curry joined with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason. As Curry became a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of his shoes have become a major factor for the Under Armour brand, with stock prices rising and falling based on the success of the Curry shoe line.

On March 3, 2016, the company became the Official Match Ball Partner of the North American Soccer League, starting with their 2016 season. In May, Under Armour and UCLA announced plans for a 15-year, $280 million contract, making this the largest shoe and apparel sponsorship in NCAA history.

On October 10, 2018, Under Armour announced that it has signed Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid to a sneaker endorsement deal.

In December 2024, Under Armour announced their sponsorship of Unrivaled, the women’s 3x3 basketball league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, serving as the league&#x27;s &quot;official uniform partner and performance outfitter&quot; for the inaugural 2025 season.

==Controversies==
===UA Fitness Performance Center and historic mural covering===

In 2015, Under Armour released plans for their new Under Armour Fitness Performance Center powered by FX Studios at the Bank of America Building at 10 Light Street in Baltimore. The Fitness Performance Center is planned to take place in the building&#x27;s lobby, covering historic murals of Baltimore&#x27;s history by art deco artist Hildreth Meiere with artificial turf flooring. This plan has been seen as controversial due to the fact that Kevin Plank, Nate Costa (president of FX Studios) and developer Cary Euwer used state and federal tax credits to restore the historical building, yet the historical murals are being covered up by turf flooring. Many historians and local Baltimoreans have expressed public outcry that the design should be reconsidered and the murals should be saved.

===Trophy hunting video===
In January 2016 Under Armour initiated a marketing campaign featuring women hunters including an American woman named Sarah Bowmar. In August 2016 a video filmed by Bowmar, showing her husband spearing a bear and then rejoicing that he had hit it, went viral. The bear was found dead the next day. Under Armour was heavily criticized worldwide and as result, the company ended its contract with Bowmar a few days after the video became known.

===Trump endorsement and public boycott===
On February 7, 2017, two weeks into the presidency of Donald Trump, CEO Kevin Plank expressed his support for the administration and its friendliness to corporations.

Numerous athletes contracted with Under Armour also spoke out in opposition to Plank&#x27;s statements. Stephen Curry, the most valuable of the company&#x27;s sponsorships, hinted that his loyalty to the company could be jeopardized if its actions do not reflect his values. Dwayne Johnson voiced disapproval with the CEO&#x27;s personal attitudes being reflected onto the company&#x27;s partners and employees.

On February 15, eight days following Plank&#x27;s statements, Plank took out a full-page ad in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; to clarify his position and that of the company. The letter acknowledged that he had used &quot;a choice of words that did not accurately reflect my intent&quot; and described how his company valued diversity, entrepreneurship and job creation. He condemned the administration&#x27;s ban on travel to and from seven primarily Muslim nations, adding &quot;we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community.&quot;

In a statement issued to reporters on June 2, Plank deplored the Trump Administration&#x27;s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement:

We at Under Armour are disappointed by the Administration&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement as climate change continues to threaten our planet, our cities and our economies. Climate change is real and must be taken seriously by our business community, our customers, our neighbors and our elected officials. Sustainability has always been part of our DNA: it&#x27;s integral to how we live and work and is essential to our environment. As a business leader concerned with creating American jobs, I disagree with the decision to exit the Paris accord.

On August 14, 2017, Plank removed himself from Trump&#x27;s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Council, following backlash over Trump&#x27;s response to the events in Charlottesville, Virginia.

===Fireproofing and flammability===
In June 2018 a Facebook post emerged stating that Under Armour clothing was flammable and resulted in severe burn injuries to a child. Though no recall was issued and no evidence suggests the brand&#x27;s items were not in compliance with federal regulations, a 2008 study by the United States Forest Service found that Under Armour&#x27;s material was more likely to result in a burn injury of the wearer than most other undergarment materials.

===Federal probe===
In November 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made public that Under Armour&#x27;s accounting policies had been under scrutiny for more than two years. In July 2020, the company confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had sent Wells Notices relating to Under Armour&#x27;s accounting in 2015 and 2016.

== Community involvement ==
UA Give Back is Under Armour&#x27;s effort to become involved in different facets of the world community. They have different branches in their organization that specialize in each cause that Under Armour supports. They consist of the &quot;UA Power in Pink&quot;, &quot;UA Freedom&quot; and &quot;UA Win Global&quot;.

&quot;UA Power in Pink&quot; is an Under Armour program that promotes women using exercise and fitness to fight breast cancer. &quot;UA Freedom&quot; is an Under Armour program that supports the efforts of the Wounded Warrior Project whose mission is to honor, raise awareness, and aid wounded veterans and military service members. &quot;UA Win Global&quot; is a children&#x27;s athletics program which focuses on &quot;underserved communities&quot; by enhancing play areas, investing in sports programs and providing support for sports coaches.

As of 2012, Under Armour was the sponsor of the Baseball Factory&#x27;s &quot;Premium Video Program&quot;, which holds more than 100 events for youth athletes across the United States annually.

After ads of many brands ran on extremist channels promoting extremist content on YouTube, Under Armour pulled its ad from Alphabet Inc. owned YouTube.

<doc id="947443" wikidata="Q2343923" url="?curid=947443" title="Beechcraft T-34 Mentor">
<text>The Beechcraft T-34 Mentor is an American propeller-driven, single-engined, military trainer aircraft derived from the Beechcraft Model 35 Bonanza. The earlier versions of the T-34, dating from around the late 1940s to the 1950s, were piston-engined. These were eventually succeeded by the upgraded T-34C Turbo-Mentor, powered by a turboprop engine. The T-34 remains in service more than seven decades after it was first designed.

==Design and development==
The T-34 was the brainchild of Walter Beech, who developed it as the Beechcraft Model 45 private venture at a time when there was no defense budget for a new trainer model. Beech hoped to sell it as an economical alternative to the North American T-6/SNJ Texan, then in use by all services of the U.S. military.


Three initial design concepts were developed for the Model 45, including one with the Bonanza&#x27;s signature V-tail, but the final design that emerged in 1948 incorporated conventional tail control surfaces for the benefit of the more conservative military (featuring a relatively large unswept vertical fin that would find its way onto the Travel Air twin-engine civil aircraft almost ten years later). The Bonanza&#x27;s fuselage with four-passenger cabin was replaced with a narrower fuselage incorporating a two-seater tandem cockpit and bubble canopy, which provided greater visibility for the trainee pilot and flight instructor. Structurally, the Model 45 was much stronger than the Bonanza, being designed for +10&quot;g&quot; and −4.5&quot;g&quot;, while the Continental E-185 engine of 185 horsepower (hp) at takeoff (less than a third of the power of the T-6&#x27;s engine) was the same as that fitted to contemporary Bonanzas.

Following the prototype were three Model A45T aircraft, the first two with the same engine as the prototype and the third with a Continental E-225, which would prove to be close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only differential braking for steering control on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable rudder pedals instead of the moveable seats of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.

===Model 73 Jet Mentor===
In 1955 Beechcraft developed a jet-engined derivative, again as a private venture, and again in the hope of winning a contract from the US military. The Model 73 Jet Mentor shared many components with the piston-engined aircraft; major visual differences were the redesigned cockpit which was relocated further forward in the fuselage and the air intakes for the jet engine in the wing roots, supplying air to a single Continental J69 jet engine in the rear fuselage. The first flight of the Model 73, registered N134B, was on 18 December 1955. The Model 73 was evaluated by the USAF, which ordered the Cessna T-37, and the USN, which decided upon the Temco TT Pinto. After initial testing at the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, the Navy tested the feasibility of using the TT Pinto as a jet-powered trainer for primary flight training in 1959, but discontinued use of the aircraft by December 1960 and discarded all examples, returning to the piston-powered T-34B Mentor and North American T-28 Trojan for its primary flight training requirements. The Beechcraft Model 73 was not put into production and the sole prototype is displayed at the Kansas Aviation Museum.

===T-34C Turbo-Mentor===
After a production hiatus of almost 15 years, the T-34C Turbo-Mentor powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-25 turboprop engine was developed in 1973. The original T-34&#x27;s modified Bonanza/Debonair-style wing was replaced with a variant of the larger Beech Baron wing, and the original Bonanza/Debonair-style landing gear was replaced with the landing gear from the even-larger Beech Duke.

Development proceeded at the behest of the USN, which supplied two T-34Bs for conversion. After re-engining with the PT6, the two aircraft were redesignated as YT-34Cs, the first of these flying with turboprop power for the first time on 21 September 1973. Mentor production restarted in 1975 for deliveries of T-34Cs to the USN and of the T-34C-1 armed version for export customers in 1977, this version featuring four underwing hardpoints. The last Turbo-Mentor rolled off the production line in 1990.

Since the late 1970s, T-34Cs have been used by the Naval Air Training Command to train numerous Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and numerous NATO and Allied nations. With over 35 years of service, the T-34C has been completely replaced by the T-6 Texan II.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force and Civil Air Patrol===

The first flight of the Model 45 was on 2 December 1948, by Beechcraft test pilot Vern Carstens. In 1950, the USAF ordered three Model A45T test aircraft, which were given the military designation YT-34. A long competition followed to determine a new trainer, and in 1953 the Air Force put the Model 45 into service as the T-34A Mentor, while the USN followed in May 1955 with the T-34B.

After extensive testing, the USAF ordered the Mentor into production as the T-34A in early 1953. The first production T-34A was delivered to Edwards Air Force Base, California, in October 1953 for evaluation, and deliveries to the Air Training Command (ATC) began in 1954. The T-34A commenced service as USAF&#x27;s initial primary flight trainer at &quot;contract&quot; pilot training air bases across the southern United States, replacing extant North American AT-6 Texan trainers. Following training in the T-34A, USAF pilot trainees would advance to the North American T-28A Trojan for intermediate training.

The T-34A Mentor remained the standard USAF primary trainer until the introduction of the Cessna T-37 Tweet jet trainer in the late 1950s, replacing both the T-34A and T-28A. This also coincided with ATC&#x27;s implementation of the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) syllabus at various air force bases in the United States under ATC claimancy and phaseout and closure of the contract pilot training air bases. As they were replaced by T-37s, many T-34As were turned over to USAF aero clubs at air force bases in the United States and USAF air bases overseas. In all, the USAF acquired 450 T-34As.

As the U.S. Air Force replaced the last of their T-34As at the beginning of the 1960s, their role taken over by the propeller-driven T-41 Mescalero and the T-37 Tweet primary jet trainer in UPT, those T-34As not allocated to USAF aero clubs or marked for foreign military sales or transfers were turned over to the USAF Auxiliary, the Civil Air Patrol, for use as search aircraft. However, the T-34A&#x27;s low wing limited its utility in an aerial search and rescue role, and maintenance issues, particularly expensive wing spar repairs that became apparent in the late 1990s, resulted in the last of the former USAF T-34As being withdrawn from CAP service by 2003.

The U.S. Navy kept the T-34B operational as a Naval Air Training Command initial primary trainer at the former Naval Air Station Saufley Field, Florida until the mid-1970s and as a Navy Recruiting Command aircraft until the early 1990s when the last examples were retired as an economy move. Others continue to remain under U.S. Navy control as part of flying clubs at Naval Air Stations and Marine Corps Air Stations.

Beginning in 1975, the turbine-powered T-34C Turbomentor was introduced as the Navy&#x27;s new primary flight trainer for Student Naval Aviators, and began replacing the North American T-28 Trojan with training air wings at NAS Whiting Field, Florida and NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. In the mid-1980s, it also commenced service as a basic trainer for Student Naval Flight Officers at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

The T-34C is no longer used as a primary training aircraft for U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard Student Naval Aviators and various NATO/Allied/Coalition student pilots training under U.S. Navy auspices. It has been replaced by the T-6 Texan II. Training Squadron TWENTY-EIGHT at NAS Corpus Christi&#x27;s Training Air Wing FOUR recently retired the T-34C as a Naval Primary Training Aircraft according to Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) PAO, joining Training Air Wing SIX at NAS Pensacola, Training Air Wing FIVE at NAS Whiting Field and Training Air Wing FOUR&#x27;s Training Squadron TWENTY-SEVEN at NAS Corpus Christi had already transitioned to the T-6A and T-6B models.

Several other T-34Cs also remain in service with the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland and as aerial spotter aircraft with F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) and Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics Schools at NAS Oceana, Virginia; NAS Lemoore, California; and MCAS Miramar, California; and the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) at NAS Fallon, Nevada.

===U.S. Army===

Some time before 1990, the United States Army received six ex-U.S. Navy T-34C, used as test platforms and chase planes at Edwards Air Force Base, California and Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

===NASA===

NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California has operated two T-34C aircraft. The first aircraft was previously flown at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, where it was used for propulsion experiments involving turboprop engines. In 1996 this aircraft was moved Dryden as a chase aircraft. That aircraft was returned to the U.S. Navy in 2002. The second T-34C was obtained in early 2005 from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at NAS Patuxent River, where it was due to be retired. At Armstrong, the T-34C is primarily used for chasing remotely piloted unmanned air vehicles which fly slower than NASA&#x27;s F/A-18 mission support aircraft can fly. As a NASA mission support chase plane, the back seat would be occupied by a photographer or flight test engineer during research missions. It is also used for required pilot proficiency flying.

=== Non-U.S. military service ===
As of 2007, Mentors were still used by several air forces and navies.

From 1978, the T-34C Turbo-Mentor was the Argentine Naval Aviation basic trainer used by the 1st Naval Aviation Force (Training), alongside 15 T-34C-1 light attack aircraft forming the Fourth Naval Air Attack Squadron. During the 1982 Falklands War, four T-34C-1s were deployed to Port Stanley on 25 April 1982, primarily to be employed in a reconnaissance role. The main encounter with British forces occurred on 1 May 1982 when three Turbo-Mentors attacked a Royal Navy Westland Sea King helicopter in the area of Berkeley Sound but were intercepted by Royal Navy Sea Harriers flown by Lt &#x27;Soapy&#x27; Watson and Lt Cdr &#x27;Sharky&#x27; Ward of 801 Naval Air Squadron flying from HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, with one of the T-34Cs being damaged by cannon fire from Ward&#x27;s aircraft. The four T-34C-1 Turbo-Mentors continued to operate, flying a few reconnaissance missions, but were redeployed to Borbon Station where they were ultimately destroyed by the SAS Raid on Pebble Island on 15 May 1982. Although all four hulks remained on the island for a considerable length of time, eventually, 0729/(1-A)411 was recovered on 10 June 1983 and stored for future display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum.

===Civilian use===
In 2004, due to a series of crashes involving in-flight structural failure during simulated combat flights, the entire US civilian fleet of T-34A/Bs was grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding has since been eased to a slate of restrictions on the permitted flight envelope. Via a series of Airworthiness Directives (ADs) established by or Alternate Methods of Compliance (AMOCs) negotiated with the FAA, including installation of certain, approved structural modifications to the wing spar and other repairs, the T-34A and T-34B fleet in 2011 has been restored to full flight status by FAA at the Mentor&#x27;s originally designed limitations, provided each individual example is compliant with those ADs and AMOCs.

The Mentor is the aircraft used by the Lima Lima Flight Team and Dragon Flight, both civilian demonstration teams. It was also used by aerobatic pilot Julie Clark, who flew her T-34 &quot;Free Spirit&quot; (registration N134JC) at air shows. 

In 2024, Apollo 8 lunar module pilot Bill Anders was killed in a crash near the US-Canada border while flying a T-34.

==Variants==

;YT-34
:Prototype, three built.
;T-34A
:US Air Force trainer. Replaced by the Cessna T-37 around 1960 (450 built).
;T-34B
:US Navy trainer. Used as a trainer until 1976, when VT-1 and VT-5 were decommissioned. It was replaced by the T-34C (423 built by Beechcraft). T-34Bs were flown by pilots assigned to the Navy Recruiting Command until the mid-1990s. 
;YT-34C
:Two T-34Bs were fitted with turboprop engines, and were used as T-34C prototypes.
;T-34C Turbo-Mentor
:Two-seat primary trainer, fitted with a turboprop engine.
;T-34C-1
:Equipped with hardpoints for training or light attack, able to carry of weapons on four underwing pylons. The armament could include flares, incendiary bombs, rocket or gun pods and antitank missiles. Widely exported.
;Turbine-Mentor 34C
:A civil variant introduced -- not, it seems, in search of private buyers, but for governmental sales where a military type was undesireable. Six were sold to the Algerian national pilot training school in 1979.
;Allison Turbine Mentor
:Conversion of surplus T-34 Mentors to be powered by Allison Model 250 turboprop engines.
;Model 73 Jet Mentor:Powered by a Continental J69-T-9 turbojet engine. The sole aircraft first flew on 18 December 1955.

<text>Tea with Mussolini () is a 1999 semi-autobiographical comedy-drama war film directed by Franco Zeffirelli, scripted by John Mortimer, telling the story of a young Italian boy&#x27;s upbringing by a circle of British and American women before and during the Second World War.

At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Maggie Smith). The film also nominated for BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design but lost to &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;.

==Plot==
The film begins in 1935 in Florence, where a group of cultured expatriate English women – the &quot;Scorpioni&quot; – meet for tea every afternoon. Young Luca is the out-of-wedlock son of an Italian businessman who has little interest in his son&#x27;s upbringing; the boy&#x27;s seamstress mother has recently died.

Mary Wallace, the man&#x27;s secretary, steps in to care for Luca, seeking support from her &quot;Scorpioni&quot; friends, including eccentric would-be artist Arabella. They teach Luca about life and the arts. Elsa Morganthal, a rich young American widow who &quot;Scorpioni&quot; matron Lady Hester Random barely tolerates, sets up a financial trust for Luca when she hears his mother has died, as she was fond of her and still owes her money for her dressmaking services.

One day, when the ladies are having afternoon tea, Italian Fascists attack the café, reflecting the increasingly uncertain position of the expatriate community. Lady Hester, widow of Britain&#x27;s former ambassador to Italy, retains an admiring faith in Benito Mussolini. She visits him, receiving his assurances of their safety, and proudly recounts her &quot;tea with Mussolini&quot;.

As the political situation continues to deteriorate, the &quot;Scorpioni&quot; find their status and liberties diminishing. Luca&#x27;s father decides Italy&#x27;s future is with Germany rather than Britain, so sends Luca to an Austrian boarding school.

Five years later, Luca plans to study art in Florence with Elsa&#x27;s trust fund. He finds that most British nationals are fleeing the country, anticipating Mussolini&#x27;s declaration of war on Great Britain, and that Mary has moved in with Lady Hester and the other English hold-outs. Arriving at the house just as they – and Hester&#x27;s grandson Wilfred, disguised as a woman – are being transported to the Tuscan town of San Gimignano, he follows.

As the U.S. is not at war, Elsa and her American compatriot Georgie Rockwell, an openly lesbian archaeologist, remain free. Elsa uses Luca to deliver forged orders and funds to have the ladies moved from their barren quarters to an upper class hotel. Believing that Mussolini helped, Lady Hester is delighted, proudly brandishing the newspaper photo of her tea with &quot;Il Duce&quot;.

As the war progresses, Jewish oppression increases and the Jewish Elsa – protected somewhat by her citizenship and wealth – gets a group of Italian Jews fake passports, enlisting Luca – who is enamored of her – to deliver them. However he becomes jealous when seeing she&#x27;s involved with Italian lawyer Vittorio.

When the U.S. enters the war in 1941, Elsa and Georgie are interned with the British women. Elsa has been tricked by Vittorio, who embezzles her art collection and money, and who plans to deliver her to the German Gestapo in a phony escape to Switzerland. Luca knows but tells no one out of jealous spite. Mary learns of it from Elsa&#x27;s art dealer and scolds him.

Luca&#x27;s attitude changes and he gives his trust fund money to the Italian resistance movement, which Wilfred has joined. Elsa refuses to believe Vittorio&#x27;s betrayal until Lady Hester who had just been scolded by Mary who had finally had enough of Hester&#x27;s praise for Mussolini and also told her what Elsa has done for all of them, so Hester repents and offers gratitude and help. Elsa&#x27;s escape plan is hatched by Mary, Luca and Wilfred. Before leaving, she tells Luca she supported his young mother to go through with her pregnancy, so he could be there for her.

In July 1944, as the British Army advances toward San Gimignano, Arabella defends her frescoes from demolition by German troops, heroically joined in the line of fire by Georgie and the English women, including Lady Hester. They are saved when the Germans retreat, leaving the women and the towers untouched.

The city rejoices as the Scots Guards arrive, with Luca now serving as their Italian interpreter. The major has orders to evacuate the &quot;Scorpioni&quot; but Lady Hester refuses, resolved that they will resume their former lives in Italy. Mary is delighted to see that Luca – now in British uniform – has become the &quot;English gentleman&quot; his father wished him to be.

Closing texts explain the mostly happy fates of the characters, concluding with the remark that Luca has become an artist and helped with the making of the film.

==Production==

Angela Lansbury was offered the role of Mary Wallace, but had to drop out when her husband became ill. Lady Hester Random is based upon a real resident of Florence whom Zeffirelli knew in his childhood. Zeffirelli mentions her and a couple of other ladies of the &quot;Scorpioni&quot; in his autobiography. He said: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember if she was called Hester, but I remember this terrible, fantastic woman. She was the dowager of the community. I remember the many outrageous things she did because she could afford to be arrogant and bossy.&quot;

==Reception==

The film opened tenth at the U.S. box office with $1,633,183 for the weekend, eventually grossing a worldwide total of $45,566,200, considerably more than its budget. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 64% from 39 reviews with the consensus: &quot;&quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; contains few surprises, but this amiably ambling drama is too likeable – and well-cast – to completely resist.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There are some scary, somber moments in this lushest of period pieces, yet Zeffirelli wisely sustains a gallant, predominantly blithe spirit throughout. &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; leaves you feeling that, if in reality not everything that Zeffirelli recalls had quite so much dash, whimsy and gallantry, it&#x27;s the way it should have been.&quot;

<doc id="947460" wikidata="Q2273645" url="?curid=947460" title="Aerojet General X-8">
<text>The Aerojet General X-8 was an unguided, spin-stabilized sounding rocket designed to launch a payload to . The X-8 was a version of the prolific Aerobee rocket family.

Towards the end of World War II, the US Army and the California Institute of Technology&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had developed a meteorological sounding rocket, the WAC Corporal. The U.S. Army had also captured enough parts to assemble perhaps 100 German V-2 guided missiles. The Army determined that its Project Hermes would be extended to assemble and launch a number of the V-2s for military, technological and scientific purposes. Many of the V-2 components were damaged or useless. Thus the initial intent of the Army was to launch only 20 missiles.

The Army was to make space available on the V-2s for upper atmosphere research. Due to the limited number of V-2s, originally planned design of several competing sounding rockets continued. Jet Propulsion Laboratory initially favored its WAC Corporal despite its inadequacy. The competing rockets were the Applied Physics Laboratory&#x27;s Aerobee and the Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s Neptune (Viking). The Army determined that it would refurbish and manufacture components as necessary to launch many more V-2s than originally intended, making most available for science.

The Aerobee was developed in response to the need for a sounding rocket to replace the dwindling numbers of V-2s. Design and initial development of the Aerobee occurred between June 1946 and November 1947.

The first Aerobees, the Navy RTV-N-8a1 and Army Signal Corps XASR-SC-1, used the Aerojet XASR-1 thrust air-pressurized engine. Aerojet&#x27;s XASR-1 was developed from the thrust WAC-1 engine of the WAC Corporal sounding rocket. The USAF RTV-A-1 (X-8), Navy RTV-N-10 and Army XASR-SC-2s used the Aerojet XASR-2 thrust helium pressurized engine. In 1949 the Air Force instigated the development of a more powerful Aerojet engine to replace the 2,600 lb.-thrust XASR-2. This was the thrust helium-pressurized AJ 10-25. The USAF X-8A (RTV-A-1a) and USN RTV-N-10a used the seminal Aerojet AJ-10-25 (Air Force) or AJ-10-24 (Navy).

The Army Air Force&#x27;s Air Research and Development Command, needing its own research programs, initiated Project MX-1011 and ordered 33 AJ-10-25 powered Aerobees as RTV-A-1s. That designation was later changed to X-8. Ultimately the rocket was renamed again as RM-84. The number of X-8s flown came to 60 including 28 X-8s (RTV-A-1), 30 X-8As (RTVM-A-1a), 1 X-8B (RTV-A-1b) with a thrust XASR-2 chemically pressurized engine, and 1 X-8C (RTV-A-1c) with a thrust AJ 10-25s helium pressurized engine with no booster. The three X-8D with thrust AJ 10-25, were never flown. A Navy experimental launch of a stretched Aerobee, the RTV-N-10b resulted in both services requesting improved Aerobees, known generically as Aerobee-Hi.

==Operational history==

At launch, an thrust Aerojet 2.5KS18,000G solid rocket booster fired for 2.5 seconds. After booster jettison, a thrust XASR-2 liquid fuel rocket burned for up to 40 seconds (depending on desired apogee). The X-8 recovery sequence was normally started as the rocket descended through about feet when the fins were blown off to induce a drag producing tumble. At about the nose cone was blown off the rocket and returned to Earth by parachute. The baseline X-8 measured in length and measured across the fins. A X-8A reached a maximum altitude of Another reached a speed of Mach six. The payloads of the X-8s varied, averaging about 150 lbs. There were 30 X-8s, 30 X-8As, 1 X-8B, 2 X8-Cs and 3 X-8Ds delivered to the Air Force.

The first RTV-A-1 (X-8) flight was USAF-1, flown at Holloman Air Force Base (adjacent to the White Sands Proving Ground). USAF-1 was launched by an Air Force crew commanded by Major Phillip Calhoun, the Aerobee Project Officer, on 2 December 1949. USAF-1 reached an altitude of and carried three experiments; a Solar Radiation Soft X-Ray detector for the Air Force Cambridge Research Center, a Pressure-Temperature study for Boston University, and a Color Earth Photography experiment for the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Equipment Laboratory. Rocket performance was good. Telemetry returned some data. The X-Ray detector foils ruptured and returned no data. Parachute failure resulted in the nose cone containing the experiments to be lost. The nose cone was found in July 1950, the film was destroyed.

The next four flights saw the nose cone recovery parachutes fail.

USAF-6, was a more typical X-8 Mission. It carried a payload of Pressure-Temperature detectors for the University of Michigan, an Air Force Cambridge Center multipurpose beacon, 6 channel PPM-AM system, a Ten channel data recorder supplied by Tufts College, and a camera to photograph a Sperry aspect gyro for the University of Michigan. USAF-6 reached an altitude of before a flawless recovery.

From December 1949 until the last X-8A flight on 11/12/1956, the X-8s (RTV-A-1/RTV-A-1a)s flew a great variety of experiments. Typical payloads were solar radiation, temperature, pressure, photography, sky brightness, atmosphere composition, winds, airglow, rocket performance, biological experiments, air density, day airglow, ionosphere, sodium studies, nitric oxide to produce a sporadic E layer, nitric oxide attempt to recombine atomic oxygen, sodium cloud ionization, solar spectrum and atmospheric composition. All but the last X-8 mission were flown from Holloman AFB. The last X-8 was flown for the Signal Corps Electronic Laboratory from Fort Churchill, Canada on 11/12/1956 and studied temperature and winds. After the X-8s Air Force Aerobees were known by their engine model numbers, either AJ-10-27 or AJ-10-34.

<text>The Encyclopédistes () (also known in British English as Encyclopaedists, or in U.S. English as Encyclopedists) were members of the , a French writers&#x27; society, who contributed to the development of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; from June 1751 to December 1765 under the editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and only Diderot from 1765 to 1772.

==History==
The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported the tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment.

More than a hundred encyclopédistes have been identified. They were not a unified group, neither in ideology nor social class. Below some of the contributors are listed in alphabetical order, by the number of articles that they wrote, and by the identifying &quot;signature&quot; by which their contributions were identified in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

Beyond the known collaborators – at least in name – many articles are not signed and certain authors expressed a desire to remain anonymous. Other authors, Allard or Dubuisson for example, remain a mystery to us. Moreover, the sporadic research into the quotations, borrowings, and plagiarisms in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; – the illustrations as well as the text – illuminate a group of &quot;indirect&quot; collaborators.

A machine-generated and incomplete list of authors sorted by number of posts can be found at the project &quot;ARTFL&quot;. There are lists by frequency and by letter.

==Contributors==
===Denis Diderot===
Diderot had just finished the translation of &quot;A Medicinal Dictionary&quot; by Robert James when the publicist André le Breton charged him, on 16 October 1747, to resume the project of translating the English &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; that Jean Paul de Gua de Malves could not successfully complete. Diderot undertook the history of ancient philosophy, wrote the &quot;Prospectus&quot; and the &quot;System of Human Knowledge&quot;, and, with D&#x27;Alembert, revised all the articles.

===Le chevalier de Jaucourt===
Louis de Jaucourt is little known in other respects but was one of the principal authors in the disciplines of economics, literature, medicine, and politics.

===D&#x27;Alembert===
Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert is the author of the &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot; and of several articles. In 1752 d&#x27;Alembert, who was tired of the mocking, cries of indignation, and religious persecution against the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, retired from the encyclopedic undertaking. Subsequently, his contributions were limited to the subject of mathematics, a sensible topic in the eyes of censors.

<doc id="947475" wikidata="Q3740587" url="?curid=947475" title="Fearless Fosdick">
<text>Fearless Fosdick is a long-running parody of Chester Gould&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. It appeared intermittently as a strip-within-a-strip, in Al Capp&#x27;s satirical hillbilly comic strip, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1934–1977).

==Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s &quot;ideel&quot;==
Fearless Fosdick made his debut in an August 1942 &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Sunday sequence, as the unflappable comic book idol of Abner (and of every other &quot;100% red-blooded American boy!&quot;) and an object of undying hero worship. Hayseed Abner mindlessly aped his role model—even going so far as submitting to marriage against his will.

Fearless Fosdick was a parody of all of &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s&quot; memorable qualities. As described in &quot;Dick Tracy and American Culture&quot;, &quot;Fosdick&#x27;s square jaw was even more pronounced than Tracy&#x27;s, violence was used much more gratuitously in &quot;Fosdick&quot; than in &quot;Tracy&quot; (and rarely with any meaning), grotesques were even more outrageous.&quot;

Cartoonist Al Capp (1909–1979) would often use &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; continuity as a narrative framing device, bookending the offbeat &quot;Fosdick&quot; sequences. Abner himself serves as a rustic Greek chorus—to introduce, comment upon and (sometimes) comically sum up the &quot;Fosdick&quot; stories. Typically, an anxious Abner would race frantically to the mailbox or to the train delivering the morning newspapers, to get a glimpse of the latest cliffhanger episode. The next panel would reveal Abner&#x27;s POV of the feature under an iconic logo: &quot;Fearless Fosdick by Lester Gooch.&quot; Subsequent installments would reinforce Abner&#x27;s obsessive immersion in the unfolding &quot;Fosdick&quot; continuity while at the same time recapping the story within a story. While oblivious to the surrounding &quot;real&quot; world (e.g., walking off a cliff or into the path of an oncoming train, or inadvertently ignoring one of Daisy Mae&#x27;s perilous predicaments), Abner would be, as ever, fully engrossed in the &quot;Fosdick&quot; adventure. Eventually, Capp would dispense with Abner&#x27;s introductory panels altogether, and the strip would carry a subheading reminding readers they were now reading &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s &quot;ideel,&quot; Fearless Fosdick.&quot;

Occasionally Fosdick&#x27;s adventures would directly affect what happened to Abner, and the two storylines would artfully converge. The story-within-a-story often ironically paralleled and/or parodied the story itself. Also, by having the comically obtuse Abner &quot;explain&quot; the strip to Daisy Mae, Capp would use &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; to self-reflexively comment upon his &quot;own&quot; strip, his readers, and the nature of comic strips and &quot;fandom&quot; in general, resulting in an absurd but overall structurally complex and layered satire.

&quot;Capp&#x27;s &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; sequences proved over the years to be some of his most popular,&quot; according to M. Thomas Inge. &quot;&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; remains the only comic strip-within-a-comic strip to achieve its own following.&quot;

==Setting and themes==
&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is set in an unnamed, crime-infested American metropolis similar to Chicago. Its urban setting stands in stark contrast with &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;&#x27;s rural Dogpatch. Fosdick lives in squalor at the dilapidated boarding house run by his dour, pitiless landlady, Mrs. Flintnose. He never married his own long-suffering fiancée Prudence &quot;(ugh!)&quot; Pimpleton, but Fosdick was directly responsible for one of the seminal events of the strip—the famous marriage of his biggest fan, Li&#x27;l Abner, to Daisy Mae in 1952.

As the only grownup member of the local &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; kiddie fan club, Abner had unwittingly vowed to do everything Fosdick does, not realizing that Fosdick&#x27;s comic strip marriage was only a dream. (Ironically, Abner had previously told Daisy Mae that cartoonists often employ plot contrivances like dream sequences and impending weddings as sucker bait, to fool their gullible readers!)

In addition to being fearless, Fosdick is &quot;pure, underpaid and purposeful,&quot; according to his creator. &quot;Fearless is without doubt the world&#x27;s most idiotic detective. He shoots people for their own good, is pure beyond imagining, and is fanatically loyal to a police department which exploits, starves and periodically fires him,&quot; Capp told &quot;Pageant&quot; magazine in May 1952. Although Fosdick is the hero of all red-blooded American boys, Daisy Mae detests him with venomous passion. All throughout &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner,&quot; the neglected Daisy Mae finds herself in the ironic position of being jealous of a &quot;&quot;stoopid&quot; comical strip character!&quot; When Capp was asked (in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview conducted by Alvin Toffler in 1965) about the specific gender makeup of his readers, he responded by using &quot;Fosdick&quot; as an example of the (perceived) inherent differences between the male and female sense of humor:

Although &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; began as a specific burlesque of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, it eventually grew beyond mere parody and developed its own distinctive, self-contained comic identity. Like all of Capp&#x27;s creations, &quot;Fosdick&quot; gradually evolved into a broad, multileveled satire of contemporary American society. Mixing equal parts slapstick, black humor, irony, and biting social criticism, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; provided a running commentary on, among other things: the lowly lives of policemen, the capriciousness of the general public, and the thankless role of society&#x27;s &quot;heroes&quot;—as well as the superficiality of modern pop culture and the compulsive nature of its avid fans. Capp would return to these themes again and again in &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;.

==Supporting characters and villains==
&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; soon developed its own regular supporting cast, separate from &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and the rest of the Dogpatch characters. Joining Fosdick&#x27;s intermittent adventures were:
*The Chief - Fosdick&#x27;s bloated, abusive and cheerfully corrupt superior.
*Prudence &quot;(ugh!)&quot; Pimpleton - Fosdick&#x27;s homely, long-suffering fiancée (formerly known as &quot;Bess Backache.&quot; Both names were a direct parody of Dick Tracy&#x27;s sweetheart, Tess Trueheart.) They were perpetually &quot;engaged for 17 years,&quot; throughout the entire 35-year run of &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;. Prudence always hoped that Fosdick would get a promotion and a subsequent pay raise of $10.00 to $32.50 per week-so he would have enough salary to support her in marriage-but Prudence was doomed to disappointment. A running gag is Prudence Pimpleton literally kicking Fearless Fosdick out of her house into the street. The nearest Prudence ever came to marriage is with Fosdick in a &quot;dream sequence&quot; nightmare Fosdick had-which ironically led to Li&#x27;l Abner Yokum finally marrying Daisy Mae Scragg after nearly 20 years of engagement in 1952. In another episode she was heroine when she saved the earth from destruction by uniting two lovesick machines &quot;Solomon&quot; and &quot;Sheba&quot; although it nearly cost her her life [1960]. Another time Fosdick saved Prudence from unknowingly marrying his evil twin brother, Jerry J. Fosdick, in 1975.
*Mr. and Mrs. Pimpleton - Prudence&#x27;s frustrated parents, who were miffed about feeding the freeloading Fosdick.
*Mrs. Flintnose - Fosdick&#x27;s mercenary, hatchet-faced landlady.
*Cousin Sebastian - The Chief&#x27;s idiot relation, who periodically replaces Fosdick on the police force and is beaten up in place of Fosdick after Fosdick gets fired.
*Purity Pinchwolf - a pretty policewoman of the Anti-Masher Squad (1960); after Fosdick made a vow not to use violence against criminals, his girlfriend Prudence Pimpleton kicked Fosdick out of her house and refused to feed him (as she had been doing for the past 17 years hoping he would marry her). Fosdick whistled about her, which was mistaken for a wolf whistle at Pinchwolf, who bonked Fosdick on the head; Fosdick falls in love with the fact that as the daughter of a supermarket owner she has a reserve supply of steaks. Later Purity had to defend herself against Mayor Smellgood.
*Lester Gooch - Supposedly Fosdick&#x27;s cartoonist &quot;creator&quot;—a broadly-drawn caricature of real-life &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; creator Chester Gould. The chronically overworked Gooch battles both his venal, exploitative comic strip syndicate and occasional bouts of temporary insanity. His mental lapses necessitate frequent visits to an insane asylum, complete with straitjacket and rubber room—from whence his most demented, diabolical plots would emerge (much to the delight of his rabid fans).

The early strips referred to grotesque &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;-inspired public enemies with absurdly satirical names like &quot;Banana Face,&quot; &quot;Spinach Face&quot; and &quot;Hamburger Face.&quot; One villain, &quot;Carrot Top,&quot; could not be tracked by bloodhounds, as he had no blood. His head was a genuine carrot. But Fosdick tracks him to his doom—with a rabbit. Over the years, other nemeses included:
*Bomb Face - Criminal gang leader with a cannonball bomb for a head (see excerpt), who tries to kill Fosdick by igniting his own fuse. Fosdick turns the tables on him—literally, causing the detonating Bomb Face to incinerate his own gang. (The original artwork for this &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Sunday sequence, dated 30 May 1943, is currently housed at the Library of Congress in the Caroline and Erwin Swann Collection.) 
*Stone Face - A supposedly fictional comic strip character who unexpectedly turns out to be &quot;real,&quot; threatening and tormenting &quot;Fosdick&quot; cartoonist Lester Gooch (1943). His solid granite head proves to be no match for Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s, however.
*Rattop - A particularly heinous villain, with a mouse head (1944).
*&quot;The Hat&quot; - A headless serial killer who wears a wide-brimmed zoot suit fedora atop his shoulders, concealing his empty collar (1945). He could not be executed, since his homicidal crimes are all hanging offenses. He&#x27;s finally undone when Fosdick tricks him into crossing state lines—where the method of execution is by electric chair.
*Anyface - A diabolical master of disguise (1947)—albeit with slovenly personal grooming habits. (He ended up disguising himself as Fearless Fosdick--and both the real thing and the copy confront one another in a steam bath; this episode ends in an unresolved cliffhanger when a feverish Lester Gooch suddenly becomes &quot;sane,&quot; and abandons the storyline—much to Abner&#x27;s frustration. Capp invited readers to submit their own solutions in a nationwide, promotional mail-in contest.) Anyface was later utilized as an all-purpose villain in a series of print ads featuring Fosdick, produced for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic, (see Licensing and promotion). In July 1966 Anyface disguised himself as Daisy Mae in order to get a manuscript of his life from Li&#x27;l Abner; although he failed to fool Li&#x27;l Abner (Li&#x27;l Abner realized who was the real Daisy Mae when she became jealous). Anyface grabbed the manuscript and, jumping a fence, fell into Dogpatch&#x27;s Bottomless Canyon; Anyface tried to get the folks who live on the side of the canyon to save him by changing into John Wayne, however, as John Wayne always defeated the Indians in the movies-the &quot;natives&quot; refused to save him; in his last desperate chance Anyface changed himself into Lyndon Baines Johnson; however the last inhabitant of &quot;Bottomless Canyon&quot; {A cartoon version of Senator Barry Goldwater} refuses to save Anyface from being doomed to fall forever!
*&quot;Fearful&quot; Fosdick (a.k.a. &quot;The Original&quot;) - Fosdick&#x27;s own dastardly, turncoat father (1948). The senior Fosdick, a former policeman-turned-criminal mastermind, is one of only a handful of recurring &quot;Fosdick&quot; villains.
*Jerry J. Fosdick - Fosdick&#x27;s evil twin con-man brother; after he finds out about Prudence Pimpleton&#x27;s 17-year engagement (+ steak dinners) to Fosdick, Jerry J. Fosdick switches clothing with Fosdick and takes his place so he can &quot;marry&quot; (i.e. steal her money) Prudence Pimpleton; Fosdick &quot;stops&quot; the &quot;wedding&quot; at the last minute! (August 24, 1975)
*The Chippendale Chair - A murderously evil piece of furniture (1948). Fosdick admonishes it, &quot;You&#x27;re going to get the chair, Chair!&quot; As usual Fosdick does bring the chair to the electric chair--but only after a large body count due to Fosdick&#x27;s stupidity.
*Elmer Schlmpf - The product-tampering urban terrorist from &quot;The Case of the Poisoned Beans&quot; who is beyond the reach of the law—being already dead (1950).
*The Atom Bum - A vagrant tramp on an escalating crime spree, loaded with radioactive plutonium—and thus deadly if he is so much as jarred. After he is found not to be destructive, he makes the mistake of walking on the grass despite a &quot;Do not walk on the Grass&quot; sign, and is shot dead by Fearless Fosdick (1951).
*Sidney the Crooked Parrot - Fosdick&#x27;s own mutinous, criminally insane house pet who after Fosdick cut down on his supply of crackers, made up his own criminal gang and nearly succeeded in killing Fosdick--but who ended up as a meal for Fosdick (1953).
*Ezio the Pincher - A petty jewel thief who stashes the &quot;hot&quot; Beanfort Knox wristwatch inside Fosdick&#x27;s skull—where Fosdick cannot find it, but can hear it ticking (1957). His name was a play on real-life opera star, Ezio Pinza.
*Nelson Shrinkafeller - The mysterious Jívaro Jungle headshrinker (1959). His moniker was a takeoff on then-New York governor (and future vice president) Nelson Rockefeller.
*Ricky Smellgood- a lovesick teenage Mayor for the Day who tries to woo Purity Pinchwolf; when he finds a rival in Fearless Fosdick, he sends Fosdick to enforce an ordinance from Smellgood forbidding the Bullgravians from celebrating a homicidal new year.
*&quot;Solomon&quot; - A lovesick, artificially intelligent weather satellite with the power to turn benign, man-made objects against humanity—unless it can unite with its mate satellite, &quot;Sheba&quot;. (1960).
*&quot;E.D.S.&quot; - The robotic &quot;Electronic Detective Substitute,&quot; which managed to rack up even more collateral damage than Fosdick (1961).
*Frank Nutsy (a.k.a. &quot;The Enforcer&quot;) - Mobster boss of &quot;The Unteachables,&quot; a parody of both TV&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and real-life Al Capone henchman Frank Nitti (1961). Nutsy bribes everyone in Fosdick&#x27;s hometown of Honesty, Indiana into falsely declaring Fosdick 65 years old—and thus prematurely retired from the force.
*Boldfinger - Disguised as master spy &quot;James Bumm&quot;, Fosdick pursues an arch-criminal with a forefinger that can pierce solid steel, and breath as hypnotically sweet as poppy blossoms (1965).
*Babyface - Half-pint killer and racketeer with an incongruously angelic face (1972). Disguised as a child, he passed as an adorable seven-year-old and stole the world&#x27;s rarest jewel, the &quot;Keeler Ruby.&quot;

==The &quot;hole&quot; story==
Fosdick is so tough that on the rare occasions he isn&#x27;t wearing his black suit, he pins his badge to his bare chest. The ramped-up comic violence depicted in &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is (usually) bloodless, over-the-top and deliberately surreal. Perpetually ventilated by flying bullets, an iconic &quot;Fosdick&quot; trademark was the &quot;Swiss cheese look&quot;—with smoking bullet holes revealing his truly two-dimensional cartoon construction. The impervious detective considers the gaping holes &quot;minor scratches&quot; or &quot;mere flesh wounds&quot; however, and always reports back in one piece for duty the next day. (When the Chief once said, &quot;Fosdick! We thought you were dead!&quot; Fosdick replied, &quot;I was—but it didn&#x27;t prove fatal. Only a mild case.&quot;)

Virtually indestructible, Fosdick&#x27;s famous iron-jawed profile adorned both Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers during World War II, joining the other &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;-inspired wartime nose art mascots—Earthquake McGoon, Moonbeam McSwine, Daisy Mae, Lonesome Polecat, Hairless Joe, Silent Yokum, Sadie Hawkins and Wolf Gal.

Supposedly starting as a patrolman in 1923 and finally making detective grade in 1948, Fosdick is perennially underpaid at $22.50 per week. (A running gag in the strip has Fosdick getting rehired after being fired from the force. He has to restart at an apprentice rate, which is half his regular onerous salary).

Fosdick has notoriously bad aim and even worse judgment. Oblivious to more obvious felonies being committed in broad daylight in the background (such as murders, assaults and bank robberies), Fosdick would bypass them to shoot someone who walked on the grass or sold balloons without a license. He regularly shoots dozens of innocent bystanders and apprehends the wrong individuals—while the real criminals go free. A darkly comic running gag in the series is the stoic, stone-faced image of a determined Fosdick standing amidst a still-smoking pile of bullet-riddled pedestrians—the inevitable collateral damage of any Fosdick crimefighting endeavor. &quot;When Fosdick is after a lawbreaker, there is no escape for the miscreant,&quot; wrote Capp in the introduction to &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Fearless Fosdick: His Life and Deaths&quot; (1956). &quot;There is, however, a fighting chance to escape for hundreds of innocent bystanders who happen to be in the neighborhood—but &quot;only&quot; a fighting chance. Fosdick&#x27;s duty, as he sees it, is not so much to maintain safety as to destroy crime, and it&#x27;s too much to ask any law-enforcement officer to do both, I suppose.&quot;

Gullible, dense and impossibly inept, public servant Fosdick is duty-bound and literal-minded to the point of being a menace to the citizens he is sworn to protect. Typically guileless Fosdick logic occurs in &quot;The Case of the Poisoned Beans&quot; (1950), a quintessential &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; continuity. In the story, the ever-vigilant detective goes about town &quot;shooting&quot; anyone he sees eating &quot;Old Faithful&quot; brand beans in an attempt to &quot;prevent&quot; them from consuming a toxic can he knows to have been tampered with. Throughout the story, the absurdity continues to mount—along with the astronomical body count—to its outlandish (and characteristically sardonic) dénouement. Fosdick begins his &quot;crusade&quot; by shooting dead a father who was trying to open a can of &quot;chicken soup&quot; for his children&#x27;s dinner; Fosdick&#x27;s &quot;body count&quot; is over 612, not including his dear old Aunt who made a mistake of trying to open a can of beans in his presence. The body count goes even &quot;higher&quot; after Fosdick has to turn in his gun--he uses a bow and arrow! Organized Crime takes advantage of Fosdick&#x27;s stupidly not only by having hitmen give cans of beans to victims (whom Fosdick of course kills) but also opening up &quot;Beaneasies&quot; (a spoof of Speakeasies) where customers can fill themselves up to their heart&#x27;s content of beans. Ironically, Fosdick ends up being sentenced to die in the electric chair, and for his last meal consumes a can of beans which turns out to be the can he was searching for. As is sometimes common in cartoon strips, Fosdick &quot;dies&quot; but (thanks to Lester Gooch) Fosdick comes back to life to inflict more chaos and mayhem on innocent citizens.

No one is spared Capp&#x27;s merciless satire in &quot;The Case of the Poisoned Beans&quot;—from the venality of the justice system to the crookedness of a complicit media (which refuses to air public safety warnings for fear of offending its sponsor, Old Faithful Beans); from the corruption of big business to the fickleness and stupidity of a complacent public. The diabolical plot, which concerns urban terrorism and product tampering, presaged the 1982 Tylenol case by more than 30 years. &quot;Capp makes Fosdick&#x27;s police brutality acceptable, even funny, because Fosdick acts out of misguided goodness. He is, like Abner, an innocent,&quot; wrote Max Allan Collins in 1990. He&#x27;s also a victim of the system himself. According to Capp, &quot;Fosdick is underpaid only in terms of money. His superiors and his community are lavish with things worth more than money, such as hollow praise and chances to risk his life.&quot; Capp dedicated a book of reprinted &quot;Fosdick&quot; continuities to &quot;all underpaid cops, because there are no other kind.&quot;

==Chester Gould&#x27;s reaction==
Newspaper editors began clamoring for Fosdick to star in his own strip, something Capp briefly considered. Chester Gould, the creator of &quot;Dick Tracy,&quot; reportedly did not find Capp&#x27;s parody particularly funny. This is not surprising, since &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; lampoons every aspect of &quot;Dick Tracy,&quot; all grossly exaggerated for comic effect, from Fosdick&#x27;s impossibly square-jawed profile to his propensity for creating mayhem beyond all reason. The style of the &quot;Fosdick&quot; sequences closely mimics &quot;Tracy&quot;—including the urban setting, the outrageously grotesque villains, the galloping mortality rate, the thick square panels, the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style.

Gould was also probably less than enamored of his own unflattering portrayal in the character of Fosdick&#x27;s &quot;creator,&quot; the diminutive and occasionally mentally deranged cartoonist Lester Gooch. (Even Gooch&#x27;s bogus &quot;autograph&quot; in the panels of &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is a parody of Gould&#x27;s own famously flamboyant signature.) Gooch toiled for the abusive and corrupt &quot;Squeezeblood Syndicate,&quot; a dig at Capp&#x27;s own real-life syndicate, United Features, which owned &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; until Capp successfully wrested back ownership in 1948. Ironically, the post-Gould Dick Tracy&#x27;s favorite cartoon character was &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;.

Whatever Capp really thought of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, he always went out of his way to praise Gould and his strip in conversation and in print, invariably referring to it as &quot;Chester Gould&#x27;s magnificent &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.&quot; In &quot;The World of Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1953), Capp even credited &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (along with &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;) with directly influencing &quot;Abner&quot;, prompting his early decision to add suspense to the humorous feature. &quot;The greatest tribute paid to Chester Gould by another famous comic strip artist and storyteller and his creation was, of course, Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;,&quot; wrote author and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; expert Garyn G. Roberts in 1993. &quot;In short, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was a great deal of fun, but must be taken seriously as a loving tribute to Chester Gould and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.&quot;

Gould never publicly objected to &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;, or made any attempt to interfere with Capp&#x27;s continuing the feature during the 35 years in which it appeared. Gould and Capp met only once, according to Capp. It was reportedly a friendly meeting, and Gould took the occasion to thank Capp for doing what he called &quot;full-time press agentry for another comic strip.&quot; Capp readily agreed. Max Allan Collins, who took over the helm of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; when Gould retired, thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; and even wrote an appreciative foreword to a 1990 collection of Fosdick cartoons.

Besides &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Capp spoofed many other comic strips in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, including &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot; (at least twice; first as &quot;Jack Jawbreaker!&quot; in 1947 and again in 1966 as &quot;Chickensouperman!&quot;), &quot;Mary Worth&quot;, &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot;, and &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. Although they proved fertile sources of parody—most memorably &quot;Little Fanny Gooney&quot; (1952), &quot;Rex Moonlight, M.D.&quot; (1956), &quot;Steve Cantor&quot; and &quot;Mary Worm&quot; (1957)—no other strip seemed to provide Capp with the same bottomless well of inspiration as &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. Later comic strip parodies were mostly one-shot affairs. They never achieved quite the same degree of repeat success or sustained popularity as &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;.

==Licensing and advertising==

===&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; TV show===
&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; proved popular enough to be incorporated into a short-lived television program in 1952. A puppet show based on &quot;Fosdick&quot; premiered on NBC-TV on Sunday afternoons, and even made the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; for the week of October 17, 1952. (The TV show also sparked the permanent switch in the strip from Fosdick&#x27;s early &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; yellow fedora to his later trademark bowler hat, when Capp felt the three-dimensional puppet looked too close for comfort to the genuine article.)

Created for television and directed by puppeteer Mary Chase, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was written by Everett Crosby and voiced by John Griggs, Gilbert Mack, and Jean Carson. The storylines and villains were mostly separate from the comic strip and unique to the show. Thirteen episodes were produced featuring the Mary Chase marionettes. Presumed lost for many years, vintage kinescopes of the show have reportedly begun to resurface. (According to publisher Denis Kitchen: &quot;There are currently efforts underway to release these exceedingly rare &quot;Fosdick&quot; episodes on a set of DVDs. Stay tuned ...&quot;) Two of the half-hour episodes (&quot;The Haunted House&quot; and &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;) are housed at the Library of Congress, in the J. Fred and Leslie W. MacDonald Collection. To view the complete &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot; episode online, see the External links citation below.

===Wildroot Cream-Oil===
Fosdick was also licensed for use outside the strip in an advertising campaign for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men&#x27;s hair tonic of the postwar period. Fosdick&#x27;s image on tin signs and counter displays became a prominent fixture in barbershops across America in the late 1940s through the mid-1950s, as well as in animated TV commercials. A long-running series of print ads appeared in newspapers, national magazines (such as &quot;Life, Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, and &quot;Argosy&quot;), and comic books (including &quot;Archie Comics, Gang Busters, All-Star Western, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Mystery in Space, House of Mystery, All-American Men of War&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis&quot;). Scores of comic strip-format ads were produced, usually featuring Fosdick&#x27;s farcical triumphs over his archvillain nemesis &quot;Anyface.&quot; Anyface was a murderous, shape-shifting scoundrel whose plastic facial features could be molded into any identity—or any animal, object or appliance. However, he was &quot;always&quot; given away in the last panels by his telltale dandruff and messy, unkempt hair. The ads would invariably end with a running gag of Fosdick advising readers to &quot;Get Wildroot Cream-Oil, Charlie!&quot;-with the disclaimer &quot;That would be illegal-my name is ...&quot;.
Although &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was heavily merchandised in the 1940s and 1950s (especially the Shmoo), &quot;Fosdick&quot; products are relatively rare and highly valued by collectors. There was a rubber Halloween mask manufactured by Topstone, and a chalkware statue of the character was issued by Artrix Products in 1951. Various Wildroot tie-ins and giveaways also appeared, such as window decals, matchbook covers, and collegiate book jackets. More recently, Dark Horse Comics issued a limited edition Fearless Fosdick statue in 2001 (complete with a cannonball-sized hole through his midsection), #17 in their line of Classic Comic Characters figures. Various nostalgic reproductions of Wildroot advertising tin signs have also been recently available.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was almost certainly Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s major inspiration for creating his irreverent &quot;Mad magazine&quot;, which began in 1952 as a comic book that specifically parodied other comic books and strips in a similar style and similarly subversive manner. By the time EC Comics published &quot;Mad #1&quot;, Capp had been doing &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; for nearly a decade. Parallels between &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and the early &quot;Mad&quot; are unmistakable: the incongruous use of mock-Yiddish slang terms, the nose-thumbing disdain for pop cultural icons, the rampant and pervasive sick humor, the pointedly subversive tone, the total disregard for sentiment and the extremely broad visual styling. Even the trademark comic signs that clutter the backdrops of Will Elder&#x27;s panels would seem to have a precedent in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, in the headquarters of Dogpatch &quot;entrepreneur&quot; Available Jones. Tellingly, Kurtzman resisted parodying either &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; or &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in the comic book &quot;Mad&quot;, despite their prominence. (Both &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; were later satirized in EC&#x27;s &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;the only authorized imitation of &quot;Mad&quot;,&quot; edited by Al Feldstein.)

Elements of &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; can be gleaned in Bob Clampett&#x27;s classic Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot; (1946), as when avid &quot;fan&quot; Daffy Duck makes a panicked dash to the mailbox to retrieve the latest comic book, just like Li&#x27;l Abner often did. Later, after Daffy portrays his alter ego &quot;Duck Twacy&quot; in a manic nightmare sequence (complete with bullet-riddled corpses and &quot;impossible&quot; villains with names like &quot;Jukebox Jaw,&quot; &quot;Pickle Puss,&quot; &quot;88 Teeth&quot; and &quot;Neon Noodle&quot;), he &quot;wakes up&quot; in a rural, Dogpatch-like setting—on a pig farm.

Cartoonist/illustrator Frank Cho, a &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; fan, occasionally references &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; in his comic strip &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; in the guise of &quot;Fearless Detective Richard Stacey.&quot; Fosdick has also turned up in &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; by Bill Griffith. Johnny Hart, creator of &quot;B.C.&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;, also cited &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; as one of his early inspirations. Comedian Chuck McCann portrayed a decidedly Fosdick-like &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; parody character, complete with stage makeup, named &quot;Detective Dick H. Dump of Bunko Squad&quot; on his irreverent WNEW-TV kids show in the sixties.

==Beyond the strip-within-a-strip==
*&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; invaded the 1968 presidential campaign, as Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey accused his Republican opponent Richard Nixon of playing loose with law and order issues. &quot;His [Nixon&#x27;s] privilege, if he wants to play &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;,&quot; said Humphrey.
*&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is also the title of a jazz instrumental by Bill Holman, recorded live by Vic Lewis and His Orchestra with Tubby Hayes in 1954. Another, unrelated jazz composition, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&#x27;s Tune,&quot; was composed and recorded by Umberto Fiorentino for his Brave Art/Columbia-Sony CD, &quot;Things to Come&quot; (2002).
*&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is an example of a metafictional character—a character who exists in a separate fictional realm within an already fictional universe. Other metafictional (or fictional fictional) characters in modern popular culture include &quot;Itchy and Scratchy&quot; and &quot;The Happy Little Elves&quot;, the cartoons-within-a-cartoon in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the science fiction &quot;works&quot; of fictional author Kilgore Trout, which reappear sporadically within the novels of Kurt Vonnegut.
*The popular Canadian children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret World of Og&quot; (1961) by Pierre Berton features a cat called &quot;Earless Osdick,&quot; because he kept his ears down like the dog he thought he was.
*Fosdick&#x27;s oft-mentioned weekly salary of $22.50 is a direct reference to Al Capp&#x27;s own pitiful salary when he was still an anonymous &quot;ghost&quot; on Ham Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, according to &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; expert Denis Kitchen. Kitchen believes that Fisher was meant to cringe every time the amount was mentioned, as he writes in the notes to &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Li&#x27;l Abner: The Frazetta Years&quot;.
*According to &quot;The Marx Brothers Scrapbook&quot; (1974, Richard J. Anobile, ed.), comedian Harpo Marx, a professed &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; fan, named one of his dogs &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; for its extraordinary dauntlessness.
*In a &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; parody which once asked if cartoon characters really aged, it had Fearless Fosdick finally retired from the police and spending his declining years in Dogpatch, living with Li&#x27;l Abner and Daisy Mae - who now look like the late Pappy and Mammy Yokum.
*Sharp-eyed viewers of Warren Beatty&#x27;s big screen adaptation of &quot;Dick Tracy (1990 film)&quot; will have detected a direct, onscreen homage to Fearless Fosdick. The &quot;opera&quot; Tracy is seen attending when his 2-way wrist radio suddenly calls him to duty is titled &quot;Die Schlmpf&quot; in the end credits—presumably after Elmer Schlmpf, the maniacal (albeit deceased) product-tampering fiend from &quot;The Case of the Poisoned Beans.&quot;
*Comic book writers Marv Wolfman and Craig Miller developed &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; for a big screen, live-action comedy in the 1990s, but the project to date remains unsold.
*In a recent episode of &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; showing retired cartoon characters, one storyline has Maggie of &quot;Bringing up Father&quot;&#x27;s pearl necklace missing. Fearless Fosdick is his usual incompetent stupid self - he wrongly thinks Walt Wallet is the thief.
*On June 26, 2016, Fearless Fosdick partnered with Dick Tracy in a dream sequence in the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic.

<doc id="947485" wikidata="Q4781156" url="?curid=947485" title="Apple Cup">
<text>The Apple Cup is an American college football rivalry game between the University of Washington Huskies and Washington State University Cougars, the two largest universities in the state of Washington. Both were members of the Pac-12 Conference until 2024.

First played in 1900, , the matchup was traditionally the final game of the regular season for both teams and generally took place on the Saturday preceding Thanksgiving. With the NCAA&#x27;s extension of the regular season to twelve games in 2006, the game is often played at a later date. From 2011 to 2023, it was most commonly held on the Friday after Thanksgiving. As a non-conference game for the first time in 63 years, the 2024 edition was played early in the season, on September 14 at Lumen Field in Seattle.

Since 1946, the game has been held in odd years in Seattle at Husky Stadium (except 2011 and 2024, both at Lumen Field), while Washington State has hosted during even years at Rogers Field (1946, 1948, 1954) and Martin Stadium (since 1982) in Pullman, and Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane. The games in eastern Washington from 1935 to 1948, all in Pullman, were held in mid-October. The exception was in 1945, when two games were played: the first in Seattle in mid-October, and the second in Pullman in late November. Starting in 2024, Seattle is scheduled to host in even years and Pullman in odd years.

First awarded in 1963, the Apple Cup Trophy is presented to the winner by the state&#x27;s governor at the conclusion of the game.

==Series history==

The teams played for the Governor&#x27;s Trophy starting in 1934. This bronze shield was made by sculptor Dudley Pratt and donated and awarded by Governor Clarence D. Martin, an alumnus of the University of Washington and the namesake of Pullman&#x27;s Martin Stadium. The winners for the years 1934–1939 are etched on the shield. The trophy was awarded until at least 1946.
In 1963 the Big Apple Trophy was donated to the competition by the Washington Apple Commission, emblematic of Washington&#x27;s national reputation as a major producer of apples. This award was colloquially referred to as the Apple Cup,
 which later came to metonymically refer to the game itself. In 1989 the apple was recognized as Washington&#x27;s state fruit during the state&#x27;s centennial celebration.

When the college football regular season was lengthened from eleven to twelve games in 2006, there was a movement to change the date of the game from the Saturday before Thanksgiving to the weekend following, which would have allowed a bye week for both teams during the season. In 2006, both teams played twelve straight weeks without a bye, leaving the two teams noticeably fatigued. The 2007 game was played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving for the first time; but the 2008 game was returned to the Saturday before the holiday.

The media joked that the 2008 game won by the Cougars in Pullman was the &quot;Crapple Cup&quot; and &quot;full of worms,&quot; because hosted winless . The game returned to the Saturday after Thanksgiving in 2009 in Seattle. The 2011 game in Seattle was moved to CenturyLink Field to allow an early start on the renovation of Husky Stadium.

From 1950 through 1980 (except for 1954), the WSU home games in the series were played in Spokane at Joe Albi Stadium (Memorial Stadium until 1962). The Cougars won three of these fifteen games (1958, 1968, 1972). In 1910, the WSU home game in Spokane was played at Recreation Park ().

The first game in 1900 resulted in a 5–5 tie. The series has been played continuously since 1945, when there were two games, one in Seattle and one in Pullman. The 2020 game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Game results==

Overtime was introduced for Division I-A (FBS) in 1996 and has been used four times in the Apple Cup, all in Pullman.Each team has two overtime victories: UW in 1996 and 2002, WSU in 2008 and 2012.
:OT → Overtime (1996, 2012)
:2OT → Double Overtime (2008)
:3OT → Triple Overtime (2002)
After a two-year hiatus in 1943 and 1944, two games were played in 1945.&lt;br&gt;The 2020 game scheduled in Pullman was declared No Contest by the league due to Washington State not having the minimum number of scholarship players available for the game as a result of a positive football student-athlete COVID-19 cases.&lt;br&gt; Prior to 1959, WSU was WSC.

<text>Lex Records is a British independent record label. Most releases on the label are alternative hip hop, alternative rock or electronic music. Dazed described Lex as a label &quot;...whose wildly creative output spans over a decade of landmark releases that have changed the music industry no end.&quot;

==History==
===2000s===
Founded in 2001, Lex was originally an imprint of Warp. By the end of 2003, Lex had released several albums including debuts by Boom Bip, Non-Prophets and Danger Mouse and the success of these albums allowed Lex to expand.

In 2004, Lex managed &quot;The Grey Album&quot; campaign, establishing Danger Mouse as a critically successful artist. Damon Albarn got a copy of &quot;The Grey Album&quot; and this led to Danger Mouse being approached to produce Gorillaz&#x27;s second album &quot;Demon Days&quot;. &quot;Demon Days&quot; was released by Parlophone in May 2005 and sold millions of copies establishing Danger Mouse as a commercially successful producer by the summer of 2005.

In September 2005, Brown bought Warp&#x27;s share of the label. The next release was Danger Doom &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot;. It was Lex&#x27;s best selling release to date. Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s multi platinum debut &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; followed in 2006, released on Warner with Lex branding.

In March 2008, Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s second album 2006 &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; was released on Warner with Lex branding. In the same month, Lex released Neon Neon &quot;Stainless Style&quot; which was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2008.

In 2009, Lex released MF Doom&#x27;s &quot;Born Like This&quot;.

===2010s===
In July 2010, Lex released an audiobook of Alan Moore &amp; Mitch Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Unearthing&quot;, narrated by Moore and scored by Crook &amp; Flail. They performed it live at the Old Vic Tunnels. Also in July, Danger Mouse, Sparklehorse &amp; David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; was released on Parlophone with Lex branding.

In May 2011, Danger Mouse &amp; Daniele Luppi&#x27;s album &quot;Rome&quot; featuring Jack White and Norah Jones was released on Parlophone with Lex branding.

On 5 November 2011, Lex marked its tenth anniversary with a show at The Roundhouse in Camden featuring performances by Ghostface Killah, MF Doom and Jneiro Jarel, and released &quot;Complex&quot;, a compilation album.

In August 2012 Lex released JJ Doom&#x27;s &quot;Key to the Kuffs&quot;. Later in 2012 Lex launched Charlie White and Boom Bip&#x27;s art project &quot;Music For Sleeping Children&quot; which includes photography, video, electronic music and spoken word recordings. Lex&#x27;s first two short films, written by Alan Moore and directed by Mitch Jenkins were previewed online in November 2012.

In 2013, Lex released Neon Neon&#x27;s second album &quot;Praxis Makes Perfect&quot;. The album was presented live as an immersive theatre performance with National Theatre Wales.

In November 2013, Lex and ATP co-promoted a show with MF Doom, BadBadNotGood and Bishop Nehru at the Kentish Town Forum. MF Doom went on to collaborate with BadBadNotGood and Bishop Nehru on Lex. BadBadNotGood remixed the JJ Doom track &quot;Guv&#x27;nor&quot;; MF Doom produced the Bishop Nehru mini-album NehruvianDoom; and MF Doom appeared on BadBadNotGood &amp; Ghostface Killah&#x27;s album &quot;Sour Soul&quot;.

Eyedress released his first single on Lex in 2016. His debut studio album, &quot;Manila Ice&quot;, was released on Lex in May 2017, followed by &quot;Sensitive G&quot; in November 2018. The single &quot;Cocaine Sunday&quot; from &quot;Sensitive G&quot; received gold RIAA certification in 2024.

In late 2019, Lex released the first singles from Eyedress’ third album &quot;Let&#x27;s Skip to the Wedding&quot;, including &quot;Jealous&quot; on 19 December 2019. “Jealous” became viral hit the following year. “Jealous” was certified gold in Australia, Canada, Poland and the US in 2021, and 3× platinum in the US in March 2024.

===2020s===

Lex released “Romantic Lover” by Eyedress on 12 January 2020 which also became a viral hit.&quot;Romantic Lover&quot; was certified platinum in the US in March 2023.

Lex&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Show&quot;, written by Alan Moore and directed by Mitch Jenkins was an official selection for SXSW 2020. Following SXSW&#x27;s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic film had a world premiere at Sitges Film Festival 2020, and was licensed to Starz.

Eyedress&#x27; album &quot;Let&#x27;s Skip to the Wedding&quot;, which includes the singles &quot;Jealous&quot; and &quot;Romantic Lover&quot;, was released on 7 August 2020. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada in 2024.

On 31 December 2020, MF Doom&#x27;s death was announced on social media.

In August 2021 Lex released Eyedress’ fourth studio album &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. The first single from the album, “Something About You” became a viral hit in the US with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; citing the track as the fastest-rising song on American streaming services for the week ending 23 September 2021. &quot;Something About You&quot; was certified gold in the US in May 2022, and platinum in October 2023.

During 2021, Lex marked its twentieth anniversary by releasing a series of remixes of recordings in its catalogue under the project title &quot;Lex-XX&quot;.

<doc id="947497" wikidata="Q1041750" url="?curid=947497" title="Carling Brewery">
<text>The Carling Brewery was founded in 1840 by Thomas Carling in London, Canada. Carling lager was first sold in the United Kingdom in 1952, and in the early 1980s became the UK&#x27;s most popular beer brand by volume sold. The company was acquired by Canadian Breweries, renamed Carling O&#x27;Keefe, and merged with the Molson Brewery, which then merged with Coors to form Molson Coors.

==History==
The origin of Carling dates back to 1818, when Thomas Carling, a farmer from the English county of Yorkshire, and his family settled in Upper Canada, at what is now the city of London, Ontario. He brewed an ale which became popular, and eventually took up brewing full-time. The first Carling brewery had two kettles, a horse to turn the grinding mill and six men to work on the mash tubs, and Carling sold his beer from a wheelbarrow on the streets of London, Ontario.

In 1840, Carling began a small brewing operation in London, selling beer to soldiers at the local camp. In 1878, his sons, John and William, built a five-storey brewery in London, which was destroyed by fire within four years of opening, on 13 February 1879. William Carling, the firm&#x27;s senior partner and technical leader, died of pneumonia contracted after helping to fight the fire. The remaining partners carried on without him. John Carling died in 1911, and the company changed hands numerous times thereafter.

In 1927, Carling offered a $25,000 prize for the first flight from London, Ontario, to London, England. The challenge was taken up by Capt. Terry Tully and Lt. James Medcalf in a Stinson Detroiter monoplane named &quot;Sir John Carling&quot;. They took off on 1 September 1927, from London, Ontario, and reached Newfoundland, but disappeared over the North Atlantic.

Carling merged with the Brewing Corporation of Ontario (BCO) in 1930. BCO launched Carling in the US in 1932 through a joint venture and acquired Toronto&#x27;s O&#x27;Keefe Brewery in 1934. BCO became Canadian Breweries (CBL) in 1937. Under the leadership of president E. P. Taylor, CBL grew Carling into a Canadian national brand through the purchase of numerous other breweries across Canada, several of which were converted to brew Carling and O&#x27;Keefe brands and Carling Red Cap became the most popular brand of beer in Ontario in the 1960s. (Alcohol sale is regulated differently by each Canadian province, not on a nation-wide basis.) The brand later disappeared from the market and was unsuccessfully revived in 1994.

Carling brands entered the UK market in a joint venture between CBL and British brewers in 1952. The joint venture eventually became Bass Charington, the largest brewer in the UK. After CBL was sold to Rothmans in 1969, it was renamed Carling O&#x27;Keefe in 1973. In 1989, Carling O&#x27;Keefe merged with Molson, which merged in 2005 with Coors to form the Molson Coors Brewing Company. Molson Coors has continued to brew and sell Carling Black Label across Canada.
Carling became the UK&#x27;s most popular beer brand (by volume sold) in the early 1980s. UK sales in 1999 were one billion pints, in 2007, 2.3 billion pints (over six billion worldwide), in 2009, 4.1 billion pints (11.6 billion pints worldwide), in 2010, 17.6 billion pints worldwide, in 2011 24.9 billion pints worldwide. In 2016 they broke new records, selling 7.9 billion pints in the UK alone, with 83.6 billion pints worldwide.

The largest pub chain in the UK, J D Wetherspoon, stopped selling Carling in September 2009, entering into a seven-year exclusive deal with the Danish brewery Carlsberg. From Q1 2011 Amstel, Carling, Heineken and Staropramen were again sold by Wetherspoons, at higher prices than Carlsberg.

In 2017, UK HMRC took Carling to the tax tribunal because it claimed the firm underpaid tax by more than £50 million between 1 September 2012 and 31 January 2015. But the firm won the case after it successfully argued the actual strength of the lager meant it should not be subject to the four per cent level of taxation. The lager is advertised as having an alcohol by volume (ABV) of four per cent but is actually brewed between 3.7 per cent and 4.3 per cent, owners Molson Coors said. In the tribunal hearing brought by HMRC, the firm said the ABV was reduced in order to cut tax on Carling products as stronger beers are subject to higher taxes than lower-strength ones under UK excise duties. EU law permits beer to have a natural variation of 0.5 per cent and the owner insists it does not believe customers are being misled. According to papers from the tribunal, Philip Rutherford, vice president of Molson Coors Europe, told the tribunal the &quot;key driver&quot; behind the decision not to change the labelling on Carling&#x27;s products was to prevent retailers, including pub chains and supermarkets, from demanding &quot;a slice&quot; of the savings.

==Sponsorships==
Carling, part of Molson Coors, were title sponsors of English football&#x27;s Premier League from its second season in 1993 until 2001, returning as an official partner from 2016 to 2019 before being replaced by Budweiser, and the Reading and Leeds festivals from between 1998 and 2007. Carling are the official beer of the Scotland national football team, and in 2010 and 2011 were the sponsors of the Scottish Cup. In 2012, Carling ended their nine-year sponsorship of the Football League Cup, then called the &quot;Carling Cup&quot; . they sponsored Northern Ireland&#x27;s IFA Premiership. Carling sponsored the two leading Scottish football clubs, Celtic and Rangers, from 2003 to 2010. As of 2022-23 season, Carling currently sponsors of both men and women&#x27;s FA Cups.

Carling was a major sponsor of live music in the UK, sponsoring the Academy Music Group venues (including Brixton Academy), until replaced by O2.

In 1927, Carling offered a $25,000 prize for the first Canadian or British pilot to fly from London, Ontario to London, England. This offer was made just after Lindbergh had made his successful flight. The pilot, Terrence Tully, and James Medcalf the navigator made the attempt in a Stinson SM-1. The plane took off on 29 August 1927, but soon turned back due to heavy fog. Their second attempt a few days later brought them to Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, from which on 7 September they headed for London, England. After two days had passed with no sighting of them, it was assumed they were lost at sea.

Carling in 1972 and 1973 sponsored race driver Larry Smith in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series; Smith died in a crash during the 1973 Talladega 500. For 1974 the company sponsored Canadian native Earl Ross; after his second place in that year’s Motor State 400 Ross&#x27; team was merged by Carling with the Junior Johnson #11 team of driver Cale Yarborough. Yarborough had won six races during the season and won four more under Carling colors while Ross stunned the sport by winning at Martinsville Speedway. Despite the success Carling unexpectedly dropped their sponsorship, this despite signing a deal lasting through 1977.

===Black Label===

Carling Black Label is the name of the brand in Australia, Canada, and South Africa. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the beer has been sold simply as Carling since 1997. In Sweden, it is known as Carling Premier.

Black Label is well-known throughout the former British Empire, where it employed the slogan &quot;Hey Mabel, Black Label!&quot;. During the eighties and nineties, its slogan was &quot;I bet he drinks Carling Black Label!&quot; which was a reworking of an unsold campaign for the UK Milk Marketing Board, &quot;I bet he drinks milk!&quot; Black Label has the slang/street name of Zamalek in South Africa, because of an association with the Egyptian football club of the name which shares the colours black, white and red.

Carling Black Label won Monde Selection&#x27;s Grand Gold Award in 2008.

===Other brand history===
Film director Wim Wenders shot an advert in Iceland with actors Bryan Carney and Rebecca Godwin, showing Carney riding a bicycle on a highwire over a waterfall; it cost over £1 million. In 1996, Carling Premier used Gary Numan&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;Cars&quot;, and sponsored his tour of that year.

<text>Daniel Peter Masterson (born March 13, 1976) is an American actor and convicted rapist. He portrayed Steven Hyde in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2006), Milo Foster in &quot;Men at Work&quot; (2012–2014), and Jameson &quot;Rooster&quot; Bennett in &quot;The Ranch&quot; (2016–2018). In May 2023, Masterson was convicted of raping two women in 2003. A third count of rape resulted in a hung jury. In September 2023, he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. Masterson is a Scientologist, as were his victims at the time of the assaults. The Church of Scientology&#x27;s attempts to silence the victims, and its subsequent interference, resulted in a 20-year delay in bringing the crimes to justice.

==Early life and family==
Masterson was born on Long Island, New York, to Carol and Peter Masterson. He grew up in Albertson, Garden City, and East Williston in Nassau County. Masterson has a brother, actor Christopher Masterson, who played Francis on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. Their maternal half-siblings, Jordan Masterson and Alanna Masterson, are also actors. He also has a paternal half-brother, Will Masterson.

==Career==
===Early years===
Starting at age four, Masterson worked as a child model and was featured in magazine articles as well as television commercials beginning at age five. He starred in musicals at the age of eight and began acting as well. Masterson&#x27;s singing voice &quot;disappeared&quot; by his teenage years. By the age of 16, he had appeared in over 100 commercials, including ones for Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes, Hardee&#x27;s, Hostess, Tang, and Clearasil.

===Acting career===

In the early 1990s, Masterson had a role in &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot;, and starred as Justin in &quot;Cybill&quot;. After starring in the third and fourth seasons of &quot;Cybill&quot;, Masterson decided he wanted to move on and audition for a show originally titled &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot;, which later was changed to &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. The original casting director for &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, Debby Romano, resisted Masterson&#x27;s audition because he was slightly older than the rest of the cast, but ultimately allowed him to audition. She stated, &quot;he came in and he was just so funny&quot; and that he redefined where the role was going and made the role of Steven Hyde the &quot;tough, funny guy.&quot;

Masterson starred in all eight seasons of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. His role on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; launched Masterson&#x27;s career, allowing him to pursue other endeavors between tapings. After the show concluded, Masterson acted in several movies and made guest appearances on television shows including &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;MADtv&quot;. Along with &quot;&#x27;70s&quot; costars Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama, he co-hosted the Fox TV special &quot;Woodstock 1999&quot;. He had a role in the 2008 comedy &quot;Yes Man&quot;. Masterson starred with his real-life future wife, Bijou Phillips, in the 2009 drama &quot;The Bridge to Nowhere&quot;.

In 2011, Masterson guest-starred as James Roland in USA Network&#x27;s &quot;White Collar&quot; (episode &quot;Where There&#x27;s A Will&quot;). He portrayed Jerry Rubin in the 2010 movie, &quot;The Chicago 8&quot;.

In 2012, the sitcom &quot;Men at Work&quot; premiered on TBS, co-starring Masterson, Michael Cassidy, James Lesure, and Adam Busch. In 2012, Masterson appeared in the film &quot;Alter Egos&quot;, directed by Jordan Galland.

Masterson starred alongside Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, and Elisha Cuthbert in the Netflix comedy series &quot;The Ranch&quot; from 2016 to 2018. His character was written out of the series in the middle of filming the third 20-episode season because of the rape and assault allegations against him.

The allegations and the resulting trial also caused Masterson to be the only surviving main or supporting cast member of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; not to be invited back to the sequel series &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;, and his character of Steven Hyde was simply not mentioned in the new series. His former castmate on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and a fellow Scientologist, Laura Prepon, had left the Church by the time of the allegations.

===Other ventures===

Masterson began DJing at Los Angeles night clubs in 1997 as a hobby, under the name DJ Donkey Punch, but it soon became a side business. After Donkey Punch, he changed his name to DJ Donkey Pizzle, then DJ Mom Jeans by 2010. Masterson is a self-described &quot;rock and hip hop fanatic&quot;, and is also a fan of indie, electro, and funk music, all of which he primarily DJed with.

For a time, Masterson owned a lounge and bar in Park City, Utah, called Downstairs.

Masterson appeared as part of a poker team, the Unabombers, in the 2005 GSN series &quot;The James Woods Gang vs. The Unabombers&quot;. He had hosted celebrity poker events, such as the Phat Farm Stuff Casino Weekend Poker Tournament, in which he won the tournament.

==Personal life==
Masterson is a Scientologist. He started dating actress Bijou Phillips in 2004. They became engaged in 2009 and married on October 18, 2011. They have one daughter, who was born in February 2014.

On September 18, 2023, Phillips filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences and requesting full legal and physical custody of their child, as well as spousal support.

== Sexual assault cases ==
In March 2017, three women filed sexual assault allegations against Masterson, prompting an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. Masterson, through his agent, denied the allegations. In December 2017, after a fourth victim&#x27;s accusations, Netflix fired Masterson from its comedy series &quot;The Ranch&quot;, saying in a statement, &quot;Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.&quot; Masterson stated that he was &quot;obviously very disappointed in Netflix&#x27;s decision to write [his] character off of &quot;The Ranch&quot;.&quot; A few weeks later, a fifth woman made similar rape accusations. He was dropped as a client by United Talent Agency.

In November 2017, musician Cedric Bixler-Zavala of the groups the Mars Volta and At the Drive-In wrote that Masterson had sexually assaulted his wife Chrissie Carnell. Bixler-Zavala further stated that At the Drive-In&#x27;s song &quot;Incurably Innocent&quot; (from the 2017 album &quot;In•ter a•li•a&quot;) is about the incident.

In early 2017, the show &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot; had filmed a two-hour episode that focused on the sexual-assault allegations against Masterson with interviews from multiple accusers. The show was planned to air during season 2, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office initially asked A&amp;E not to air the episode until the office had concluded investigations and decided whether to charge Masterson. After waiting another year and a half, A&amp;E decided to air the episode as the season 3 finale in February, but as soon as they announced it, A&amp;E and Disney were bombarded with a campaign of attack letters from Scientologists. Though delayed, the episode finally aired six months later on August 26, 2019, as a two-hour special, titled &quot;Waiting for Justice&quot;. One week before the airing, four accusers filed a civil suit against Masterson and the Church of Scientology.

=== Civil suit for harassment ===

Each of the four plaintiffs had been a member of the Church of Scientology at the time, as was Danny Masterson. Scientology forbids its members to report fellow members to police for any reason. After each plaintiff reported the sexual assaults to the police, each was declared a &quot;suppressive person&quot; and ejected from the Church. In the civil suit, the plaintiffs alleged the Church then mobilized an aggressive harassment campaign against them, called Fair Game in Scientology practice. The plaintiffs claimed they were subjected to stalking, physical invasion of privacy, constructive invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, though the campaigns against each plaintiff allegedly differed.

One plaintiff claimed her dog died from unexplained traumatic injuries to its trachea and esophagus, also alleging church members chased her as she drove her car, filmed her without permission, harassed her online, and posted ads to social media sites soliciting sex in her name. Another plaintiff stated that she and her neighbors observed a man snapping pictures from her driveway and later that night someone broke a window in her 13-year-old daughter&#x27;s bedroom. Masterson has since responded to one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, claiming: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to fight my ex-girlfriend in the media like she&#x27;s been baiting me to do for more than two years. I will beat her in court—and look forward to it because the public will finally be able to learn the truth and see how I&#x27;ve been railroaded by this woman... and once her lawsuit is thrown out, I intend to sue her and the others who jumped on the bandwagon for the damage they caused me and my family.&quot; He did not address the stalking or harassment claims.

On January 22, 2020, Bixler-Zavala reported that a second of his family pets had to be euthanized because it had been fed rat poison wrapped inside a rolled-up piece of raw meat, alleging this was done by Scientologists in response to his repeated public statements alleging that Masterson had raped his wife (who was one of the four women who filed suit against Masterson). Masterson&#x27;s wife Bijou Phillips made an Instagram post mocking court papers against Masterson.

Later, when the criminal case got underway, the parallel civil case was put on hold until after the criminal case was completed.

=== Criminal charges and trial ===

On June 17, 2020, Masterson was charged with raping a 23-year-old woman in 2001, a 28-year-old woman in early 2003, and a 23-year-old woman in late 2003. The three counts came after a three-year investigation beginning in 2017.

On January 21, 2021, Masterson pleaded not guilty. A four-day preliminary hearing began on May 18, 2021. 

During the hearing, three women told how Church of Scientology employees tried to stop them from reporting Masterson to the police.

On May 21, 2021, Los Angeles County Superior Court judge Charlaine F. Olmedo ruled &quot;all three witnesses to be credible and the evidence presented during a preliminary hearing sufficient to support the charges.&quot; She ordered that Masterson be bound over for trial on three counts of rape by force or fear and that he surrender his passport at his next arraignment, which was set for June 7, 2021. In the ruling, Judge Olmedo determined that the Scientology organization has &quot;an expressly written doctrine&quot; that &quot;not only discourages, but prohibits&quot; its members from going to the police to report illegal behavior.

On June 7, 2021, Masterson pleaded not guilty to rape accusations alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2003. His defense attorney accused the three women of colluding against Masterson, claiming that they were in contact with each other. His defense attorney also stated that one of the Jane Does had obtained money from Masterson in 2004. After the June 7 arraignment, Masterson remained free on $3.3 million bail. A pretrial hearing was set for August 9, 2021.

During the pretrial hearing on August 9, 2021, Judge Olmedo rejected numerous subpoena requests from Masterson&#x27;s defense attorneys, calling them &quot;stunningly overbroad&quot;, including requests for LAPD records related to David Miscavige and Shelly Miscavige, a subpoena of the producers of the TV show &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot;, and a subpoena of an investigative reporter. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the case based on a lack of evidence presented during the May preliminary hearing, and Olmedo sent that motion to another judge. On November 10, 2021, Los Angeles County Judge Ronald S. Coen ruled that the testimony of the alleged victims was credible and sufficient to support the charges, setting trial for August 29, 2022 in Judge Olmedo&#x27;s courtroom.

The August 29 trial date was subsequently rescheduled for October 11, 2022, at the request of Masterson&#x27;s lawyers. Near the end of the month-long trial, Masterson decided not to testify nor call witnesses in his defense. Both parties rested their cases on November 14, 2022, and made their closing arguments the following day. The jury deadlocked after three days in deliberation; instead of declaring a mistrial, the judge ordered the jury to resume deliberations the week after Thanksgiving. The jury remained deadlocked once deliberations resumed; consequently, a mistrial was declared on November 30, 2022. The jury foreman said that the panel of six men and six women leaned towards acquitting Masterson on all counts because they found the testimonies of the complainants inconsistent and implausible; for instance, one Jane Doe testified in court that Masterson threatened her with a gun during the attack, but a firearm was not mentioned when she reported to the police: &quot;The big big problem for her, credibility-wise, was the gun present in the testimony but not in the early reports&quot;, the jury foreman said.

===Retrial===

A new trial was held between April and May 2023, and on May 31, Masterson was convicted of two of the three counts of forcible rape. The jury was hung 8–4 in favor of conviction on the third charge. Masterson was remanded without bail until sentencing. He was incarcerated at Men&#x27;s Central Jail in Los Angeles, in &quot;administrative segregation&quot; for his safety.

In July 2023, prosecutors announced that they would not retry Masterson on the charge which had resulted in a hung jury.

===Sentencing===

On September 7, 2023, Masterson was sentenced to an indefinite period of 30 years to life in prison, which means he might be eligible for parole after serving 25½ years, but can be held in prison for life. His lawyers have said they will appeal the conviction.

Masterson was admitted to North Kern State Prison on December 27, 2023, after months of post-sentencing hearings. He was subsequently moved to and now resides at California Men&#x27;s Colony.

=== Appeal ===

In January 2024, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied bail for Masterson pending an appeal with worries Masterson could flee. &quot;If defendant&#x27;s conviction and sentence are upheld on appeal, he will likely remain in custody for decades and perhaps the rest of his life,&quot; wrote Judge Charlaine Olmedo. &quot;In light of the fact that defendant has no wife to go home to, defendant now has every incentive to flee and little reason to return to state prison to serve out the remainder of his lengthy sentence should his appeal be unsuccessful,&quot; the judge added in reference to the ongoing divorce proceedings between Masterson and Bijou Phillips.

=== Interference by Church of Scientology ===

After the criminal trial concluded, the victims&#x27; civil case resumed against Masterson and the Church of Scientology. Numerous instances of interference by the Church before, during and after the criminal trials were brought to light.

There were attempts to break in to the prosecutor&#x27;s house and to run him off the road, his car windows were broken, electronics tampered with, and he was surveilled. When seeking co-counsel, the prosecutor warned of potential harassment, stalking or other retaliation. Two attorneys declined out of fear, before the prosecutor found co-counsel.

LAPD detectives on the case were stalked, surveilled and experienced harassment. In the middle of the criminal trial, the Church of Scientology&#x27;s head of security and their attorney Vicki Podberesky met with the LAPD chief of police to accuse detectives and prosecutors of misconduct. They claimed to have &quot;boxes&quot; of evidence alleging &quot;detectives and prosecutors on the case had falsified witness testimony, overstated or coached witness testimony and withheld evidence&quot;. Prosecutor Mueller said the visit impacted the case when one of the detectives was afraid to testify.

One of the sexual assault victims claimed various harassment including tampering with security systems, vandalizing a car, and attempting to run them off the road. Another victim reported being followed during the criminal trial.

On June 7, 2023, Judge Olmedo sanctioned Masterson&#x27;s earlier defense attorneys Tom Mesereau and Sharon Appelbaum for leaking confidential discovery material from the criminal case to Vicki Podberesky, an attorney representing the Church of Scientology in the civil lawsuit. This leak was in direct violation of &quot;repeated directives and orders to refrain from providing criminal discovery to litigants and attorneys in the civil case.&quot; The files contained confidential information regarding the victims, including addresses and other personal information. Podberesky then used the information to file complaints against the lead prosecutors in Masterson&#x27;s rape trial, requested the police department start criminal inquiries into the two detectives who testified in the trial, and alleged that the Masterson victims filed false police reports.

<text>The Long Range Mountains are a series of mountains along the west coast of the Canadian island of Newfoundland. The Long Range Mountains are a subrange which forms the northernmost section of the Appalachian mountain chain on the eastern seaboard of North America. 

In 2003, it was announced that the International Appalachian Trail would be extended through the Long Range Mountains. A portion of the trail opened in 2006.

==Description==
The Great Northern Peninsula of Western Newfoundland contains the Highlands, the largest external basement massif of the Grenville Orogeny in the Appalachian Orogen. This Precambrian basement is known as the Long Range Inlier, Long Range Complex or Basement Gneiss Complex, consisting of quartz-feldspar gneisses and granites that are up to 1,550 million years in age. The Long Range dikes are mafic in composition and have an age of about 605 million years. 

Running along the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the range includes the following sections:

* Anguille Mountains,
* Lewis Hills,
* Tablelands (a section of the Earth&#x27;s mantle exposed at the surface)
* main section of the Long Range Mountains (running northeast from the Tablelands through Gros Morne National Park)

<doc id="947505" wikidata="Q841005" url="?curid=947505" title="Quena">
<text>The quena (hispanicized spelling of Quechua qina, sometimes also written kena in English) is the traditional flute of the Andes. Traditionally made of cane or wood, it has 6 finger holes and one thumb hole, and is open on both ends or the bottom is half-closed (choked). To produce sound, the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between the chin and lower lip, and blows a stream of air downward, along the axis of the pipe, over an elliptical notch cut into the end. It is normally in the key of G, with G4 being the lowest note. It produces a very &quot;textured&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; timbre because of the length-to-bore ratio of about 16 to 20 (subsequently causing difficulty in the upper register), which is very unlike the tone of the Western concert flute with a length-to-bore ratio of about 38 to 20.

The quenacho (also &quot;kenacho&quot; in English) is a greater, lower-toned version of the quena and made the same way. It is in the key of D, with D4 being the lowest note, a perfect fourth lower than the quena. It produces a very rich timbre because of the length-to-bore ratio of about 25, paradoxically brighter by comparison to the quena.

The quena is mostly used in traditional Andean music. In the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several &quot;nueva canción&quot; musicians. This use was in most cases for particular songs and not as a standard instrument, but some groups such as Illapu and virtuoso player Facio Santillan have used it regularly. In the 1980s and 1990s some post-&quot;nueva canción&quot; rock groups have also incorporated the quena in some of their songs; notably Soda Stereo in &quot;Cuando Pase el Temblor&quot; and Los Enanitos Verdes in &quot;Lamento Boliviano&quot;. The quena is also relatively common in world music.

==Other Andean instruments similar to the quena==
Other Andean flutes include the following:
*The &quot;pinkillu&quot; has the same fingering as the quena, and is similar in appearance and operation to a recorder. Unlike the actual quena, it has an air channel or fipple to conduct the air;
*The &quot;tarka&quot; (or tharqa), which also operates like a recorder but is comparatively shorter and quite angular in shape, requires greater breath, and has a darker, more penetrating sound;
*The &quot;moseño&quot; (originally &quot;mohoseño&quot;), is a long, dual-tube bamboo flute with a deep sound. The auxiliary tube acts as an aeroduct.

<text>Arcola is an offshoot of the record label Warp Records. It was set up in late 2003, and takes its name from the Arcola Theatre, Arcola Street in Dalston, London where Warp held the launch party for the label. It released a number of singles in 2003 and 2004. Arcola marked its return after a 14-year hiatus in January 2018, with new EP&#x27;s by Rian Treanor &amp; 2814.

==Details==
All Arcola releases are 12-inch singles released in a generic sleeve designed by The Designers Republic. Although some artists such as Brothomstates and Milanese are shared by both the Warp and Arcola label, Arcola releases are always more dancefloor-oriented.

<text>Jaca (; in Aragonese: &quot;Chaca&quot; or &quot;Xaca&quot;) is a city of northeastern Spain in the province of Huesca, located near the Pyrenees and the border with France. Jaca is an ancient fort on the Aragón River, situated at the crossing of two great early medieval routes, one from Toulouse to Santiago de Compostela and Pau to Zaragoza. Jaca was the city out of which the County and Kingdom of Aragon developed. It was the first capital of the Kingdom of Aragon until 1096 and also the capital of Jacetania.

==Villages==
Besides Jaca town, there are a number of outlying villages in the municipality of Jaca, including the ski resort of Astún.

==History==
The origins of the city are obscure, but its name is apparently of Iacetani origin, mentioned by Strabo as one of the most celebrated of the numerous small tribes inhabiting the Ebro basin. Strabo adds that their territory lay on the site of the wars in the 1st century BC between Sertorius and Pompey. According to the atlas of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, Jaca was a town where minted coins were made from the second half of the 2nd century BC, a small number of which are now in the British Museum. The coins show an unidentified bearded head to the right with an inscription to the left and also have an image of a dolphin. The reverse depicts a horseman carrying a spear to the right, with an inscription below in Iberian reading &quot;iaka&quot;. In the year 195 BC, the Roman consul Cato the Elder began the conquest of the city, ending in the spring of 194 BC. 

After Roman rule, the Visigothic nobility took over most of Iberia. However, in 720, Huesca is conquered by the Muslims reaching out as far as Sobrarbe. Muslim advances in Europe had a turn of events after the Battle of Tours (732). By that time, the region of Jacetania would remain as a buffer zone in favour of the Carolingian Empire against Muslim dominions. By 799 Aureolo stabilised an independent county which gradually evolved until Ramiro I of Aragon (1035–1063) granted it the title of City and capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. In 1063 it was the site of the Synod of Jaca. As the Aragonese domains expanded to the south, conquering land from Al Andalus, the capital city was moved from Jaca to Huesca in 1096. The loss of capital status did not mean that Jaca lost other urban functions related to its geographical location. Thus, it continued to play its role as a market city and services for its region.

The plagues and fires of the late Middle Ages plunged Jaca into a deep crisis from which it would not emerge until the intervention of Ferdinand the Catholic to form a local government. The bourgeoisie was favored by this situation and many became patrons of artists whose results can be seen especially in the cathedral. The city was consolidated as a military post from which to defend the peninsular kingdoms from a hypothetical French invasion. In this regard, Philip II ordered the construction of several fortresses throughout the Pyrenees, including in 1592 the pentagonal Jaca citadel, designed by the Italian engineer Tibúrcio Spannocchi in the fields that had formed the Burgo Nuevo, the neighborhood built outside the city walls.

During the Middle Ages, Jaca was home to Aragon&#x27;s oldest Jewish community until the 1492 expulsion of the Jews.

On December 12–13 1930 the Jaca uprising, a mutiny whose leaders demanded abolition of the monarchy, was suppressed with some difficulty. It was an early event that preceded the Spanish Civil War.

==Climate==
Jaca has a submediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) bordering a submediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with strong continental influences caused by the city&#x27;s high altitude of . Winters are cool and summers are warm, with hot daytime temperatures but relatively cool nights. There isn&#x27;t any real dry season, but the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The average precipitation is per year. Frost is common and so is snowfall, snow being common from late November to early March. Heavy snowfalls are sporadic and usually occur during cold spells. Jaca&#x27;s average annual temperature is . 


==Main sights==
Jaca boasts several medieval walls and towers surrounding the 11th-century Romanesque Jaca Cathedral.

The Jaca citadel, a fortification dating to the late 16th century, is home to a colony of rock sparrows.

The Diocesan Museum of Jaca (Museum of Medieval Sacred Art) protects Romanesque and Gothic frescos, some of which were found in the most remote locations in the Jaca district.

==Tourism and sports==
Jaca is a tourist destination in the region for summer holidays and winter sports.

Starting in the early 1970s, the city was transformed from being a small provincial and garrison town to become the gateway to a mid-tier mountain sports area with two major winter resorts (Valle de Astun and Candanchu) within a drive of the city.

The accompanying urban and infrastructure development in the 1970s and 1980s was controversial, with many claiming that the town lost a lot of its original charm and authenticity to the interests of developers.

The development experienced by the city, with the construction of a nationally known ice-skating rink (the Pista de Hielo del Pirineo), a small convention centre (the Palacio de Congresos) and countless second homes, had a profound impact on the economy of the Valley (Valle del Aragon), where many of its inhabitants evolved from small-scale subsistence farmera in Jaca and the surrounding villages to become part of a tertiary economy.

Jaca was the host city of the 1981 and 1995 Winter Universiades. The city also hosted the 2007 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival. Its popularity for winter sports was a motivating factor in the city&#x27;s failed bids for the 1998 Winter Olympics, 2002 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Nagano, Salt Lake City and Vancouver. It was again the applicant city of Spain for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but the bid failed again when it was not selected as a candidate city and the games were ultimately awarded to Sochi.

<text>Švitrigaila (before 1370 – 10 February 1452; sometimes spelled Svidrigiello) was the Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1430 to 1432. He spent most of his life in largely unsuccessful dynastic struggles against his cousins Vytautas and Sigismund Kęstutaitis.

==Early life and Vitebsk rebellion==
Švitrigaila was born to Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife Uliana of Tver. His date of birth is unknown, but it is believed that he was the youngest or second youngest son of Algirdas. He first appeared in politics in October 1382 when he witnessed the Treaty of Dubysa between his elder brother Jogaila and the Teutonic Knights. Historians believe that would indicate that at the time Švitrigaila was no younger than 12 which would put his date of birth sometime before 1370. In a complaint submitted to the Council of Florence, Švitrigaila claimed that he and Jogaila were favorite sons of Algirdas. Before his death in 1377, Algirdas transferred his throne to Jogaila but made him swear to make Švitrigaila his heir. Jogaila&#x27;s representatives did not outright deny the arrangement and instead claimed that it had been modified by mutual agreement between the brothers.

In 1386, as part of the Christianization of Lithuania and union between Poland and Lithuania, Švitrigaila together with his brothers was baptized in the Roman Catholic rite in Kraków. His baptismal name was Bolesław.

Despite numerous power struggles in Lithuania, including rebellion by Andrei of Polotsk, conquest of the Principality of Smolensk, and the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–92), Švitrigaila does not appear in politics until 1392. After the death of his mother Uliana of Tver, Jogaila appointed falconer Fedor Vesna regent of the Principality of Vitebsk. This angered Švitrigaila and he rebelled against his brother. Vytautas, who just concluded the Ostrów Agreement to become Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Skirgaila gathered an army and captured Drutsk, Orsha, and then Vitebsk. Švitrigaila was captured and sent to Kraków. He was not held in a prison as demonstrated by the fact that he headed a commission for demarcation of the Lithuanian–Prussian border in 1393, but at the same time he had no territories.

==Struggle against Vytautas (1392–1430)==

===Defection to Hungary===
Accounts on Švitrigaila&#x27;s activities in 1394–1397 are conflicting. Older historians followed Jan Długosz and claimed that he escaped to the Teutonic Knights in Prussia right after the capture of Vitebsk, but Polish historian Aleksander Narcyz Przezdziecki disproved it. Probably around 1396 or 1397, Švitrigaila and Fedor, son of Liubartas who was ousted from Volhynia near the conclusion of the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, escaped from Kraków to Duchy of Cieszyn, fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia, and from there to the court of Sigismund of Luxemburg. Švitrigaila contacted the Teutonic Knights, a long-standing enemy of Lithuania, and proposed an alliance against Vytautas. It was not an unprecedented move: Vytautas had done the same in 1382 and 1390 when he fought with Jogaila. However, the Knights concluded the Treaty of Salynas with Vytautas in October 1398 and Švitrigaila lost any hopes of an armed rebellion. He reconciled with Vytautas and received Navahrudak and a portion of Podolia not ruled by Spytek of Melsztyn.

In 1399, Švitrigaila survived the disastrous Battle of the Vorskla River against the Golden Horde. Spytek of Melsztyn was killed in the battle and Švitrigaila received his lands in Podolia.

===Defection to Prussia===
In January 1401, Vytautas and Lithuanian nobles concluded the Pact of Vilnius which confirmed that after Vytautas&#x27; death Lithuania would be ruled by Jogaila and his heirs. That crushed Švitrigaila&#x27;s ambition to one day become the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Chronicler Jan Długosz hinted that the Pact was in part motivated by the desire to contain growing influence and ambition of Švitrigaila. According to Johann von Posilge, Švitrigaila was forced to sign the Pact. However, just a month later he wrote to Siemowit IV of Masovia trying to form an alliance against Vytautas.

Vytautas-instigated the First Samogitian Uprising against the Teutonic Knights started in March 1401. In August, Yury of Smolensk and his father-in-law Oleg II of Ryazan started a rebellion to retake the Principality of Smolensk. Švitrigaila decided to take advantage of these conflicts. In January 1402, instead of traveling to the wedding of Jogaila and Anna of Cilli, Švitrigaila, disguised as a merchant, traveled to Marienburg, the capital of the Teutonic Knights. On 2 March 1402, he concluded a treaty with the Knights which in essence confirmed the Treaty of Salynas. In July 1402, the Knights, including Švitrigaila, invaded Lithuania and marched towards Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, however Vytautas learned of the planned treason and executed six city residents. The Knights did not dare to lay the siege and returned to Prussia. Vytautas wanted to concentrate on the rebellion in Smolensk and peace negotiations started in summer 1403. The truce was signed in December 1403 and the Peace of Raciąż in May 1404. The Knights received territorial concessions in Samogitia while Švitrigaila received Podolia (though the territory was &quot;de facto&quot; governed by Piotr Szafraniec), Zhydachiv, and an annual sum of 1,400 marks from the Wieliczka Salt Mine from Jogaila and the Principalities of Briansk, Chernigov, and Trubetsk from Vytautas.

===Defection to Moscow and imprisonment===
For a few years, Švitrigaila was loyal to Vytautas and helped to subdue Smolensk and negotiate with the Teutonic Knights regarding the Dobrzyń Land. Švitrigaila&#x27;s new territories were by the border with the Grand Duchy of Moscow which began to emerge as the main rival to Lithuania. He decided to rebel against Vytautas once again but this time with the help of Vasily I of Moscow, who was also Vytautas&#x27; son-in-law. In May 1409, Švitrigaila with a great number of dukes and boyars defected to Moscow. Vasily I rewarded Švitrigaila with Vladimir, Volokolamsk, Pereslavl, Rzhev, half of Kolomna. Vytautas immediately gathered an army, including 5,000 Polish men commanded by Zbigniew of Brzezia and one flag of Teutonic Knights, and marched towards Russia. The two armies met on the Ugra River but did not engage in battle. The Lithuanian army was exhausted and lacked food while Russians needed to defend from an invasion of the Golden Horde, commanded by Edigu. A peace was concluded which treated Ugra River as the border between Russia and Lithuania.

It is not known what happened to Švitrigaila after the standoff at the Ugra River. According to a contemporary Teutonic report, Vytautas demanded that as a condition for peace Vasily I would surrender Švitrigaila, but Vasily I claimed that he had escaped to the Golden Horde. The report further elaborated that Švitrigaila received marriage proposal to a daughter of a Tatar Emir. However, in June 1409, Švitrigaila was back at the court of Vytautas. Restless, he again attempted to conspire with the Teutonic Knights, but the letters were intercepted. Švitrigaila was arrested and imprisoned in various locations until he was settled in the Kremenets Castle, the only brick castle in Volhynia. There he had at least some freedom as he signed land donations.

===Escape to Hungary and reconciliation===
Švitrigaila remained imprisoned for nine years until his escape was organized by Dashko Feodorovich Ostrogski, Aleksander Nos, and Alexander of Smolensk. During the night of 24 March 1418 the conspirators, with 500 men, invaded the Kremenets Castle (the gate was opened by two of their men who infiltrated castle security), freed Švitrigaila, and marched to Lutsk. The city was captured and Švitrigaila received support from local nobility, but instead of waging a war, he retreated to Wallachia. For a while, he lived with Ernest, Duke of Austria and Sigismund, King of Hungary.

At the same time, an anti-Vytautas rebellion broke out in Samogitia. The Teutonic Knights wanted to use that against Lithuania and invited Švitrigaila to overthrow Vytautas. Instead, Švitrigaila reconciled with Jogaila during a meeting between King Sigismund and Jogaila in Košice in May 1419. Švitrigaila received Opoczno and restored annual income from the Wieliczka Salt Mine. However, that did not reconcile him with Vytautas. After the failed mediation by King Sigismund between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights, both Poland and Lithuania began preparing for the Gollub War. Polish nobles understood the importance of neutralizing Švitrigaila, who continued to receive Teutonic offers for an alliance, and sent a delegation to persuade Vytautas to forgive his cousin. Eventually, Vytautas relented and the official agreement was concluded in August 1420. Švitrigaila swore loyalty and received Principalities of Briansk, Chernigov, Trubetsk, and Novgorod-Seversk.

After the reconciliation, Švitrigaila actively participated in state politics. In the spring of 1421, he won a battle against the Tatars; in the summer of 1422, he participated in the Gollub War and subsequent Treaty of Melno; in 1424–1426, he was sent to a diplomatic mission to Riga; he also took part in Vytautas&#x27; raid against Novgorod.

==Struggle against Sigismund==
===Grand Duke of Lithuania===
Upon Vytautas&#x27;s death in October 1430, Lithuanian nobles unilaterally elected Švitrigaila as the Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horodło of 1413, where Lithuanians promised not to elect a new Grand Duke without the approval of the Kingdom of Poland. In order to receive Ruthenian votes Švitrigaila granted equal rights to Catholic and Orthodox nobles – it was one lasting achievement of his brief reign. The Polish nobility, led by Zbigniew Oleśnicki, were outraged and demanded that Švitrigaila acknowledged his fealty to his brother Jogaila, King of Poland. Švitrigaila refused and professed full independence. The conflict was further complicated by territorial disputes in Podolia and Volhynia, that according to an agreement in 1411 were to be ruled by Lithuania only for the lifetime of Vytautas.

Švitrigaila fought against the Polish–Lithuanian forces at Lutsk in Volhynia, and at the same time started organizing a wider anti-Polish coalition. In June 1431, an agreement was reached with the Teutonic Knights: the Knights declared war and without much opposition invaded Poland, whose forces were engaging Švitrigaila in Volhynia. In September a two-year truce between Poland, Lithuania, and the Teutonic Knights was signed in Staryi Chortoryisk. It was more favorable to Poland and it is not clear why Švitrigaila agreed to it. However, the truce did not solve the underlying dispute. The war turned into diplomatic struggle: Poland sought to turn Lithuanian nobles against Švitrigaila.

===Coup and civil war===

Conspirators, led by Sigismund Kęstutaitis, attacked Švitrigaila and his escort, who were staying in Ashmyany for the night of 31 August 1432. Švitrigaila managed to escape to Polotsk while his pregnant wife Anna of Tver was detained. It is unclear what groups supported Sigismund and why. Possibly Lithuanian nobles were dissatisfied with favors Švitrigaila showed to Orthodox dukes, but before the coup no such opposition manifested itself. Sigismund, who did not play a major role in Lithuanian politics before the coup and who initially supported Švitrigaila, became the Grand Duke and resumed policy of union with Poland.

Lithuania was divided into two camps: supporters of Sigismund (Lithuanian lands, Samogitia, Podlaskie, Hrodna, Minsk) to the west, and supporters of Švitrigaila (Polotsk, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Kiev [Kyiv], Volhynia) to the east. Three years of devastating hostilities began. Švitrigaila enlisted help from Sayid Ahmad I, Khan of the Golden Horde. Both sides suffered heavy losses (see Battle of Ashmyany) and final victory in the Battle of Wiłkomierz went to Sigismund in 1435. After the defeat, Švitrigaila fled to Polotsk. Losing his influence in the Slavic principalities, he attempted to reconcile with Poland in September 1437: he would rule lands that still supported him (chiefly Kiev and Volhynia) and after his death the territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, Polish Senate did not ratify this treaty under strong protest from Sigismund. Švitrigaila retreated to Wallachia in 1438.

==Later years and death==
In 1440, Sigismund Kęstutaitis was assassinated by nobles who supported Švitrigaila, and Švitrigaila returned to rule Podolia and Volhynia. At the age of 70 (or 85, according to some sources), he was too old to resume his struggle for the Lithuanian throne and more importantly had no support from the Council of Lords led by Jonas Goštautas, that in June 1440 elected Casimir Jagiellon, brother of Polish King Władysław III as Grand Duke. Shortly before his death in Lutsk in 1452, he bequeathed all his possessions in Podolia and Volynia to the Lithuanian state.

Švitrigaila died on 10 February 1452 in Lutsk and was buried at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.

<text>Gary Rowell (born 6 June 1957) is an English former footballer—most notably with Sunderland—and a current local (North East) newspaper columnist.

Born in Sunderland and raised in Seaham, he left school and joined Sunderland as an apprentice in 1972. His career was split (1972–84) between playing as a striker (albeit often coming from deep) and in midfield. He scored 102 goals for &quot;The Rokerites&quot; in all competitions, surpassing the previous record post-war goalscorer, Len Shackleton, who had scored 101 goals. Rowell&#x27;s record stood until it in turn was beaten by Kevin Phillips in the early 21st century.

Gary was a talented player who many supporters felt was destined to become &#x27;fully&#x27; capped by England. Unfortunately, his career was severely disrupted by a serious knee injury that he sustained during a game against Leyton Orient (in which he had already scored the winning goal) during March 1979. Following a lengthy recovery, Rowell continued to score goals in the First Division at a healthy strike-rate, but he always looked likely to struggle to maintain full fitness for the whole of any season.

Sunderland manager Len Ashurst forced Rowell out of Roker Park as part of a huge rebuilding plan in 1984, part of the slide which would ultimately take them to the third tier of English football for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Rowell moved to Norwich City, but never recreated his goalscoring exploits because of a knee injury he picked up on his first pre season tour with the Canaries. The injury would ultimately blight the rest of his career, although he did go on to play for Middlesbrough, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Carlisle United before finishing his career with Burnley.

Rowell is remembered by Sunderland supporters for scoring a hat-trick for Sunderland in a 4–1 win away at local rivals Newcastle United on 24 February 1979. Describing the match later, he said &quot;When we hit the 4th I had a chat with Kevin Arnott about whether to try for a fifth or just to take the piss. We decided to take the piss.&quot;

He now works as a radio summariser on Real Radio, commentating on all Sunderland games. He previously spent seven years covering Sunderland&#x27;s games on Metro Radio and Magic 1152.

In 2005, he was voted Sunderland&#x27;s all-time cult hero on the television programme Football Focus, whilst in 2006, Sunderland fanzine &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; voted him their Best Player of the 1980s. Such accolades reflect his almost &#x27;iconic&#x27; status on Wearside, which has led him to recently be inducted in to the Sunderland A.F.C hall of fame.

<text>The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, also spelled &quot;Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve&quot; (), is a motor racing circuit on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the venue for the FIA Formula One Canadian Grand Prix. It has previously hosted the World Sportscar Championship, the Champ Car World Series (Grand Prix of Montreal), the NASCAR Pinty’s Series, the NASCAR Nationwide Series (NAPA Auto Parts 200), and the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series.

==Formula One at Montréal==

The Canadian Grand Prix was first held at the circuit in 1978, where hometown hero Gilles Villeneuve (1950–1982) won for Scuderia Ferrari. The Grand Prix quickly became a mainstay of the Formula One calendar, with the race taking place in Montreal for the next thirty years. Once held in late September, the event was moved to its present location on the calendar of mid-June in 1982, to provide a warmer, more pleasant race weekend. Many great races have occurred at the track over the years, cementing its reputation as a truly unpredictable venue. However, the race was dropped from the 2009 Formula One calendar and replaced with the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after running over two decades uninterrupted. On November 27, 2009, Quebec&#x27;s officials and Canadian Grand Prix organizers announced a settlement with Formula One Administration and signed a new five-year contract spanning the 2010–2014 seasons.

The 2011 edition of the race was the longest World Championship Grand Prix ever at over 4 hours in length, due to a lengthy rain delay.

==Circuit history==

Originally named the Île Notre-Dame Circuit, the circuit was built and finished in 1978. In what has proven to be the venue&#x27;s main event over the decades, the FIA Formula One Canadian Grand Prix had been part of the Formula One World Championship for 10 years. It was previously held at Mosport Park near Toronto on 8 occasions and in 1968 and 1970, the Mont-Tremblant circuit in Quebec. With safety concerns with Mosport blighting the 1977 event, it was decided to move the race to the new circuit in Montréal. In 1982, it was renamed in honour of Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, father of Jacques Villeneuve, following his death earlier in the year. The circuit is located in Parc Jean-Drapeau in the city of Montréal. The park is named after the mayor of Montréal who was responsible for the organization of Expo 67.

The race circuit is on Notre Dame Island, a man-made island in the St. Lawrence River most of which was originally built up for the Expo in 1967. Saint Helen&#x27;s Island to the northwest was artificially enlarged for the Expo &#x27;67 fairgrounds and a prominent remnant of the fair, the Biosphere is located adjacent to the circuit. Almost half of the track—from the hairpin turn until after the pit area—runs alongside the &quot;Olympic Basin&quot;, a huge rectangular basin which was created for the rowing and canoeing events of Montréal&#x27;s 1976 Summer Olympics.

Over the winter of 2018–19 the paddock—in use since 1988—was demolished and replaced with the current structure.

==Circuit layout==

Barriers run close to the circuit and many experienced drivers have been caught out by them. A particularly famous part of the circuit is the wall on the outside of the exit of the final chicane before the start/finish straight. In 1999 the wall, which bears the name &quot;Bienvenue au Québec&quot; (&quot;Welcome to Quebec&quot;) giving it the nickname &quot;Mur du Québec&quot; (&quot;Quebec Wall&quot;), ended the race of three Formula One World Champions, Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve along with FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta. Since then the wall has been nicknamed &quot;The Wall of Champions&quot;. In subsequent years, 2009 world champion Jenson Button (2005) and four time World Champion Sebastian Vettel (2011, during free practice) also became victims of the wall.

For the first few years of its existence, the track consisted of technical, medium speed chicanes and a relatively low overall lap speed. However, over the years the circuit has transformed into a power track, with straight line speed being very much a priority. Between 1986 and 1988 (with a one-year hiatus occurring in 1987), the pitlane and start-finish straight were relocated from the hairpin to the exit of the fast right-left chicane, which became the final corner. After the fatal crashes of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola earlier in the year, in 1994 a chicane was inserted between the Casino corner and the hairpin to decrease top speed. The 1996 race saw both the chicane and the Casino corner removed and the layout changed; the run from the hairpin at the bottom of the circuit was turned into a straight.

In 2002 the exit of the pitlane was changed to make exiting the pitlane safer for drivers. This also shortened the length of the circuit.

Changes made in 2005 to the curbs on the final chicane were controversial amongst drivers in the run-up to the Grand Prix. The curbs were made higher and more difficult for the drivers to see, making it even more challenging.

On June 23, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that the city of Montréal had awarded exclusive rights to stage the two allowed race weekends on the track to Normand Legault, promoter of the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix. The deal was for 2007 to 2011, with an option for 2012 to 2016. Legault decided to replace the Champ Car race with races from the Grand American Road Racing Association&#x27;s Rolex Series and NASCAR Nationwide Series, respectively – the latter series&#x27; first race north of the Canada-United States border. On August 4, 2007, Kevin Harvick made history by winning the first NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in what was one of the most controversial NASCAR races ever, as Robby Gordon claimed to have won the race. The NASCAR races have affected the circuit layout. An expansion of the pit lane took place, since a NASCAR pit lane must accommodate a minimum of 43 cars. The 2008 race made history as the first NASCAR race to run on rain tires.

In 2017, due to the higher cornering speeds of the new Formula One cars and the new safety requirements imposed by the FIA, the circuit had additional Tecpro barriers installed, following the removal of older tire barriers by May 2017. With the 2017 technical regulations, experts predicted the F1 cars to be quicker by three to five seconds a lap in June at Montréal. 2017&#x27;s F1 event also saw a change to the exit of the last chicane (the Wall of Champions) with its angle modified, because the FIA found it was dangerous.
===Senna &#x27;S&#x27; turns===
The complex of turns one and two has become known as the Senna &#x27;S&#x27;. From a bird&#x27;s eye view turns one and two together can represent an &#x27;S&#x27; shape.

===Pont de la Concorde corner===
The very fast Pont de la Concorde corner (Turn 8) is after the bridge underpass and is known as a &#x27;quick kink&#x27; before Turn 9 and the rush to a passing zone at the Hairpin curve.

===The Hairpin Curve===
Turn 10 at Île Notre-Dame is probably the best example of a 180° hairpin turn design with full wheel lock during F1 competition. The various lines taken entering the hairpin curve can lead to overtaking on the apex, or exit during race competition. Braking too late can see cars offline into the runoff area, and some spinning in front of packed grandstands. Many overtakes can be seen at this location due to engine differences and drivers&#x27; skills.

===Wall of Champions===

Entering turns 12 &amp; 13 drivers encounter one of the best passing zones, completing the long straight after the hairpin. Many duels have been seen exiting turn 12 with some race cars deciding to cut corner 13 into the run-off, with many going a bit &#x27;too hot&#x27; apexing Turn 13 and not exiting intact. Turn 14 is dubbed the &quot;Wall of Champions&quot; after three former Drivers&#x27; World Champions found the outside wall in the 1999 race. In Formula 1 races, a car damaged after gracing the Wall of Champions brings out a Safety Car or VSC. The exit barrier is poignantly marked with advertising by Tourisme Québec (&quot;Bonjour Québec&quot;; “Bienvenue au Québec” in previous years) during the F1 event.

==Other circuit activities==
As part of Parc Jean-Drapeau, the Circuit is open to visitors, between races, for walking, running, biking, in-line skating, and driving. During the few days of the Grand Prix, Notre Dame Island is one of the noisiest places in Montréal. Other times of the year, it is one of the quietest, being located in the middle of a river, on an island filled with greenery and animals, joggers and cyclists. However, on June 4, 2009, administration of Notre Dame Island has forbidden the access of competitive cyclists to the circuit, justifying this as a security measure to avoid the increasing injuries that occurred between year 2008 and 2009. A total of 27 injuries have been reported. The ban on cyclists has since been lifted due to protests.

==Lap records==

As the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve serves as host to different racing series, it is possible to directly compare different race series&#x27; lap times.

In 2006, the last time Champ Car and F1 ran on the same track, Formula One was 5 to 7 seconds faster than Champ Car. The fastest lap in the Formula One race was 1:15.841 by Kimi Räikkönen, while Sébastien Bourdais&#x27;s fastest lap was 1:22.325 in the Champ Car race.

2007 NASCAR Busch Series driver Patrick Carpentier racing in the NAPA Auto Parts 200, posted a pole time of 1:42.086. The pole time at the 2012 NAPA Auto Parts 200 was 1:40.865 by Alex Tagliani.

The track record for the Rolex Sports Car Series is 1:32.620. The time was set by Scott Pruett driving for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Daytona Prototype class in 2010.

The fastest ever lap around the circuit was set by Sebastian Vettel with a time of 1:10.240 set in qualifying (Q3) for the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix. As this time was set during qualifying, it is not recognized as an official lap record. Lewis Hamilton set the previous lap record with a time of 1:11.459 during qualifying for the 2017 Canadian Grand Prix, earning him pole position. This was Hamilton&#x27;s 65th pole position which put him level with Ayrton Senna in the F1 history books. After qualifying, Hamilton was awarded a helmet that belonged to his hero as a celebration. This helmet was sent by Senna&#x27;s family and was awarded to an emotional Hamilton in front of the crowd.

As of June 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve are listed as:

<text>Lilian Jackson Braun (June 20, 1913June 4, 2011) was an American writer known for her light-hearted series of &quot;The Cat Who...&quot; mystery novels. &quot;The Cat Who&quot; books features newspaper journalist Jim Qwilleran and his two Siamese cats, Koko (short for Kao K&#x27;o Kung) and Yum Yum, first in an unnamed midwestern American city and then in the fictitious small town of Pickax located in Moose County &quot;400 miles north of everywhere&quot;. Although never explicitly located in the books, the towns, counties, and lifestyles portrayed in the series are generally accepted to be modeled after Bad Axe, Michigan, where Braun resided with her husband until the mid-1980s.

==Life and career==
Born Lilian Jackson in the Willimansett neighborhood of Chicopee, Massachusetts, to Charles and Clara Ward Jackson, she began her writing career as a teenager, contributing sports poetry to the &quot;Detroit News&quot;. She went on to write advertising copy for many Detroit department stores. At the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; she worked 30 years as the &quot;Good Living&quot; editor and retired in 1978. Lilian married her second husband, Earl Bettinger in 1979.

Braun wrote a series of three mystery novels published to critical acclaim from 1966 to 1968: &quot;The Cat Who Could Read Backwards&quot;, &quot;The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern&quot;, and &quot;The Cat Who Turned On and Off&quot;. In 1986 the Berkley Publishing Group continued the series, and introduced Braun to a new generation, by publishing &quot;The Cat Who Saw Red&quot; as a paperback original. During the next two years, Berkley released four more &quot;Cat Who&quot; novels in paperback and reprinted all three from the 1960s. The series rose to the top of some bestseller lists; it reached number two on the New York Times Best Seller list with its 23rd volume &quot;The Cat Who Smelled a Rat&quot; in 2001. The 29th and last completed novel in the series, &quot;The Cat Who Had 60 Whiskers&quot; was published by Penguin Group in January 2007. Like many writers of her generation, Braun was an admitted technophobe; she wrote all of her books in long hand and then typed them herself. Many of her books have been published as audiobooks narrated by George Guidall, Mason Adams, Christopher Ragland and Theodore Bikel.

Little was known about Braun, who was protective of her private life. Publishers long gave the incorrect birth year of 1916; she was three years older, which remained unknown until she gave her true age during a 2005 interview with the &quot;Detroit News&quot;. Finally she lived in Tryon, North Carolina, with her second husband of 32 years, Earl Bettinger, and their two cats. Each of her books from 1990 to 2007 is dedicated to &quot;Earl Bettinger, the Husband Who ...&quot;.

Braun died from a lung infection in June 2011, at the Hospice House of the Carolina Foothills in Landrum, South Carolina. She was preceded in death by her first husband, Louis Paul Braun, a sister, Florence Jackson, and a brother, Lloyd Jackson. Earl A. Bettinger (born November 24, 1923) died at the age of 96 on July 20, 2020.

== Legacy ==
In June 2022, Mystery Writers of America (MWA) announced the establishment of the Lilian Jackson Braun Award, to be awarded to the best contemporary cozy mystery book in a modern day setting. Braun left a bequest to MWA that enabled them to fund new projects and programs and MWA chose to honor her career and legacy with the award.

The Columbus Library in Columbus, North Carolina opens its new Lilian Jackson Braun and Earl Bettinger Music Garden June 10, 2023.

<doc id="947550" wikidata="Q1014779" url="?curid=947550" title="Burgan field">
<text>The Burgan field is an oil field situated in the desert of southeastern Kuwait. Burgan field can also refer to the Greater Burgan—a group of three closely spaced fields, which includes, in addition to Burgan field, the much smaller Magwa and Ahmadi fields. Greater Burgan is the world&#x27;s largest sandstone oil field, and the second-largest overall, after Ghawar in Saudi Arabia. The Burgan field is located on the coast of the Persian Gulf, which played a huge part in the creation of this prominent reservoir formation many million years ago.

==Discovery and geology==
A natural surface Petroleum seep above the Burgan field was known to humankind since neolithic time, bituminous material from a reed boat discovered in As-Sabiyah/North Kuwait and dated 5000 BC have been traced back to this seep. The subsurface reservoirs of the Burgan oil field were discovered in February, 1938. The US and UK-owned Kuwait Oil Company began commercial oil production at Burgan in 1946.

The Greater Burgan, a wider area around Burgan, is the world largest sandstone (clastic) oil field with the total surface area of about 1000 km2. It includes three producing subfields: Burgan itself (500 km2), Magwa (180 km2) and Ahmadi (140 km2). The Burgan field&#x27;s structure is an anticlinal dome having an elliptical shape and transected by numerous radial faults. Both Magwa and Ahmadi are located on smaller, subsidiary domes north of Burgan.

The oil is contained in the four main horizons of Cretaceous age: Wara (sandstone), Mauddud (limestone), Burgan Third Sand (3S) and Burgan Fourth Sand (4S). Burgan Third Sand is in turn subdivided into Third Sand Upper (3SU), Third Sand Middle (3SM) and Third Sand Lower (3SL). Historically the production has come mainly from the 3SM unit. By 1992 the second and third sand units had been swept by water.

== Stratigraphy ==
The Burgan Oil Field is made up of three main subsurface structures known as the Magwa, Ahmadi, And Burgan formation. The deeper reservoirs, namely the Lower Cretaceous Ratawi and Minagish limestones and the Jurassic Marrat Formation also contain significant oil reserves but are less substantial. The Magwa and Ahmadi formation are separated from the Burgan formation by a normal fault cutting horizontally down through the whole structure. This is known as the Burgan Graben. The role of tectonic stresses that have affected this region in Mesozoic and Cenozoic times also play a part in much of the faultings seen in the formation. Looking closer at the Burgan field the formation is made up of several radial faults that help trap the petroleum content in the formation. These faults and the Burgan graben are what cause the compartmentalization of the reservoir. This compartmentalization makes for great petroleum play and holds it in place well over a long period of time. The source rock that caps this formation is known as the Mauddad Limestone.( the above diagrams help give you a better visual on the formation as a whole)

The Paleo environment of the Greater Burgan Field suggest the field began constructing in the lower and upper Burgan sand based on a fluvial system accommodated by transgressive coastline movements over time. Following the Burgan Formation, the Mauddud Limestone Formation (source Rock) began forming. The Mauddud formation is made up of shallow marine, bioclast wackestone, grainstone, and shoal surrounded by lagoonal dolomite. Lastly, the Wara formation is created by a fluvial system exposed to bio clastic dolomite known as the wara shales. These shales were formed during the falling RSL. Finishing the Wara formation the fluvial valleys are filled with tidal estuaries caused by transgressive and RSL high stand. The formation is capped off by the Ahmadi Cap rock.

Attempts to find deeper oil plays have been made. In 1951 discovery of the Berriasian-age Minagish Oolite Limestone in Burgan was made along with the Jurassic carbonate at Magwa and both proved to be holding oil. However, production did not make way from these subsurface discoveries.

==Oil reserves, production capacity and estimated lifetime==
&quot;The reserves and production data for Burgan are shrouded in a cloud of secrecy, uncertainty, and controversy.&quot;

Burgan&#x27;s total potential production of recoverable oil has been estimated as between 66 and 75 billion barrels, plus perhaps 70 trillion cubic ft. of natural gas. Bloomberg estimated remaining reserves of 55 billion barrels as of 2005. Cumulative production through 1996 was estimated by a consulting firm at around 28 billion barrels of oil. 

Burgan&#x27;s production capacity stood at in 2005. It was the fourth most productive oilfield worldwide in 2013, per 
Oil Patch Asia. This was lower than it had been in the past—it reached as high as in 1972. The actual oil production from the field in 2005 was between 1,300,000 and 1,700,000 barrels per day. The International Energy Agency then predicted an output of in 2020 and in 2030. In 2005, the Kuwait Oil Co. estimated a remaining life of 30 to 40 years for Burgan, at a production rate of about 1.7 million barrels a day.

In 2010 the Chief Executive of the Kuwait Oil Company said that Burgan produced half of Kuwait’s oil.

The possibilities of deeper plays below the known Burgan oil &amp; gas resource appear to be under-explored.

==1st Gulf War==

In 1991, retreating Iraqi soldiers set Burgan Field on fire during the 1st Gulf War in a scorched earth tactic. Smoke plumes from the Greater Burgan oil field extended 50 kilometers in width on any given day, and 2.5 km thick. From satellite observations the plume appeared like a black snake in the desert that extended parallel to the Persian Gulf. The Red Adair Service and Marine Company extinguished 117 of the burning well fires, while the Canadian company Safety Boss set the pace with 180 wells extinguished. Declassified 1991 CIA documents claimed that despite the destruction there was no significant depletion of the oil reserves and drop in production capacity at Burgan field. Three gathering stations were, however, too badly damaged to repair.

The 1st Marine Division destroyed 60 Iraqi tanks in a battle that took place near the Burgan oil field.

<text>Grafham Water is an biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) north of Perry, Huntingdonshire. It was designated an SSSI in 1986. It is a reservoir with a circumference of about , is deep at maximum, and is the eighth largest reservoir in England by volume and the third largest by area at . An area of at the western end is a nature reserve managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.

The lake was created by building an earth and concrete dam, constructed by W. &amp; C. French in 1965, and water is extracted and processed at an adjacent Anglian Water treatment plant before being piped away as drinking water. It was shown from the air, before it opened, in &#x27;Look at Life (film series)&#x27; &#x27; 1965 episode, &#x27;Will Taps Run Dry ?&#x27;, narrated by Tim Turner.

The reservoir was immediately colonised by wildlife and a nature reserve was created at the western side of the reservoir. The nature reserve contains semi-natural ancient (at least 400 years old) woodlands and more recent plantation woodlands, grasslands and wetland habitats such as reedbeds, willow and open water. The reservoir has nationally important numbers of wintering great crested grebes, tufted ducks and coots, and of moulting mute swans in late summer. A pond has a population of the nationally uncommon warty newt.

Water is obtained by pumping water from the River Great Ouse nearby. There are two pumping stations associated with the reservoir. One is located just behind the dam, the other at Offord Cluny alongside the River Great Ouse. At times of high potential flood risk, Grafham Water treatment works can increase the amount of water it takes up to maximum capacity to help reduce the risk of flooding along the river.

As of January 2011, it was the only site in England, and the first in the UK, to harbour the invasive killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus).

Grafham Water is popular for a range of leisure activities including sailing, fly fishing and cycling. In 2019, a live-action gaming centre, Rumble Live Action Gaming, was opened in the woodland arenas on the edge of the reservoir.

<text>The National Museum of Prehistory (NMP; ) is located in Taitung City, Taitung County, Taiwan.

==History==
In 1980, during the construction of the South-Link Line, building work uncovered prehistoric remains on the Beinan Site (卑南遺址). Many slate coffins and artifacts were discovered, and after a proposal by the Taitung City Government, construction of Taitung Station was halted. For 10 years, a National Taiwan University-led team excavated the site and uncovered over 1,500 burials and tens of thousands of artifacts. The site is widely regarded as the most important site of the mid-Neolithic age in Taiwan, and was then later transformed into the Beinan Cultural Park.

An outdoor museum was proposed and approved in 1990. Trial operations began on July 10, 2001, and the museum officially opened on August 17, 2002.

The museum underwent renovation starting on 31 May 2020.

==Architecture==
The museum was designed by American architect Michael Graves and is situated on a parcel of land.

The museum is divided into several sections, including:
* Sun Square
* Mountain Square
* Administrative Building
* Scenic Garden
* Children&#x27;s Play Area
* The Maze
* Water Fountain Show
* Bird Singing Square
* Sightseeing Hill.

==Exhibitions==
* Natural History of Taiwan designed by MET Studio, London
* Prehistory of Taiwan
* Indigenous Peoples of Taiwan designed by MET Studio, London

==Transportation==
The museum is accessible within walking distance from Kangle Station of the Taiwan Railways.

<text>LGS standing for Le Groupe Swing is a Canadian néo-trad band of Franco-Ontarian origins. The band started as Swing before change of name in 2017. The two main members of Swing are Michel Bénac and Jean-Philippe Goulet.

==Biography==
===Michel Bénac===
Singer and musician, Michel Bénac, is a Franco-Ontarian and the main singer for Swing. He was born in Ottawa, Ontario and still lives in the same city. Michel’s mother is Louise, his father is Michel Bénac and he also has a brother named Christian Mathurin and a sister Jocelynne Bénac. Michel Benac Jr. was a voice student of Cantor Stephen Chaiet of the NATS (National Association of Teachers of Singing of America).

===Jean-Philippe Goulet===
The other musician and singer for Swing is Jean-Philippe Goulet. He was born in Rimouski, Quebec. Goulet, a multi-instrumentalist, played guitar, keyboards and violin with Indiscipline and Pole Volt before joining Swing, in which he plays violin and mandolin, as well as singing. He currently lives in Montreal, Quebec. His mother’s name is Jean, his father is André Goulet and he has two sisters, Isabelle and Marie-Claude Goulet.

==History==
Contrary to what the name seems to suggest, its sound is not inspired by swing music, only Franco-Ontarian folklore, which is adapted with techno music. The name comes from the Quebec French term &quot;Swinger&quot; meaning, in this context, &quot;to dance&quot;, and the phrase &quot;Swing la bacaisse dans le fond d&#x27;la boîte à bois!&quot;, a classic, almost cliché expression used in Quebec folk music parties. 

Experienced musician Michel Bénac, met an R’n’B singer, Bobby Lalonde, who was coming back from Nashville to rediscover the French language. They joined forces and created a new sound, the urban folk music. In 1998, the band Swing was created. Michel and Bobby wrote their first single on February 18, 1998: “Ça va brasser”. After five years, Bobby, co-founder of the band, left the group. Shortly after, Jean-Philippe Goulet joined Michel Bénac to continue the urban folk music band Swing. Being in the core of the group, Jean-Philippe discovered his folk music roots and brought his rock and roll influences into the music created. With the multiple trips and passionate meetings, the flavour is still prominent.

==Music==
Swing is composed of a duo, Michel Bénac and Jean-Philippe Goulet. They have travelled across Canada and to many countries abroad. As of 2012, Swing has played over 900 shows and in front of at least 500,000 spectators. Using their voices and the musical sounds from their violin, mandolin and scratch, Swing delivered music that incorporates hip/hop and rock with a touch of traditional music.

In 1999, Swing debuted their first album: &quot;La Chanson S@crée&quot;. This was distributed across Canada. 
On July 1, 2001, on Parliament Hill for Canada’s birthday, Swing played in front of 100,000 spectators, in conjunction with having the show broadcast on live television. This performance gave them a nomination at the Gemini Gala (2002) in the category of Best Performance, and/or Best guest on a program or series. Swing also walked away with four Trille-Or Awards from the “Gala de la chanson et de la musique franco-ontarienne”.

In 2003, they released their second album: &quot;La vie comme ça&quot;. Bobby Lalonde passed the torch to the French musician/singer Jean-Philippe Goulet. Swing was invited to participate in many television shows such as Le Garage, Belle et Bum, Palmarès, etc. They also participated in a telethon to help support the research of childhood diseases and disorders. During that year, Swing also started an interprovincial tour and was seen performing at the “Festival franco-ontarien” as well as the Festival acadien de Caraquet.

The following year, in 2004, Swing was asked to record two songs for the Québec Carnaval, to be added to their compilation album. Shortly after, Swing went on tour in Eastern Europe, visiting Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Once they returned to Canada, they performed in Montreal for Canada’s birthday in front of more than 150,000 spectators. Having more than 75 shows under their belts across the country, the end of the year finished with a nomination at the &quot;Gala de l&#x27;Association québécoise de l&#x27;industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo (ADISQ)&quot; in the category of Best Traditional Album.

In 2005, Swing participated for a second time at the Québec Carnaval and started an international tour in South America. This tour took the band to Colombia, Ecuador and Panama. Swing also got a breakthrough in France during the Festival Les Déferlantes de Cap-Breton. This year, Swing also won three awards at the Gala de la chanson et de la musique franco-ontarienne.

In 2006, Swing continued their international success, and participated at the Festival de la francophonie in Douai as well as the Festival de la Virée francophone in Cherbourg, both located in France. This is when they started thinking about their third album. In 2007, Swing was recognized with two more awards and took the year to create their third album entitled: Tradarnac. In 2008, Swing received a nomination from the Canadian Folk Music Awards in the category of French Album of the Year. In 2009, Swing received a nomination at the Juno’s for the Best French Album of the Year with &quot;Tradarnac&quot;.

In 2011, Michel Bénac continued working on Swing as well as working at Lafab Musique Record company, where he produced the albums himself. During the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, Swing performed at the closing ceremony.

<text>Channel M was a regional television station in England which broadcast to the Greater Manchester area between 2000 and 2012. The station, originally Manchester Student Television, was owned and operated by the GMG Regional Media division of Guardian Media Group.

==Coverage==
Originally an RSL station and the sixth such station to launch, Channel M was at first primarily available free-to-air on analogue terrestrial TV through channel 39 in central and south Manchester. The licence was awarded in 1997 to a group formed by managing director Philip Reevell in 1997, and was the largest city in terms of population to receive an RSL television station at the time.

The channel began broadcasting free-to-air in conjuction with the University of Salford in 2000.

In 2004, Channel M launched on the NTL (now part of Virgin Media) digital cable platform, around Greater Manchester, mid-Lancashire and Cheshire. In April 2006 Channel M launched on digital satellite, the first RSL channel to do so, where it was broadcast free-to-air across Western Europe from Astra 28.2°E and was available on Sky. The channel was removed from Sky channel 203 and Virgin Media channel 878 on 1 September 2010.

The channel became the first broadcaster in the region to offer its programmes on demand via broadband TV on its website, which closed down in late March 2010.

In January 2009, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom announced that Channel M would receive a licence to broadcast on Freeview after digital switchover. On 2 December 2009, Channel M ceased broadcasting on analogue UHF channel 39 (615 MHz). Around this time, the station announced plans to launch on Freeview (digital terrestrial television); broadcasts began on Monday 12 April 2010.

==Programming==
Originally, the main sources of programming were CHUM, Euronews, Channel M&#x27;s in-house productions and the University of Salford with Interference, Gloves Off and Hitting Home, a documentary series. These were made in house by students and staff at the university. Canada-sourced output from CHUM was gradually replaced by in-house Channel M Productions as the station developed more local programming, particularly following the station&#x27;s launch on digital satellite services in April 2006. Major cutbacks saw most of the station&#x27;s non-news output axed in May 2009. Remaining GMG production ceased on 19 March 2010, leaving the station with a schedule of archive and acquired output.

===Salford University input / output===
The history of Channel M can be traced back to the 1996 Broadcasting Act which made provision for six local Restricted Service Licences (RSL) to be issued around the UK. The Manchester RSL was awarded to the University of Salford in 1997 and the channel began life as Manchester Student Television (MSTV), operated by a consortium that included the university and Guardian Media Group, amongst others. All partners started producing content in the autumn of 1998, and this was stockpiled in advance of launch on 14 February 2000. Programming produced by the University of Salford continued to be broadcast on the station until shortly before its closure. Featured programming included &quot;Reel North&quot; (short films), &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; (arts magazine), &quot;Grey Matters&quot; (studio debate), &quot;Hitting Home&quot; (documentary) and &quot;Wildtrack&quot; (wildlife documentary), four of which won a total of nine Royal Television Society awards. &quot;Interference&quot;, an arts show, helped launch careers of presenters and comedians, including OJ Borg and Jason Manford. Gloves Off was a student debate programme that ran for four years.

===Guardian Media Group output===
From 2004 until July 2009, the station&#x27;s flagship programme was the 5pm weeknight edition of &quot;Channel M News&quot; (produced in conjunction with the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;), which later expanded to include breakfast, lunchtime and late evening bulletins as well as a weekly review programme and occasional live specials.

Until May 2009, GMG also produced entertainment programmes including the weekly entertainment round-up &quot;City Life&quot;, the comedy talk-show &quot;Frank Sidebottom&#x27;s Proper Telly Show&quot;, and regular music coverage. Programming such as the weekly music show &quot;City Life Social&quot; and video/computer game review series &quot;Re:Loaded&quot; helped Channel M to gain viewers nationally.
&quot;City Life Social&quot;, &quot;The Great Northern Music Show&quot; and &quot;In Session&quot; were Channel M&#x27;s main music programmes, often presented by Gerry McLaughlin with Clint Boon as a stand-in host. These programmes usually featured live, acoustic or &quot;unplugged&quot; studio and outside broadcast performances from alternative and indie bands.

Former BBC Radio Manchester host, Granada presenter and Factory Records boss Tony Wilson was due to present a Friday evening music and entertainment show called &quot;The New Friday&quot;, produced by former Granada producer and BBC Radio Manchester host Eamonn O&#x27;Neill. However, this programme was postponed after Wilson became terminally ill with cancer. Wilson died in August 2007 and the plans for &quot; The New Friday&quot; were soon abandoned.

&quot;City Life Social&quot; (previously &quot;City Centre Social&quot;) then became the station&#x27;s flagship music show, as Channel M shifted towards a greater focus on live performances within programmes. This policy continued until the music department ceased production in May 2009, shortly after the station announced severe cutbacks in staff and programming.

==Studios==
The channel was originally based at smaller studios in the Triangle shopping mall and the later at the Printworks entertainment complex in Manchester city centre, until Channel M moved to the former Urbis museum in August 2005.

&quot;Channel M News&quot; was initially pre-recorded until live bulletins were launched in May 2006. The studio&#x27;s position on the ground floor of Urbis in Manchester city centre gave a live elevated background shot of the area around Cathedral Gardens and Manchester Victoria railway station.

The station&#x27;s production team were based at the offices of the &quot;Stockport Express&quot; before moving to Urbis in March 2006. In November 2007, Channel M&#x27;s news team moved again to the MEN Media headquarters at Spinningfields, which was used as a secondary studio base for some news bulletins.

The station later moved its in-house transmission and administration facilities from Urbis to GMG Radio&#x27;s headquarters at Laser House in Salford Quays. Studio content produced by Salford University was originally produced at the Adelphi Building in Peru Street, Salford, but later moved to new facilities at MediaCity:UK in Salford Quays.

==Fate==
On 27 April 2009, Channel M&#x27;s then-chief executive Mark Dodson announced that the station was looking to make 41 redundancies from its 74 staff and restrict weekday live programming from four programmes (totalling six hours of output) to one three-hour news magazine programme, broadcast between 4pm and 7pm, in order to cut losses. A company review carried out by the Guardian Media Group before the announcement recommended that the station should focus on news and general sport programming.

Channel M also ceased all of its stand-alone entertainment, sport and features programming as well as the weekday breakfast show (which was, for a short time, replaced by live footage of the area&#x27;s traffic cameras accompanied by a simulcast of Real Radio North West) and the lunchtime and evening news bulletins. News and sport coverage was incorporated into &quot;Channel M Today&quot; which launched on Monday 13 July 2009, broadcast on weekdays from 4pm to 7pm and presented by chief news anchor Andy Crane, alongside a rotating team of sports and features presenters.

In February 2010, the station&#x27;s owners Guardian Media Group were reported to be in talks with staff regarding options for Channel M&#x27;s future after the company sold off 32 of its regional newspaper titles, including the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, to Trinity Mirror for £44.8 million. The following month, the station announced its remaining in-house regional programmes, including the flagship magazine show &quot;Channel M Today&quot;, would cease production by Friday 19 March 2010. 29 of the station&#x27;s 33 staff were made redundant.

Several ex-GMG employees later secured consultancy positions working on Salford University productions at the IMC. The station then broadcast a mix of archived programming, original output from Salford University and simulcasts of Euronews and Real Radio North West, alongside some new programming from independent and third party producers. The station&#x27;s in-house transmission and administration facilities were later based at Laser House in Salford Quays and managed by GMG&#x27;s regional radio division.

By the start of 2012, all remaining local programming had ended, resulting in a schedule consisting of simulcasts of Real Radio North West and Euronews, and acquired programming from The Community Channel.

On 16 April 2012, GMG Radio announced its decision to close Channel M after 12 years of broadcasting. The station&#x27;s owners said UK government plans for localised television services would not allow the station to run a commercially viable service in the future. The channel ceased broadcasting on Freeview the same day, leading to three redundancies.

By 2023, That&#x27;s Media Group, the parent of That&#x27;s TV, had acquired the Freeview capacity that had been created for Channel M and was using it to broadcast music videos.

==Royal Television Society (North West) Awards==
Channel M programmes were short-listed for RTS North West Awards on numerous occasions since 2001 and won a total of eight times - once for GMG-produced output (Andy Crane) and seven times for the University of Salford. In addition to programme awards, the station&#x27;s website won the RTS Best Online award in 2008.

===Programme winners===
* &quot;Hitting Home: Final Clearance&quot; - Best Cable, Satellite or RSL programme (2001); University of Salford for Channel M
* &quot;Channel M&quot; - Best Newcomers (2005) (The RTS were &#x27;unable to split&#x27; the three nominations for the award - GMG reporter Laura Fogg, Salford University presenter Gerry McLaughlin and the production team for &quot;Reel North&quot; - so instead the Society presented a generic award to Channel M. Effectively, all three nominations lost out on an award, even though they all came joint-first).
* &quot;Hitting Home: Displaced&quot; - Best Regional Programme (2005); University of Salford for Channel M
* &quot;Reel North&quot; - Best Regional Programme (2006); University of Salford for Channel M
* &quot;Nigel Hoar &amp; Angela Byrne&quot; - Best Newcomers (2008); University of Salford for Channel M

* &quot;Wildtrack&quot; - Best Low Budget Programme (2011); University of Salford for Channel M

<doc id="947573" wikidata="Q3241700" url="?curid=947573" title="Linus and Lucy">
<text>&quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; is a popular instrumental jazz standard written by American jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. It serves as the main theme tune for the many &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated specials and is named for the two fictional siblings, Linus and Lucy Van Pelt. The jazz standard was originally released on Guaraldi&#x27;s album &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; in 1964, but it gained its greatest exposure as part of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; soundtrack the following year. It is one of the most recognizable pieces by Guaraldi and has gained status as the signature melody of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise. It has also become a popular song on radio stations playing Christmas music during the holidays.

== History ==

The genesis of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; began when &quot;Peanuts&quot; executive producer Lee Mendelson heard Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s hit, &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot;, on the radio while driving his car over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Mendelson then contacted &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason, who put him in touch with Guaraldi. Mendelson believed Guaraldi would be a good fit for a documentary he was working on entitled &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Guaraldi gladly accepted the offer to compose several jazz tunes for the documentary.

Within several weeks, Mendelson received a call from an excited Guaraldi who wanted to play a piece of music he had just written. Mendelson, not wanting his first exposure to the new music to be marred by the poor audio qualities of a telephone, suggested coming over to Guaraldi&#x27;s studio. Guaraldi enthusiastically refused, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve got to play this for someone right now or I&#x27;ll explode!&quot; He then began playing the then untitled &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; for Mendelson, who agreed the song was perfect for Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters.

Reflecting on the song in 2008, Mendelson said, &quot;it just blew me away. It was so right, and so perfect, for Charlie Brown and the other characters. I have no idea why, but I knew that song would affect my entire life. There was a sense, even before it was put to animation, that there was something very, very special about that music.&quot;

==Releases==
&quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; was originally featured on &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot; (1964) and was also released as the B-side for the single &quot;Oh, Good Grief&quot;. However, it gained its greatest exposure as part of the &quot;Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; soundtrack the following year. Since then, it has been reissued multiple times. To date, it has been included on the following soundtracks and compilations:

*&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)&quot; (1965)
*&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1980)
*&quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Holiday Hits&quot; (1998)
*&quot;The Definitive Vince Guaraldi&quot; (2009)
*&quot;Peanuts Portraits&quot; (2010)
*&quot;The Very Best of Vince Guaraldi&quot; (2012)
*&quot;Peanuts Greatest Hits&quot; (2015)

Guaraldi included variations of his signature tune in most subsequent &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials he worked on after &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; through &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown&quot; in 1975. Some of these alternate renditions have been made available on the following releases:
*&quot;Oh Good Grief!&quot; (1968) – harpsichord-driven version
*&quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack&quot; (1970) – minor key, flute-driven versions
*&quot;The Charlie Brown Suite &amp; Other Favorites&quot; (2003) – band version from &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; and live version recorded at Mr. D&#x27;s in San Francisco, California on May 18, 1969 
*&quot;Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials, Volume 2&quot; (2008) – chimes-driven version from &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Live on the Air&quot; (2008) – live version recorded in 1974
*&quot;An Afternoon with the Vince Guaraldi Quartet&quot; (2011) – live version recorded in 1967
*&quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; (2017) – minor key, flute-driven versions
*&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; (2018) – flute-driven version
*&quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; (2023) – band version with brass
*&quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; (2024) – flute-driven, vibes versions
*&quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; (2024) – chimes version
*&quot;Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; (2025) – bridge variations

== Legacy ==
&quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; receives considerable airplay on radio stations in the United States and Canada that flip to Christmas music for the holiday season due to its inclusion on the soundtrack album of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

The first 24 bars of the song&#x27;s sheet music were adopted as startup sound while a subsequent 8 bars were adopted as shutdown sound in the desktop theme &quot;Peanuts&quot; from Microsoft Plus! 98.

The song has been used as background music for The Weather Channel&#x27;s local forecasts during the holiday season since 1999.

On May 10, 2019, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the single gold for sales.
