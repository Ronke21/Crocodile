<text>Egeria (, ) was a nymph attributed a legendary role in the early history of Rome as a divine consort and counselor of Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to whom she imparted laws and rituals pertaining to ancient Roman religion. Her name is used as an eponym for a female advisor or counselor.

==Origin and etymology==
Egeria may predate Roman myth: she could have been of Italic origin in the sacred forest of Aricia in Latium, her immemorial site, which was equally the grove of Diana Nemorensis (&quot;Diana of Nemi&quot;). At Aricia there was also a Manius Egerius, a male counterpart of Egeria.

The name &quot;Egeria&quot; has been diversely interpreted. Georges Dumézil proposed it came from &quot;ē-gerere&quot; (&quot;bear out&quot;), suggesting an origin from her childbirth role. It may mean &quot;of the black poplar&quot; (Greek αἴγειρος, &quot;aigeiros&quot;). Her role as prophetess and author of &quot;sacred books&quot; is similar to the Etruscan Vegoia, to whom were attributed various books of prophecy, including the &quot;Libri Fulgurales&quot;, which were used to interpret the will of the gods through lightning strikes.

==Function==
Egeria as a nymph or minor goddess of the Roman religious system is of unclear origin; she is consistently, though not in a very clear way, associated with another figure of the Diana type; their cult is known to have been celebrated at sacred groves, such as the site of Nemi at Aricia, and another one close to Rome (see section below); both goddesses are also associated with water bearing wondrous, religious or medical properties (the source in that grove at Rome was dedicated to the exclusive use of the Vestals); their cult was associated with other, male figures of even more obscure meaning, such as one named Virbius, or a Manius Egerius, presumably a youthful male, that anyway in later years was identified with figures like Atys or Hippolyte, because of the Diana reference (see Frazer).

Described sometime as a &quot;mountain nymph&quot; (Plutarch), she is usually regarded as a water nymph and somehow her cult also involved some link with childbirth, like the Greek goddess Ilithyia, but most of all, Egeria gave wisdom and prophecy in return for libations of water or milk at her sacred groves. This quality has been made especially popular through the tale of her relationship with Numa Pompilius (the second legendary king of Rome, who succeeded its founder Romulus).

==Relationship with Numa Pompilius==

According to mythology, she counseled and guided the King Numa Pompilius (Latin &quot;numen&quot; designates &quot;the expressed will of a deity&quot;) in the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome. Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in &quot;sacred books&quot; that he had buried with him. When a chance accident brought them back to light some 500 years later, the Senate deemed them inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and ordered their destruction. What made them inappropriate was some matter of religious nature with &quot;political&quot; bearing that apparently has not been handed down by Valerius Antias, the source that Plutarch was using. Dionysius of Halicarnassus hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the Pontifices.

She is also gifted with oracular capabilities (she interpreted for Numa the abstruse omens of gods, for instance the episode of the omen from Faunus). In another episode, she helps Numa in a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strikes and thunder.

Numa also invoked communicating with other deities, such as Muses; hence naturally enough, the somewhat &quot;pale&quot; figure of Egeria was later categorized by the Romans as one of the Camenae, deities who came to be equated with the Greek Muses as Rome fell under the cultural influence of Greece; so Dionysius of Halicarnassus listed Egeria among the Muses.

The precise level of her relationship to Numa has been described diversely. She is typically given the respectful label &quot;coniūncta&quot; (&quot;consort&quot;); Plutarch is very evasive as of the actual mode of intimacy between Numa and Egeria, and hints that Numa himself entertained a level of ambiguity. By Juvenal&#x27;s day, that tradition was treated more critically. Juvenal called her Numa&#x27;s &quot;amīca&quot; (or &quot;girlfriend&quot;) in a sceptical phrase.

Numa Pompilius died in 673 BC of old age. According to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, with Numa&#x27;s death, Egeria melted into tears of sorrow, thus becoming a spring (&quot;...donec pietate dolentis / mota soror Phoebi gelidum de corpore fontem / fecit...&quot; ), traditionally identified with the one nearby Porta Capena in Rome.

==Egeria spring in Rome==

A spring and a grove once sacred to Egeria stand close to a gate of Rome, the Porta Capena. Its waters were dedicated to the exclusive use of the Vestals. The &quot;ninfeo&quot;, a favored picnic spot for nineteenth-century Romans, can still be visited in the archaeological Park of the Caffarella, between the Appian Way and the even more ancient Via Latina, nearby the Baths of Caracalla (a later construction).

In the second century, when Herodes Atticus recast an inherited villa nearby as a great landscaped estate, the natural grotto was formalized as an arched interior with an apsidal end where a statue of Egeria once stood in a niche; the surfaces were enriched with revetments of green and white marble facings and green porphyry flooring and friezes of mosaic. The primeval spring, one of dozens of springs that flow into the river Almone, was made to feed large pools, one of which was known as &quot;Lacus Salutaris&quot; or &quot;Lake of Health&quot;. Juvenal regretted an earlier phase of architectural elaboration:

:Nymph of the Spring! More honour&#x27;d hadst thou been,
:If, free from art, an edge of living green,
:Thy bubbling fount had circumscribed alone,
:And marble ne’er profaned the native stone.

==In culture==
* In Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s English Restoration tragedy &quot;Lucius Junius Brutus&quot; (1680), Egeria appears in a vision to Brutus&#x27; son Titus.
* In Canto IV of Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; mentions Egeria twice and refers to her grotto.
* Two letters written by John Adams to Charles Adams and John Quincy Adams in January of 1794 make allusions to the myth of Numa and Egeria in relation to recent developments in Thomas Jefferson’s political career. Adams’s references to Jefferson’s “Conversations with Egeria in the Groves” at Monticello have been interpreted by some historians as euphemistic acknowledgment of the affair between Jefferson and Sally Hemings. 
* In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, the canon Chasuble refers to Cecily&#x27;s tutor Miss Prism as &quot;Egeria.&quot;
* In Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;, (1911) Madame de S___, a Russian lady of &quot;advanced views&quot;, is referred to as the Egeria of Peter Ivanovich, the &quot;heroic fugitive&quot; who wrote books preaching and practicing the cult of women under the rites of special devotion to the transcendental merits of Madame de S___.
* In the video game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, Egeria, also known as the Mistress of Many Waters, was the original Hydro Archon, creator of the oceanids and Fontainian Humans, and the predecessor of the latest Hydro Archon, Focalors.
* In the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, Egeria is the founder of the Tok&#x27;ra.

<doc id="964984" wikidata="Q154049" url="?curid=964984" title="Michael Forbes (politician)">
<text>Michael Patrick Forbes (born July 16, 1952) is an American former politician from the state of New York. Forbes represented a Long Island district in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001, first as a Republican (until 1999) and then as a Democrat. He was an influential member of the House Appropriations Committee throughout his tenure on Capitol Hill. Forbes left Congress after being defeated in the 2000 Democratic primary election. In 2005, he relocated his family to Round Rock, Texas. Since leaving politics, Forbes has devoted his life to service in the Roman Catholic Church. He was ordained in 2013 as a permanent deacon by Most Reverend Joe S. Vasquez, Bishop of Austin. Former Congressman, now Deacon Forbes, was invited to become a fellow in the Inspired Leadership Initiative at the University of Notre Dame for the 2023-2024 academic year. He and his wife, Barbara, reside in Granger, Indiana, where they are also closer to Barbara&#x27;s family.

== Early life and career==
Michael Patrick Forbes of Granger, Indiana and Quogue, Long Island, was born on 16 July 1952 at Riverhead, Long Island, New York, to Kenneth and Jane (née Morrissey) Forbes. He is the grandson of Carrie Bowman, a Broadway actress, and T. Harold Forbes, an actor and Vaudeville song and danceman who became a well-known newspaper publisher in New Rochelle and Long Island, New York. Forbes holds degrees from the SUNY Albany, Saint Paul University, the University of Ottawa, and the University of Mary. He studied American history, political science, bioethics and canon law, and received an honorary Doctor of Law from Long Island University. 
Forbes got his start in politics as an assistant to New York State Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. He was a close advisor and senior aide to U.S. Senator Al D&#x27;Amato and U.S. Rep. Connie Mack III. In 1979, Forbes joined the George H.W. Bush presidential campaign as a campaign operative in Upstate New York and again, in 1987, successfully campaigned statewide in Maine for Bush to succeed Ronald Reagan. President Bush appointed Forbes to a senior post at the United States Small Business Administration in 1989. He served four years, leaving in 1993 when the Clinton administration came into office.

Forbes remains involved as a former founding board member, and volunteer of the not-for-profit Camp Agawam, an alumni-owned boys summer camp in Raymond, Maine. He and his older brother, Ken, his father, Ken Sr., and Forbes’s sons, Ted, Sam, Max, and most of their male relatives spent their summers on Agawam’s Crescent Lake dating from the camp’s founding in 1919. Forbes first attended Agawam in 1965.

== Congress ==
In 1994, Forbes ran on three ballot lines for the House of Representatives: Republican, Conservative, and Right to Life. Campaigning as a fiscal conservative, he defeated incumbent George Hochbrueckner by six percentage points. Forbes was honored with a seat on the powerful Appropriations committee, unusual for a freshman Representative, after defeating an incumbent congressman and because of his close ties to the new GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In December 1996, after Gingrich was cited for gross campaign irregularities, Forbes became the first Republican to announce he was not going to vote for Gingrich for speaker. Forbes voted for moderate Republican candidate Jim Leach instead. Despite his record of support for a number of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s programs, particularly his health insurance for all Americans, Forbes voted to impeach Clinton in 1998.

===Party switch===
On July 17, 1999, Forbes switched to the Democratic Party after chastising national Republicans for being &quot;tone deaf&quot; to the needs of average Americans. While embraced nationally by President Bill Clinton, House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, U.S Senators Ted Kennedy and Max Cleland and other Senate and House Democrats, New York&#x27;s liberal Democrats (particularly chairwoman Judith Hope) refused to welcome Forbes into the Democratic Party because he would not change his long-held belief in the sanctity of human life and push to prohibit abortion.

Activists in the Suffolk County Democratic Party recruited a 71-year-old librarian, Regina Seltzer, to challenge Forbes in the 2000 Democratic primary. Seltzer won a court ruling halting state Democratic Party ads for Forbes. Both the national and state Republican parties secretly funneled $250,000 to Seltzer’s primary, which she won by just 35 votes. Fireworks company executive Felix Grucci, a Republican, beat Seltzer and took Forbes&#x27;s place in the Congress. Grucci served a single term in Congress, being defeated in 2002 by Democrat Tim Bishop, who served until 2015.

==Career after Congress==
Forbes is married to Barbara Ann (Blackburn) Forbes and has four children and seven grandchildren. In his post-Congress years, Forbes worked as a public relations executive, founding his own communications firm in 2001. His clients included defense industry contractors, financial services, Internet payment providers, non-profit children&#x27;s home, and other small businesses seeking Federal legislative relief and appropriations. He has also blogged for the Huffington Post.

In 2005, Forbes and his wife moved to Round Rock, Texas, then in 2023, to Granger, Indiana. In 2008, he entered five years of formation and theological study in the Diocese of Austin to become a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church. He was ordained clergy in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin by Bishop Joe S. Vásquez on April 13, 2013. For ten years, he served at Saint William Catholic Church in Round Rock. Today, Forbes is a deacon at St. Monica Parish, Mishawaka, Indiana, in the Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, and assists as a canon lawyer in the tribunal for the diocese.

In 2016, Forbes earned both ecclesiastical and civil degrees in canon (Church) law (the iuris canonici licentiate (J.C.L.) and a Master in Canon Law (M.C.L.) from Saint Paul University and the University of Ottawa, respectively. He proceeded to complete a Master in Science in Bioethics (MSBE) from the University of Mary at Bismarck, North Dakota, in 2021 to better serve his parish and diocese in critical life issues. In addition to having served as a judge on the ecclesiastical court of the Diocese of Austin, Forbes formerly served Bishop Vasquez as his canonist and as Vice Chancellor for the Diocese of Austin. He was also the director of diaconal ministry. He is a member of the Canon Law Society of America, the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the Canon Law Society of Australia New Zealand, and the Canadian Canon Law Society.

<doc id="964985" wikidata="Q6610031" url="?curid=964985" title="List of city nicknames in the United States">
<text>This partial list of city nicknames in the United States compiles the aliases, sobriquets and slogans that cities are known by (or have been known by historically), officially and unofficially, to municipal governments, local people, outsiders or their tourism boards or chambers of commerce.

City nicknames can help establish a civic identity, help outsiders recognize a community, attract people to a community because of its nickname, promote civic pride, and build community unity. Nicknames and slogans that successfully create a new community &quot;ideology or myth&quot; are also believed to have economic value. This value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by &quot;branding&quot; themselves by adopting new slogans.

In 2005 the consultancy Tagline Guru conducted a small survey of professionals in the fields of branding, marketing, and advertising aimed at identifying the &quot;best&quot; U.S. city slogans and nicknames. Participants were asked to evaluate about 800 nicknames and 400 slogans, considering several criteria in their assessments. The assigned criteria were: whether the nickname or slogan expresses the &quot;brand character, affinity, style, and personality&quot; of the city, whether it &quot;tells a story in a clever, fun, and memorable way,&quot; uniqueness and originality, and whether it &quot;inspires you to visit there, live there, or learn more.&quot;

The top-ranked nickname in the survey was New York City&#x27;s &quot;The Big Apple,&quot; followed by &quot;Sin City&quot; (Las Vegas), &quot;The Big Easy&quot; (New Orleans), &quot;Motor City&quot; (Detroit), and &quot;The Windy City&quot; (Chicago). In addition to the number-two nickname, Las Vegas had the top-rated slogan: &quot;What Happens Here, Stays Here.&quot; The second- through fifth-place slogans were &quot;So Very Virginia&quot; (Charlottesville, Virginia), &quot;Always Turned On&quot; (Atlantic City, New Jersey), &quot;Cleveland Rocks!&quot; (Cleveland, Ohio), and &quot;The Sweetest Place on Earth&quot; (Hershey, Pennsylvania).

Some unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive. The unofficial nicknames listed here have been in use for a long time or have gained wide currency.

<doc id="964987" wikidata="Q1335234" url="?curid=964987" title="Simargl">
<text>Simargl (also Sěmargl, Semargl) or Sěm and Rgel is an East Slavic god or gods often depicted as a winged dog, mentioned in two sources. The origin and etymology of this/these figure(s) is the subject of considerable debate. The dominant view is to interpret Simargl as a single deity who was borrowed from the Iranian Simurgh. However, this view is criticized, and some researchers propose that the existence of two deities, Sěm and Rgel, should be recognized.

== Sources ==
The first source that mentions Simargl is &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, which describes how Vladimir the Great erected statues to Slavic gods in 980:

&lt;poem&gt;
And Vladimir began to reign alone in Kyiv. And he placed idols on the hill outside the palace: a Perun in wood with a silver head and a gold moustache, and Khors and Dazhbog and Stribog and Simargl and Mokosh. And they offered sacrifices and called them gods, and they took their sons and daughters to them and sacrificed them to the devils. And they profaned the earth with their sacrifices, and Rus’ and that hill were profaned by blood. But God the merciful, who does not wish the death of sinners, on that hill stands today the church of Saint Vasilij, as we will relate later.

&lt;/poem&gt;
In a later text from the second half of the 12th century, &quot;Sermon by One Who Loves Christ&quot;, Simargl is mentioned as two separate deities, Sěm and Rgel:

&lt;poem&gt;
[...] being unable to bear Christians who live a double faith and believe in Perun and Khors, Mokosh, Sim and Rgl and in the Vily [...]

&lt;/poem&gt;
The &quot;Sermon&quot; further states: „Therefore, Christians must not hold demonic festivities, meaning dancing, music and profane songs, and offerings to the idols, who with fire under the fields of sheaves pray to the Vily, to Mokosh, and Sim and Rgl, to Perun, Rod, the Rozhanitsy and all the like.”

== Etymology and interpretations ==
In copies of &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the theonym is written (in the genitive) as (Laurentian Codex), (Hypatian Codex) and (Radziwiłł Chronicle). In the &quot;Sermon&quot; as two separate theonyms: , (genitive) and , (dative).

In 1841, proposed that Sim and Rgel be considered characters corresponding, respectively, to the Old Testament Asima and Nergal. This view was supported by Viljo Mansikka. Alexander Famitsin, on the other hand, concluded that Simargl was a corrupted notation that was originally intended to read &quot;Sim Yaryl&quot;. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov originally concluded that the theonym originally sounded &quot;*Sedmor(o)-golvъ&quot; and meant &quot;seven-headed&quot;.

Since 1933, Simargl has been considered an Iranian loanword. It was first proposed by Kamilla Trever, a Russian historian and orientalist, according to whom the source word for &quot;Simargl&quot; was supposed to be &quot;Simurgh&quot; – a winged creature with a dog&#x27;s head that was a protector of plants. The derivation of &quot;Simargl&quot; from &quot;Simurgh&quot; is now the dominant view in scholarship. The source of the borrowing was to be Persian , Middle Persian , Avestan &quot;saēna-marga&quot; or Scythian-Sarmatian &quot;Sēnmary&quot;.

Boris Rybakov was an ardent supporter of the Trever theory; he rejected the division of Simargl into two deities or the possibility of typos. Based on the relationship between Simargl and Simgur, he concluded that Simargl was the god of seeds, sprouts and roots of plants, the protector of shoots and greens, the intermediary between the highest gods of heaven and earth. Simargl was supposed to be a deity of a lower order. He was depicted as a winged dog with fangs and claws, and his images were to be found on various objects, such as bracelets. According to Rybakov, Simargl was identical to Pereplut (often referring to them as &quot;Simargl-Pereplut&quot;) and was later replaced by him. The view is supported by a number of scholars including Alexander Gieysztor eventually also Ivanov and Toporov and many others.

Mikhail Vasilyev admits that there are some linguistic difficulties in deriving &quot;Simargl&quot; from &quot;Simurgh&quot;, but states that it is plausible and accepts the theory, at least until a better one is discovered. However, he questioned Rybakov&#x27;s interpretation seeing Simargl as a plant god: there are no Iranian or Indian sources confirming that Simurgh was the protector of plants, so Simargl could not have inherited this competence. However, he points out that the common Indo-Iranian characteristic of Simurgh was to mediate between worlds, and that at a later stage, in Eastern Iranian mythology, he was the protector of humans, especially human clusters, and that this may have determined his introduction into the Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon. He also points out that Simurgh in the form of a dog-bird originated in (post)Sasanian Iran and from there spread to the space between the Atlantic and Siberia. However, after the Islamization of Iran, Simurgh lost its religious significance and became an ornamental motif. According to him, there is no evidence that among the eastern Iranians, from whom the Slavs were supposed to have taken him over, Simurgh was depicted with a dog&#x27;s head, and this means that he must have had an original appearance, i.e. be depicted as a large, predatory bird, and consequently, Simargl could not have been a dog-bird. As a result, he also accuses Rybakov of arbitrarily concluding that winged dogs in East Slavic art are depictions of Simargl, while an analysis of the oldest depictions of this type (from the 10th century onward) suggests that they may be Old Russian reflections of Western European dragons of the romanesqe type.

The relationship between Simargl and Simurgh has also been criticized on linguistic grounds: the vowels and the last consonant ([l]) do not fit. This has led to at least a dozen other proposals. Martin Pukanec proposed to read the second part of the theonym as Proto-Slavic &quot;eagle&quot;. Here he mentions the Latvian cognate &quot;ērglis&quot;, containing &quot;-g-&quot;. According to him, this is to prove that &quot;-g-&quot; was originally in the Balto-Slavic words for eagle, but fell out due to taboo. The Slavs were thus supposed to have borrowed Simurgh as &quot;*Sim-orьglъ&quot; &quot;eagle Sim&quot; and evolved into &quot;*Simo-orьglъ&quot; &gt; &quot;*Simōrьglъ&quot; &gt; &quot;*Simarьglъ&quot;. This etymology, however, cannot be accepted because Latvian &quot;ērglis&quot; is a late form and derives from the earlier &quot;*ereľis&quot; &lt; &quot;*erlis&quot; and does not correspond to the original forms.

Due to the above mentioned problems, some scholars concluded that Simargl were two separate deities: Sim/Sem/Sěm and Rgel/Rgěl, and it was for them that etymology was sought. Alexander Brückner stated that in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; the conjunction is also not found between &quot;Khors&quot; and &quot;Dazhbog&quot;, and these are still separate theonyms, therefore Simargl should also be divided into two words. According to Martin Pitro and Petr Vokáč, if one considers the existence of two deities instead of one, it is possible that Sěm and Rgel were divine twins, the Slavic counterparts of the Dioskuri.

=== Sěm ===
According to Brückner, &quot;Sim&quot;&#x27;s etymology was not problematic. He stated that since there were such words as &quot;šeima&quot;, &quot;šaima&quot;, &quot;keimas&quot;, &quot;kaimas&quot; in Lithuanian, there could have been a feminine word &quot;sima&quot; or a masculine &quot;sim&quot; in Slavic alongside &quot;sěmia&quot; &quot;family&quot;. In doing so, he uncertainly pointed to such place names as &quot;Simoradz&quot; and &quot;Siemiradz&quot;.

Krzysztof T. Witczak and Idaliana Kaczor assumed that the basic Old Russian form of the theonym was &quot;Sěmъ&quot; and that it was etymologically related to Lithuanian &quot;Seme-pates&quot;, Roman &quot;Sēmūnes&quot; &quot;deities of sowing&quot;, Sabine &quot;Simo Sancus Dius Fidius&quot; &quot;some deity compared to Hercules&quot;, Old Irish &quot;Semon&quot; &quot;hero or demigod&quot; and Gaulish Σημόνη. ήρωίς &quot;heroine&quot;. All these names are supposed to derive ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*Sēmos&quot; / &quot;*Sēmōn&quot; &quot;god of sowing&quot; or &quot;*Sēmonā&quot; &quot;goddess of sowing&quot;. Witczak and Kaczor refer to the PIE root &quot;to sow&quot; &gt; Proto-Slavic . Michał Łuczyński, however, points out the errors of this etymology: the Latin notation &quot;Semepates&quot; should be read as the Lithuanian &quot;*Žemepatys&quot; (from &quot;žemė&quot; &quot;earth&quot;), while for the rest of the names it is possible to reconstruct the protoform, but it would be &quot;*seVmōn-&quot;, from the PIE (Italo-Celtic) &quot;*seĝʰ-mōn-&quot;, from PIE *seĝʰ- &quot;to maintain, care for&quot; and they are not related to Sěm.

Łuczyński, however, agrees with Witczak and Kaczor that the theonym Sěm is etymologically related to the Slavic word for sowing. He reconstructs the Proto-Slavic noun &quot;*sêmъ&quot;, which consists of the verb &quot;*sěti&quot; &quot;to sow&quot; and the suffix , which literally meant &quot;sowing&quot;, secondarily &quot;that what one sows&quot;, &quot;that which is sown&quot;, etc., from which the theonym is derived.

=== Rgel ===
Brücker proposed two etymologies for Rgel. First one connects Rgel with the alleged Lithuanian god &quot;Ruglis&quot; or &quot;Rugulis&quot;; he connected them to, respectively, Old Polish &quot;reż&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;rugys&quot; &quot;rye&quot; (Old Polish from PS *&quot;rъžь&quot;), thus Rgel would be a god of rye, field, economy. The other links &quot;Rgel&quot; to the Lithuanian god &quot;Ruguczis&quot; &quot;god of sour things&quot;. The Lithuanian theonym is supposed to derive from &quot;rugti&quot; &quot;to sour&quot;, this root in the form &quot;rug-&quot; also occurs in Slavic languages. Rgel would thus a god associated with the souring. The name of the Polish village of &quot;Rgielsko&quot; is supposed to derive from the god&#x27;s name.

Witczak and Kaczor reconstructed the PIE theonym &quot;*Rudlós&quot; &quot;God of the wild nature&quot; to be attested by the Vedic &quot;Rudra&quot; and the Old Russian &quot;Rgel&quot; (from the earlier &quot;*Rъdlъ&quot;).

Łuczyński notes, however, that none of these etymologies can be accepted because their authors use erroneous notation of the deity when creating the etymology: Brücker gives notations of &quot;Rъglъ&quot; and &quot;Rъgъlъ&quot;, and Witczak and Kaczor give &quot;Rъglъ&quot; (all with &quot;ъ&quot; – a hard sign), while in the sources it is written as &quot;Rьglъ&quot; (with &quot;ь&quot; – a soft sign). Consequently, he also rejects deriving &quot;Rgielsko&quot; from the name of a god, since then the expected form would be &quot;*Rzgielsko&quot; (in Polish, the theonym would be &quot;*Rzgieł&quot; (Slavic &quot;rъ&quot; &gt; Polish &quot;rz&quot;)).

According to Łuczyński, the &quot;ь&quot; in the name may be the result of apophony of &quot;e&quot; : &quot;ь&quot; and the only word that fits the theonym is the Proto-Slavic verb &quot;to cut&quot; (cf. Slovene &quot;régati&quot; &quot;to crack&quot;, Polish &quot;rzega&quot; &quot;streak, weal, welt&quot;), which he derives from the PIE root &quot;to be dark&quot; ( Greek &quot;darkness&quot;). The semantic shift from &quot;dark, black&quot; &gt; &quot;empty&quot; is typical ( Sanskrit &quot;dark; empty&quot; from the same stem), then the meaning may have shifted to &quot;to make something empty&quot;, &quot;to make empty places&quot; &gt; &quot;to make holes, cuts; to cut&quot;. The theonym would thus consist of &quot;*rьgǫ&quot; / &quot;*regǫ&quot; &quot;I cut&quot; (1st person singular present tense of &quot;*regti&quot;) and the suffix . The resulting participial noun &quot;*rьglъ&quot;, which later became a theonym, may have meant &quot;that which is cut out&quot; &gt; &quot;cut&quot; &gt; perhaps &quot;chink, fissure&quot;, or &quot;hole&quot;, &quot;cavity&quot;. If this etymology is correct, the name of the Czech municipality &quot;Řehlovice&quot; may derive from god (from the personal name &quot;*Řehl-&quot;). According to Łuczyński, Sěm and Rgel were agricultural gods (from the names of agricultural work).

<text>Central Welfare Council (sometimes also translated as Main Social Services Council--Polish, Rada Główna Opiekuńcza) was one of the very few Polish social organizations that were allowed to work under the German occupation of Poland in World War I and World War II.

It was created during World War I in 1916 and again re-created in February 1940 in the General Government. It had its departments in most of Polish towns and cities. Among its main tasks were organization of:

* Cheap bars with hot soup for the poor and the expelled; almost 2000 such facilities were opened for almost 300,000 people
* Shelters and hostels for displaced persons and the poor
* Holiday camps for children as well as rest-homes for children and elderly people
* Places of free exchange of clothing and food as well as providing the poor with garments; up to 300,000 people a year were offered warm clothing
* Educational facilities and trade schools (other schools were forbidden)
* Relief for the expelled from Polish areas annexed by Germany, Zamość area, Volhynia and residents of Warsaw during and after the Warsaw Uprising
* Sending food packages for the POWs and prisoners of German concentration camps

It is estimated that the RGO helped an average of 800,000 people every year until 1944. The council was headed by prince Janusz Radziwiłł (until June 1940), count Adam Ronikier (until October 1943) and Konstanty Tchórznicki (until April 1945). The council had at least 15 000 volunteers all around Poland.

The council received finances from the German authorities and (clandestinely) from the Polish Government in Exile.

Adam Ronikier was a president during WWI and during WWII till 1943.

<doc id="964994" wikidata="Q1823275" url="?curid=964994" title="Likho">
<text>Likho, liho, lykho (, , , ) is an embodiment of evil fate and misfortune in Slavic mythology, a creature with one eye, often depicted as an old, skinny woman in black (Лихо одноглазое, One-eyed Likho) or as an evil male goblin of forests. Rather than being included in the major canon of the Slavic belief system, the Likho is traditionally found in fairy tales.

==Story==
There are several basic versions of tales about how a person meets with Likho, with different morals of the tale.
*A person eventually cheats Likho.
*A person cheats Likho, runs away (with Likho chasing him), sees a valuable thing, grabs it out of greed, the person&#x27;s hand sticks to it and they have to cut off their hand.
*Likho cheats a person and rides on his neck. The person wants to drown Likho, jumps into a river, drowns himself, but Likho floats out, to chase other victims.
*Likho is received or passed to another person with a gift.

Within the framework of superstitions, Likho was supposed to come and eat a person. In particular, this was used to scare small children. In Ukrainian folklore, it is sometimes portrayed as type of a bad spirit that can cling to one&#x27;s neck.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Likho&quot; is not a real proper name, but a noun meaning bad luck in modern Russian and Ukrainian, and the odd number in Polish (obsolete). Several proverbs utilize this term such as the Russian &quot;Не буди лихо, пока оно тихо&quot; and the Ukrainian &quot;Не буди лихо, поки воно тихо&quot;, literally translated as &quot;Don&#x27;t wake likho until it is quiet&quot;, similar to &quot;Don&#x27;t trouble trouble until trouble troubles you&quot;; or the Polish &quot;Cicho! Licho nie śpi&quot;, translated as &quot;Quiet! Evil does not sleep&quot; and &quot;Licho wie&quot;, literally &quot;Licho [only] knows&quot;, used to mean that a given piece of information is known by no one. In old Russian, the root meant &quot;excessive&quot;, &quot;too much&quot;, &quot;remaining&quot; and &quot;odd number&quot; (contrasted with chetno in the chetno i likho game) with pejorative connotations, similar to the unlucky &#x27;odd man out&#x27;. Compare to Russian &quot;lishniy&quot; – one in excess. The word is likely to be related to Indo-European &quot;leikw&quot; meaning something to remain, to leave. The derived adjective &quot;likhoy&quot; can be used to describe someone who is a bit too daring or brave. In Czech, &quot;lichý&quot; means odd (number), idle, vain. In Polish, &quot;lichy&quot; means shoddy, poor, flimsy. In Belarusian language, &quot;ліхі&quot; means bad, evil (like in prayer), odd (side of clothing). In Ukrainian language, it is type of bad luck or incident.

<doc id="964995" wikidata="Q595448" url="?curid=964995" title="Postmodern architecture">
<text>Postmodern architecture is a style or movement which emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the austerity, formality, and lack of variety of modern architecture, particularly in the international style advocated by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock. The movement was formally introduced by the architect and urban planner Denise Scott Brown and architectural theorist Robert Venturi in their 1972 book &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot;. The style flourished from the 1980s through the 1990s, particularly in the work of Scott Brown &amp; Venturi, Philip Johnson, Charles Moore and Michael Graves. In the late 1990s, it divided into a multitude of new tendencies, including high-tech architecture, neo-futurism, new classical architecture, and deconstructivism. However, some buildings built after this period are still considered postmodern.

==Origins==
Postmodern architecture emerged in the late 1960s as a reaction against the perceived shortcomings of modern architecture, particularly its rigid doctrines, its uniformity, its lack of ornament, and its habit of ignoring the history and culture of the cities where it appeared. In 1966, Venturi formalized the movement in his book, &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot;. Venturi summarized the kind of architecture he wanted to see replace modernism:

I speak of a complex and contradictory architecture based on the richness and ambiguity of modern experience, including that experience which is inherent in art. ... I welcome the problems and exploit the uncertainties. ... I like elements which are hybrid rather than &quot;pure&quot;, compromising rather than &quot;clean&quot; ... accommodating rather than excluding. ... I am for messy vitality over obvious unity. ... I prefer &quot;both-and&quot; to &quot;either-or&quot;, black and white, and sometimes gray, to black or white. ... An architecture of complexity and contradiction must embody the difficult unity of inclusion rather than the easy unity of exclusion.

In place of the functional doctrines of modernism, Venturi proposed giving primary emphasis to the façade, incorporating historical elements, a subtle use of unusual materials and historical allusions, and the use of fragmentation and modulations to make the building interesting. Accomplished architect and urban planner Denise Scott Brown, who was Venturi&#x27;s wife, and Venturi wrote &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot; (1972), co-authored with Steven Izenour, in which they further developed their joint argument against modernism. They urged architects to take into consideration and to celebrate the existing architecture in a place, rather than to try to impose a visionary utopia from their own fantasies. This was in line with Scott Brown&#x27;s belief that buildings should be built for people, and that architecture should listen to them. Scott Brown and Venturi argued that ornamental and decorative elements &quot;accommodate existing needs for variety and communication&quot;. The book was instrumental in opening readers&#x27; eyes to new ways of thinking about buildings, as it drew from the entire history of architecture—both high-style and vernacular, both historic and modern—and In response to Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s famous maxim &quot;Less is more&quot;, Venturi responded, to &quot;Less is a bore.&quot; Venturi cited the example of one of his wife&#x27;s and his own buildings, Guild House, in Philadelphia, as examples of a new style that welcomed variety and historical references, without returning to academic revival of old styles.

In Italy at about the same time, a similar revolt against strict modernism was being launched by the architect Aldo Rossi, who criticized the rebuilding of Italian cities and buildings destroyed during the war in the modernist style, which had had no relation to the architectural history, original street plans, or culture of the cities. Rossi insisted that cities be rebuilt in ways that preserved their historical fabric and local traditions. Similar ideas were and projects were put forward at the Venice Biennale in 1980. The call for a post-modern style was joined by Christian de Portzamparc in France and Ricardo Bofill in Spain, and in Japan by Arata Isozaki.

==Notable postmodern buildings and architects==

===Robert Venturi===

Robert Venturi (1925–2018) was both a prominent theorist of postmodernism and an architect whose buildings illustrated his ideas. After studying at the American Academy in Rome, he worked in the offices of the modernists Eero Saarinen and Louis Kahn until 1958, and then became a professor of architecture at Yale University. One of his first buildings was the Guild House in Philadelphia, built between 1960 and 1963, and a house for his mother in Chestnut Hill, in Philadelphia. These two houses became symbols of the postmodern movement. He went on to design, in the 1960s and 1970s, a series of buildings which took into account both historic precedents, and the ideas and forms existing in the real life of the cities around them.

===Michael Graves===

Michael Graves (1934–2015) designed two of the most prominent buildings in the postmodern style, the Portland Building and the Denver Public Library. He later followed up his landmark buildings by designing large, low-cost retail stores for chains such as Target and J.C. Penney in the United States, which had a major influence on the design of retail stores in city centers and shopping malls. In his early career, he, along with the Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier, was considered one of the New York Five, a group of advocates of pure modern architecture, but in 1982 he turned toward postmodernism with the Portland Building, one of the first major structures in the style. The building has since been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

===Charles Moore===

The most famous work of architect Charles Moore (1925–1993) is the Piazza d&#x27;Italia in New Orleans (1978), a public square composed of an exuberant collection of pieces of famous Italian Renaissance architecture. Drawing upon the Spanish Revival architecture of the city hall, Moore designed the Beverly Hills Civic Center in a mixture of Spanish Revival, Art Deco and postmodern styles. It includes courtyards, colonnades, promenades, and buildings, with both open and semi-enclosed spaces, stairways and balconies.

The Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley blends in with both the neo-Renaissance architecture of the Berkeley campus and with picturesque early 20th century wooden residential architecture in the neighboring Berkeley Hills.

===Philip Johnson===

Philip Johnson (1906–2005) began his career as a pure modernist. In 1935, he co-authored the famous catalog of the Museum of Modern Art exposition on the International Style, and studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at Harvard. His Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut (1949), inspired by a similar house by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became an icon of the modernist movement. He worked with Mies on another iconic modernist project, the Seagrams Building in New York City. However, in the 1950s, he began to include certain playful and mannerist forms into his buildings, such as the Synagogue of Port Chester (1954–1956), with a vaulted plaster ceiling and narrow colored windows, and the Art Gallery of the University of Nebraska (1963). However, his major buildings in the 1970, such as IDS Center in Minneapolis (1973) and Pennzoil Place in Houston (1970–1976), were massive, sober, and entirely modernist.

With the AT&amp;T Building (now named 550 Madison Avenue) (1978–1982), Johnson turned dramatically toward postmodernism. The building&#x27;s most prominent feature is a purely decorative top modeled after a piece of Chippendale furniture, and it has other more subtle references to historical architecture. His intention was to make the building stand out as a corporate symbol among the modernist skyscrapers around it in Manhattan, and he succeeded; it became the best-known of all postmodern buildings. Soon afterward he completed another postmodern project, PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1979–1984), a complex of six glass buildings for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. These buildings have neo-gothic features, including 231 glass spires, the largest of which is high.

In 1995, he constructed a postmodern gatehouse pavilion for his residence, Glass House. The gatehouse, called &quot;Da Monstra&quot;, is 23 feet high, made of gunite, or concrete shot from a hose, colored gray and red. It is a piece of sculptural architecture with no right angles and very few straight lines, a predecessor of the sculptural contemporary architecture of the 21st century.

===Frank Gehry===

Frank Gehry (born 1929) was a major figure in postmodernist architecture, and is one of the most prominent figures in contemporary architecture. After studying at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and then the Harvard Graduate School of Design, he opened his own office in Los Angeles in 1962. Beginning in the 1970s, he began using prefabricated industrial materials to construct unusual forms on private houses in Los Angeles, including, in 1978, his own house in Santa Monica. He broke their traditional design giving them an unfinished and unstable look. His Schnabel House in Los Angeles (1986–1989) was broken into individual structures, with a different structure for every room. His Norton Residence in Venice, California (1983) built for a writer and former lifeguard, had a workroom modeled after a lifeguard tower overlooking the Santa Monica beach. In his early buildings, different parts of the buildings were often different bright colors. In the 1980s he began to receive major commissions, including the Loyola Law School (1978–1984), and the California Aerospace Museum (1982–1984), then international commissions in the Netherlands and Czech Republic. His &quot;Dancing House&quot; in Prague (1996), constructed with an undulating façade of plaques of concrete; parts of the walls were composed of glass, which revealed the concrete pillars underneath. His most prominent project was the Guggenheim Bilbao museum (1991–1997), clad in undulating skins of titanium, a material which until then was used mainly in building aircraft, which changed color depending upon the light. Gehry was often described as a proponent of deconstructivism, but he refused to accept that or any other label for his work.

===César Pelli===

César Pelli (October 12, 1926 – July 19, 2019) was an Argentine architect who designed some of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings and other major urban landmarks. Two of his most notable projects are the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and the World Financial Center in New York City. The American Institute of Architects named him one of the ten most influential living American architects in 1991 and awarded him the AIA Gold Medal in 1995. In 2008, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat presented him with The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1977, Pelli was selected to be the dean of the Yale School of Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, and served in that post until 1984. Shortly after Pelli arrived at Yale, he won the commission to design the expansion and renovation of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which resulted in the establishment of his own firm, Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates. The museum&#x27;s expansion/renovation and the Museum of Modern Art Residential Tower were completed 1984; the World Financial Center in New York, which includes the grand public space of the Winter Garden, was completed in 1988. Among other significant projects during this period are the Crile Clinic Building in Cleveland, Ohio, completed 1984; Herring Hall at Rice University in Houston, Texas (also completed 1984); completion in 1988 of the Green Building at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, California; and the construction of the Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1989.

Pelli was named one of the ten most influential living American Architects by the American Institute of Architects in 1991. In 1995, he was awarded the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. In May 2004, Pelli was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Minnesota Duluth where he designed Weber Music Hall. In 2005, Pelli was honored with the Connecticut Architecture Foundation&#x27;s Distinguished Leadership Award.

Buildings designed by Pelli during this period are marked by further experimentation with a variety of materials (most prominently stainless steel) and his evolution of the skyscraper. One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in London (opened in 1991); Plaza Tower in Costa Mesa, California (completed 1991); and the NTT Headquarters in Tokyo (finished 1995) were preludes to a landmark project that Pelli designed for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Petronas Towers were completed in 1997, sheathed in stainless steel and reflecting Islamic design motifs. The dual towers were the world&#x27;s tallest buildings until 2004. That year, Pelli received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the design of the Petronas Towers Pelli&#x27;s design for the National Museum of Art in Osaka, Japan, was completed 2005, the same year that Pelli&#x27;s firm changed its name to Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects to reflect the growing roles of senior principals Fred W. Clarke and Pelli&#x27;s son Rafael.

While postmodernism was best known as an American style, notable examples also appeared in Europe. In 1991 Robert Venturi completed the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London, which was modern but harmonized with the neoclassical architecture in and around Trafalgar Square. The German-born architect Helmut Jahn (1940–2021) constructed the Messeturm skyscraper in Frankfurt, Germany, a skyscraper adorned with the pointed spire of a medieval tower.

One of the early postmodernist architects in Europe was James Stirling (1926–1992). He was a first critic of modernist architecture, blaming modernism for the destruction of British cities in the years after World War II. He designed colorful public housing projects in the postmodern style, as well as the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany (1977–1983) and the Kammertheater in Stuttgart (1977–1982), as well as the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University in the United States.

One of the most visible examples of the postmodern style in Europe is the SIS Building in London by Terry Farrell (1994). The building, next to the Thames, is the headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In 1992, Deyan Sudjic described it in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;epitaph for the &#x27;architecture of the eighties. ... It&#x27;s a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple or a piece of clanking art deco machinery&#x27;.

The Belgian architectural firm Atelier d&#x27;architecture de Genval is renowned for its pioneering work in postmodern architecture in Belgium, particularly in Brussels with major realizations such as the Espace Leopold complex which includes the European Parliament, and other like the Euroclear Building, recalling for most of them the American postmodernist style. 

The Italian architect Aldo Rossi (1931–1997) was known for his postmodern works in Europe, the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, the Netherlands, completed in 1995. Rossi was the first Italian to win the most prestigious award in architecture, the Pritzker Prize, in 1990. He was noted for combining rigorous and pure forms with evocative and symbolic elements taken from classical architecture.

The Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill (born 1939) is also known for his early postmodern works, including a residential complex in the form of a castle with red walls at Calp on the coast of Spain (1973) and the social housing complex Les Espaces d&#x27;Abraxas (1983) in Noisy-le-Grand, France.

The works of Austrian architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser (1928–2000) are occasionally considered a special expression of postmodern architecture.

==Postmodernism in Japan==

The Japanese architects Tadao Ando (born 1941) and Isozaki Arata (1931–2022) introduced the ideas of the postmodern movement to Japan. Before opening his studio in Osaka in 1969, Ando traveled widely in North America, Africa and Europe, absorbing European and American styles, and had no formal architectural education, though he taught later at Yale University (1987), Columbia University (1988) and Harvard University (1990). Most of his buildings were constructed of raw concrete in cubic forms, but had wide openings which brought in light and views of the nature outside. Beginning in the 1990s, he began using wood as a building material, and introduced elements of traditional Japanese architecture, particularly in his design of the Museum of Wood Culture (1995). His Bennesse House in Naoshima, Kagama, has elements of classic Japanese architecture and a plan which subtly integrates the house into the natural landscape, He won the Pritzker Prize, the most prestigious award in architecture, in 1995.

Isozaki Arata worked two years in the studio of Kenzo Tange (1913–2005), before opening his own firm in Tokyo in 1963. His Museum of Contemporary Art in Nagi artfully combined wood, stone and metal, and joined three geometric forms, a cylinder, a half-cylinder and an extended block, to present three different artists in different settings. His Art Tower in Mito, Japan (1986–1990) featured a postmodernist Titanium and Stainless Steel tower that rotated upon its own axis. In addition to museums and cultural centers in Japan, he designed the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), (1981–1986), and the COSI Columbus science museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio.

==Concert halls – Sydney Opera House and the Berlin Philharmonic==
The Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia, by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon (1918–2008), is one of the most recognizable of all works of postwar architecture, and spans the transition from modernism to postmodernism. Construction began in 1957, but it was not completed until 1973 due to difficult engineering problems and growing costs. The giant shells of concrete soar over the platforms which form the roof of the hall itself. The architect resigned before the structure was completed, and the interior was designed largely after he left the project. The influence of the Sydney Opera House, can be seen in later concert halls with soaring roofs made of undulating stainless steel.

One of the most influential buildings of the postmodern period was the Berlin Philharmonic, designed by Hans Scharoun (1893–1972) and completed in 1963. The exterior, with its sloping roofs and glided façade, was a distinct break from the earlier, more austere modernist concert halls. The real revolution was inside, where Scharoun placed the orchestra in the center, with the audience seated on terraces around it. He described it this way: &quot;The form given to the hall is inspired by a landscape; In the center is a valley, at the bottom of which is found the orchestra. Around it on all sides rise the terraces, like vineyards. Corresponding to an earthly landscape, the ceiling above appears like a sky.&quot; Following his description, future concert halls, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry in Los Angeles, and the Philharmonie de Paris of Jean Nouvel (2015) used the term &quot;vineyard style&quot; and placed the orchestra in the center, instead of on a stage at the end of the hall.

==Characteristics==
===Complexity and contradiction===
Postmodern architecture first emerged as a reaction against the doctrines of modern architecture, as expressed by modernist architects including Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In place of the modernist doctrines of simplicity as expressed by Mies in his famous &quot;less is more;&quot; and functionality, &quot;form follows function&quot; and the doctrine of Le Corbusier that &quot;a house is a machine to live in,&quot; postmodernism, in the words Robert Venturi, offered complexity and contradiction. Postmodern buildings had curved forms, decorative elements, asymmetry, bright colours, and features often borrowed from earlier periods. Colours and textures were unrelated to the structure or function of the building. Rejecting the &quot;puritanism&quot; of modernism, it called for a return to ornament, and an accumulation of citations and collages borrowed from past styles. It borrowed freely from classical architecture, rococo, neoclassical architecture, the Vienna Secession, the British Arts and Crafts movement, the German Jugendstil.

Postmodern buildings often combined astonishing new forms and features with seemingly contradictory elements of classicism. James Stirling the architect of the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany (1984), described the style as &quot;representation and abstraction, monumental and informal, traditional and high-tech.&quot;

===Fragmentation===
Postmodern architecture often breaks large buildings into several different structures and forms, sometimes representing different functions of those parts of the building. With the use of different materials and styles, a single building can appear like a small town or village. An example is the Abteiberg Museum by Hans Hollein in Mönchengladbach (1972–1974).

===Asymmetric and oblique forms===
Asymmetric forms are one of the trademarks of postmodernism. In 1968, the French architect Claude Parent and philosopher Paul Virilio designed the church Saint-Bernadette-du-Banlay in Nevers, France, in the form of a massive block of concrete leaning to one side. Describing the form, they wrote: &quot;a diagonal line on a white page can be a hill, or a mountain, or slope, an ascent, or a descent.&quot; Parent&#x27;s buildings were inspired in part by concrete German blockhouses he discovered on the French coast which had slid down the cliffs, but were perfectly intact, with leaning walls and sloping floors. Postmodernist compositions are rarely symmetric, balanced and orderly. Oblique buildings which tilt, lean, and seem about to fall over are common.

===Polychromy===
Color is an important element in many postmodern buildings; to give the façades variety and personality, colored glass is sometimes used, or ceramic tiles, or stone. The buildings of Mexican architect Luis Barragán offer bright sunlight color that give life to the forms.

===Humor and &quot;camp&quot;===
Humor is a particular feature of many postmodern buildings, particularly in the United States. An example is the Binoculars Building in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, designed by Frank Gehry in collaboration with the sculptor Claes Oldenburg (1991–2001). The gateway of the building is in the form of an enormous pair of binoculars; cars enter the garage passing under the binoculars. &quot;Camp&quot; humor was popular during the postmodern period; it was an ironic humor based on the premise that something could appear so bad (such as a building that appeared about to collapse) that it was good. In 1964, American critic Susan Sontag defined camp as a style which put its accent on the texture, the surface, and style to the detriment of the content, which adored exaggeration, and things which were not what they seemed. Postmodern architecture sometimes used the same sense of theatricality, sense of the absurd and exaggeration of forms.

The aims of postmodernism, which include solving the problems of Modernism, communicating meanings with ambiguity, and sensitivity for the building&#x27;s context, are surprisingly unified for a period of buildings designed by architects who largely never collaborated with each other. These aims do, however, leave room for diverse implementations as can be illustrated by the variety of buildings created during the movement.

==Theories of postmodern architecture==

The characteristics of postmodernism allow its aim to be expressed in diverse ways. These characteristics include the use of sculptural forms, ornaments, anthropomorphism and materials which perform &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;. These physical characteristics are combined with conceptual characteristics of meaning. These characteristics of meaning include pluralism, double coding, flying buttresses and high ceilings, irony and paradox, and contextualism.

The sculptural forms, not necessarily organic, were created with much ardor. These can be seen in Hans Hollein&#x27;s Abteiberg Museum (1972–1982). The building is made up of several building units, all very different. Each building&#x27;s forms are nothing like the conforming rigid ones of Modernism. These forms are sculptural and are somewhat playful. These forms are not reduced to an absolute minimum; they are built and shaped for their own sake. The building units all fit together in a very organic way, which enhances the effect of the forms.

After many years of neglect, ornament returned. Frank Gehry&#x27;s Venice Beach house, built in 1986, is littered with small ornamental details that would have been considered excessive and needless in Modernism. The Venice Beach House has an assembly of circular logs which exist mostly for decoration. The logs on top do have a minor purpose of holding up the window covers. However, the mere fact that they could have been replaced with a practically invisible nail, makes their exaggerated existence largely ornamental. The ornament in Michael Graves&#x27; Portland Municipal Services Building (&quot;Portland Building&quot;) (1980) is even more prominent. The two obtruding triangular forms are largely ornamental. They exist for aesthetic or their own purpose.

Postmodernism, with its sensitivity to the building&#x27;s context, did not exclude the needs of humans from the building. Carlo Scarpa&#x27;s Brion Cemetery (1970–1972) exemplifies this. The human requirements of a cemetery is that it possesses a solemn nature, yet it must not cause the visitor to become depressed. Scarpa&#x27;s cemetery achieves the solemn mood with the dull gray colors of the walls and neatly defined forms, but the bright green grass prevents this from being too overwhelming.

Postmodern buildings sometimes utilize &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, creating the illusion of space or depths where none actually exist, as has been done by painters since the Romans. The Portland Building (1980) has pillars represented on the side of the building that to some extent appear to be real, yet they are not.

The Hood Museum of Art (1981–1983) has a typical asymmetrical façade which was at the time prevalent throughout postmodern buildings.

Robert Venturi&#x27;s Vanna Venturi House (1962–1964) illustrates the postmodernist aim of communicating a meaning and the characteristic of symbolism. The façade is, according to Venturi, a symbolic picture of a house, looking back to the 18th century. This is partly achieved through the use of symmetry and the arch over the entrance.

Perhaps the best example of irony in postmodern buildings is Charles Moore&#x27;s Piazza d&#x27;Italia (1978). Moore quotes (architecturally) elements of Italian Renaissance and Roman Antiquity. However, he does so with a twist. The irony comes when it is noted that the pillars are covered with steel. It is also paradoxical in the way he quotes Italian antiquity far away from the original in New Orleans.

&quot;Double coding&quot; meant the buildings convey many meanings simultaneously. The Sony Building in New York provides one example. The building is a tall skyscraper which brings with it connotations of very modern technology. However, the top contradicts this. The top section conveys elements of classical antiquity. This double coding is a prevalent trait of postmodernism.

The characteristics of postmodernism were rather unified given their diverse appearances. The most notable among their characteristics is their playfully extravagant forms and the humour of the meanings the buildings conveyed.
Postmodern architecture as an international style – the first examples of which are generally cited as being from the 1950s – but did not become a movement until the late 1970s and continues to influence present-day architecture. Postmodernity in architecture is said to be heralded by the return of &quot;wit, ornament and reference&quot; to architecture in response to the formalism of the International Style of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism&#x27;s most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist style are replaced by diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered past architectural ornament and forms which had been abstracted by the Modernist architects.

Postmodern architecture has also been described as neo-eclectic, where reference and ornament have returned to the façade, replacing the aggressively unornamented modern styles. This eclecticism is often combined with the use of non-orthogonal angles and unusual surfaces, most famously in the State Gallery of Stuttgart by James Stirling and the Piazza d&#x27;Italia by Charles Moore. The Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh has also been cited as being of postmodern vogue.

Modernist architects may regard postmodern buildings as vulgar, associated with a populist ethic, and sharing the design elements of shopping malls, cluttered with &quot;&quot;. Postmodern architects may regard many modern buildings as soulless and bland, overly simplistic and abstract. This contrast was exemplified in the juxtaposition of the &quot;whites&quot; against the &quot;grays,&quot; in which the &quot;whites&quot; were seeking to continue (or revive) the modernist tradition of purism and clarity, while the &quot;grays&quot; were embracing a more multifaceted cultural vision, seen in Robert Venturi&#x27;s statement rejecting the &quot;black or white&quot; world view of modernism in favor of &quot;black and white and sometimes gray.&quot; The divergence in opinions comes down to a difference in goals: modernism is rooted in minimal and true use of material as well as absence of ornament, while postmodernism is a rejection of strict rules set by the early modernists and seeks meaning and expression in the use of building techniques, forms, and stylistic references.

One building form that typifies the explorations of postmodernism is the traditional gable roof, in place of the iconic flat roof of modernism. Shedding water away from the center of the building, such a roof form always served a functional purpose in climates with rain and snow, and was a logical way to achieve larger spans with shorter structural members, but it was nevertheless relatively rare in Modernist buildings. However, postmodernism&#x27;s own modernist roots appear in some of the noteworthy examples of &quot;reclaimed&quot; roofs. For instance, Robert Venturi&#x27;s Vanna Venturi House breaks the gable in the middle, denying the functionality of the form, and Philip Johnson&#x27;s 1001 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan advertises a mansard roof form as an obviously flat, false front. Another alternative to the flat roofs of modernism would exaggerate a traditional roof to call even more attention to it, as when Kallmann McKinnell &amp; Wood&#x27;s American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, layers three tiers of low hipped roof forms one above another for an emphatic statement of shelter.

==Relationship to previous styles==


A new trend became evident in the last quarter of the 20th century as some architects started to turn away from modern functionalism which they viewed as boring, and which some of the public considered unwelcoming and even unpleasant. These architects turned toward the past, quoting past aspects of various buildings and melding them together (even sometimes in an inharmonious manner) to create a new means of designing buildings. A vivid example of this new approach was that postmodernism saw the comeback of columns and other elements of premodern designs, sometimes adapting classical Greek and Roman examples. In Modernism, the traditional column (as a design feature) was treated as a cylindrical pipe form, replaced by other technological means such as cantilevers, or masked completely by curtain wall façades. The revival of the column was an aesthetic, rather than a technological necessity. Modernist high-rise buildings had become in most instances monolithic, rejecting the concept of a stack of varied design elements for a single vocabulary from ground level to the top, in the most extreme cases even using a constant &quot;footprint&quot; (with no tapering or &quot;wedding cake&quot; design), with the building sometimes even suggesting the possibility of a single metallic extrusion directly from the ground, mostly by eliminating visual horizontal elements—this was seen most strictly in Minoru Yamasaki&#x27;s World Trade Center buildings.

Another return was that of the &quot;wit, ornament and reference&quot; seen in older buildings in terra cotta decorative façades and bronze or stainless steel embellishments of the Beaux-Arts and Art Deco periods. In postmodern structures this was often achieved by placing contradictory quotes of previous building styles alongside each other, and even incorporating furniture stylistic references at a huge scale.

Contextualism, a trend in thinking in the later parts of 20th century, influences the ideologies of the postmodern movement in general. Contextualism is centered on the belief that all knowledge is &quot;context-sensitive&quot;. This idea was even taken further to say that knowledge cannot be understood without considering its context. While noteworthy examples of modern architecture responded both subtly and directly to their physical context, postmodern architecture often addressed the context in terms of the materials, forms and details of the buildings around it—the cultural context.

==Roots of postmodernism==

The postmodernist movement is often seen (especially in the US) as an American movement, starting in America around the 1960s–1970s and then spreading to Europe and the rest of the world, to remain right through to the present. In 1966, however, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner spoke of a revived Expressionism as being &quot;a new style, successor to my International Modern of the 1930s, a post-modern style&quot;, and included as examples Le Corbusier&#x27;s work at Ronchamp and Chandigarh, Denys Lasdun at the Royal College of Physicians in London, Richard Sheppard at Churchill College, Cambridge, and James Stirling&#x27;s and James Gowan&#x27;s Leicester Engineering Building, as well as Philip Johnson&#x27;s own guest house at New Canaan, Connecticut. Pevsner disapproved of these buildings for their self-expression and irrationalism, but he acknowledged them as &quot;the legitimate style of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; and defined their characteristics. The job of defining postmodernism was subsequently taken over by a younger generation who welcomed rather than rejected what they saw happening and, in the case of Robert Venturi, contributed to it.

The aims of postmodernism or late-modernism begin with its reaction to modernism; it tries to address the limitations of its predecessor. The list of aims is extended to include communicating ideas with the public often in a then humorous or witty way. Often, the communication is done by quoting extensively from past architectural styles, often many at once. In breaking away from modernism, it also strives to produce buildings that are sensitive to the context within which they are built.

Postmodernism has its origins in the perceived failure of modern architecture. Its preoccupation with functionalism and economical building meant that ornaments were done away with and the buildings were cloaked in a stark rational appearance. Many felt the buildings failed to meet the human need for comfort both for body and for the eye, that modernism did not account for the desire for beauty. The problem worsened when some already monotonous apartment blocks degenerated into slums. In response, architects sought to reintroduce ornament, color, decoration and human scale to buildings. Form was no longer to be defined solely by its functional requirements or minimal appearance.

==Changing pedagogies==
Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University&#x27;s School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, program were developed including the Advanced Masters-Level Course in the History and Theory of Architecture offered by Dalibor Vesely and Joseph Rykwert at the University of Essex in England between 1968 and 1978. It was the first of its kind.

Other programs followed suit, including several PhD programs in schools of architecture that arose to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, MIT and Cornell were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by Columbia, Berkeley, and Princeton. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were Bruno Zevi at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the Architectural Association, Anthony Vidler at Princeton, Manfredo Tafuri at the University of Venice, Kenneth Frampton at Columbia University, and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at ETH Zürich.

The creation of these programs was paralleled by the hiring, in the 1970s, of professionally trained historians by schools of architecture: Margaret Crawford (with a PhD from UCLA) at SCI-Arc; Elisabeth Grossman (PhD, Brown University) at Rhode Island School of Design; Christian Otto (PhD, Columbia University) at Cornell University; Richard Chafee (PhD, Courtauld Institute) at Roger Williams University; and Howard Burns (MA Kings College) at Harvard, to name just a few examples. A second generation of scholars then emerged that began to extend these efforts in the direction of what is now called &quot;theory&quot;: K. Michael Hays (PhD, MIT) at Harvard, Mark Wigley (PhD, Auckland University) at Princeton (now at Columbia University), and Beatriz Colomina (PhD, School of Architecture, Barcelona) at Princeton; Mark Jarzombek (PhD MIT) at Cornell (now at MIT), Jennifer Bloomer (PhD, Georgia Tech) at Iowa State and Catherine Ingraham (PhD, Johns Hopkins) now at Pratt Institute.

Postmodernism with its diversity possesses sensitivity to the building&#x27;s context and history, and the client&#x27;s requirements. The postmodernist architects often considered the general requirements of the urban buildings and their surroundings during the building&#x27;s design. For example, in Frank Gehry&#x27;s &quot;Venice Beach House&quot;, the neighboring houses have a similar bright flat color. This vernacular sensitivity is often evident, but other times the designs respond to more high-style neighbors. James Stirling&#x27;s Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University features a rounded corner and striped brick patterning that relate to the form and decoration of the polychromatic Victorian Memorial Hall across the street, although in neither case is the element imitative or historicist.

==Subsequent movements==
Following the postmodern riposte against modernism, various trends in architecture established, though not necessarily following principles of postmodernism. Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach toward construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize. Some postmodern architects, such as Robert A. M. Stern and Albert, Righter, &amp; Tittman, have moved from postmodern design to new interpretations of traditional architecture.

The Neo-Andean style takes a similar approach to ornamentation as broader postmodernism. First brought to attention in 1996, the style is notable for being designed and championed by indigenous Peruvians and Bolivians, and takes inspiration from ancient Inca and Andean designs.

<text>Greatest Hits is the first studio album by Canadian rock band Rheostatics. Only 1,000 copies were released in 1987, and all sold out. The album was rereleased in 1996.

Despite the album&#x27;s name, it is not a greatest hits compilation in the conventional sense. It does, however, compile songs from the band&#x27;s pre-1987 demo releases. The album&#x27;s best known song is &quot;The Ballad of Wendel Clark, Parts I and II&quot;, an ode to Toronto Maple Leafs player Wendel Clark.

<doc id="965002" wikidata="Q873276" url="?curid=965002" title="300-win club">
<text>In Major League Baseball, the 300-win club is the group of pitchers who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. This list does not include Bobby Mathews who won 297 in the major leagues plus several more in 1869 and 1870 before the major leagues were established in 1871. The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see four players reach 300 wins while on their roster: Tim Keefe in the Players&#x27; League, Christy Mathewson and Mickey Welch while the team was in New York, and most recently Randy Johnson. Early in the history of professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. Moreover, a schedule with rest days after most games allowed pitchers to start a far higher proportion of their team&#x27;s games than modern pitchers do, typically every other game or even more (in the second half of the 1884 season Old Hoss Radbourn started 40 games out of 43). The first player to win 300 games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19th century: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Keefe, John Clarkson, Charles Radbourn, and Welch. Four more pitchers joined the club in the first quarter of the 20th century: Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young&#x27;s mark.

Only three pitchers—Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn—joined the 300-win club between 1924 and 1982, which may be explained by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball; World War II military service, such as Bob Feller&#x27;s; and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300-win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton, and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from baseball&#x27;s increase from a 154-game schedule to a 162-game schedule in 1961, and expansion of the league from 16 teams in 1960 to 26 by 1977. The increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher&#x27;s parks all also suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine - such as Tommy John surgery - allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.

Since 1990, only four pitchers have joined the 300-win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Randy Johnson. Changes in the game in the last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300 career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid-20th century. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20 wins in a non-shortened season for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009, 2017, and 2024.

Recording 300 career wins has been seen as a guaranteed admission to the Baseball Hall of Fame. All pitchers with 300 wins have been elected to the Hall of Fame except for Clemens, who received only half of the vote total needed for induction in his first appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in and lost votes from that total in . Clemens fell off the ballot in 2022 and can only be elected via the players&#x27; Contemporary Baseball Era ballot of the Veterans Committee. Clemens&#x27; future election is seen as uncertain because of his alleged links to use of performance-enhancing drugs. Many observers expect the club to gain few, if any, members in the foreseeable future. Ten members of the 300-win club are also members of the 3,000 strikeout club.

<doc id="965003" wikidata="Q17014419" url="?curid=965003" title="Introducing Happiness">
<text>Introducing Happiness is the fifth studio album by Rheostatics, released in 1994 on Sire Records. Produced by Michael Phillip Wojewoda, the album was recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.

Band member Dave Bidini described the album as intended to represent &quot;a really crazy kind of thing with exploding colors like XTC&#x27;s &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;.&quot;

The album includes &quot;Claire&quot;, reached a peak of #52, on Canada&#x27;s RPM Pop Singles/Tracks chart. That song is also featured on the &quot;Whale Music&quot; soundtrack album, and won the Genie Award for Best Original Song at the 15th Genie Awards.

&quot;Introducing Happiness&quot; was the band&#x27;s second and final album for Sire Records. Sire found the band&#x27;s quirky indie rock too quirky and too indie to market effectively despite having a Top 40 hit, and dropped the band from the label.

It was also Dave Clark&#x27;s last album with the band. Following this album, he left to concentrate on The Dinner Is Ruined, and was replaced for the next several years by Don Kerr.

==Critical response==
Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; ranked it as the third best album of the year, behind only Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged in New York&quot; and Hole&#x27;s &quot;Live Through This&quot;. He wrote that the album was &quot;just yer basic, Etobicoke jock hoser-music psycho trip - but it wails like ginger ale. The Rheos manage the neat trick of attracting mainstream appeal without losing their alternative savvy. And &quot;Claire&quot; qualifies as single of the year contender.&quot;

<text>The Florida State Seminoles are the athletic teams representing Florida State University located in Tallahassee, Florida. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 1991–92 season; within the Atlantic Division in any sports split into a divisional format since the 2005–06 season.

The Seminoles&#x27; athletic department fields 18 teams. They have collectively won 20 team national championships, and over 100 team conference championships, as well as numerous individual national and conference titles.

The athletic department is led by athletic director Michael Alford, who reports to FSU President Richard D. McCullough and the Board of Trustees.

==Overview==
Florida State Athletics began in 1902 when the then Florida State College football teams played three seasons. The 1905 Buckman Act reorganized the existing seven Florida colleges into three institutions, segregated by race and gender. As a result of this reorganization, the coeducational Florida State College was renamed the Florida State College for Women. The Florida State University again became a co-ed institution in 1947 with most of the newly enrolled male students back from service in World War II. Athletic programs resumed and Florida State fielded its first football team in 43 years with FSU facing Stetson on October 18, 1947.

Florida State was a founding member of the Dixie Conference, in 1948, when other southern institutions seeking to create a &quot;purely amateur&quot; athletic conference based on the principle of complete amateurism, with no athletic scholarships. Three years later, FSU left the conference to become an independent, having won ten conference titles including three in football and two in men&#x27;s track and field.

In 1976, Florida State joined the Metro Conference in all sports except football, which remained independent. For fifteen years FSU competed and won sixty-eight conference titles as well as five national titles including two in softball, two in women&#x27;s track and field, and one in women&#x27;s golf.

Since 1991, Florida State has been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Since joining the conference, FSU has won ninety-six ACC titles and nine national titles including three in football, three in men&#x27;s track and field, two in soccer, and one in softball. After the 2005 conference expansion was complete, FSU was placed in the newly formed Atlantic Division.

Florida State&#x27;s school colors of garnet and gold are a merging of the university&#x27;s past. In 1904 and 1905, the Florida State College won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms. When FSC became Florida State College for Women in 1905, the FSCW student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. The garnet and gold colors were first used on an FSU uniform in a 14–6 loss to Stetson on October 18, 1947.

On April 11, 2014, as part of the university&#x27;s rebranding of the program, white and black were added to the official school colors. The addition of the two colors is to better represent the colors present on the flag of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Florida State also uses turquoise accents on special occasions in various sports to honor the Seminole Tribe as the color represents “harmony, friendship, and fellowship” within Native American culture.

=== Mascot ===
==== History ====
The &quot;Seminoles&quot; name, chosen by students in a 1947 vote, alludes to Florida&#x27;s Seminole people who in the early nineteenth century resisted efforts of the United States government to remove them from Florida. Since 1978 the teams have been represented by the symbols Osceola and Renegade. The symbol represents an actual historical figure, Seminole war leader Osceola, whose clothing represents appropriate period dress. The athletic logo, in use since the early 1970s, shows a profile of a shouting Seminole warrior in circle. The model for the logo was Florida State music faculty member Thomas Wright, composer of the Florida State University Fight Song and Victory Song.

The university maintains that they do not officially have a mascot, but use the Seminole name in &quot;admiration&quot; of the unconquered tribe. However, the figures of Osceola and Renegade, as well as the athletic logo, are used in a way that is indistinguishable from other mascots; they are used to rally the crowd at sporting events, and emblazoned on T-shirts and other merchandise.

==== Controversy ====
The use of names and images associated with Seminole history is officially sanctioned by the Seminole Tribal Council of Florida. In 2005, the Tribal Council produced a written resolution affirming their support for the use of their symbolism, and FSU states that they take pride in their &quot;continued collaboration with the tribe&quot;.

In 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association adopted a policy intended to prevent their schools and athletic programs from using mascots and imagery that are &quot;hostile or abusive&quot; to racial and ethnic minorities. This included Native American mascots, and FSU was specifically flagged as a university with potentially offensive imagery. However, Florida State challenged the policy and was granted a waiver based on their &quot;unique relationship&quot; with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The NCAA allows the use even though the NCAA &quot;continues to believe the stereotyping of Native Americans is wrong.&quot;

Though the Florida Seminole Tribal Council made this agreement, they only represent Florida&#x27;s portion of the Seminole people. In 2013, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which has about four times as many registered members as Florida&#x27;s Seminole tribe, passed a resolution condemning the use of such imagery on sports teams, making no exception for the kind of agreement FSU made with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Their statement reads, &quot;the use of American Indian mascots, images, and religious symbols is harmful to all children, and is discriminatory to Native cultures, Native imagery, and violates religious icons&quot;. The American Psychological Association has made similar statements about the negative effects of Indigenous mascots, arguing that they promote stereotypes, establish a hostile environment, and undermine the Nations&#x27; ability to accurately represent their culture. Students and other members of the Florida State community have also argued against the use of Native imagery, posting about it on school blogs and starting a Change.org petition in August 2021 to &quot;ban racist traditions at FSU&quot;.

===Rivalries===
Florida State maintains two traditional rivalries in all sports with the Florida Gators and the Miami Hurricanes. Florida State is the only school in the State of Florida to play both Florida and Miami each year in all sports. Most notable is the football rivalry with the Gators, who hold a 37–28–2 all-time lead against the Seminoles. The series began with Florida dominating the first two decades, but it has since become more balanced. The football rivalry with Miami dates back to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35–13 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played uninterrupted since 1966, with Miami holding the all-time advantage, 36-33; Florida State holds a 13–7 advantage since the Hurricanes joined the ACC and became a conference foe in 2004.

Florida State developed a rivalry with Clemson in the decades after first playing in 1970. Tommy Bowden was named the head coach at Clemson prior to the 1999 season, and with his father Bobby Bowden the head coach at Florida State the game was nicknamed the &quot;Bowden Bowl&quot;. The two programs were then placed in the same division of the ACC after the 2004 season. This rivalry was particularly important from 2009 to 2020, as the winner of the game went to the ACC Championship each year (Clemson in 2009, 2011, and 2015–2020, and Florida State in 2010 and 2012–2014). Florida State leads the all-time series 20–15.

Florida State University was founded with money donated by Francis Eppes VII, a grandson of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States (1801–1809), principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776), and founder of the University of Virginia. As a result, both teams play for the Jefferson-Eppes Trophy in football. With the realignment of the ACC, the Seminoles and Cavaliers found themselves different divisions and no longer play annually.

Florida State has baseball rivalries with its traditional opponents, as well as with Jacksonville.

== Teams ==

Florida State University sponsors teams in eight men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports, generally as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Florida State competes as a member of the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association in beach volleyball.

=== Baseball ===


Florida State&#x27;s baseball program is one of the most successful in collegiate sports, having been to twenty-four College World Series (CWS) in sixty Tournament appearances, and having appeared in the national championship final on three occasions, (falling to the USC Trojans in 1970, the Arizona Wildcats in 1986, and the Miami Hurricanes in 1999).
Under the command of Head Coach No. 11 Mike Martin for forty years, Florida State is the second-winningest program in the history of college baseball. Since 1990, the Seminoles have had more 50 win seasons, been to more NCAA Tournaments and finished in the top 10 more than any other team in the country. Since 2000, FSU is the winningest program in college baseball with more victories and a higher winning percentage in the regular season than any other school. Despite their success, Florida State is still chasing their first CWS Championship, and has the most appearances in the CWS of any program yet to win a national title.

=== Basketball ===

==== Men&#x27;s basketball ====

Florida State&#x27;s basketball program has enjoyed modest success since their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1968. Since then, the Seminoles have made eighteen tournament appearances, played for the national title in the NCAA championship game in 1972, advanced to the Sweet Sixteen round in 1992, 2011, 2019 and 2021, the Elite Eight round in 1993 and 2018, and won the ACC title in 2012.

A total of 44 Seminoles have been selected in the NBA draft with nine first-round picks. Among those first round selections are Dave Cowens, and George McCloud, the first lottery selection in school history.

==== Women&#x27;s basketball ====


The women&#x27;s basketball program has made twenty-two tournament appearances. In the 2006–07 season, Florida State advanced to its first NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen in school history. The Seminoles won the ACC regular season titles in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, the Seminoles made it to the Elite Eight round, the deepest advance in the tournament in program history, matching that run in 2015 and again in 2017.

===Beach volleyball===


Florida State added women&#x27;s beach volleyball as a sport during the 2012 season, competing as part of the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, and have been coached by Brooke Niles, who has been recognized as the AVCA National Coach of the Year, since 2016. They have appeared in four AVCA tournaments and eight NCAA tournaments since the program&#x27;s inception. The team has won seven conference titles and reached the national championship on four occasions. The Seminoles will join the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation beginning with the 2026 season.

=== Football ===

In 1902, the Florida State College in Tallahassee fielded its first varsity football team. The FSC program posted a record of 7–6–1 over the next three seasons, including a record of 3–1 against their rivals from the old University of Florida (formerly known as Florida Agricultural College) in Lake City. In 1904, the Florida State College football team became the first-ever state champions of Florida after beating both the University of Florida and Stetson University. In 1905, however, the Florida Legislature reorganized the state&#x27;s higher education system by abolishing the existing state-supported colleges, and creating the new University of the State of Florida in Gainesville, and the new Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee. Many former Florida State College male students transferred to the new University of the State of Florida (renamed the University of Florida in 1909).

Following World War II, Florida State College for Women became coeducational and was renamed Florida State University in 1947, and the school once again started a football team. After its first season, FSU joined the Dixie Conference, which it won in each of the three years it was a member. It withdrew from the conference in 1951 and competed as an independent team for the next forty years.

Under head coach Bobby Bowden, the football team became one of the nation&#x27;s most competitive football teams, greatly expanding the tradition of football at Florida State. The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993 and 2001, and have claimed the championship three times, in 1993, 1999, and 2013. The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. FSU also set an NCAA record for most consecutive Top 5 finishes in the AP football poll – receiving placement fourteen years in a row, from 1987 to 2000. The Seminoles were the first college football team in history to go wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason) since the AP began releasing preseason rankings in 1936. FSU also owns the record for most consecutive bowl game victories with 11 between 1985 and 1996 and made a post-season appearance for thirty-six straight seasons from 1982 to 2017. The Seminole football team has also won nineteen conference championships in the Dixie and Atlantic Coast.

Florida State&#x27;s football program has produced many players who went on to NFL careers, including Fred Biletnikoff, Deion Sanders, Terrell Buckley, Derrick Brooks, Sebastian Janikowski, Walter Jones, Corey Simon, Anquan Boldin, Javon Walker, Warrick Dunn, Peter Boulware, Laveranues Coles, Brad Johnson, Samari Rolle, Peter Warrick, Jalen Ramsey, Dalvin Cook, Jameis Winston, Darnell Dockett, Dustin Hopkins, Graham Gano, Rodney Hudson, and many others; other notable players include Burt Reynolds and Lee Corso.

=== Golf ===

==== Men&#x27;s golf ====
The Seminoles have made thirty-eight NCAA tournament appearances including twenty-six national championship appearances, finishing as runner-up in 2024, and nineteen regionals. Florida State has won thirteen conference championships. The Seminoles have appeared in fifteen straight NCAA tournaments and were the top seed in the 2015 tournament, a year in which they won a school record four straight in-season tournaments. In the 2021 season, John Pak won the Haskins Award, Hogan Award, and Nicklaus Award.

==== Women&#x27;s golf ====
The Seminoles have made eight AIWA tournament appearances, twenty-eight NCAA tournament appearances including twelve national championship appearances and twenty-five regionals. Florida State has won three conference championships.

=== Women&#x27;s soccer ===


Since adding soccer as a sport, Florida State has made twenty-five appearances in the NCAA tournament and fourteen appearances in the College Cup. The Seminoles won national championships in 2014, 2018, 2021, and 2023, with additional national title appearances in 2007, 2013, and 2020.

=== Softball ===
The softball team plays at the Seminole Softball Complex; the field is named for JoAnne Graf, the winningest coach in softball history. An 8–1 victory over Jacksonville on February 22, 2006, made her only the second coach in NCAA history to record 1,100 NCAA fast-pitch wins. In 1999, Florida State received a softball complex, which also houses the soccer stadium.

Florida State&#x27;s accomplishments include two AIAW national championships, one NCAA national championship, twelve trips to the Women&#x27;s College World Series, thirty-six NCAA tournaments, thirty-nine All-Americans, and nineteen conference titles, as well as forty forty win seasons.

For over two decades, FSU has been one of the most dominant softball programs in the history of collegiate softball. Only five teams in the history of the NCAA have been to more WCWS than Florida State and no school east of Arizona has been to more NCAA tournaments than the Seminoles. Florida State has made a regional appearance every year since 2000.

In 2015, Lacey Waldrop and Maddie O&#x27;Brien became the first players from the school to be drafted into the National Pro Fastpitch league and Jessica Burroughs became the school&#x27;s first number one overall pick in 2017.
===Track and field===

The men&#x27;s track and field team has won multiple NCAA national championships and ACC championships. In 2006, the team had individual champions in the 200 m (Walter Dix), the triple jump (Rafeeq Curry), and the shot put (Garrett Johnson). In 2007, Dix became the first person to hold the individual title in the 100 m, 200 m, and 4×100 m Relay at the same time.

===Non-varsity/club teams===

====Cheerleading====

The Florida State cheerleaders cheer at all football games as well as home basketball and volleyball games. The all-girl squad won the National Cheerleaders Association championship in 1997 and the co-ed squad won the Universal Cheerleaders Association championship in 2023. The dance team that performs at football and basketball games is known as the Golden Girls.

====Rugby====
The Florida State Rugby Football Club was founded in 1970, and plays Division 1 college rugby in the South Independent Rugby Conference, which is not affiliated with the NCAA. The Seminoles won the conference championship in 2012, defeating the University of Central Florida. FSU is led by head coach Michael Gomez.

==Athletic facilities==
Florida State University has invested and continues to invest largely in the athletic centers and facilities around campus. The most visible stadium is Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium which is surrounded by the &quot;University Center&quot;, which houses the university administration, several colleges and departments.

Coyle E. Moore Athletics Center

:The Coyle E. Moore Athletic Center is located on the north side of the University Center and is the center of Florida State Athletics and its 400-plus student-athletes. It is home to the Athletics Administration and support staff and houses the Executive Staff, Business Office, Computer Information Services, Coaches&#x27; Video, Seminole Productions, College of Communication faculty offices and student edit rooms, Academic Support, Student Services, Compliance, Sports Information, Digital Media, Marketing and Promotions, Facilities and Event Management, classrooms, a dining facility with a full service kitchen, and a mailroom. Initially built in the 1950s as a football field house, the original infrastructure of the athletic center plumbing, sewage, and air-conditioning had become inadequate to the demands placed upon it by far more student-athletes and staff than it was designed for. In 2004, the Moore Building underwent an overhaul makeover to match the appearance of the rest of the University Center with a more efficient floor plan to allow for more room for growth. The new facility includes a dining hall, a 15,000 square foot training and rehab facility, and a more than 8,000 square foot tutorial and study hall space. A multi-purpose theater for team meetings, press conferences, and symposiums is also located on the first floor of the Moore Athletic Center. In an effort to enhance the studies of Florida State students, there is also a designated space for athletic-training curriculum and a studio provided for the College of Communication students to gain hands on experience producing work for Seminole athletics.

Albert J. Dunlap Athletic Training Facility

:The Dunlap Indoor Practice Facility is the indoor field used by the football team. It is located adjacent to the stadium, next to the outdoor practice fields.

Bill Harkins Field at the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex

:Bill Harkins Field at the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex is an artificial turf with rubber fill field built near the Flying High Circus on Chieftain Way. The field is an exact replica of what Bobby Bowden field looked like on game days at the time of the field&#x27;s construction. Since then several alterations have been made to the actual field. Bill Harkins, head coach of the men&#x27;s lacrosse team from 2004 to 2013, donated $350,000 towards the construction of the new field. Previously the space was a grassy field that often alternated between dusty and muddy. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs have primary use of the field and use it for their daily practices. The football team and lacrosse teams have secondary use of the field with the lacrosse team using the field for practices and games. The football team sometimes uses the practice field in anticipation of games at stadiums with artificial turf.

Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium

:The stadium, named after FSU President Doak Campbell, hosted its first game against the Randolph-Macon College Yellowjackets on October 7, 1950, with the Seminoles winning the game 40–7. At that time the facility had a seating capacity of 15,000. Florida State began to play at Centennial Field during the team&#x27;s 1947 season and would continue to play there for the following two years (1948 and 1949). Florida State College – FSU predecessor institution – also fielded teams from 1902 to 1904 (precise location of where games were played is not documented). Doak Campbell Stadium, with its original capacity of 15,000 in 1950, was built at a cost of $250,000. In 1954, the stadium grew to a capacity of 19,000. Six thousand more seats were added in 1961. During the Bill Peterson era (1960–70), the stadium was expanded to 40,500 seats, and it remained at that capacity for the next 14 years. Since that time, the stadium has expanded to 82,300, largely in part to the success of the football team under head coach Bobby Bowden coupled with the ever growing student body. It now is the second largest football stadium in the ACC. Aesthetically, a brick facade surrounding the stadium matches the architectural design of most of the buildings on the university&#x27;s campus. In addition to the obvious recreational uses, The University Center surrounds the stadium and houses many of the university&#x27;s offices. The field was officially named Bobby Bowden field on November 20, 2004, as Florida State hosted intrastate rival Florida.

Donald L. Tucker Civic Center

:The Donald L. Tucker Center is the home for Seminole basketball is named in honor of Donald L. Tucker, a former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Special Ambassador for the United States to the Dominican Republic. Prior to the 2000–01 basketball season, the center completed an expansion project which began in October 1998 in which 34 luxury suites and 468 club seats at mid-level in the arena were added. In addition, the upper level seating was configured to offer better viewing and additional concession stands and restrooms were added. The Spotlight Grill, a 450-seat arena-view restaurant includes an outdoor patio and ledge seating for viewing arena events. The multi-purpose facility, which opened its doors in 1981, covers over 22 acres in the heart of Tallahassee&#x27;s downtown district. The Civic Center is only two blocks from the Capitol building and is just across the street from FSU&#x27;s nationally-acclaimed Law School and Center for Professional Development. The complex covers over 18,000 square feet with 119-foot ceilings in the main arena. The Tucker Center is actually three different areas combined under one roof. The main arena, where FSU hosts its home games. The Exhibition Hall, which joins the main arena via a hallway, can seat 5,000 for an event or serve as an indoor display area. The complex also features a terrace, which is popular for outdoor hosting.

Seminole Basketball Training Center
:The 40,000 square foot Florida State Basketball Training Center is attached to the Donald L. Tucker Center and is one of the nation&#x27;s top basketball-only facilities. The $10 million facility opened in April 2002 is home to the Seminole men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs and is truly a first class facility for its players and coaching staff. It provides a permanent home for the Seminoles to practice, hold meetings and watch film. The Seminoles have their own practice floor, locker rooms, coaches&#x27; offices, meeting and film rooms, an expansive player&#x27;s lounge, a tradition room and offices for support staff.

Don Veller Seminole Golf Course

:The Don Veller Seminole Golf course was originally built in 1962, later redesigned in 2004 and is home to the Seminoles&#x27; practice greens, training center and the Dave Middleton Golf Center. The golf center houses the SGC clubhouse and is also the location of the team&#x27;s private facilities. Florida State golfers have a team room, on course workout facility and state of the art training center. The team room / facility is utilized for team meetings, as a study area between classes and practices and as a lounge when the team is not on the course.

JoAnne Graf Field at the Seminole Softball Complex

:The Florida State Soccer/Softball Complex was opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday, April 17, 1999. The event, which was held in conjunction with Florida State&#x27;s 30th Anniversary of Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletics Spring Celebration. JoAnne Graf Field hosted back-to-back NCAA Regionals in 2001 and 2002 and then again in 2004 and 2009. Known as one of NCAA softball&#x27;s best venues, JoAnne Graf Field is a modernized field of play that caters quite well to student-athletes, coaches, fans and other spectators. Since opening in 1999, Florida State has played to the venue&#x27;s home-field advantage. The Seminoles have recorded 384 victories in their 15 years at JoAnne Graf Field. Two major changes were made to the complex in the mid 2000s. On April 2, 2005, former university president Dr. T.K. Wetherell and former Athletics Director, Dave Hart, officially renamed the softball stadium &quot;JoAnne Graf Field at the Seminole Softball Complex&quot;. She joined Bob Heck at Georgia State as the only two active softball coaches with fields named after them. In the fall of 2006, the stadium got a facelift as a Florida State unveiled a brand new video scoreboard for the 2007 season. The team building underwent a multi-million dollar renovation to the second floor which began in October 2008. The expansion to the second floor now includes new offices, a team meeting room, tradition space for both softball and soccer and a player lounge. In 2011 when a new indoor batting facility was constructed, approaching nearly 12,000 square feet. It is a two-story facility that includes a large bullpen, hitting nets and a wide area on the top floor for stretching and other softball activities. Another recent addition to the field was the installation of new wall padding in 2013.

Lucy McDaniel Volleyball Court at Tully Gymnasium
:Tully Gymnasium has been home to Florida State volleyball for many years. The facility, which was constructed in 1956, was named for the late Robert Henry (Bobby) Tully, a 1952 FSU graduate and football player. Active on campus, Tully was a member of Gold Key, Omicron Delta Kappa, the Arnold Air Society and Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He died in May 1954 after battling illness. With a capacity of 1,162, the gymnasium has undergone several renovations in recent years. Prior to the 2004 season, the playing floor was replaced with a new floor. New lighting was added before the 1999 season. Most recently in 2011, locker room renovations occurred to add to the facility&#x27;s appeal. Tully Gymnasium also features new arena-style padded seating with armrests which were installed to create a more comfortable atmosphere for Seminole fans while watching Florida State volleyball. On November 2, 2000, in a special ceremony, Florida State dedicated the floor of Tully Gymnasium to Lucy McDaniel, the first woman in the state of Florida to donate more than one million dollars to a women&#x27;s athletic program. The facility became known as the Lucy McDaniel Volleyball Court at Tully Gymnasium prior to the 2001 season, in honor of the gifts and support that McDaniel has provided to the Lady Seminole volleyball program and Florida State athletics.

Florida State University Beach Volleyball Courts
:In 2012, Florida State started intercollegiate competition in beach volleyball, which the NCAA then called &quot;sand volleyball&quot;. Beach volleyball courts were constructed adjacent to Mike Long Track and the soccer training fields.

Mcintosh Track and Field Building at Mike Long Track

:Named after Florida State&#x27;s first track and field head coach, the complex has attracted some of the top meets in the nation. Mike Long Track and the City of Tallahassee played host to the USA Track and Field National Junior Championships in 1988 and the AAU National Championships in 1991. Florida State and Mike Long Track also hosted the Atlantic Coast Conference Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1992 and 2005. The USA Track and Field National Junior Championships returned ti Mike Long Track in the Summer of &#x27;94. The British Olympic Team, who trained in Tallahassee for the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics, used the facility for all their track and field practices and workouts over the summer. The Florida State track and field team has been calling Mike Long Track home now for 53 years. The 2003 season marked the unveiling of Mike Long Track&#x27;s brand new track, complete with a new surface, wider lanes, faster turns and a larger infield area for hosting field events. Seating capacity was also expanded to accommodate 1,500 spectators. The competition areas were resurfaced before the start of the 2008 season. In the spring of 2008 the newest addition to the facility, an 18,000-foot expansion gave the center a total space of 22,000 square feet. The improvements benefit not only the track and field/cross country programs, but also volleyball, soccer, softball and tennis student-athletes. The expanded center includes locker rooms, student-athlete lounges, medical preparation areas, coaches&#x27; offices and a conference room.

The stadium was dedicated in honor of Dick Howser in March 1988 prior to an exhibition game between Florida State and the Kansas City Royals, two of Howser&#x27;s former teams. As part of the stadium dedication, Kansas City all-stars George Brett and Bo Jackson helped unveil a bronze bust of Howse in Haggard Baseball Plaza. A two-year, $12 million project was completed in 2004 and stadium capacity increased to 6,700. On April 2, 2005, Florida State University dedicated the field at Dick Howser to current head coach Mike Martin.

Scott Speicher Tennis Center at the Donald Loucks Courts
:The Speicher Tennis Center was named in honor of Lieutenant Commander Michael Scott Speicher, a graduate of Florida State University. Speicher was considered the first American casualty during Operation Desert Storm, but was later reclassified by the United States government as missing in action in 2001 and missing or captured a year later. However, in 2009 Speicher&#x27;s remains were found in the Anbar province of Iraq after a nearly 20-year search. The Scott Speicher family was later honored by Florida State at a home football game with a missing man formation flyover from the Navy. By Presidential directive, the facility bears the name the &quot;Scott Speicher Tennis Center&quot;. In 1947, Loucks became Florida State&#x27;s first basketball coach and a year later was named the school&#x27;s first tennis coach. His tennis team was the first athletic team. The varsity tennis courts were named for Loucks in 1981. He served as Dean of men from 1957 to 1967 and was known as a servant of leadership, service and devotion to many worthy causes. With the first stage of construction completed in the summer of 1993, the Scott Speicher Tennis Center at the Donald Loucks Courts opened its gates to the public for the first time at a Children&#x27;s Miracle Network charity tournament. Through its 18 year existence, the Scott Speicher Tennis Center at the Donald Loucks Courts has served as the home courts for all Florida State men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s home dual matches, the annual Seminole Fall Classics, City of Tallahassee tennis championships, various USTA regional and zonal tournaments, the 1994 and 1995 Men&#x27;s Intercollegiate tournament and the annual Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Charity Invitational benefiting Shands Hospital in Gainesville. The tennis center has also been the site for the ITA Summer Circuit for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis in which high school and collegiate athletes participate in singles and double matches.

Indoor tennis facility
:Located on the Southwest Campus, the indoor tennis facility was completed in April 2011 adjacent to the aquatics center, Seminole golf course and the engineering buildings. The multi-million dollar Indoor practice facility serves as an additional playing arena for the Florida State tennis teams. Since the completion in spring of 2011, the facility has served as both a site for training and competition. The building hosts six regulation courts, locker rooms, athletic training room, equipment room, office and lobby. For the next phase, plans are in place to add spectator seating, team lounges, extended locker rooms, offices and a press box. Besides use from the tennis programs the Multi-Purpose Educational Facility is used for academic classes, clinics and camps. The facility is the only indoor tennis facility approved for college competition in the state of Florida and only one of a few in the southeast.

Seminole Soccer Complex

:In the spring of 1998, Florida State&#x27;s dream of a new complex started to become a reality, as ground was broken for the new facility and construction began. Although the new facility was not completed, the Seminoles began playing on their new field in the fall of 1998. The 1999 season marked the first full season in the new 1,600 seat Seminole Soccer Complex, which is regarded as one of the nation&#x27;s best with its new top-playing surface. The two-level Mary Ann Stiles &amp; Barry Smith Team Building houses the coaches&#x27; offices which overlook the soccer field, a reception area, a combined workroom, large team and coaches locker rooms, visiting team locker rooms and training and equipment rooms. The team building will undergo a multi-million dollar renovation to the second floor beginning in October 2008 with an expected completion date in June 2009. The expansion to the second floor will include new offices, a team meeting room, tradition space for both sports and a player lounge. Although the Seminole Soccer Complex is still one of the newest facilities on the Florida State campus, FSU&#x27;s commitment to the success of the soccer program continues to show with the latest upgrade to the facility. Florida State unveiled a brand new video scoreboard in 2006. The Seminole Soccer Complex now has a capacity of 2,000.

===Olympians===
FSU alums have competed at the Olympic Games, winning seventeen medals: six golds, four silvers, and seven bronzes. Florida State has sent athletes to every edition of the summer games since the 1972 Summer Olympics, sending a school-record 26 Olympians in 2024.
==2006–2010 NCAA penalties==

The athletic department emerged in January 2010 from NCAA sanctions resulting from the discovery of academic cheating by athletes in 2006–2007. This discovery involved athletes in ten sports programs who were taking an online course in music history. An NCAA investigation resulted in scholarship limits and negation of wins involving compromised athletes. Florida State appealed parts of the decision. The penalties removed fourteen football wins from the career total of Seminoles football coach Bobby Bowden, yet the coach temporarily claimed the all-time record for Division 1 football wins in 2012 when a far larger number of victories was deducted from the career total of Pennsylvania State University football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno&#x27;s wins were later reinstated, however, following an appeal from the Penn State Board of Trustees in January 2015., leaving Coach Bowden with the 2nd all-time winningest record in Division 1 football.

Additionally, FSU vacated 22 wins in men&#x27;s basketball, an NCAA post season baseball victory, one national championship in men&#x27;s track and field, an NCAA tournament victory in women&#x27;s basketball, as well as other wins in these and several other men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports.

<text>The Florida Gators are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Florida, located in Gainesville. The University of Florida, its athletic program, its alumni and its sports fans are often collectively referred to as the &quot;Gator Nation.&quot; The Gators compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and are consistently ranked among the top college sports programs in the United States. The University of Florida currently fields teams in nine men&#x27;s sports and twelve women&#x27;s sports.

All Florida Gators sports teams compete in NCAA Division I, and 20 of the 21 Gators teams compete in the SEC. The sole University of Florida sports team that does not play in the SEC is the women&#x27;s lacrosse team, which plays a sport the SEC has never sponsored. That team joined the Big 12 Conference in 2024 in advance of that conference&#x27;s first women&#x27;s lacrosse season in spring 2025. The Gators joined the Big 12 after having been a single-sport member of the American Athletic Conference since the 2019 lacrosse season. The University of Florida was one of the thirteen charter members who joined to form the new Southeastern Conference in 1932. Previously, the university was a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1912 to 1921 and the Southern Conference from 1922 until the SEC began play in the fall of 1933.

All Florida Gators sports teams have on-campus facilities, and most are located on or near Stadium Road on the north side of campus, including Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium for football; the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O&#x27;Connell Center for basketball, gymnastics, swimming and diving, indoor track and field, and volleyball; and James G. Pressly Stadium for outdoor track and field. The Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium, the Condron Ballpark, and the Donald R. Dizney Stadium for soccer and lacrosse are located on Hull Road on the southwestern side of the campus. The Mark Bostick Golf Course and Scott Linder Stadium for tennis are located on S.W. Second Avenue on the northwestern side of the campus.

The Florida Gators athletic program is administered by the University Athletic Association, Inc. (UAA), a private non-profit corporation that reports to the president of the university and its board of trustees. For the 2014–15 school year, the UAA had an operating budget of $103,310,001, projected revenues of $104,064,487, and made a $3.5 million contribution to the university&#x27;s general fund. Scott Stricklin has been Florida&#x27;s athletic director since 2016.

==Awards and records==
Beginning in the early 1990s, the Florida Gators has been recognized as one of the premier athletic programs in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and one of the best in the nation. The SEC has awarded an All-Sports Trophy to the best overall sports program in the conference since 1984, and Florida has won the award 28 times as of 2023. Florida is the only school in the SEC and one of four schools nationally to have won a national championship in the football, men&#x27;s basketball, and baseball. Every year since 1993, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) has recognized the Gators athletic program as one of the ten best overall Division I athletic programs in the country in its annual NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup standings, including as runners-up on four occasions. The men&#x27;s athletic program was also the winner of the 2010–11 and 2011–12 Capital One Cup; the women&#x27;s athletic program won the Capital One Cup in 2013–14, and both programs have placed in the top five in the standings on several other occasions.

Among the Gators&#x27; recent national championships, the Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2006 and 2007 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournaments, and the Florida Gators football team won 2007 BCS National Championship Game in football, all in the span of 366 days. Florida is the only school in NCAA Division I history to hold the outright men&#x27;s basketball and football championships during the same school year. In January 2009, the Gators football team won the 2009 BCS National Championship Game with a 24–14 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners. The Florida Gators baseball team took home its first championship at the 2017 NCAA championship, defeating rival SEC foe the LSU Tigers in two games. The Gators won the NCAA men&#x27;s indoor track and field championship in three consecutive seasons in 2010, 2011 and 2012, the NCAA women&#x27;s swimming and diving team national championship in 2010, the NCAA women&#x27;s tennis championship in 2011, 2012 and 2017, the NCAA men&#x27;s outdoor track and field championship in 2012, 2013 and 2016, the NCAA women&#x27;s gymnastics championship in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and the NCAA softball championships in 2014 and 2015. Individual Gator athletes have won 279 individual NCAA championships in boxing, golf, gymnastics, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field. In 2017, Florida won the baseball national championship for the first time. The Gators swept LSU in the best of three national title series. This earned the university a total of 39 national team championships. Additionally, this put the University of Florida in exclusive company. With the 2017 baseball national championship, Florida became only the fourth school in history to win national championships in football, men&#x27;s basketball, and baseball. Florida, along with Michigan, Ohio State, and UCLA are the only schools to ever achieve triple crown status. This also put Florida in a category by itself. Florida is the only Southeastern Conference school to accomplish this feat, as well, Florida is the only school in history to have achieved triple crown status in such a short span of time. Florida&#x27;s first national championships in each of the big three sports (football, men&#x27;s basketball, and baseball) were won in the span of just 21 years.

=== NCAA all-sports rankings ===
The University of Florida has been ranked among the nation&#x27;s top ten NCAA Division I athletic programs every year since 1983–84, an overall ranking that includes both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports – the only college sports program ranked in the top ten in the United States for the last 39 consecutive years. The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) has recognized the University of Florida as ranking among the top seven Division I programs in its NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup standings every year since the NACDA and &quot;USA Today&quot; began awarding the cup in 1993–94. The 2022–23 academic year marked the Gators&#x27; 39th consecutive year ranked among the nation&#x27;s top ten best overall collegiate athletic programs, and the twenty-second consecutive year ranked among the top seven Division I programs in the NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup standings. Only one other Division I athletic program has matched that feat, and Florida has achieved this record while fielding fewer sports teams than many of the other perennially top-ranked collegiate athletic programs. In the 29 years of the NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup, the Gators have finished fifth or better in 22 years, and have never finished lower than seventh; the only other program ranked among the top ten Division I programs every year since 1993–94 is the Stanford Cardinal sports program of Stanford University.

=== SEC All-Sports Trophy ===
Through the end of the 2022–23 school year, the Florida Gators have won 261 Southeastern Conference (SEC) team championships, the most in conference history.

The SEC All-Sports Trophy began in 1973 as the Bernie Moore Trophy and tabulated the league&#x27;s best men&#x27;s sports program. In 1983, the SEC also began recognizing the best women&#x27;s sports program in the conference, as well as the best overall SEC sports program. In 1994, the &quot;New York Times&quot; Regional Newspaper Group assumed responsibility for awarding the trophies. In the 50-year history of the awards, Florida has won 24 women&#x27;s trophies, 22 men&#x27;s trophies, and 28 overall SEC All-Sports trophies.

SEC rival Georgia won the overall 2005–06 All-Sports Trophy to snap Florida&#x27;s record streak at fourteen straight (1990–91 through 2004–05). Florida reclaimed the SEC All-Sports Trophy for the 2006–07 school year, and the Gators have held on to the overall all-sports trophies in every year until Texas A&amp;M ended their streak in 2018–19. The Gators are the first of two SEC sports programs to earn the overall, men&#x27;s, and women&#x27;s all-sports trophies in a single year (the other being Tennessee in the 2022–23 season), and have swept all three trophies sixteen times.

Florida is one of only two Division I schools to hold both major men&#x27;s championships (football and men&#x27;s basketball) at the same time (as the 2006 BCS football champions and the 2006 and 2007 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball champions), and was the first to do so.

For purposes of counting &quot;official&quot; SEC team championships in baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and volleyball, the SEC currently only includes regular season team championships, not tournament championships. The Gators have won an additional 66 SEC tournament titles in these sports which are not included in Florida&#x27;s total of 261 SEC team championships. 

== Baseball ==


Coach Andy Lopez took over the Gators baseball program in 1994, one season after leading the Pepperdine Waves to their first College World Series championship. In 1996, he coached the Gators to a fifty-win season and a College World Series bid. By 2000, the program had seemingly hit a plateau and Lopez was replaced.

Pat McMahon became the Gators&#x27; head coach in 2001 after coaching the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Gators&#x27; 2005 baseball season was the most successful to date, with the team winning the SEC title, and earning a place in the College World Series for the fifth time in school history. The team advanced to the championship round against the Texas Longhorns, ultimately losing two games to none.

Following their 2005 College World Series run, the Gators opened the 2006 season ranked number one in the polls, but struggled to finish 28–28 record (10–20 SEC), and failed to qualify for the NCAA Regionals. After missing the NCAA Regionals again in 2007, McMahon was dismissed.

Former Clemson Tigers associate head coach Kevin O&#x27;Sullivan became the Gators&#x27; new head baseball coach on June 13, 2007. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Gator teams showed immediate improvement and the Gators finished the 2008 regular season with a 30–24 record (17–13 SEC), and received an invitation to the NCAA Regional in Tallahassee. The 2009 squad finished the regular season with a 38–18 record (19–11 SEC), won the NCAA Regional in Gainesville, and advanced to the Super Regional before losing to the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles.

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 2010 and 2011 Gators finished their SEC regular season play with identical 22–8 records, won the program&#x27;s eleventh and twelfth SEC championships, earned a berth in the College World Series in both years, and advanced to the College World Series final in 2011 before getting swept by SEC foe South Carolina in two games.

The Gators returned to the College World Series in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2023, and 2024. In June 2017, Florida won their first College World Series championship, sweeping fellow SEC rival LSU in two games in the best-of-three finals. In the CWS championship rematch six years later, the Gators, though they set a new program record with 54 wins, lose to the Tigers in three games.

Since 2021, the Gators baseball team plays its home games at Condron Ballpark at Alfred A. McKethan Field.

== Men&#x27;s basketball ==


Florida enjoyed limited success in men&#x27;s basketball before the mid-1980s. Coach Norm Sloan&#x27;s Gators were invited to the National Invitation tournament (NIT)—only the second time the team had been invited to a post-season tournament. They returned to the NIT in 1985 and 1986, and made their first appearance in the NCAA basketball tournament in 1987, when guard Vernon Maxwell led the team to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. The Gators received invitations to the NCAA tournament in 1988 and 1989, but Sloan was forced to resign at the outset of the 1989–90 season as a result of NCAA infractions.

Coach Lon Kruger brought renewed success, and his Gators reached the NIT final four in 1991–92. During the 1993–94 season, Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill led the Gators to their first NCAA tournament Final Four following a dramatic overtime victory over the Connecticut Huskies in the NCAA regional semifinal, and a 74–66 win over Boston College in the NCAA Regional Final.

Athletic Director Jeremy Foley hired Billy Donovan as Kruger&#x27;s replacement in 1996. Donovan&#x27;s recruiting prowess was evident early, as he landed recruiting classes with future NBA players Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem and Matt Bonner. Donovan&#x27;s Gators advanced to the NCAA tournament final before losing to the Michigan State Spartans in 2000, and demonstrated a consistency previously unknown to the program as they received invitations to the NCAA tournament every year from 1999 through 2007, a team-record eight-year streak.

Under Donovan, Florida won its first SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2005, when they beat the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC title game.

The 2005–06 team&#x27;s 17–0 start was the best in team history, surprising many with a young, selfless squad led by four sophomores. The team began the season unranked, but won its second consecutive SEC Tournament championship. On April 3, 2006, the Gators defeated the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the NCAA tournament championship game to win Florida&#x27;s first men&#x27;s national basketball championship. Within days, all five starters announced they would return for another season to try to win back-to-back championships.

At the outset of the 2006–07 season, the Gators were ranked No. 1 in both major polls for the first time. The Gators won their second consecutive NCAA national men&#x27;s basketball championship on April 2, 2007, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 84–75. They became the first team since Duke in 1991–92 to win back-to-back tournaments and the first in NCAA history to do so with the same starting line-up. Afterward, Florida&#x27;s four-star juniors—Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Taurean Green, and Corey Brewer—announced their decision to enter the NBA draft.
Donovan&#x27;s Gators returned to championship form in 2010–11, winning the program&#x27;s fifth regular season SEC championship and fighting their way to the NCAA regional semifinals (the &quot;Elite Eight&quot;) before losing 74–71 to the Butler Bulldogs in overtime. In 2011–12, the Gators received a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, exceeded expectations, and advanced to the Elite Eight, headlined by the play of star freshman Bradley Beal and point guard Erving Walker, before falling to Louisville. During the 2013–14 season, the Gators were ranked No. 1 in the nation, won the SEC championship with 36 straight wins during the regular season and tournament games, went on a school-record 30 game winning streak, and advanced to the NCAA Final Four, headlined by the play of four senior veterans: Patric Young, Scottie Wilbekin, Will Yeguete and Casey Prather.

The Gators men&#x27;s basketball team is currently led by coach Todd Golden and plays its home games in the O&#x27;Connell Center.

== Women&#x27;s basketball ==


Women&#x27;s basketball was approved as a new women&#x27;s varsity sport by Florida in March 1972, but began play in 1973 as a club team. In 1975, the Lady Gators debuted as a varsity program under head coach Dr. Paula Welch. The Gators made local headlines in 1976 by winning the &quot;state championship&quot;, beating the other three women&#x27;s college teams located in the state at that time.

While traditionally being overshadowed by conference and national basketball powers Tennessee and Georgia, the Lady Gators have made several NCAA tournament appearances and sent players to the WNBA, including DeLisha Milton-Jones. Carol Ross compiled more wins than any other women&#x27;s basketball coach in Florida&#x27;s history, and guided the team for twelve seasons from 1991 to 2003, but left to accept the head coaching job at her alma mater, Ole Miss.

From 2002 through 2006, the women&#x27;s basketball team was coached by Carolyn Peck, a former WNBA coach who won a national title with Purdue. Peck was fired midway through the 2006 season (though allowed to finish the season) after enduring the worst losing streak of any Gator sport.

Former Gator player and previous Charlotte coach Amanda Butler was named the new women&#x27;s basketball coach on April 13, 2007. During the 2008–09 season, the Lady Gators received an NCAA tournament bid, and won a first-round game before being defeated by eventual tournament champion Connecticut in the second round. Butler resigned after the 2016–17 season.

The Gators women&#x27;s basketball team is currently coached by Kelly Rae Finley, and plays its home games in the O&#x27;Connell Center.

== Cross country ==

The Florida Gators men&#x27;s cross country team has won three Southeastern Conference championships (SEC), and has competed in eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournaments. The women&#x27;s cross country team has also won five SEC Championships (including the most recent), and competed in ten NCAA tournaments. In 2009, the Lady Gators placed seventh at the NCAA cross country championship; in 2010, they won the SEC championship for the second consecutive year.

Coach Mike Holloway is the head coach of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country teams.

== Football ==


The University of Florida fielded an official varsity football team for the first time in 1906, defeating the Gainesville Athletic Club 6–0 in its first game. Since then, the Gators have played in thirty-seven bowl games, won three national championships (1996, 2006, 2008) and eight Southeastern Conference championships, and produced 138 All-Americans, forty-two National Football League (NFL) first-round draft choices and three Heisman Trophy winners.

The Gators&#x27; most prominent current football rivals are SEC Eastern Division foes Georgia and Tennessee, annual SEC Western Division opponent LSU, and in-state rival Florida State from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Florida has historically shared rivalries with Auburn and Miami, too, but those games are no longer played annually and have lessened in intensity.

Since 1990, when Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Steve Spurrier returned to his alma mater as head coach, the Gator football team has won more games than any other program in the NCAA&#x27;s Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The 1996 team, coached by Spurrier and led by another Gator Heisman-winner, Danny Wuerffel, finished with a 12–1 record and won the national championship in the Sugar Bowl, beating rival Florida State 52–20. This win was not without controversy from FSU fans who thought they should not have had to play Florida again. FSU won in the regular season match up 24–21.

Urban Meyer became Florida&#x27;s head football coach in December 2004, and his six teams had great success from 2005 to 2010. The 2006 team won the school&#x27;s second national championship on January 8, 2007, defeating the number one-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 41–14. Quarterback Tim Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, and Florida&#x27;s Tebow-led 2008 team won the 2009 BCS National Championship Game on January 8, 2009, beating the top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners 24–14, for the Gators&#x27; third national championship.

The Gators have won the SEC Championship Game seven times in eleven appearances since the SEC instituted the championship game in 1992. The Gators won their first official conference title in 1991, the year before the first SEC conference championship game was played, for a total of eight SEC championships in the last twenty-four seasons.

The Gators football team plays its home games in Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, more popularly known as The Swamp, the team&#x27;s home field since 1930. Billy Napier is the current head coach of the Florida Gators football.

== Men&#x27;s golf ==


The men&#x27;s golf team has won five NCAA Championships (1968, 1973, 1993, 2001, 2023), and has produced three individual NCAA champions, Bob Murphy in 1966, Nick Gilliam in 2001, and Fred Biondi in 2023. The men&#x27;s golf team has also won sixteen Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships: 1955–56, 1968, 1973–75, 1985, 1989, 1991–94, 1999, 2003, 2011, 2023.

Numerous former Gator golfers have represented the University of Florida on the PGA Tour, and the program has produced over thirty male athletes who have competed professionally.

Buddy Alexander, the long-time head coach for the men&#x27;s golf team, retired after the 2013–14 season. J. C. Deacon was hired in June 2014, and the 2022–23 season was his ninth. The Gators men&#x27;s golf team plays its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course (formerly known as the &quot;University Golf Course&quot;).

== Women&#x27;s golf ==


The women&#x27;s golf team has won two NCAA team championships (1985, 1986), and has produced one individual NCAA champion, Page Dunlap. The women&#x27;s golf team has also won eight Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships.

Former Lady Gator golfers have regularly represented the University of Florida on the LPGA Tour, and the program has produced over twenty female athletes who have competed in the professional ranks.

Emily Glaser is the head coach for the women&#x27;s team. The Gators women&#x27;s golf team plays its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course (formerly known as the &quot;University Golf Course&quot;).

== Women&#x27;s gymnastics ==

Gymnastics was one of the first women&#x27;s sports added at the University of Florida and achieved early success by winning the 1982 AIAW national championship. Since the NCAA assumed sponsorship of the national gymnastics championships in 1982, Florida has typically earned invitations to the NCAA national championships (top twelve teams nationally), and advanced to the NCAA &quot;Super Six&quot; eighteen times. Florida won the 2013, 2014 and 2015 NCAA national championships, finished in second-place in 1998 and 2012, and the team has only failed to qualify for the NCAA championships once in the past thirty-three seasons.

The Gators have won a total of nine SEC gymnastics championships since 1982. The team&#x27;s biggest SEC rivals are Alabama and Georgia, both of which are also perennial national contenders. Coach Rhonda Faehn&#x27;s Gator gymnasts were the SEC champions in both 2012 and 2013, and won the NCAA national team championships in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (the 2014 was as co-champions with Oklahoma).

Faehn coached the Gators gymnastics team from 2003 to 2015. Under Faehn, the Gator gymnasts have been nationally competitive and remarkably consistent—finishing in the top seven every year and winning three NCAA national championships.

The Gators gymnastics team is now coached by Jenny Rowland. The Gators hold their home meets at the O&#x27;Connell Center.

== Women&#x27;s lacrosse ==

In June 2006, the University Athletic Association announced the creation of the new Gators women&#x27;s lacrosse program, citing the growth of high school lacrosse across the country and the increased availability of Division I competition. Florida became the second Southeastern Conference member university to offer lacrosse as a varsity sport, following Vanderbilt University, and played its inaugural 2010 season in the American Lacrosse Conference (ALC) together with the Commodores. The Gators and Commodores continued to play in the ALC until conference realignment led to the demise of the ALC following the 2014 season, after which both programs became single-sport members of the Big East Conference. The Gators and Commodores played in the Big East through the 2018 season, after which they became charter members of the new women&#x27;s lacrosse league of the American Athletic Conference (The American). After the 2024 season, the Gators left The American to become inaugural members of Big 12 Conference women&#x27;s lacrosse. The lacrosse team is the only Gators team that does not compete in the SEC.

The Gators lacrosse team has had success from its establishment, including four ALC regular-season championships (2011–2014); two ALC tournament titles (2012, 2014); both regular-season and tournament titles in all of its four Big East seasons (2015–2018); the regular-season and tournament championships in four of its five completed seasons as a member of The American (2019, 2021, 2022, 2024); seven appearances in the NCAA tournament national quarterfinals (&quot;Elite Eight&quot;); and two appearances in the NCAA tournament national semifinals (&quot;Final Four&quot;) in 2012 and 2024. The Gators have been ranked among the top ten women&#x27;s lacrosse teams in the country each of the last five seasons, and have been ranked as high as No. 1.

Amanda O&#x27;Leary is the Gators&#x27; head coach. Before she was named to jump-start Florida&#x27;s new program, O&#x27;Leary was the head coach at Yale University for 14 seasons, and was honored as a two-time All-American midfielder at Temple University, where she led her team to an NCAA championship in 1988.

In only the second season of the Gators lacrosse program, the mostly-sophomores team defeated the defending ALC champion Northwestern Wildcats to win their first regular season conference championship. The Gators completed a perfect 5–0 season three days later by defeating the Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville.

The Gators women&#x27;s lacrosse team plays its home games in the 1,500-seat Donald R. Dizney Stadium.

== Women&#x27;s soccer ==

Becky Burleigh was hired to be the first head coach since the women&#x27;s soccer team began play a varsity sport in 1995. Under Burleigh&#x27;s leadership, the team quickly became a national contender. In 1998, in the program&#x27;s fourth season, the Gators won their only NCAA national championship by defeating the defending national champion North Carolina Tar Heels 1–0 in the national finals of the NCAA tournament. The women&#x27;s soccer team has also won thirteen Southeastern Conference regular season championships and ten SEC tournament titles in its eighteen seasons of play. In 2021, Burleigh retired as women&#x27;s soccer coach.

Notable former Gator soccer players include Abby Wambach, who was a member of the U.S. women&#x27;s national team and scored the game-winning goal in the final game of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece; Heather Mitts, who played for the gold medal U.S. national team in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China; Melanie Booth, who currently plays for the Canadian women&#x27;s national soccer team; and Danielle Fotopoulos, who played professionally with the Carolina Courage. Savannah Jordan plays for the Portland Thorns and ranks second in Gators history behind Wambach for goals scored.

The Gators women&#x27;s soccer team is coached by Samantha Bohon and rotates most of its home games between James G. Pressly Stadium and Donald R. Dizney Stadium.

== Softball ==



The University Athletic Association decided to create the women&#x27;s varsity softball program in 1995, and the Florida Gators softball team officially started competing in the Southeastern Conference in 1997 under former head coach Larry Ray. Since the beginning of the program, the Florida Gators have had several notable successes, including four SEC championships, 12 appearances in the Women&#x27;s College World Series (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2024), and back-to-back WCWS national championships (2014 &amp; 2015).

The Gators won nine SEC regular season championships (1998, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021), as well as six SEC tournament titles (2008, 2009, 2013, 2018, 2019, and 2024). In 2009, they played for the NCAA softball championship in the Women&#x27;s College World Series, losing to the Washington Huskies in the final round. The Gators again advanced to the finals of the 2011 Women&#x27;s College World Series before falling to the Arizona State Sun Devils. In 2014, the Gators defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the first two games of the three-game Women&#x27;s College World Series to win their first NCAA national championship. In 2015, the Gators repeated as national champions by defeating the Michigan Wolverines in the full three games. The Gators would return to the WCWS finals in 2017 before losing to the Oklahoma Sooners in two games.

The current head coach is Tim Walton; the 2023–2024 season was his 18th as the Gators&#x27; coach. He was previously the head coach at Wichita State University and he played baseball for the University of Oklahoma and a minor league team affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies. Through the end of the 2023 season, Walton has acquired a 926–223 (.806) record, while at Florida. Following the conclusion of the 2018 season, Walton was given a 10-year contract extension.

The Gators softball team plays its home games at the Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium.

== Swimming and diving ==

The Florida Gators men&#x27;s swimming and diving teams have won NCAA national championships in 1983 and 1984, and has also won 41 Southeastern Conference team championships – including a stretch of 13 straight from 1956 to 1968. The women&#x27;s swimming and diving team has won AIAW and NCAA national championships in 1979, 1982 and 2010, and has also won seventeen SEC team championships.

The Florida Gators&#x27; notable female swimmers include three-time Olympic gold medalist Tracy Caulkins, three-time Olympic gold medalist Nicole Haislett, and four-time Olympic gold medalist Dara Torres, who is also the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games. The Gators&#x27; notable male swimmers include Olympic gold medalists Matt Cetlinski, Mike Heath, David Larson, Ryan Lochte, Caeleb Dressel, Anthony Nesty and Martin Zubero.

The Gators have had an international flavor since the 1980s, when the Olympic success of Gator swimmers began to attract Canadian, European and Latin American swimmers to train under coach Randy Reese. That tradition continues in the present day under Gregg Troy, the head coach of the Gators men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming teams. Troy served as the head coach of the U.S. Olympic men&#x27;s swim team in 2012. Dale Schultz is the new head coach of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s diving teams, succeeding long-time coach Donnie Craine in 2014.

The Gators swimming and diving teams hold their home meets at the O&#x27;Connell Center Natatorium and train in the Carse Swimming Complex.

== Tennis ==



The Florida Gators have one of the strongest and most storied women&#x27;s tennis programs in NCAA history, and the women&#x27;s tennis team has won seven NCAA team championships (1992, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2011, 2012, 2017). The team has also produced three individual Gators who have won four NCAA singles championships: Shaun Stafford (1988), Lisa Raymond (1992, 1993), and Jill Craybas (1996). In NCAA championship doubles play, four Gators doubles pairs have won five NCAA doubles championships: Jillian Alexander and Nicole Arendt (1991); Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas (1996, 1997); Whitney Laiho and Jessica Lehnhoff (2001); and Brooke Austin and Kourtney Keegan (2016). The Gator women have also won seven Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) national indoor championships (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2017), and twenty-nine SEC team championships. The Gators have also claimed six SEC Tournament titles (1994, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2016, and 2022) in Men&#x27;s Tennis and 20 in Women&#x27;s Tennis (1982, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2016).

The Gators men&#x27;s tennis team has a winning tradition and has won 12 Southeastern Conference team championships as of 2022. In 2021, the men&#x27;s tennis program won its first-ever NCAA team championship. The Gator men have also produced four NCAA singles champions: Mark Merklein (1993), Jeff Morrison (1999), Sam Riffice (2021), and Ben Shelton (2022). Merklein and partner David Blair combined to win an NCAA doubles championship (1994).

Adam Steinberg is the head coach of the men&#x27;s tennis team, and coach Roland Thornqvist leads the women&#x27;s tennis team. The Florida Gators tennis teams play their home matches at Linder Stadium at the Ring Tennis Complex on the university&#x27;s campus.

== Track and field ==

The Florida Gators men&#x27;s track and field team has won six Southeastern Conference indoor championships, and four SEC outdoor championships. After finishing as the runner-up in both the NCAA indoor and outdoor meets in 2009, the men&#x27;s team went on to win three consecutive NCAA indoor titles (2010-2012) and its first NCAA outdoor title (2012) over the next three years. The men&#x27;s team then went on their own &quot;three-peat&quot; of NCAA outdoor titles in 2022, 2023, and 2024.

The women&#x27;s track and field team won the NCAA indoor championships in 1992 and 2022. The women&#x27;s team won its first NCAA outdoor title in 2022. In addition, the women&#x27;s team has won six SEC indoor championships, and four SEC outdoor championships.

The head coach for the track and field program is Mike Holloway, and he is responsible for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The assistant coaches are Steve Lemke, Adrain Mann, Nic Petersen, Chris Solinsky, &amp; Mellanee Welty.

The Gators men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field teams hold their outdoor home meets at Percy Beard Track, which is part of James G. Pressly Stadium.

== Volleyball ==

The Gators began competing in women&#x27;s volleyball in 1984 under coach Marilyn McReavy, but did not become nationally competitive until coach Mary Wise assumed control of Florida&#x27;s program in 1991. During her 30 seasons as Florida&#x27;s head coach, Wise has compiled a 979–168 win–loss record (.854), and her Gators teams have won nineteen SEC regular season titles and twelve SEC Tournament titles in her twenty seasons. The Gators have made nineteen trips to the NCAA tournament, including eight NCAA Final Four appearances (1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2017). In 2003 and 2017, they advanced to the NCAA national championship final, where they lost to the USC Trojans and Nebraska Cornhuskers, respectively.

Florida landed the nation&#x27;s top 2008 recruiting class, as ranked by Prepvolleyball.com and &quot;Volleyball Magazine&quot;, and signed the nation&#x27;s top recruit and Gatorade National Player of the Year, Kelly Murphy, as well as four other recruits ranked among the top fifty. Murphy garnered First-Team All SEC and a spot on the SEC All-Freshman Team with fellow Gators Colleen Ward and Kristy Jaeckel. Murphy would also gain the SEC Freshman of the Year, AVCA All-South Region Freshman of the Year, the AVCA National Freshman of the Year, and &quot;Volleyball Magazine&quot; Freshman of the Year. She was also honored as an AVCA Third-Team All-American and a &quot;Volleyball Magazine&quot; Second-Team All-American.

The Gators volleyball team plays its home matches in the O&#x27;Connell Center.

== Former varsity sports ==
In the past, the Florida Gators fielded varsity teams in men&#x27;s boxing and men&#x27;s wrestling. Gator boxer John Joca, a &quot;Gator Great&quot; member of the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame, won the NCAA national boxing championship in the 135-pound weight class in 1940. The Gators boxing team, however, was discontinued in 1943 during World War II, and was never revived after the war. The Gators men&#x27;s wrestling team was an SEC-sponsored sport from 1970 to 1979; the team won the 1975 SEC championship tournament and placed second during four other seasons. The wrestling team was eliminated as a result of cost-cutting and Title IX compliance issues in 1979. The University Athletic Association, under athletic director Ray Graves and associate director Ruth Alexander, desired to take a proactive role in Title IX compliance by balancing the number of available men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic scholarships, and the resulting tight athletic budgets ultimately resulted in the elimination of men&#x27;s wrestling program.

== Athletic facilities ==

The University of Florida has invested significant capital and effort in the construction, expansion and betterment of its major sports facilities, including the following outdoor stadiums, indoor arenas, and training and practice facilities:

=== Condron Ballpark at Alfred A. McKethan Field ===
*Completed in 2020, Condron Ballpark plays host to the Gators baseball team&#x27;s home games. Seating 7,000 spectators (with an expandable capacity of 10,000), Condron Ballpark replaced McKethan Stadium at Perry Field.

=== Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium ===
*The Gators football team plays its home games in Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

Since the arrival of coach Steve Spurrier in 1990, the stadium has become nationally known as the &quot;Swamp.&quot; The Swamp has been renovated and expanded several times, and has included a natural grass surface since 1990. With the latest expansions, the stadium has an official capacity of 88,548 people, but routinely accommodates more than 90,000 fans for the Gators&#x27; home football games. The Swamp is the 12th largest college football stadium in America as measured by official seating capacity.

=== Carse Swimming Complex ===
*Built in 1998 at a cost of $2 million, Carse Swimming Complex is a two-story, facility that includes locker rooms, offices, and direct access to the UAA training pool. The swimming complex is located adjacent to the O&#x27;Connell Center.

The facility was renovated in 1995, when 2,500 bench seats were added to the existing 2,000-seat concrete grandstand, increasing the total seating capacity to more than 4,500 spectators. The stadium is located on campus, between the Heavener Complex and Linder Stadium, and was renamed in honor of James G. Pressly, Jr., a University of Florida alumnus and benefactor. The women&#x27;s soccer team plays its home games in Pressly Stadium.
*Percy Beard Track was renovated in 1995 at a cost of $750,000, and the pole vault and long jump pits were moved from the infield to an area outside the track to accommodate the new soccer field. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field teams host their home meets and the annual Florida Relays on Percy Beard Track during the outdoor track season.

=== Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium ===

The O&#x27;Dome underwent a major renovation 2016 with upgraded luxury suites, concession stands, locker rooms, and a new main entrance facing Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, but the seating capacity was reduced to over 10,000 fans.


== Athletic program culture and traditions ==

===Colors and mascot===

The University of Florida began its sports program soon after it was established in Gainesville in 1906, and its teams adopted orange and blue as their official colors soon thereafter. These colors are a probably a combination of the colors of the two primary institutions that merged to form the university, as the East Florida Seminary used orange and black and the Florida Agricultural College used blue and white.

As with the school colors, the exact origin of the alligator (almost always shortened to &quot;gator&quot;) as the school mascot is not well documented. It likely originated in 1908, when Gainesville merchant Phillip Miller chose the animal to adorn pennants he designed for sale to students. The school did not yet have a mascot, and Miller chose the alligator because it is native to Florida and was not claimed by any other school. The football team subsequently adopted the &quot;Gators&quot; nickname in 1911. There are two theories as how the name become synonymous with the university&#x27;s athletic programs. One theory is that the 1911 football squad began calling themselves the Gators in honor of team captain Neal &quot;Bo Gator&quot; Storter. Storter himself refuted this explanation, saying that it originated when a sportswriter in South Carolina described Florida&#x27;s 1911 road upset of Clemson as an &quot;invasion of alligators from Florida&quot; and the players adopted the name. Whatever its origins, the nickname &quot;Gators&quot; (and for a time, &quot;Lady Gators&quot; for women&#x27;s sports) has been used by the University of Florida&#x27;s athletic program for over a century.

====Albert and Alberta====

Albert and Alberta are the official costumed mascots of the Florida Gators. Many variations of Albert have been present at sporting events over the decades, and a live alligator was used for many years. The current version of Albert was introduced in the early 1980s, and Alberta joined him in 1984. They are unique among the SEC&#x27;s mascots as the only male-and-female pair, and are featured together in a life-sized statue outside of UF&#x27;s Alumni Affairs Building.

===Other traditions===
The University of Florida&#x27;s marching band is known as &quot;The Pride of the Sunshine&quot;, and plays at every home football game, and also performs at various events such as Gator Growl and parades. Florida&#x27;s fight song is &quot;The Orange and Blue&quot;. The Gatorettes are the baton-twirlers, or majorettes, for the marching band. The University of Florida dance team that performs at home basketball games and other sports events is known as the Dazzlers.

The &quot;Gator Chomp&quot; is a gesture made by Florida Gators fans and players to show their support of the Florida Gators sports teams. The UF band originated in 1981 and is performed by fully extending one&#x27;s arms, one over the other, in front of the body with the palms facing each other, and then moved apart and together to symbolize an alligator&#x27;s mouth. When performed by fans at home football or basketball games, the chomp is often accompanied by Florida&#x27;s marching band or pep band playing the two-note shark motif from the film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Another football fan tradition, both for home and road games, is playing and singing of &quot;We Are the Boys from Old Florida&quot; at the end of every third quarter. Following the death of Gainesville native Tom Petty in October 2017, his song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; is also played right after &quot;We Are the Boys&quot; while the entire stadium sings along.

&quot;Orange and blue&quot; is a fan cheer that is popular at home sports events, with alternate stadium sections yelling &quot;Orange!&quot;, and answering back with their loudest &quot;Blue!&quot; This can go back and forth for several minutes, with both sections competing to be the louder.

The football team had a long-time tradition of having George Edmondson Jr. — better known as &quot;Mr. Two Bits&quot;— wandering through the stands with a sign and a whistle to pump up the crowd to the &quot;Two Bits&quot; cheer. Edmondson officially retired in 2008, and was made an honorary alumnus in 2005. His final appearance as Mr. Two Bits was at the last home game of the 2008 season against The Citadel.

In June 2020, then university president Kent Fuchs announced that the University Athletic Association and the Gator Band would cease the use of the &quot;Gator Bait&quot; cheer at UF sporting events. While the university found no direct link between its usage of the phrase at sporting events and historical depictions of black children being used as alligator bait, it decided to end the chant due to &quot;horrific racist imagery&quot; associated with the phrase. The decision was reached amid a growing demand for social justice in the United States following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the ensuing protests.

== Notable Gator athletes and benefactors ==




=== University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame ===
Over 250 notable former Gators athletes and coaches have been inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame inductees fall into three categories: &quot;Gator Greats&quot;; &quot;Distinguished Letterwinners&quot;; and &quot;Honorary Letterwinners.&quot; Gator Greats are those former athletes who distinguished themselves during their undergraduate sports careers, and include former All-Americans, all-conference selections, winners of major national awards, individual national champions, and those who significantly contributed to national team championships. Distinguished Letterwinners are those former Gators athletes who achieved distinction after graduation, as athletic coaches or administrators, professional athletes, or in public service or other career activities. Honorary Letterwinners are those persons who are not University of Florida alumni and former undergraduate athletes, but have distinguished themselves by their significant contributions to the success of Florida Gators sports teams, including former championship Gators coaches.

Gator Greats include Heisman Trophy winners Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel, and Tim Tebow; Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jack Youngblood and Emmitt Smith; Olympic gold medal swimmers Tracy Caulkins, Nicole Haislett and Dara Torres; individual NCAA golf champions Page Dunlap, Nick Gilliam and Bob Murphy; Olympic gold medal soccer players Heather Mitts and Abby Wambach; and individual NCAA tennis champions Jill Craybas, Jeff Morrison and Lisa Raymond.

Distinguished Letterwinners include head coaches Doug Dickey, Lindy Infante and Dutch Stanley, as well as U.S. Senator George Smathers.

Honorary Letterwinners include former Gators national championship coaches Buster Bishop, Andy Brandi, Randy Reese and Mimi Ryan, former football coach and four-star general James Van Fleet, as well as medical professor Robert Cade, who invented the sports drink Gatorade at UF in the mid-1960s as a rehydration aid to assist Gators athletes.

=== Gators in the Olympic Games ===
The University of Florida has a reputation and long history of producing athletes who compete in the Olympic Games. Over 160 university alumni, including Florida Gators athletes from over 35 countries, have competed in the Games, winning fifty Olympic gold medals, twenty-nine silver medals and thirty bronze medals (through the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics).

The list of notable Gator Olympians and gold medalists includes sprinters Kerron Clement, Dennis Mitchell, and Bernard Williams; marathon runner Frank Shorter; baseball outfielder Brad Wilkerson; basketball forward DeLisha Milton-Jones; soccer forward Abby Wambach; and swimmers Tracy Caulkins, Nicole Haislett and Ryan Lochte.

Former Gator Dara Torres is the only American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008). At the age of 41, Torres became the oldest swimmer to win an Olympic medal when she won a silver medal in her inclusion in three events in 2008, finishing her career with a total of twelve Olympic medals (including four gold).

<text>The Tennessee Volunteers and Lady Volunteers are the 20 male and female varsity intercollegiate athletics programs that represent the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Volunteers compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In January 2021, Danny White was introduced as the Volunteers&#x27; Director of Athletics.

Men&#x27;s teams are called the Volunteers (often shortened to &quot;Vols&quot;) and women&#x27;s teams are called the Lady Volunteers (&quot;Lady Vols&quot;). These names come from the nickname of Tennessee, &quot;The Volunteer State.&quot;

== Overview ==
The Tennessee Volunteers have competed in the Southeastern Conference since its inception in 1932 and have consistently been at the top. The Vols have adopted a tradition for competing in every sport often resulting in many teams being ranked in the top 25. Tennessee has been known for its football and women&#x27;s basketball programs that have both featured several famous coaches including Robert Neyland and Pat Summitt. Tennessee&#x27;s football team won the first ever BCS National Championship Game and also represents the 9th winningest program in the NCAA. Tennessee women&#x27;s basketball team won the 2007 and 2008 National Championships earning Pat Summit her eighth NCAA national title, which was at the time the most in college basketball. Overall Tennessee has won 158 regular season SEC championships, 41 SEC tournament championships, and 23 national championships in women&#x27;s basketball, football, men&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving. The only Tennessee sport that does not compete in the SEC is women&#x27;s rowing which competes in Big 12. The rowing team formerly competed in Conference USA. They won the 2010 Conference USA rowing championship.
Many of Tennessee&#x27;s traditions come from the early 20th century. Tennessee&#x27;s orange and white colors were selected by Charles Moore, a member of the first football team in 1891. They were later approved by a student body vote. The colors were chosen because of the common American daisy which grew on &quot;The Hill&quot;, an area of campus surrounding UT&#x27;s most notable building, Ayres Hall. The orange color is distinct to the school, dubbed &quot;UT Orange&quot;, and has been offered by The Home Depot for sale as a paint, licensed by the university. Home games at Neyland Stadium have been described as a &quot;sea of Orange&quot; due to the large number of fans wearing the school color; the moniker &quot;Big Orange&quot;, as in &quot;Go Big Orange!&quot;, derives from the usage of UT Orange.

Tennessee adopted the name &quot;Volunteers&quot;, or more commonly &quot;Vols&quot;, because of a now-official nickname that Tennessee received during the War of 1812, the &quot;Volunteer State&quot;. The name &quot;Volunteers&quot; also reflects the Tennessee volunteers who came to the assistance of the Texans during Texas&#x27;s 1836 War for Independence from Mexico. The name became even more prominent in the Mexican-American War of 1846 when Governor Aaron V. Brown issued a call for 2,800 men to battle Santa Ana and some 30,000 Tennesseans volunteered.

The iconized &#x27;T&#x27; that represents the men&#x27;s Tennessee sports programs was introduced by Doug Dickey and then re-designed by Johnny Majors. The once-separate men and women&#x27;s programs allowed the women&#x27;s sports to adopt a separate identity apart from the men&#x27;s by not only referring to themselves as the &quot;Lady Vols&quot; but also adopting the color Columbia Blue into their uniforms and adopting a different logo with a different &#x27;T&#x27; that represents the Lady Vols. The famous Smokey mascot was introduced in 1953 by Rev. Bill Brooks who entered his prize-winning blue tick coon hound, &quot;Brooks&#x27; Blue Smokey,&quot; in a contest at halftime of the Mississippi State game that season. The dogs were lined up on the old cheerleaders&#x27; ramp at Shields-Watkins Field and each dog was introduced over the loudspeaker and the student body cheered for their favorite, with &quot;Blue Smokey&quot; being the last hound introduced. When his name was called, he barked. The students cheered and Smokey threw his head back and barked again. This kept going until the stadium was in an uproar and UT had found its mascot, Smokey. The widely known and unique tradition of running through the &#x27;T&#x27; on game days began in 1965 when Doug Dickey moved the teams&#x27; bench to the east side and had the team enter and simply turning around back to their sideline through a giant &#x27;T&#x27; performed by the Pride of the Southland Band. One of the biggest and most popular trademarks and most recognized sights of Tennessee sports is the orange and white checkerboard end zones that was introduced in the 1960s and reappeared in the 1980s, inspired by the checkerboard design that Ayres Hall features on its outside brick work, and can also be found in the Thompson-Boling Arena on the basketball court.
The Hill is another highly memorable aspect about UT because since the 19th century, &quot;The Hill&quot; has been symbolic of higher education in the state of Tennessee. The university, founded in 1794 as Blount College, moved to &quot;The Hill&quot; in 1828 and quickly grew around it. The main part of UT&#x27;s old campus stands on this rise above the north shore of the Tennessee River. Neyland Stadium sprawls at the base of The Hill, between it and the River. The Vol Navy is one of the most unusual experiences for a game day at any school because only UT, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Washington are adjacent to major bodies of water. Today, approximately 200 boats of all shapes and sizes make up this giant floating tailgate party on the river every fall, and boats begin arriving days in advance of home games

The &quot;Pride of the Southland&quot; is one of the most recognizable bands in the country and has represented the state of Tennessee for the last 50 years at eleven Presidential Inaugurations, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Barack Obama&#x27;s first inauguration. The band has also made more than 40 bowl appearances, including the Sugar Bowl, Astro Bluebonnet Bowl, Citrus Bowl, Gator Bowl, Hall of Fame Bowl, Garden State Bowl, Sun Bowl, Liberty Bowl, Peach Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and the Rose Bowl. One of the most notable college fighting songs in the country is the beloved Rocky Top, the unofficial fighting song for the Vols, which has become a ritual for every sport at UT to play at games.

=== Sports sponsored ===

===Baseball===
The University of Tennessee baseball team has predominantly had a fairly successful program reaching the NCAA Tournament nine times and the NCAA College World Series seven times (1951, 1995, 2001, 2005, 2022, 2023, and 2024). They have produced players such as Todd Helton, Joe Randa, Chris Burke, and the number one overall pick in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, Luke Hochevar. In 2011 Tennessee hired Dave Serrano to replace Todd Raleigh who finished the season with a losing record including one of the worst SEC records in Tennessee history. Serrano, who was an assistant coach at Tennessee from 1995 to 1996, came to UT with a 289–139–1 (.675) in seven seasons as a Division I head coach. Serrano is also one of 11 coaches that have managed to take two different schools to the College World Series. Serrano officially resigned after the 2017 baseball season. Former Athletic director John Currie introduced Tony Vitello as the new head coach on June 7, 2017.

=== Basketball ===

==== Men&#x27;s program ====
The head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball program is Rick Barnes. The Volunteers used to be coached by Donnie Tyndall. Tyndall was fired after NCAA violations at his former school Southern Miss. Tyndall was at UT for 1 year where he went 16–16. Before Tyndall, Counzo Martin was head coach of the Volunteers, who left to go to Cal after a Sweet 16 season in 2014. Martin is believed to have left due too many fans calling for his firing earlier in the season. Before Martin, there was Bruce Pearl who restored the men&#x27;s program and brought it to national prominence until he was fired in 2011 for multiple violations against the NCAA. Through Pearl&#x27;s guidance, the men&#x27;s program was revitalized and claimed the 2005–2006 SEC East Title and closed the season with a 22–8 record and an NCAA Tournament berth. In 2007, the Vols made the NCAA tourney for the second straight year, making it to the Sweet Sixteen. In 2008 the Vols claimed their first outright SEC regular season championship in 41 years. One of the highlights of the 2008 season came when UT knocked off number 1 Memphis, who was then undefeated, to claim the number one ranking in the nation. In men&#x27;s basketball, the most important rivalries are with Kentucky, Vanderbilt, Florida and cross-state rival Memphis. In the 2009–2010 season, the Volunteers made their first ever elite eight appearance. Notable Tennessee basketball players who went on to NBA careers include Allan Houston and Bernard King. The Volunteers had two players, Jarnell Stokes and Jordan McCrae selected in the 2014 NBA Draft.

==== Women&#x27;s program ====

The Lady Vols are led by Coach Kim Caldwell. Tennessee has historically had one of the strongest women&#x27;s basketball teams at the college level, having won eight NCAA Division I titles (1987, 1989, 1991, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2007, 2008), the 2nd most in women&#x27;s college basketball history (UConn has 11). The Tennessee Volunteers women&#x27;s basketball was previously led by Kellie Harper, who played for Pat Summitt, the most winningest basketball coach in NCAA history, having won 1,098 games—more than any other basketball coach at her retirement. Coach Summitt boasted a 100 percent graduation rate for all players who finish their career at UT. Former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball star Candace Parker went No. 1 in the WNBA draft. Tennessee and Summitt also have a rivalry with the University of Connecticut in women&#x27;s basketball. These two schools have consistently fought great games against each other in recent years, occasionally with the national championship on the line. The regular season rivalry games ended in 2007 when Tennessee decided to not sign a contract continuing them, due to a recruiting dispute. The main women&#x27;s basketball rivals for Tennessee within the conference are Georgia, Vanderbilt, and LSU. The Lady Vols&#x27; first-round loss to Ball State in the 2009 NCAA tournament ended their record of having made the Sweet Sixteen of every NCAA Tournament since its inception in 1982. Coach Summitt was honored with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2012 ESPYs.

=== Cross country ===

==== Men&#x27;s program ====
The Tennessee Vols men&#x27;s cross country team has won 25 Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships, 10 NCAA regionals, qualified for 34 NCAA Championships, and won 1 national championship.

==== Women&#x27;s program ====
The Tennessee Lady Vols women&#x27;s cross country team has claimed 5 SEC Championships, 6 NCAA/AIAW regional crowns, qualified for 3 AIAW Championships, and appeared in 10 NCAA Championships. Their all-time best finish was when they placed 4th in the nation.

=== Football ===

Prior to the 2024 season, Tennessee competed in the SEC&#x27;s Eastern Division, along with Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, and Vanderbilt, and has longstanding football rivalries with the majority of them. However, the Vols&#x27; most intense and bitter traditional rivalry is with the Alabama Crimson Tide. The teams battle every year in the Third Saturday in October, though the game is now usually held on the fourth Saturday in October. The Vols&#x27; Super Bowl champions Peyton Manning and Reggie White are among the most famous NFL athletes to start their careers at the University of Tennessee. Todd Helton also played football, in addition to baseball, as a quarterback.

=== Golf ===

==== Men&#x27;s program ====
The Tennessee men&#x27;s golf team has won 3 Southeastern Conference Championships. The current coach for the Vols is Jim Kelson whose steady hand has the Tennessee men&#x27;s golf program thriving.

The Vols are coming off a 12th-place national finish after advancing to NCAA regional competition for a school-best 10th consecutive season. And already this year, UT has captured the prestigious Carpet Capital Collegiate for the first time in school history and the Bank of Tennessee Intercollegiate in a scorecard playoff. Kelson was hired in June 1998 and made almost immediate inroads toward success. The Vols missed the NCAAs that initial season but have been a regular participant ever since, advancing as far as the championship round four times. Kelson has been building this program from the day he arrived on campus. The Vols have won 15 tournament championships in his 11-plus seasons. Five different campaigns produced multiple tourney titles—2001–02 (three), 2004–05 (three), 2006–07 (two), 2007–08 (two). UT also claimed hardware under Kelson in the 1998–99, 2000–01, and 2005–06 seasons. Tennessee&#x27;s SEC victory that year by two strokes over Alabama led to a plethora of well-deserved postseason awards. Kelson was honored with his first SEC Coach of the Year award, Philip Pettitt earned All-SEC first team honors, while Charlie Ford and Chris Paisley were named to the All-SEC second team. One of the highlights was capturing the 2007 SEC Championship, Tennessee&#x27;s first league crown in 17 years. At the event, UT finished with three players in the top-10, including two tied for second.

Last season, Kelson guided the Vols to a top-five team finish in seven of their 12 tournaments played for the highest number of top-five showings in his coaching career. Four runner-up finishes—the NCAA Northeast Regional included—two thirds and a fifth-place result were testament to Tennessee&#x27;s steady play throughout the season. Tennessee then challenged for a spot in the NCAA quarterfinal round of match-play but fell just a few strokes shy.

==== Women&#x27;s ====
The women&#x27;s golf team is led by Judi Pavón. Over the last decade, the Lady Volunteer golf program has been a constant force in the Southeastern Conference and on the national level under the guidance of Judi Pavón, the current National Golf Coaches Association President. Since Pavón became head coach in 2000, the Big Orange has captured 13 tournament titles, competed at seven NCAA Championships, and been a constant presence in top 25 rankings.

Individually, Lady Vols have captured 14 All-America awards, 28 All-SEC nods and 21 NGCA Academic All-America citations under the tutelage of Pavón. In the &quot;decade of success&quot; with Pavón, the Orange and White have continued UT&#x27;s streak of finishing above .500 in head-to-head matchups and competing at the NCAA Regional Championships every season.

=== Rowing ===
The Volunteers rowing team participates with the Big 12 and is coached by Lisa Glenn. During her 12 years at the helm of the University of Tennessee women&#x27;s rowing team, Head Coach Lisa Glenn has helped the 14-year-old program mature into a national power. Now in her 13th season, Glenn has led the Vols to seven appearances at the NCAA Championships, including three consecutive full-team selections in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010. Glenn helped propel the Lady Vols to new heights in 2008, leading the Orange and White to its first-ever Conference-USA rowing championship. Glenn was also named C-USA Coach of the Year for her efforts in helping Tennessee achieve this historic feat. Under Glenn&#x27;s tutelage, senior Laura Miller was named the C-USA rower of the year, while three other Lady Vols captured All-Conference honors.

At the 2008 NCAA Championships, the three-time Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association South Region Coach of the Year guided the Orange and White to its first-ever appearance in a grand final, as the second varsity eight took fifth to record UT&#x27;s best event finish at the NCAA regatta. The team has excelled under Glenn&#x27;s watch at the sport&#x27;s largest event, the Head of the Charles Regatta, held every fall in Boston, Mass. Glenn&#x27;s entries in the Club 8+ race have captured five golds, including three consecutive victories in the event from 2005 to 2007. The Championship 8+ crews have made their mark over the years as well, claiming top-10 finishes three times, and top-15 marks seven times, including a program-best fifth-place finish in 2007. In 2009, the Champ 8+ from Tennessee finished 12th out of 34 overall, placing it in the top eight among universities.

=== Soccer ===
The Tennessee Volunteers women&#x27;s soccer team competes in the SEC and has won four conference championships. The Vols used to be coached by Angela Kelly, who resigned her job on December 17, 2011, to become head coach at the University of Texas.

Under Kelly&#x27;s guidance the then-Lady Vols soccer program became quite the Southeastern Conference powerhouse and a force on the collegiate soccer landscape. Before her promotion to head coach, the Big Orange had never advanced to the NCAA Tournament, claimed an SEC Tournament match, collected any of the league&#x27;s hardware or been ranked in the final poll of any season. After taking over the program, Kelly took home four consecutive SEC Eastern Division banners, three straight SEC regular-season crowns, and four SEC Tournament titles between 2000 and 2008. The ex-Lady Vol boss also owns three SEC Coach of the Year trophies which she collected each year from 2003 to 2005.

Over the previous nine years, Kelly combined strong recruiting, top talent, excellent leadership and team chemistry to create a Tennessee program that made Lady Vol history and collected numerous accolades, both as a team and individually. Kelly compiled a 127–59–16 overall record since taking over at Rocky Top, leading the team to four SEC Eastern Division titles, three regular season championships and four SEC Tournament crowns. In her nine years at the helm, Kelly&#x27;s teams reached eight NCAA Tournaments, making five Sweet 16 appearances. Kelly&#x27;s squads were 10–7–2 in the NCAA Tournament and were nearly unbeatable at home, winning nearly 86 percent of the time in Knoxville.

On January 26, 2012, Dave Hart announced that Brian Pensky would take over as head coach for the University of Tennessee women&#x27;s soccer program. Pensky had coached at the University of Maryland where he was named the 2010 Soccer America National Coach of the Year for guiding Maryland to the No. 1 overall seed in the 2010 NCAA Soccer Tournament.

=== Softball ===
In recent years the women&#x27;s softball team has gained notoriety, reaching the Women&#x27;s College World Series a total of four times (three consecutive years in a row). They placed third in 2005, 2006, and 2010 and second in 2007. In 2010 the Lady Vols made headlines as they reached the WCWS with a low 15th seed and advanced to 2–2 in the World Series just one victory short of a berth in the Women&#x27;s College World Series best-of-three title round, but lost 5–2 to No. 3 Arizona. The four appearances in the Women&#x27;s College World Series have never resulted in the Lady Vols finishing lower than third place in the WCWS. Former pitcher Monica Abbott is the all-time career NCAA leader in strikeouts (2,440), shutouts (112), wins (189) and innings pitched (1448.0). The Salinas, California, native won the U.S. Softball National Player of the Year award and the Honda Award for Softball in 2007. She was also honored by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation as its Team Sport Player of the Year over such high-profile candidates as Kristine Lilly of the U.S. women&#x27;s soccer team and Lauren Jackson of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. In 2011 the Lady Vols returned with a very experienced team that had just been to the WCWS and was one series away from the WCWS championship game. The Lady Vols remained impressive throughout the season staying within the top 10 most of the year and leading the eastern division in the SEC until Florida swept them in the last week of conference play, but the resilient Lady Vols found life in the SEC tournament where they defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 6–5 in the championship game winning the tournament after a five-year drought.

Recent National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) All-Americans from the University of Tennessee include Abbott (2004–07), India Chiles (2007), Lindsay Schutzler (2005–07), Tonya Callahan (2006–07), Kristi Durant (2005–06) and Sarah Fekete (2005–06).

All-time the Vols have 27 NCAA Top-10 marks and 13 Top-5 finishes in addition to 2 NCAA Runner-up seasons. They have been coached by Matt Kredich, the former women&#x27;s only coach, since 2013.

The Tennessee Volunteers men&#x27;s tennis team has won 9 Southeastern Conference Championships, 4 SEC tournaments, and finished as national runner-up three times. The Vols have 8 NCAA Semifinal appearances all-time, most recently in 2022. They have been coached by former player and ATP professional Chris Woodruff since 2018.

==== Women&#x27;s program ====
The Lady Vol tennis team has qualified for 29 NCAA tournaments since their founding in 1977, with their best tournament result coming as an NCAA Semifinal appearance in 2002. The program is notable for being one of only two Tennessee teams (women&#x27;s golf) to never win an SEC title, finishing 2nd in the SEC regular season on 5 occasions and falling in the SEC tournament final 4 times. They have been led by former Lady-Vol alum and All-American Alison Ojeda since 2017.

=== Track and field – indoor ===

==== Men&#x27;s program ====
The Tennessee Volunteers men&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field team have won 18 SEC Championships as well as 1 national championship in 2002. Duane Ross, who assumed his position prior to the 2022–2023 year, serves as the director for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field teams.

==== Women&#x27;s program ====
The Vols&#x27; women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field team have won 4 SEC Championships as well as 2 national championships in 2005 and 2009.

=== Track and field – outdoor ===

The Tennessee Vols men&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field team have won 25 Southeastern Conference Championships as well as 3 national titles in 1974, 1991, and 2001.

==== Women&#x27;s program ====
The Tennessee women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field team have won 4 SEC Championships and 1 AIAW national championship in 1981.

=== Volleyball ===
The Volunteers volleyball team have won 4 SEC championships. Two-time National Coach of the Year Rob Patrick has developed a tradition of excellence since coming to Tennessee 13 years ago. Following his arrival at Rocky Top, Patrick has become one of the nation&#x27;s top coaches and helped the Vols attain levels of success never before reached in Knoxville, as evidenced by NCAA Tournament berths in five of the last six years, including a run to the Final Four in 2005.

With an impressive 24–8 record in 2009, the Big Orange now has won 20 or more matches in six of the last eight campaigns and has done so seven times in a 10-year span. Prior to Patrick&#x27;s arrival at UT in 1997, the then-Lady Vols last recorded a 20-win season in 1988. His nine-year stretch of winning seasons from 1998 to 2006 marked the longest-such run in program history, topping the previous high of seven, set from 1978 to 1984. The Big Orange finished the 2009 campaign with a school-record 16 wins in SEC action, finishing in a tie for second before earning its fifth bid to the NCAA Tournament in the past six seasons where it reached the second round. Following a tough 2007 season, the Lady Vols regrouped to post the third-largest turnaround in NCAA Division I in 2008. Under Patrick&#x27;s direction, UT doubled its win total from 11 to 22 and returned to the NCAA Tournament after a one-year absence. For his efforts, Patrick was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) South Region Coach of the Year, as well as the Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year, for the second time in his career.

During his 13-year tenure at Rocky Top, Patrick has compiled an impressive 267–143 (.651) record, and he became the program&#x27;s all-time winningest coach with a 3–0 victory over Auburn on October 3, 2008. Under Patrick&#x27;s guidance, eight different student-athletes have been named All-Americans on a total of 15 occasions, including Nikki Fowler who claimed honorable mention honors from the AVCA in 2008 before picking up the honors alongside libero Chloe Goldman in 2009. Prior to those awards, the last players to accomplish the feat were Yuliya Stoyanova and Sarah Blum who both picked up AVCA Honorable Mention accolades as well, following the 2006 campaign.

In 2005 the Vols&#x27; women&#x27;s team achieved the program&#x27;s first ever appearance in the NCAA Final Four and highest year-end ranking in school history. During that memorable year, the Lady Vols fought past some early season obstacles and compiled a stellar 25–9 overall record, finishing sixth in the nation after falling to eventual national champion Washington in the national semifinals of the NCAA Tournament in San Antonio, Texas. For his efforts, Patrick was named the 2005 NCAA National Coach of the Year by VBall Magazine. The season before its run to the Final Four, Tennessee put together an equally impressive season in which it emerged victorious in a school-record 32 matches, while dropping just three contests all year. The Lady Vols accomplished a number of goals in 2004, including winning an SEC regular-season title for the first time in school history, defeating Florida, 3–2, on the final day of the season to tie the Gators with identical 15–1 marks. Just a mere seven days later, the Orange and White made it two titles in two weeks, topping UF, once again by a 3–2 score, in the SEC Tournament championship match. A couple of weeks following that accomplishment, the Big Orange won a pair of NCAA Tournament matches for the initial time in Tennessee annals and advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 20 years. Based on the team&#x27;s fast rise to prominence, Patrick was awarded both the AVCA South Region and the SEC Coach of the Year awards, as well as CVU.com National Coach of the Year honors. He was also a finalist for the AVCA National Coach of the Year award.

==Facilities==

Neyland Stadium, home to the football team, seats over 102,000 people and is the fifth-largest stadium in the world. Neyland finished undergoing renovations costing over $100 million. The Volunteers have practiced at the Neyland-Thompson Sports Center since 1989, which underwent an expansion in 2006. The Neyland-Thompson Sports Center features two exterior fields, one indoor field and provides the University of Tennessee athletes with strength and conditioning, dressing, health care, meeting, and coaching facilities. In 2013, Tennessee dedicated the Anderson Training Center and Brenda Lawson Athletic Center; a 145,000 square foot building that includes an amphitheater-style seating room, coaches offices, position meeting rooms, a dining hall, players&#x27; lounge, a barber shop, a 7,000 square-foot locker room, a 22,000 square foot, multi-level weight room, a new training room and hydrotherapy area. In 2014, the Ray and Lucy Hand Digital Studio was added on the ground floor of the Brenda Lawson Athletic Center. The studio is a state-of-the-art facility for athletic video content creation such as online video content and coaches&#x27; television shows.

The Volunteers and Lady Vols basketball teams play in Thompson-Boling Arena, the largest arena (by capacity) ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Both basketball programs practice at the Pratt Pavilion, which besides two full-sized basketball courts, has an athletic training room, a weight room, a film study room, and a place to host recruits. The former home of both basketball teams and the Lady Vols volleyball program, Stokely Athletic Center, was demolished in 2014 to make way for new dormitories.

The Alumni Memorial Gym was another indoor athletic facility. It was built in 1934 during a construction campaign under school president James D. Hoskins, and was replaced by the Stokely Athletics Center in 1967. The facility hosted the Southeastern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1936 and 1937 and again in 1939 and 1940. It is now used as a performing arts center and seats 1,000 spectators.

The Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center, completed in 2008, is a $30 million center that features one outdoor 50-meter pool, an indoor 50-meter pool, a new 50-meter competition pool, and a separate competition diving well featuring five platforms and six springboards. It will allow for 2,800 seats. The facility also includes a weight room, a training room, a team-meeting room, several locker rooms for the Vols, Lady Vols, and two visiting teams, seven offices for coaches, a multipurpose room, an elevated timing booth, and a renovated Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame. It was named for businessman Allan Jones of Cleveland, who gave donations for its construction.

<text>The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are the athletic teams that represent the University of Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish participate in 26 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I intercollegiate sports and in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I in all sports, with many teams competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Notre Dame is one of only 16 universities in the United States that play Division I FBS football and Division I men&#x27;s ice hockey. The school colors are gold and blue and the mascot is the Leprechaun. It was founded on November 23, 1887, with football in Notre Dame, Indiana.

==History of the Fighting Irish==

===Moniker===
The exact origin of the moniker &quot;Fighting Irish&quot; is unknown and has been the subject of debates and research. It was first attested to as early as 1909, and became more popular in the 1910s, becoming the official nickname in 1927.

Prior to that, the athletes and teams at Notre Dame were known by many different unofficial names. During the Knute Rockne football era, Notre Dame had several unofficial nicknames, among them the &quot;Rovers&quot;, &quot;Domers&quot;, and the &quot;Ramblers&quot;. These names reflected the teams&#x27; propensity to travel the nation to play its football contests, long before such national travel became the collegiate norm. Later, Notre Dame was known unofficially as the &quot;Terriers,&quot; after the Irish breed of the dog, and for some years, an Irish Terrier would be found on the ND football sidelines. Other popular names were “the Gold and Blue”, “Nomads,” “the Blue Comets”, “the Horrible Hibernians”. According to historian Murray Sperber, during the 1910s and 1920s, anti-Catholic and anti-Irish stereotypes and ethnic slurs were openly expressed against immigrants, and the press often referred to Notre Dame teams as &quot;Catholics&quot;, &quot;Papists&quot;, or &quot;Dirty Irish&quot;. University leadership wished to distance itself from such names and school publications referred to the team &quot;the Gold and Blue&quot; or the &quot;Notre Damers&quot;. 

There are several accounts on the origins of &quot;Fighting Irish.&quot; One story suggests the moniker was born in 1899 during a game between Notre Dame and Northwestern. The Fighting Irish were leading 5–0 at halftime when the Wildcat fans began to chant, &quot;Kill the Fighting Irish, kill the Fighting Irish,&quot; as the second half opened. In the November 9th, 1912 edition of Scholastic, it is claimed that the moniker &quot;Fighting Irishmen&quot; was given by the president of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Another legend in Notre Dame folklore is that the nickname is inherited from Irish immigrant soldiers who fought in the Civil War with the Union&#x27;s Irish Brigade. Notre Dame&#x27;s claim to the nickname would seem to come from the presence of Fr. William Corby, CSC, the third president of Notre Dame, who was at the Battle of Gettysburg. Fr. Corby served as chaplain of the Irish Brigade and granted general absolution to the troops in the midst of the battle. This is commemorated in the painting &quot;Absolution Under Fire,&quot; part of Notre Dame&#x27;s permanent art collection. A life-size statue of Fr. Corby stands in front of Corby&#x27;s namesake building on the Notre Dame campus. A print of the painting &quot;The Original Fighting Irish&quot; by former Fighting Irish lacrosse player Revere La Noue is on permanent display at Notre Dame&#x27;s Arlotta Stadium. The print also hangs in the office of former head Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly, who said that he had to have the work which captures the &quot;swagger&quot; and &quot;toughness&quot; of the football program after seeing it online. 

One of the first documented uses of the nickname comes from the Notre Dame-Michigan game in 1909 (incidentally, that game was Notre Dame&#x27;s first victory in the rivalry). Reporting on that game, Edward A. Batchelor wrote on the Detroit Free Press: &quot;Eleven fighting Irishmen wrecked the Yost machine this afternoon. These sons of Erin, individually and collectively representing the University of Notre Dame, not only beat the Michigan team, but they dashed some of Michigan&#x27;s fondest hopes.&quot; Notre Dame football historian, John Kryk, later wrote: &quot;With that flowery lead, E.A. Batchelor of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; popularized a moniker Notre Dame teams would later come to embrace - and aptly summed up the greatest athletic achievement to that point in Notre Dame history.&quot; Kryk noted that, according to Notre Dame folklore, Batchelor had overheard a Notre Dame player trying to motivate his teammates at halftime by pleading, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with you guys? You&#x27;re all Irish and you&#x27;re not fighting worth a lick.&quot; 

The term Fighting Irish was used in an official capacity by the Notre Dame Football Review as early as 1917 and by &quot;Scholastic&quot; as early as 1912. While commonly used throughout student and university media at the time, it was still not universally accepted, as evidenced by an alumni letter in &quot;Scholastic&quot; opposing its use in virtue of the fact that most students did not have an Irish background.

One theory associates the popularity of the nickname to the visit from future president of the Republic of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, who had been part of the 1916 Easter Rising and was imprisoned and sentenced to death. He was given amnesty, elected to Parliament and arrested by the authorities again. He escaped and slipped off to America to avoid recapture. Barnstorming the country, the future president of Ireland was welcomed as a hero at Notre Dame on October 15, 1919. Accounts in &quot;Scholastic&quot;, a student publication, indicate that his visit tilted campus opinion in favor of the &quot;Fighting Irish&quot; moniker — though not completely. De Valera planted a &quot;tree of liberty&quot; as a memorial of his visit — only to have it uprooted a week later and thrown in one of the campus lakes by a student &quot;of Unionist persuasion.&quot;

It has been asserted by Notre Dame alumnus historian Todd Tucker (Class of 1990) that the moniker became official in large part as a way of honoring and appeasing the student body, after a confrontation with the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had planned a three-day rally to begin on May 17, 1924. In response to racist and anti-immigration sentiments espoused by the Klan, a large number, between 50 and 500, of Notre Dame students arrived in downtown South Bend to interrupt the Klan&#x27;s parade with violent harassment. A secondary brawl ensued following the weekend&#x27;s incident. Rev. Matthew Walsh, C.S.C., then the university president, having addressed the immediate threats of continued violence between the Klan and members of the university, was able to calm the students’ ire and restore relative peace. 

Francis Wallace, a student press agent for Knute Rockne and sportswriter, tried to popularize the name “Blue Comets” starting in 1923, but soon gave up and admitted his artificial attempt at a lasting name failed. Instead, he contributed to popularize the use of “Fighting Irish” in the pages of the New York Post and the New York Daily News.

In 1927, university president Rev. Matthew J. Walsh, authorized the moniker &quot;The Fighting Irish&quot; as the official nickname. He stated that &quot;The university authorities are in no way averse to the name ‘Fighting Irish’ as applied to our athletic teams. It seems to embody the spirit that we like to see carried into effect by the various organizations that represent us on the athletic field. I sincerely hope that we may always be worthy of the ideal embodied in the term ‘Fighting Irish.&quot;

===Conference affiliations===

Notre Dame joined the Midwestern City Conference (now known as the Horizon League) for all sports except football, basketball and hockey in 1982. They remained in the conference, with the exception of the 1986–87 season, until 1995. They were then members of the &quot;old&quot; Big East Conference, basketball included, from 1995 until 2013. The Irish are currently a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in all sports except for the following:
*Football, in which the university maintains its status as an independent university. It is a member of the Football Bowl Subdivision, and for postseason purposes Notre Dame is the only independent with the privileges granted to teams in the Power Five conferences.

:Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 football team played a full ACC schedule with eligibility for the ACC Championship Game for which they qualified.
*Men&#x27;s ice hockey competes in the Big Ten. Their former hockey conference, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, disbanded after the 2012–13 season due to a major realignment of hockey conferences. The Irish then spent three seasons as a member of Hockey East before joining the Big Ten.

According to men&#x27;s basketball coach Mike Brey, Notre Dame strongly considered joining the Big Ten in 2003, with the decision not to proceed occurring at the &quot;11th hour&quot;.

===Football===
* Head Coach: Marcus Freeman
* Stadium: Notre Dame Stadium
* National Championships: 11 claimed (1924, 1929, 1930, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1966, 1973, 1977, 1988). There are other years (1919, 1920, 1927, 1938, 1953, 1964, 1967, 1970, 1989, 1993, 2012) where various mathematical systems and polls selected Notre Dame as a national champion (some retrospectively), but those years are not claimed by the university.
The school has a comprehensive and nationally competitive Division I athletic program, but it is most famous for its football program. Notre Dame fielded its first football team in 1887. With eleven football championships acknowledged by the NCAA, over 900 all-time wins, seven Heisman Trophy winners, famous head coaches, a 73% winning percentage and the most consensus All-Americans of any school, Notre Dame football is one of the most storied programs both on the gridiron and college athletics in general. Notre Dame is also the only football program in the nation, including both collegiate and professional ones, with every home game being on national broadcast television.

In addition to having the oldest university marching band in the country, the school has many rivalries in football, the most famous ones being with USC, Navy, Michigan State, Army, Purdue, and Michigan. Notre Dame played in arguably the greatest, although certainly not the most-watched (due to Notre Dame games&#x27; already having been broadcast nationally that season as many times as allowed, ABC had to relegate its broadcast to a regional one), college football game in history: the famous 10–10 tie against Michigan State at Spartan Stadium on November 19, 1966. Other Notre Dame rivalries include those with Stanford, Boston College, and Pittsburgh. Former rivalries include a very intense rivalry in the 1980s with Miami (Catholics vs. Convicts), and a rivalry with Penn State, which was renewed and played on September 9, 2006, and again during the 2007 season. The football program is also known for ending the Oklahoma NCAA record winning streak of 47 games. The streak-ending game was a 7–0 victory for the Fighting Irish on November 9, 1957. Incidentally, Oklahoma&#x27;s 28–21 loss to Notre Dame to open the 1953 season was the last loss before the beginning of the streak. 

Notre Dame&#x27;s only trip to the BCS National Championship Game was at the end of the 2012 season, where they suffered a 42–14 loss to the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Fighting Irish made the 4-team College Football Playoff twice, in the 2018 and 2020 seasons, failing to make the championship game both times. In the inaugural 12-team playoff after the 2024 season, the Irish defeated the Indiana Hoosiers, Georgia Bulldogs, and Penn State Nittany Lions, earning the right to face the Ohio State Buckeyes in the national championship game.

Notre Dame&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team is a perennial championship level program which has been consistently ranked in the top 5 in the country for the past 8 years, notching 8 consecutive 30+ win seasons. Former coach Muffet McGraw led the Fighting Irish to 25 NCAA tournament appearances including a streak of 23 straight, winning two national championships and 8 Final Four appearances.

The Irish won their first national championship in 2001 by beating Purdue 68–66. The 2001 team was led by 6-foot-5 center Ruth Riley, a recent inductee into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame. McGraw would take the Fighting Irish back to the Final Four in 2011, beating Pat Summitt&#x27;s Tennessee Lady Volunteers; this was the program&#x27;s first win against the Lady Vols in 21 tries. That win was followed by an upset of the number one-ranked UConn Huskies (making Notre Dame the first team ever to beat both Tennessee and UConn in the same tournament) to advance the Fighting Irish to the 2011 championship game, where it lost to Texas A&amp;M. The Irish would return to the championship game in 2012, 2014, and 2015, losing to Baylor once and Connecticut twice. After an injury plagued start to the 2018 season, which saw four Irish players lost to injury, Notre Dame won its second national championship in 2018 by beating Mississippi State 61–58. Guard Arike Ogunbowale scored the game winning three point shot with 0.1 seconds left, two days after scoring a similar buzzer-beater to knock out Connecticut in the semifinal game. The win was coach McGraw&#x27;s second national championship and 800th career win.

===Fencing===
The Notre Dame men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing teams have won 13 national titles — the men&#x27;s team won titles in 1977, 1978 and 1986 while the women&#x27;s team won the 1987 title. After the NCAA replaced the individual men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national titles with a combined fencing championship, Notre Dame won national titles in 1994, 2003, 2005, 2011, and most recently, in 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, and 2023. During the 2010 regular season, Notre Dame went undefeated in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing. Notre Dame alumna Mariel Zagunis became the first U.S. fencer to win an Olympic gold medal in 100 years in 2004 and the first U.S. women&#x27;s fencer to win a gold medal, and Nick Itkin became the first American to win a US championship, NCAA championship, and Junior World championship all in the same year.

Notre Dame is one of only three schools with multiple national titles, the others being North Carolina (21) and Portland (2). Notre Dame also ranks second in all-time title game appearances (8) behind North Carolina (23). ND&#x27;s women&#x27;s soccer program started in 1988 under coach Chris Petrucelli. Their 1995 Big East title was the university&#x27;s first in any sport. That same year, Petrucelli&#x27;s squad, under the leadership of Cindy Daws, won the program&#x27;s first national title, defeating Portland 1–0. Notre Dame&#x27;s current coach, Randy Waldrum, took over the program in 1999 and has maintained the Fighting Irish&#x27;s success, winning the national title in 2004 by beating UCLA 4–3 as well as capturing six Big East titles. Waldrum&#x27;s 2010 squad won the school&#x27;s third national title, going 21-2-2 and posting 15 shutouts and became the lowest ranked team to do so, beating undefeated Stanford in a 1–0 decision. In doing so, they outscored their postseason opponents 15–1. They also reached the College Cup for the 5th straight year, a school record. Their senior class won 87 matches in their 4 years, the most in that span. Three Notre Dame players have won the Hermann Trophy, given to the United States&#x27; best male and female collegiate soccer players. They are Cindy Daws (1996), Anne Mäkinen (2000) and Kerri Hanks (2006, 2008). Hanks is one of only four players to win the award twice. Notre Dame is also one of only two schools with three or more different Hermann Trophy recipients.

===Men&#x27;s golf===
The men&#x27;s golf team has won 11 conference championships:
*Horizon League (3): 1988–89, 1995
*Big East Conference (8): 1995–97, 2004–06, 2011–12

They won the NCAA Championship in 1944.

==Club sports==

===Robotic Football===
Founded in 2012, the Notre Dame Robotic Football Club (NDRFC) was the first ever Robotic Football Program as the sport was invented on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. The Notre Dame Robotic Football Club has won 4 National Championships and 2 Combine Championships.

===Rugby===
Founded in 1961, the Notre Dame rugby club was one of the oldest college rugby clubs in the Midwest, before the club was disbanded in 1995. Notre Dame reinstated rugby in 2007, however, due in part to the &quot;explosive growth of rugby in the nation&#x27;s Catholic high schools&quot; and Notre Dame&#x27;s desire to offer a program to attract rugby-playing students. Notre Dame began the 2007–08 season in Division 2, but their 8–1–1 record merited a promotion to Division 1 in the spring of 2008.

Notre Dame finished the 2010–11 season ranked 19th in the nation. Notre Dame&#x27;s rugby program has the support and commitment of the school and alumni, with an endowment fund rumored to be over $1 million. The team is coached by Justin Hickey. Notre Dame also plays every year in the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC). The CRC is the highest profile college rugby competition in the United States, broadcast live on NBC each year. Notre Dame finished 10th in the 2011 CRC, with wins over Boston College, Ohio State and Navy.

==Other sports==
John A. Kromkowski, (BA &#x27;60) (MA &#x27;61) (Phd &#x27;72), won the National Intercollegiate Men&#x27;s Singles Table Tennis championship in 1959 defeating Paul S. Kochanowski (BA &#x27;61) 3–0. Playing together Kromkowski and Kochanowski won the Men&#x27;s Doubles championship that year and they won the &quot;Teams&quot;.

<text>The Ohio State Buckeyes are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent Ohio State University, located in Columbus, Ohio. The athletic programs are named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio buckeye. The Buckeyes participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division I in all sports and the Big Ten Conference in most sports. The Ohio State women&#x27;s ice hockey team competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The school colors are scarlet and gray. The university&#x27;s mascot is Brutus Buckeye. &quot;THE&quot; is the official trademark of the Ohio State University merchandise. Led by its football program, the Buckeyes have the largest overall sports endowment of any campus in North America.

Ohio State is one of only seven universities to have won an NCAA national championship in baseball and men&#x27;s basketball, and be recognized as a national champion in football. Ohio State has also won national championships in women&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, men&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, men&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s gymnastics, men&#x27;s fencing, women&#x27;s rowing, co-ed fencing, co-ed and women&#x27;s pistol, synchronized swimming, and wrestling. Since the inception of the Athletic Director&#x27;s Cup, Ohio State has finished in the top 25 each year, including top 6 finishes in three of the last five years. During the 2005–06 school year Ohio State became the first Big Ten team to win conference championships in football, men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s basketball in the same season. This feat repeated in the 2006–07 season, which also included a February 25, 2007 men&#x27;s basketball game which saw the Buckeyes defeat the Wisconsin Badgers in the Big Ten&#x27;s first basketball game between the number one and number two ranked squads in the nation.

A few of the many outstanding sports figures who were student athletes at Ohio State include Jesse Owens, &quot;The Buckeye Bullet&quot; (track and field), John Havlicek, Jerry Lucas, and Katie Smith (basketball), Frank Howard (baseball), Jack Nicklaus (golf), Archie Griffin (football running back, the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner), and Chic Harley (three-time All-American football running back). Hall of Fame coaches at Ohio State have included Paul Brown and Woody Hayes (football), Fred Taylor (men&#x27;s basketball). Notable sports figures in Ohio State history may be inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame.

== Sports sponsored ==

===Baseball===
Ohio State has played baseball since 1881, winning a national championship in 1966 along with 16 Big Ten regular-season titles and eight Big Ten tournament titles. The Buckeyes baseball team was the first Ohio State sports team. The team is currently coached by Greg Beals and play their home games at Bill Davis Stadium, which opened in 1997. Going into the 2008 season the Buckeyes all-time record is 2228–1427–38. Notable alumni include Frank Howard, Nick Swisher and two time All-American Steve Arlin.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The Ohio State men&#x27;s basketball team has played in 10 NCAA Final Fours, winning the championship in 1960, when they were led by Basketball Hall of Famers Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek, and Bob Knight off the bench. A Buckeye has been named first team All-American 23 times, including five two-time All-Americans and one three-time All-American. Between 1960 and 1964, Ohio State won five consecutive Big Ten championships, an achievement that has yet to be matched.
In 2004, Ohio State fired men&#x27;s basketball coach Jim O&#x27;Brien for recruiting violations and self-imposed a one-year penalty, including a ban on post-season play and reduction of scholarships. In light of these University self-imposed penalties, the NCAA Division I Committee on infractions merely placed Ohio State on three years probation for the violations, and gave heavier penalties to Coach O&#x27;Brien and a former assistant coach. The lightness of this judgment was seen as encouragement for schools to be proactive in responding to violations. Nevertheless, O&#x27;Brien successfully sued Ohio State for improper termination. Thad Matta took over O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s spot in 2004. Ohio State recruited such talents as Greg Oden, and Mike Conley Jr. to start the 2006–2007 year. The Buckeyes finished the season with a 27–3 record; won the Big Ten tournament, and earned a number 1 seed for the NCAA tournament. After a very close game with state rival Xavier, and a thrilling 20 point come from behind victory against the Tennessee Volunteers, the Buckeyes managed to hold off Georgetown Hoyas 67–60 to reach the Championship Game for the first time since 1962, which they lost to defending NCAA champions Florida Gators, 84–75. Following years saw continued success for the Buckeyes. They won the Big Ten Championship in both the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 season, and reached the Final Four in 2011–2012 before losing to Kansas. The Buckeyes reached the Elite Eight in 2012–2013, losing to Wichita State. 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 both saw early exits from the NCAA tournament.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
Currently coached by Kevin McGuff, the Ohio State women&#x27;s basketball team plays its home games in the Value City Arena, which they moved into in 1998. Prior to 1998, they played at St. John Arena. They have won 10 Big Ten titles, which is the most in the conference and have 14 appearances in the NCAA tournament, the most recent being in 2016.

In 1993 they lost to the Texas Tech Lady Raiders 84–82 for the NCAA championship, while they captured the NIT championship in 2001, beating the New Mexico Lobos 62–61. Notable alumni include former All-Americans Katie Smith and Jessica Davenport.

===Fencing===
Ohio State won its first title in 1942, when the NCAA had only men&#x27;s fencing. Ohio State won the NCAA championships in fencing in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing, combined, in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Israeli Boaz Ellis won the NCAA title in men&#x27;s foil in 2004, 2005 and 2006 for Ohio State, the first NCAA foil fencer to win three individual NCAA titles since 1963.

In April 2022, the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions panel, upon the conclusion of an investigation, found that the fencing team&#x27;s head coach Vladimir Nazlymov had violated NCAA head coach responsibility rules, and was guilty of aggravated level I violations. Further, he violated ethical conduct rules, by ignoring several requests that had been made to him to cooperate with the NCAA investigation. The panel found that: &quot;The head fencing coach violated fundamental, well-known bylaws. Worse, the head fencing coach received relevant education on the exact areas of the violations as they were occurring, but continued to commit the same violations and, in some circumstances, concealed them from compliance staff.&quot; The NCAA said Nazlymov arranged, provided, or directed other coaches to give more than $6,000 in recruiting inducements to three fencers. Two of the prospects also received free meals and free private lessons from Nazylmov, which allowed OSU coaches to observe the fencers, and constituted impermissible tryouts, and received other inducements. It also found that under Nazlymov&#x27;s direction, in addition 18 student fencers also received impermissible benefits worth over $8,000, resulting in them competing while ineligible.

The Ohio State fencing team was placed on four years of probation for NCAA violations committed between 2015 and 2019. In addition, the OSU athletic department was fined, and the OSU fencing program budget was reduced by 3%. The fencing program scholarship program was reduced by 10% for the 2022–23 academic year. Team wins and championships, and individual records for affected fencers, were vacated, including the 2016 and 2017 second-place finishes and a 2018 third-place finish in the NCAAs for the fencing team, and Midwest Fencing Conference championships in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

===Football===
The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won nine national championships, including seven from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches&#x27; Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award.

===Golf===
Ohio State&#x27;s two golf courses, the Scarlet and the Gray, were completed in 1938. The Scarlet was designed by architect Alister MacKenzie, who designed the Masters course at Augusta National. However, his original design was not implemented fully, and the greens were the only part of the course that truly resembled his designs. Golf magazines annually rate the Scarlet Course as one of the top collegiate courses in the nation. The Scarlet recently underwent a $4.2 million renovation under the supervision of Jack Nicklaus. Ohio State has won the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Golf Championships in 1945 and 1979. Five times, Buckeye men have won the NCAA golf individual championship: John Lorms in 1945, Tom Nieporte in 1951, Robert Jones in 1956, Jack Nicklaus in 1961 and Clark Burroughs in 1985. They have won 23 Big Ten Conference championships. In 1952, Mary Ann Villega won the women&#x27;s individual intercollegiate golf championship on her home course (an event conducted by the Division of Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports (DGWS)—which later evolved into the current NCAA women&#x27;s golf championship). Ohio State was host to the first eight women&#x27;s individual national title tournaments.

===Men&#x27;s gymnastics===

The Ohio State gymnastics team has won three national titles and fifteen Big Ten titles, and has produced 5 Nissen Award winners (The Heisman Trophy of Men&#x27;s Gymnastics). The team is currently coached by Rustam Sharipov. The Buckeyes have all their competitions at the Covelli Center in Columbus, Ohio.

Some of the more notable Buckeye alumni include Don Perry, the first OSU All-American in the sport (Trampoline – 1954 – 4th place), brothers Seth and Noah Riskin – co-national champions (Parallel Bars – 1985 – 1st place), and Mike Racanelli – Ohio State&#x27;s first Nissen winner in 1990. Racanelli also went on to win Gymnastic&#x27;s first &quot;Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year&quot; Award that same year, given out annually to the athlete who displays the best performance in his sport (regardless of grade).

Following later in Racanelli&#x27;s footsteps were other Nissen winners Kip Simons (1994), Blaine Wilson (1997) and Jamie Natalie (2001). Blaine Wilson (1995, 1996, 1997) and Jamie Natalie (2000, 2001) also went on to win &quot;Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year&quot;. Raj Bhavsar was the only other Men&#x27;s Gymnast to win &quot;Ohio State Athlete of the Year&quot; which he accomplished in 2002.

On the Olympic and World Championship stage, OSU Men&#x27;s Gymnastics is well represented, by gymnasts and coaches. The Olympian list includes: Miles Avery (asst coach 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008), Peter Kormann (Athlete in 1976, Head Coach 1996, 2000), Raj Bhavsar (2004, 2008), Jamie Natalie (2000), Gil Pinto (1988), Kip Simons (1994), Blaine Wilson (1996, 2000, 2004) and Alec Yoder (2020).

Two gymnasts who trained at the Ohio State facilities under coach Miles Avery, but were not NCAA Athletes due to eligibility rules, were Paul and Morgan Hamm – twin brothers from Wisconsin. Paul later went on to win the first ever Olympic gold medal in the Men&#x27;s Gymnastics All-Around competition for the United States.

In 2011, Senior co-captain, Brandon Wynn, won his second national championship on rings. Brandon Wynn, Ty Echard, Kris Done and Jeff Treleaven earned All-America honors. In all, the seven All-America honors tie the second-best single-season performance in program history and are the most laurels since the 2005 campaign.

===Ice hockey===
The Ohio State men&#x27;s ice hockey team was established in 1961 and played at the Ohio State Ice Rink until 1999, when they moved into Value City Arena. The Buckeyes competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) through the 2012–2013 season. After Penn State added men&#x27;s ice hockey as a Division I sport in 2012, the Big Ten had enough teams to sponsor its own hockey conference and began play in the 2013–2014 season.

The Buckeyes won one conference championship in 1972, the first year of the CCHA, and won the conference tournament in 1974 and 2004. The Buckeyes have made it to the NCAA tournament in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2009, and went to the semi-finals in 1998. In 2006, they retired Paul Pooley&#x27;s #22, the only number to be retired by the hockey program to date.

The Ohio State women&#x27;s ice hockey team was started in 1999 and competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The Buckeyes have three NCAA postseason appearances, 2018, 2020, and 2022. In their first, the Buckeyes made it to the Frozen Four before being beaten by the Clarkson Golden Knights. They received an autobid to the tournament in 2020 after winning the conference tournament for the first time before COVID-19 cancelled the NCAA tournament. In the 2022 Frozen Four, the Buckeyes defeated the Yale Bulldogs to advance to their first national championship. In the national championship, the Buckeyes defeated the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs by a score of 3–2 to win their first ever national championship.
 Notable Buckeye alumni include Olympians Emma Laaksonen, Tessa Bonhomme, and Lisa Chesson.

Ohio State also has taken at least 61 individual honors in that span, including 11 by Karen and Sarah Josephson. Head Coach Holly Vargo-Brown led the team to their 32nd total championship in 2019, the most of any Ohio State varsity sport.

===Tennis===
The Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Varsity Tennis teams have shown success both individually and as a team. Both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams share the outdoor tennis facility, the Stickney Tennis Center, dedicated in 1993. When the weather takes them indoors, both teams play at the Varsity Tennis Center, which was recently completed in November 2007. The outdoor facility has 12 courts and the indoor has six courts and are both located in Columbus, Ohio.

He has been coaching Ohio State since the 2006–2007 wrestling season. His coaching ability led the Buckeye Wrestling team to 3 Big Ten titles, an NCAA title in 2015 and 5 NCAA runners-up finishes. The team has a practice facility named The Jennings Center and competes on campus in Covelli Arena. Two-time NCAA wrestling champion Jeffrey Jaggers, or commonly referred to as J Jaggers, made a seamless transition from student-athlete to coach in 2009–10 as the volunteer assistant coach.

==Club sports==

College club sports in the United States are any sports offered at a university or college in the United States that compete competitively with other universities, or colleges, but are not regulated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and do not have varsity status. In some cases, club sports have junior varsity status. Oftentimes, students who play club sports later move on to play the same sport at the varsity level, or vice versa. Collegiate club sports can exist at schools that do have teams that are part of the NCAA or NAIA. Many times, club sports are student-run and receive little financial aid from the school. An estimated 2 million student-athletes compete in club sports.

Typically, most sports offered at universities and offered in youth leagues are also available as a collegiate club sport. However, the variety of sports offered is often related to the size of the school. Collegiate club sports offer college athletes the ability to play at a competitive level, but without the time commitment generally required for a sport governed by the NCAA. The tryout procedure for club sports varies from school to school and from sport to sport.

===Basketball === 
Collegiate Club Basketball is associated with the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association, with regional qualifying and a national tournament every year. The head coach of the Ohio State Men&#x27;s Club Basketball team is Eddie Days, who played for Ohio State Buckeyes men&#x27;s basketball from 2009 to 2011. Ohio State Men&#x27;s Club Basketball has won three national championships (2016, 2018, 2019).

In 2016, Ohio State defeated James Madison University in the national championship to win their first title. The Most Valuable Player of the tournament was Ohio State&#x27;s Ryan Murray, who played college basketball at Centre College before transferring to Ohio State. In 2018, Ohio State defeated Harvard University in the national championship and the Most Valuable Player was Ohio State&#x27;s Nick Moschetti, who played college basketball at Purdue University Fort Wayne before transferring to Ohio State. In 2019, Ohio State defeated The University of Houston in the national championship to win back-to-back titles, and their third national championship in four years. The Most Valuable Player of the 2019 Tournament was Ohio State&#x27;s Evan Grootenhuis.

The 2020 Club Basketball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ohio State was named league champion for the season, despite a majority of games not being played. No national champion was crowned.

=== Football ===
The Ohio State Club Football team, founded in 2009, gives Ohio State students without athletic scholarships the opportunity to play full-contact, 11-on-11 football with largely NCAA rules. Although not affiliated with the NCAA program, multiple former players such as Chris Booker, De&#x27;Shawn White, Eli Goins and others have gone on to walk-on to the NCAA team. The Ohio State Club Football program joined the National Club Football Association in 2012 and has won three NCFA national championships, going back-to-back in 2019 and 2021 (no games played in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and winning again in 2024. The Buckeyes are one of just two programs to repeat as national champions (Coppin State 2012-2013) and the only program to boast three national championships.

In addition to their three national titles, the Buckeyes have won five conference titles (2019, 2021–2024) and two division titles (2018, 2019) all under current Head Coach, James Grega Jr. Ohio State has also had 109 players named to NCFA All-American teams since its inception, including quarterback Kellyn Gerenstein, who won the league&#x27;s Offensive MVP award in 2019 and 2022 and the NCFA national championship game MVP Award in 2021. Gerenstein is the only player in NCFA history to win national league MVP honors twice. 

===Rugby===
Founded in 1966, Ohio State&#x27;s Rugby Football Club plays college rugby in Division 1-A in the Big Ten Universities conference against traditional Big 10 rivals such as Michigan. The Buckeyes are led by head coach Ron Bowers, who played rugby as a Buckeye, earning All-American honors in 1991. The Buckeyes best performances were in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, when they finished third in the nation in both seasons.

More recently, Ohio State has appeared in the Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament broadcast live on NBC, finishing 7th in 2010 and 14th in 2011. The Buckeyes were led in those two tournaments by Nate Ebner, who was named to the competition&#x27;s All Tournament Team in 2010 and 2011, before entering the 2012 NFL draft and signing with the New England Patriots. The Buckeyes finished the 2010–11 season ranked 23rd in the country. Ohio State finished third at the 2012 Big Ten 7s, missing out on qualification to the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.

=== Tennis ===
The Ohio State club tennis team competes in the national USTA Tennis on Campus league and won the national championship in 2018, defeating the University of North Carolina.

=== Water Polo ===

==Media==

On April 2, 2009, Ohio State signed a 10-year media-rights agreement with IMG College (now a part of Learfield IMG College) and RadiOhio (former owner of the school&#x27;s radio network flagship WBNS/WBNS-FM in Columbus, and now a part of Tegna Inc.), worth nearly $128 million, the largest such agreement in college sports.

==The Ohio State University Marching Band==
The Ohio State University Marching Band (nicknamed &quot;The Best Damn Band In The Land&quot;) is currently under direction of Dr. Christopher Hoch. This all brass band has 228 members, and was first formed in 1878. The band has traditions including a field march that forms a &quot;Script Ohio&quot;, during which, a senior sousaphone player gets to &quot;dot the i&quot; in the word Ohio.

==School colors==
The Ohio State school colors of scarlet and gray were chosen by a committee of three students (Curtis C. Howard, Harwood R. Pool, and Alice Townshend) prior to the school&#x27;s first graduation ceremony in 1878. The committee&#x27;s original recommendation was to be orange and black. The committee soon discovered that Princeton already used the colors, however, and changed their recommendation. For this reason some references claim that Ohio State&#x27;s original school colors were orange and black. This claim is not quite accurate, in that the committee never filed the original report with that recommendation.

The dotting of the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;Script Ohio&quot; by a sousaphone (tuba) player who high-kicks out and does a giant bow to the crowd was voted the #1 greatest sports tradition ever, in Athlon Sports, ESPN, and &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot;

<doc id="965018" wikidata="Q3490794" url="?curid=965018" title="Oklahoma Sooners">
<text>The Oklahoma Sooners are the athletic teams that represent the University of Oklahoma, located in Norman. The 19 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity teams are called the &quot;Sooners&quot;, a reference to a nickname given to the early participants in the Land Run of 1889, which initially opened the Unassigned Lands in the future state of Oklahoma to non-native settlement. The university&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Division I in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The university&#x27;s current athletic director is Joe Castiglione.

The Sooners have won 44 team national championships. In 2002, the University of Oklahoma was ranked as the third best college sports program in America by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

== Sports sponsored ==
The University of Oklahoma was a charter member of the Southwest Athletic Conference (SWC) during its formation in 1914. Five years later, in 1919, OU left the SWC and joined the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association. In 1928, this conference split, and OU remained aligned with the teams that formed the Big Six Conference. Over the next 31 years, more schools were added and the conference underwent several name changes, incrementing the number each time up to the Big Eight Conference where it remained until 1996. Four Texas schools joined with the members of Big Eight to form the current Big 12 Conference.

In July 2021, Oklahoma and the University of Texas at Austin accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference after the two universities had reached out the conference. In May 2023, it was announced that the two universities had approved the necessary contractual agreements with both conferences in order officially join the SEC on July 1, 2024. Oklahoma will remain as an affiliate member of the Big 12 in men&#x27;s wrestling as the SEC does not sponsor the sport, no other sport will be affected. 

When combined with Blake Griffin&#x27;s John Wooden Award and Sam Bradford&#x27;s Heisman Trophy, Oklahoma became the second school to have a top winner in both basketball and football in the same year (in 1968, Gary Beban won the Heisman Trophy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the USBWA &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award for UCLA).

===Football===
The Sooners have been participating in college football since 1895. Calling Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium at Owen Field home, the team has won numerous bowl games, 50 conference championships (including every Big Seven championship awarded), and seven Associated Press National Championships, making the Sooners football program one of the most decorated in college football. Oklahoma has scored the most points in Division I-A football history despite the fact they have played over 60 fewer games than the second place school on that list. OU also has the highest winning percentage of any team since the start of the AP poll in 1936.

The Sooners possess 7 national championships in football, with 1950, 1955, 1956, 1974, 1975, 1985, and 2000 seasons featuring the top team in the Associated Press final poll, and the 2000 Bowl Championship Series National Championship as well. This number is 3rd only to the Alabama Crimson Tide (12) and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (8) for the most AP titles of any Division I college football team after the end of World War II (which is commonly used as the division between eras in college football).

In addition to these seven acknowledged national championships there are also ten additional years in which the NCAA&#x27;s official record book lists other selections (mostly by math rating systems) of the Sooners as national champions, with the first four years in retrospect: 1915, 1949, 1953, 1957, 1967, 1973, 1978, 1980, 1986, 2003. In general, math formula rankings are not recognized as national championships. The University of Oklahoma does not acknowledge these additional &quot;championships&quot;, as they were not awarded by the Associated Press, United Press International (UPI), USA Today Coaches Poll, or the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).
Individual success is also a major part of Oklahoma football; seven Heisman Trophy winners (Billy Vessels, Steve Owens, Billy Sims, Jason White, Sam Bradford, Baker Mayfield, and Kyler Murray) are surrounded by many other award winners, including NFL MVP Award winner Adrian Peterson, Joe Washington, Brian Bosworth, Tony Casillas, Greg Pruitt, Josh Heupel, Jerry Tubbs, Rocky Calmus, Granville Liggins, Teddy Lehman, Lee Roy Selmon, Roy Williams, Tommy McDonald, Mark Clayton, Tommie Harris, J. C. Watts, Keith Jackson, and Jammal Brown. More than a dozen Sooner players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Oklahoma has more Butkus award winners than any other school.
Coaches Bennie Owen, Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer and Bob Stoops have passed through the game-day tunnel for the Sooners, each on his way to the College Football Hall of Fame. Owen was the first highly successful coach at OU and was a major advocate of the forward pass, which at the turn of the century was not popular. The playing surface at Oklahoma&#x27;s Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is popularly known as Owen Field in honor of his long tenure and devotion to the university. Wilkinson left many imprints on the game, such as the 5–2 defense with five linemen and two linebackers; the perfection of the Split-T, an early option offense; three national championships; and his teams set the NCAA Division 1 record for consecutive wins at 47 (started October 10, 1953, vs. Texas and ended in 1957 with a loss to Notre Dame 7–0). Switzer won three national championships (the National Championship of 1975 is highly controversial; Arizona State went 12–0 that season while Oklahoma was 11–1) and forged arguably the fiercest rushing offense ever, the Oklahoma wishbone formation, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Though the end of Switzer&#x27;s tenure at Oklahoma was marked by controversy and poor player behavior, he is generally well regarded by both his past players and Sooner fans. During his 16 years as the Sooners&#x27; head coach, Switzer led his team to 12 conference championships and never lost more than two games in a row. His winning percentage of .837 stands as the fourth-highest in the history of 1-A football. Other Hall of Fame coaches whose tenure included stints at the University of Oklahoma are Lawrence &quot;Biff&quot; Jones and Jim Tatum.

===Baseball===

The Oklahoma Baseball tradition is long, proud and storied, with two National Championships in 1951 and 1994, along with numerous All-Americans. Their home field is L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park, named after famed player Dale Mitchell. The current coach is Skip Johnson. The baseball program was a source of recent controversy when the head coach, Larry Cochell, resigned after making racially insensitive remarks about one of the players on the team.

During the 2005–2006 season, the Sooners were given a home regional at L. Dale Mitchell Park and were named the No. 1 seed. They beat the University of Houston, Texas Christian University, and Wichita State University to win the regional and advanced to a Super Regional where they were defeated by Rice University in a best-of-three series. Oregon State University went on to win the College World Series that year.

Prior to 2006, the Sooners hosted regionals at minor league parks in Oklahoma City, first All Sports Stadium and then AT&amp;T Bricktown Ballpark. Scheduling conflicts with the Oklahoma Redhawks, the Class AAA affiliate of the Houston Astros, led OU to bid for future regionals at its on-campus stadium.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===


The men&#x27;s basketball team is highly successful and rose to national prominence since the early 80s with head coach Billy Tubbs and three time All-American power forward Wayman Tisdale. It currently plays in the Lloyd Noble Center, which came to be known as the house Alvan Adams built and Tisdale filled. While the team has never won a national championship, it ranks second in most tournament wins without a championship behind Illinois. The team played in the 1988 national championship game but lost to Kansas, despite having beaten the Jayhawks twice earlier in the season. The program has won a combined twenty regular-season and tournament conference championships.

The Sooners headed into the 2005–06 season ranked No. 5 in the AP preseason poll, led by Taj Gray, Kevin Bookout, Terrell Everett, and David Godbold, but had a disappointing early season. After the emergence of Michael Neal as a potential star, the Sooners salvaged a No. 3 seed in the Big 12 Conference Tournament but lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

On March 29, 2006, Kelvin Sampson left the University of Oklahoma to become the head basketball coach at Indiana University. 13 days later, on April 11, 2006, Oklahoma Athletic Director Joe Castiglione named Jeff Capel III the new head coach. Capel encountered trouble in his first few months as several players who had been recruited by Sampson backed out of their commitments. Also, under Sampson&#x27;s watch, Oklahoma was placed under a three-year investigation by the NCAA for recruiting violations. At the end of their investigation, the NCAA issued a report citing more than 550 illegal calls made by Sampson and his staff to 17 different recruits. The NCAA barred Sampson from recruiting off campus and making phone calls for one year, ending May 24, 2007. The Sooners looked to continue a streak of 12 consecutive postseason tournament appearances in 2006–2007, but were disappointed when they did not receive a bid for either the NCAA Tournament or the NIT.

In the 2009 NBA draft, the Sooners produced the No. 1 overall draft selection Blake Griffin.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
OU women&#x27;s basketball began during the 1974–75 academic year. It wasn&#x27;t until 1996 when OU hired local high school basketball coach, Sherri Coale, that the team became something Sooners would be proud of. Due to low attendance, a statement was released in March 1990 that the program would be cut, but it was reinstated eight days later after fan response. In that season, the team drew an average of 65 people per game. Now the Sooners are one of the nation&#x27;s leaders in attendance. In 2002, Oklahoma advanced to the National Title game before losing to the Connecticut Huskies. The Sooners won seven Big 12 titles in the 2000&#x27;s and became a mainstay in the NCAA Tournament, advancing to the Final Four in 2009 and 2010.

===Men&#x27;s golf===
The men&#x27;s golf team has won 19 conference championships:
*Big Six/Seven/Eight Conference (15): 1935, 1936, 1938, 1941, 1946–48, 1951–52, 1955–57, 1989, 1992, 1996 (co-champions in 1947 and 1955)
*Big 12 Conference (4): 2006, 2018, 2022, 2023

The Sooners won the NCAA Championship in 1989 and 2017. OU has also crowned two individual national champions: Walter Emery in 1933 and Jim Vickers in 1952.

Several Sooners have had successful amateur and professional careers after college: Charles Coe (1949 and 1958 U.S. Amateur winner), Glen Day (one PGA Tour win), Todd Hamilton (two PGA Tour wins including 2004 Open Championship), Anthony Kim (three PGA Tour wins), Andrew Magee (four PGA Tour wins), Craig Perks (one PGA Tour win), Greg Turner (four European Tour wins), Grant Waite (one PGA Tour win) and Abraham Ancer (winner of 2018 Emirates Australian Open).

===Men&#x27;s gymnastics===

The men&#x27;s gymnastics program at OU is headed by coach Mark Williams. It has won twelve NCAA Men&#x27;s Gymnastics Championships, which is tied with Penn State for most all time. Their 12 championships include five in a span of seven years in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2008 (they finished second behind Penn State in 2004 and 2007). They won the 2006 title with very little experience on the team as 50% of the members were freshmen and just 21% were upperclassmen (seven freshmen, four sophomores, one junior, and two seniors). Teams from OU also won national championships in 1977, 1978, 1991, and became the third program in history to win four consecutive championships when they won in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2015, the Sooners broke the NCAA scoring record in a dual meet against Michigan scoring 456.4 points and then broke their own record two weeks later against Illinois scoring 457.3 points.

Gymnastics began at the school in 1902. The program folded in 1917 when the original coach left. The program was revived in 1965 with the new coach, Russ Porterfield having to beg students to join the squad. Within 6 years, OU had its first winning season. OU&#x27;s next coach, Paul Ziert, turned the program into one of national prominence. He led OU to two national championships in 1977 and 1978. One of Ziert&#x27;s athletes, Greg Buwick, would replace him as head coach in 1980 and would lead the team to its third national title in 1991. Buwick&#x27;s assistant of 12 years, Mark Williams, took over the head coaching position in 2000 and has led the Sooners to six national championships, thirteen conference titles, several individual champions, and even more All-Americans. OU has produced more Nissen Award winners than any other university and is the only school to have back-to-back Nissen Award winners.

===Women&#x27;s gymnastics===
The women&#x27;s gymnastics program is headed by K. J. Kindler. The Sooners have won 14 Big 12 conference titles, 8 regional championships, and six national championship titles (2014, a co-championship with Florida and in 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022, and 2023). The Sooners have also won seven individual titles in their history, with Kelly Garrison (all-around in 1987; all-around, bars and beam in 1988), Taylor Spears (beam in 2014), Nicole Lehrmann (bars in 2017), and Maggie Nichols (bars in 2017) claiming honors.

===Women&#x27;s rowing===
On May 10, 2007, the University announced the addition of women&#x27;s rowing to the intercollegiate athletics program started by well-respected rower Candie Garrett. The University hired head coach Leeanne Crain in the spring of 2008. Assistant Coaches Kris Muhl and Andrew Derrick followed Crain from the University of Central Florida to jumpstart OU&#x27;s program. Muhl took a head coaching position at Jacksonville University during summer 2009. Former UVA rower and Alabama Novice coach Marina Traub was hired as the varsity assistant coach in Fall 2009.

The University of Oklahoma women&#x27;s rowing team practices in the Oklahoma City River (formerly the Canadian River), located in the Bricktown area of Oklahoma City. The river was designated as a U.S. Olympic Training Center for the sports of kayaking, canoeing, and rowing on July 28, 2009. The University&#x27;s boathouse was completed in 2011.

===Women&#x27;s soccer===
The women&#x27;s soccer home ground is John Crain Field in the OU Soccer Complex.

 the head coach is Mark Carr, a graduate of Bournemouth University, who was formerly head coach of the United States women&#x27;s national under-20 soccer team.

=== Softball ===
The OU softball program qualified four times for the AIAW WCWS (1975, 1980, 1981, 1982) and 16 times for the Women&#x27;s College World Series (Division I) (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023).

In October 1994, OU hired Patty Gasso as the fifth head coach in program history. In 29 years, she has built OU into one of the premier collegiate softball programs in the nation. Within her first five seasons in Norman, Gasso led the Sooners to the final Big Eight championship (1995) and 15 Big 12 titles (1996, 1999, 2000, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023).

In 2000, Oklahoma won its first Women&#x27;s College World Series title by defeating perennial power UCLA. It marked the first national championship by a women&#x27;s athletics program in school history. OU rolled through the 2013 season en route to its second WCWS title. The 2016 Sooners won the program&#x27;s third national title while starting four sophomores and four freshmen. Despite entering the 2017 postseason tournament as a No. 10 national seed, OU won its second consecutive WCWS title and fourth overall. Game One of the WCWS champion series featured a 17-inning thriller in which the Sooners defeated Florida 7-5. The 2021 WCWS saw OU drop its opener to James Madison before rebounding to earn a spot in the championship series against Florida State. The Sooners defeated the Seminoles in three games to win the program&#x27;s fifth national title.

=== Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field ===
The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track and field teams host meets at the John Jacobs Track and Field Complex. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field teams host meets at the Mosier Indoor Track Facility.

===Wrestling===

The Sooner wrestling program was established in 1920 and is the fourth most decorated in college wrestling, having won seven NCAA national championships in 1936, 1951, 1952, 1957, 1960, 1963 and 1974. The Sooners are considered a power in their own right and Bedlam matches draw big home crowds, with the Howard McCasland Field House being the home for Sooner Wrestling. There are numerous All-Americans and National Champions that have wrestled for the Oklahoma Sooners. Mark Cody was head coach of the program for five years before his resignation in 2016. During his time, Cody coached the Sooners to 10th in 2014. Under Cody, the Sooners had ten All-Americans and two national champions (Kendric Maple and Cody Brewer). Roger Kish took over as head coach in May 2023.

==Notable non-varsity sports==

===Rugby===
Oklahoma plays college rugby in the Allied Rugby Conference of Division 1A. Oklahoma has participated several times in the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC), often matching up against rival Texas. The CRC, held every year at PPL Park in Philadelphia, is the highest profile college rugby competition in the US, and is broadcast live on NBC each year.

The Oklahoma University Rugby Football Club was established in 1974. OU Rugby has experienced success since its founding, including an undefeated record in the 1983–1984 season, and reached the national quarter-finals five times from 1980 to 1990. The early 2000s saw Oklahoma return to its winning ways, winning the Big 12 Rugby Tournament four times. The captain of that squad, All American Tyson Meek, played for the US national rugby team, and went on to become OU&#x27;s first professional rugby player. Oklahoma finished the 2005 season with a 19–1 record.

===Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey===
Oklahoma began playing ice hockey in 2003 and currently plays Division 1 college hockey through the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) as a founding member of the Western Collegiate Hockey League.

The Sooners maintain annual rivalries with the University of Central Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University.

Oklahoma has participated several times in the ACHA National Tournament. In 2013, the Sooners climbed to the country&#x27;s No. 2 ranking before eventually suffering an overtime loss in the national semifinals. 

==Rivalries==
===Nebraska Cornhuskers===
A traditional college football rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers was much less intense during the Big 12 years than it was in the Big 8 era. This was mainly due to the split-division nature of the Big 12 that only allowed the teams to play each other twice every four years. Prior to this, these teams were involved in several historic match-ups, including the Game of the Century and the so-called Game of the New Century where the teams have come into the game ranked one and two in the Associated Press poll, making the games of great importance in deciding the national championship. Historically, the rivalry&#x27;s most distinguishing quality has been the grudging respect and appreciation between the two tradition-rich programs. Also of note is the game&#x27;s former status as the premier Thanksgiving Day game for the middle of the country. The Sooners and Cornhuskers went head-to-head in the 2006 Big 12 championship game, with Oklahoma winning the conference title by the score of 21–7. The two teams also met in the 2010 Big 12 championship game, with Oklahoma again the victor in a close game by a score of 23–20. This turned out to be the final conference meeting between the two teams, as Nebraska departed for the Big Ten Conference the following season.

===Oklahoma State Cowboys===
Oklahoma&#x27;s shares an intrastate rivalry with the Oklahoma State Cowboys and is often referred to as the &quot;Bedlam Series.&quot; It is normally played as a home-and-home series with games alternating between Norman and Stillwater, with the exception of the baseball teams, who often play at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City or ONEOK Field in Tulsa. Oklahoma currently leads the series 86–18–7 in football, and 125-88 in basketball In baseball the series is tied at 147–147, and in wrestling Oklahoma trails the series 27–128–9.

===Texas Longhorns===

The Texas Longhorns are one rival of the Sooners. Regardless of the trademark implications, inverted versions of the Longhorn mascot can be seen on automobiles all over the Norman campus, and many T-shirts referring to the rivalry present the word &quot;Texas&quot; in mirror image, upside-down, or possibly surrounded by obscenities. A reminder of the rivalry shared by these two schools was painted on the South Oval of the OU campus for many years, and was recently replicated near the Library clock tower due to construction at its original site.

The annual game between the schools at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas, known as the Red River Showdown, is a game that draws attention from all around the college football world.

==Traditions==
The &quot;fight song&quot; of the University of Oklahoma is &quot;Boomer Sooner&quot;, a version of &quot;Boola Boola&quot;, the fight song of Yale University, combined with a version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Tar Heel Born&quot;, the fight song of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. &quot;Boomer Sooner&quot; was written by Arthur M. Alden in 1905. Other songs played at athletic events by The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band are a version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;OK Oklahoma&quot;, played after extra points, and the &quot;OU Chant.&quot; At home games, The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band plays that visiting team&#x27;s &quot;fight song&quot; while facing their fans.

The Mascot present at all football games is the Sooner Schooner, a Conestoga wagon, pulled by two crème white ponies, Boomer and Sooner. The caretakers of the wagon are the spirit group called the RUF/NEKS, who shoot off modified shotguns in celebration of scores by the home team. The group was launched in 1915 when an elderly female spectator at an OU-Oklahoma A&amp;M basketball game chided the group for raising hell (&quot;Sit down and be quiet, you roughnecks!&quot;)

Recently, in time for the 2005 football season, two new mascots, based on the ponies who pull the Schooner, were created, named appropriately, Boomer and Sooner. They are costumes of two identical (except for eye color) crème white ponies. Before, the Boomer and Sooner costume mascots, OU was also represented by Top Dawg. Top Dawg did some appearances at football games, but was primarily used at wrestling and basketball events.

The official school colors are Crimson and Cream, with red and white sometimes used as substitutes for simplicity. The school logo is an interlocking OU design.

<text>The Louisville Cardinals (also known as the Cards) are the NCAA athletic teams representing the University of Louisville. The Cardinals teams play in the Atlantic Coast Conference, beginning in the 2014 season. While playing in the Big East Conference from 2005 through 2013, the Cardinals captured 17 regular season Big East titles and 33 Big East Tournament titles totaling 50 Big East Championships across all sports. On November 28, 2012, Louisville received and accepted an invitation to join the Atlantic Coast Conference and became a participating member in all sports in 2014. In 2016, Lamar Jackson won the school its first Heisman Trophy.

Since 2000 Louisville is the only NCAA team to win a BCS bowl game; to appear in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball Final Four, the College World Series, and the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball Final Four; and to finish as runner-up in the Men&#x27;s soccer College Cup. It is one of only six schools that has appeared more than once in each of the following events—a BCS bowl game, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball Final Fours, and the College World Series—and Louisville&#x27;s span of seven school years (2006–07 to 2012–13) is the shortest among these schools. Also, it is the first school ever to win a BCS bowl game, appear in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball Final Fours, and appear in the College World Series in the same school year, doing so in 2012–13.

Louisville finished the 2015–16 year ranked 29th in the NACDA Learfield Sports Directors&#x27; Cup. The 2015–16 season began with Louisville ranked 24th through the final fall standings.

== Varsity teams ==
Louisville competes in 23 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The Cards never had a losing season in Hickman&#x27;s 23 years, prior to his arrival the team had only had 11 winning seasons. In 1956, Hickman&#x27;s team won the NIT, then considered a national championship on a par with the NCAA tournament. After retiring, Hickman became the school&#x27;s Athletics Director and hired then John Wooden assistant and future Hall of Famer Denny Crum, who led the team to two NCAA Division I basketball championships (1980 and 1986) and six Final Fours. The men&#x27;s basketball team currently ranks fifth in all-time NCAA tournament wins and has been in the top-five in average attendance each year since the 1982–83 season.

Under Coach Smith, the Cardinals spent 11 weeks in the AP Top 25, including a #17 final finish in 2000.

Under Coach Petrino, the Cardinals were ranked in all but three of the weekly AP polls since the beginning of the 2004 season. This includes a #6 final finish in both 2004 and 2006, as well as a #19 final finish in 2005.

In the 2004 season, the Cardinals went 11–1 and won the Conference USA Championship; their only loss was against third-ranked Miami, a game in which the Cardinals led by 17 in the third quarter before falling. The Cardinals went to the Liberty Bowl, where they defeated #10-ranked and previously undefeated Boise State.

In 2005, the Cardinals finished 9–3 after falling to Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl and completed the season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and #20 in the Coaches&#x27; Poll.

In 2006, the Cardinals began the season ranked #13 in the AP poll and finished the season with a 12–1 record, their first Big East Conference title and completed the season with a 24–13 victory over the Atlantic Coast Conference champion Wake Forest in the Orange Bowl. The Cards finished the 2006 season ranked #6 in the AP Poll and #7 in the Coaches Poll, while being ranked #6 in the Bowl Championship Series Poll.

On January 9, 2007, Steve Kragthorpe was introduced as the new head coach of the Cardinals, within 48 hours after Bobby Petrino announced his departure to take the head coaching position with the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League. The Cardinals went 6–6 in Kragthorpe&#x27;s first season and the second season 5–7. He was fired after his third season (2009) ended with a disappointing 4–8 record. Kragthorpe&#x27;s replacement is Charlie Strong, formerly the defensive coordinator at Florida, and the second African American to head the Cardinals program.

None of the football program&#x27;s recent success would have been possible without the vision and efforts of former Kentucky All-American and national champion coach (at the University of Miami) Howard Schnellenberger, who was the head coach from 1985 to 1994. His greatest achievement at Louisville was a 34–7 victory over the Alabama Crimson Tide in the 1991 Fiesta Bowl (Alabama finished 7–5), which culminated in Louisville&#x27;s first national ranking (11th) and a 10–1–1 record.

The University of Louisville football program&#x27;s home is Cardinal Stadium.
The Louisville football program annually plays for the Governor&#x27;s Cup (awarded to the winner of the Louisville-Kentucky football game) and The Keg of Nails (awarded to the winner of the annual Louisville-Cincinnati football game).

The film &quot;The Replacements&quot; was rumored to be based on former Cardinal quarterback Ed Rubbert (played by Keanu Reeves), who led the Washington Redskins&#x27; 1987 strike team to a 3–0 record en route to the franchise&#x27;s Super Bowl XXII championship.

;Retired jerseys and numbers
Louisville has retired the jerseys, although not their numbers, of the following former Cardinal football players: Bruce Armstrong, Ray Buchanan, Doug Buffone, Ernie Green, Tom Jackson, Joe Jacoby, Otto Knop, Lenny Lyles, Sam Madison, Frank Minnifield, Chris Redman, Otis Wilson, Roman Oben, Dwayne Woodruff, and Jeff Brohm. The Cardinals football program also has retired two numbers: 16, worn by Johnny Unitas, and 8, worn by Lamar Jackson.

On February 21, 2013, Louisville announced that it would build a new soccer-only stadium on campus. The new stadium, with a capacity of 5,300, is set to open for the 2014 season, and will be known as Dr. Mark and Cindy Lynn Stadium, after their donation of $5 million toward the $17.5 million project.

Volleyball has traditionally been one of Louisville&#x27;s most successful programs, led for 15 years by head coach Leonid Yelin, whose .772 career winning percentage ranked 9th among active coaches prior to his retirement after the 2010 season. He was replaced by former Louisville player Anne Kordes, who had spent the previous seven seasons as head coach at Saint Louis. During the 2005 season, Louisville was ranked as high as #6 en route to a 30–3 record, a regular season tie for the Big East title, and a second straight trip to the Sweet 16. In the most recent 2012 season, the team averaged 2,341 fans while playing mainly at the KFC Yum! Center. Their traditional home of Cardinal Arena, with 840 seats, has become too small for the team&#x27;s current popularity, with fans turned away at several games. While Louisville has sought state funding to expand Cardinal Arena to better meet fan demands and prevent unsafe &quot;standing room only&quot; crowds, it has more recently opted to move full-time into the KFC Yum! Center; of its 19 home matches in the 2012 season, 15 were scheduled for that facility. Louisville also hosted both the 2005 Big East Volleyball tournament and the first two rounds of NCAA volleyball tournament at the Kentucky International Expo Center in Downtown Louisville, and hosted the Women&#x27;s Final Four in 2012 and 2024 at the KFC Yum! Center.

In 2005, two Cardinals, seniors Lena Ustymenko and Jennifer Hoffman, were named second team All-American. Previously only one Big East volleyball player had been named an All-American. Ustymenko was also named the 2005 Big East player of the year and Hoffman led the nation in hitting percentage in the Card&#x27;s 6–2 offense. The program has won 15 of its last 16 conference titles (with another in 1983) and has been to the NCAA tourney 17 times since 1982, with 47 players making their all-conference team. The team has a 157–19 all-time record at Cardinal Arena, and is 17–6 at the KFC Yum! Center.

The Cardinal volleyball team has won conference championships 19 times, from Metro, C-USA, Big East, American Athletic, and ACC.

More recently, after the Cardinals joined the ACC in 2014, the Cardinals won the 2015 ACC title, the first ACC crown ever won by any Louisville team. Senior setter Katie George, also notable as that year&#x27;s Miss Kentucky USA, was named ACC Player of the Year and Setter of the Year. In addition, Kordes was named Coach of the Year, and libero Molly Sauer was named Defensive Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.

The Cardinal volleyball team moved back into the newly expanded Cardinal Arena in 2017. In April 2019, the local L&amp;N Federal Credit Union donated $2 million to the athletic program, leading the university to rename the venue L&amp;N Federal Credit Union Arena.

In 2021, the Cardinals won the ACC title and entered the NCAA tournament undefeated. Setter Tori Dilfer and middle blocker Anna Stevenson were named first-team All-Americans by the American Volleyball Coaches Association, becoming the program&#x27;s first-ever first-team All-Americans, and outside hitter Anna DeBeer was named a third-team All-American. Dilfer was also named ACC Setter of the Year. The Cardinals&#x27; only loss was in the national semifinals to eventual champion Wisconsin.

=== Ladybirds ===
The University of Louisville Ladybirds dance team has won 20 national titles. The Ladybirds have won nine of the last ten national competitions, including the last four years, in the National Cheerleading Association Championships in Daytona Beach, Fla. The Ladybirds also added the 2014, 2016, 2017 Hip Hop national title to their trophy case. In the years 2016–18 the Ladybirds won a double title, placing first in both the team performance and hip hop categories. Louisville won the Universal Dance Association title in 1995 and 1997. The Ladybirds have long been successful, placing in the top five in their national competition 21 of the last 27 years. The group is under the direction of Sheryl Knight.

==Rivalries==

===Kentucky Wildcats===

The Louisville Cardinals rivalry with the Kentucky Wildcats is widely considered one of the most intense college rivalries in the United States. The men&#x27;s basketball game is called the Battle for the Bluegrass; the football game is officially called the Governor&#x27;s Cup.

In the early years after the rivalry resumed whoever would win the football game would go on to lose the basketball game. In 2003 Louisville broke that tradition by winning both the football and basketball game and did so again in 2012. Kentucky has completed the double four times, in the 2009, 2011, 2018 and 2019 seasons.

Unlike many in-state rivalries that have been played continuously for many decades, these two schools went through a long period from the 1930s to the 1980s of rarely facing one another. They did play frequently from the 1900s to the 1920s. Since the renewal of the men&#x27;s basketball rivalry in 1983–84 UK leads the modern rivalry 28–13 and the all-time series 37–16. Since the two teams resumed playing football in 1994, Louisville leads the modern series 15–11 but the all-time series is led by UK at 17–15.

Within the intrastate rivalry with the Kentucky Wildcats, the team that has won the football game has lost the following basketball game every year, except in 2003 and 2012 (when Louisville won both) and 2009, 2011, 2018 and 2019 (when UK won both).

===Cincinnati Bearcats===
Known more for an intense basketball rivalry and tradition, Louisville and UC have a football rivalry that has stretched over the span of four conferences from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference to Conference USA, and more recently in the Big East Conference, which in 2013 was renamed to the American Athletic Conference. It is believed to be the oldest rivalry for the Louisville football team and the second oldest for Cincinnati, only behind the annual game with the Miami RedHawks.

On the gridiron, the two teams compete for the Keg of Nails, currently held by Louisville as winner of the most recent game in the 2022 season. The Bearcats lead the overall series 30–22–1.

===Other rivalries===
Louisville also has dormant rivalries with University of Memphis Tigers,West Virginia University, and Marquette University, which have all been on hiatus.

<text>Pozzolana or pozzuolana ( , ), also known as pozzolanic ash (), is a natural siliceous or siliceous-aluminous material which reacts with calcium hydroxide in the presence of water at room temperature (cf. pozzolanic reaction). In this reaction insoluble calcium silicate hydrate and calcium aluminate hydrate compounds are formed possessing cementitious properties. The designation pozzolana is derived from one of the primary deposits of volcanic ash used by the Romans in Italy, at Pozzuoli. The modern definition of pozzolana encompasses any volcanic material (pumice or volcanic ash), predominantly composed of fine volcanic glass, that is used as a pozzolan. Note the difference with the term pozzolan, which exerts no bearing on the specific origin of the material, as opposed to pozzolana, which can only be used for pozzolans of volcanic origin, primarily composed of volcanic glass.

== Historical use ==

Pozzolanas such as Santorin earth were used in the Eastern Mediterranean since 500–400 BC. Although pioneered by the ancient Greeks, it was the Romans who eventually fully developed the potential of lime-pozzolan pastes as binder phase in Roman concrete used for buildings and underwater construction. Vitruvius speaks of four types of pozzolana: black, white, grey, and red, all of which can be found in the volcanic areas of Italy, such as Naples. Typically it was very thoroughly mixed two-to-one with lime just prior to mixing with water. The Roman port at Cosa was built of pozzolana-lime concrete that was poured under water, apparently using a long tube to carefully lay it up without allowing sea water to mix with it. The three piers are still visible today, with the underwater portions in generally excellent condition even after more than 2100 years.

== Geochemistry and mineralogy ==
The major pozzolanically active component of volcanic pumices and ashes is a highly porous glass. The easily alterable, or highly reactive, nature of these ashes and pumices limits their occurrence largely to recently active volcanic areas. Most of the traditionally used natural pozzolans belong to this group, i.e., volcanic pumice from Pozzuoli, Santorin earth and the incoherent parts of German trass.

The chemical composition of pozzolana is variable and reflects the regional type of volcanism. SiO2 being the major chemical component, most unaltered pumices and ashes fall in the intermediate (52–66 wt% SiO2) to acid (&gt;66 wt% SiO2) composition range for glassy rock types outlined by the IUGS. Basic (45–52 wt% SiO2) and ultrabasic (&lt;45 wt% SiO2) pyroclastics are less commonly used as pozzolans. Al2O3 is present in substantial amounts in most pozzolanas, Fe2O3 and MgO are present in minor proportions only, as is typical or more acid rock types. CaO and alkali contents are usually modest but can vary substantially from pozzolana to pozzolana.

The mineralogical composition of unaltered pyroclastic rocks is mainly determined by the presence of phenocrysts and the chemical composition of the parent magma. The major component is volcanic glass typically present in quantities over 50 wt%. Pozzolana containing significantly less volcanic glass, such as a trachyandesite from Volvic (France) with only 25 wt% are less reactive. Apart from the glass content and its morphology associated with the specific surface area, also defects and the degree of strain in the glass appear to affect the pozzolanic activity.
Typical associated minerals present as large phenocrysts are members of the plagioclase feldspar solid solution series. In pyroclastic rocks in which alkalis predominate over Ca, K-feldspar such as sanidine or albite Na-feldspar are found. Leucite is present in the K-rich, silica-poor Latium pozzolanas. Quartz is usually present in minor quantities in acidic pozzolanas, while pyroxenes and/or olivine phenocrysts are often found in more basic materials. Xenocrysts or rock fragments incorporated during the violent eruptional and depositional events are also encountered.
Zeolite, opal CT and clay minerals are often present in minor quantities as alteration products of the volcanic glass. While zeolitisation or formation of opal CT is in general beneficial for the pozzolanic activity, clay formation has adverse effects on the performance of lime-pozzolan blends or blended cements.

== Modern use ==
Pozzolana is abundant in certain locations and is extensively used as an addition to Portland cement in countries such as Italy, Germany, Kenya, Uganda,Turkey, China and Greece. Compared to industrial by-product pozzolans they are characterized by larger ranges in composition and a larger variability in physical properties. The application of pozzolana in Portland cement is mainly controlled by the local availability of suitable deposits and the competition with the accessible industrial by-product supplementary cementitious materials. In part due to the exhaustion of the latter sources and the extensive reserves of pozzolana available, partly because of the proven technical advantages of an intelligent use of pozzolana, their use is expected to be strongly expanded in the future.

==Pozzolanic reaction==

The pozzolanic reaction is the chemical reaction that occurs in portland cement containing pozzolans. It is the main reaction involved in the Roman concrete invented in Ancient Rome. At the basis of the pozzolanic reaction stands a simple acid-base reaction between calcium hydroxide (as Portlandite) and silicic acid.

<text>Yorubaland () is the homeland and cultural region of the Yoruba people in West Africa. It spans the modern-day countries of Nigeria, Togo and Benin, and covers a total land area of . Of this land area, 106,016 km2 (74.6%) lies within Nigeria, 18.9% in Benin, and the remaining 6.5% is in Togo. Prior to European colonization, a portion of this area was known as Yoruba country. The geo-cultural space contains an estimated 55 million people, the majority of this population being ethnic Yoruba.

==Geography==

Geo-physically, Yorubaland spreads north from the Gulf of Guinea and west from the Niger River into Benin and Togo. In the northern section, Yorubaland begins in the suburbs just west of Lokoja and continues unbroken up to the Ogooué River tributary of the Mono River in Togo, a distance of around 610 km. In the south, it begins in an area just west of the Benin and Osse (Ovia) river occupied by the Ilaje Yorubas and continues uninterrupted up to Porto Novo, a total distance of about 280 km as the crow flies. West of Porto Novo Gbe speakers begin to predominate. The northern section is thus more expansive than the southern coastal section.

The land is characterized by mangrove forests, estuaries and coastal plains in the south, which rise steadily northwards into rolling hills and a jagged highland region in the interior, commonly known as the &quot;Yorubaland plateau&quot; or &quot;Western upland&quot;. The highlands are pronounced in the Ekiti area of the region, especially around the Effon ridge and the Okemesi fold belt, which have heights in excess of 732 m (2,400 ft) and are characterized by numerous waterfalls and springs such as Olumirin waterfall, Arinta waterfall, and Effon waterfall. The highest elevation is found at the Idanre Inselberg Hills, which have heights in excess of . In general, the landscape of the interior is made up of undulating terrain with occasional inselbergs jutting out dramatically from the surrounding expanse. Some include: Okeagbe hills: 790m, Olosunta in Ikere Ekiti: 690m, Saki and Igbeti hills.

===Rivers===

With coastal plains, southern lowlands, and interior highlands, Yorubaland has several large rivers and streams that crisscross the terrain. These rivers flow in two general directions within the Yoruba country; southwards into the lagoons, estuaries and creeks which empty into the Atlantic Ocean, and northwards into the Niger river. Some southward flowing rivers include; The Osun and Shasha rivers which empty into the Lekki Lagoon, the Ogun River and its major tributaries; the Oyan and Ofiki which empties into the Lagos Lagoon, the upper Mono River, Oba River, Erinle River, Yewa River which discharges into the Badagry creek, Okpara River which forms part of the Nigeria-Benin border before fully re-entering Benin to join the Ouémé River (Ofe in Yoruba) which drains into Lake Nokoué and the Porto-Novo creek. On the eastern flank, the Owena (Siluko), Ofosu and Ose rivers empty into the Benin river creek. Those which flow in a northerly direction into the Niger include the Moshi river, Oyun, Oshin, Awun, Asa, Ero and Oyi.

===Subnational divisions===

The Nigerian part of Yorubaland comprises today&#x27;s Ọyọ, Ọṣun, Ogun, Kwara, Ondo, Ekiti, Lagos as well as parts of Kogi, Edo and Delta. The Beninese portion consists of Ouémé Department, Plateau Department, Collines Department, Tchaourou commune of Borgou Department, Bassila commune of Donga Department, Ouinhi and Zogbodomey commune of Zou Department, and Kandi commune of Alibori Department. The Togolese portions are the Ogou, Anié and Est-Mono prefectures in Plateaux Region, and the Tchamba prefecture in Centrale Region.

===Vegetation and climate===

The climate of Yorubaland varies from north to south. The southern, central and eastern portions of the territory is tropical high forest, known as the Yoruba lowland forests ecoregion. The characteristic vegetation is verdant closed-canopy forests composed of many varieties of hardwood trees including &quot;Milicia excelsa&quot; which is more commonly known locally as &quot;iroko&quot;, &quot;Antiaris africana&quot;, &quot;Terminalia superba&quot; which is known locally as &quot;afara&quot;, &quot;Entandrophragma&quot; or &quot;sapele&quot;, &quot;Lophira alata&quot;, &quot;Triplochiton scleroxylon&quot; (or &quot;obeche&quot;), &quot;Khaya grandifoliola&quot; (or African mahogany), &quot;Symphonia globulifera&quot;, and numerous other species. Some non-native species such as &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; (teak) and &quot;Gmelina arborea&quot; (pulp wood) have been introduced into the ecosystem and are being extensively grown in several large forest plantations.

The coastal section of this area features an area covered by swamp flats and dominated by such plants as mangroves and other stilt plants as well as palms, ferns and coconut trees on the beaches. This portion includes most of Ondo, Ekiti, Ogun, Osun, Lagos states and is characterised by generally high levels of precipitation defined by a double maxima (peak period); March–July and September–November. Annual rainfall in Ijebu Ode in the middle of Ogun state, for example, averages . The area is the center of thriving cocoa, natural rubber, kola nut and oil palm production industry, as well as lucrative logging. Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states are the leading producers of cocoa in Nigeria, while the southern portions of Ogun and Ondo states (Odigbo, Okitipupa and Irele) play host to large plantations of oil palm and rubber.

The northern and western portions of the region is characterized by tropical woodland savanna climate (Aw), with a single rainfall maxima. This area covers the northern two-thirds of Oyo, northwestern Ogun, Kwara, Kogi, Collines (Benin), northern half of Plateau department (Benin) and central Togo. It is part of the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic ecoregion, a transitional zone between West Africa&#x27;s coastal forests and interior savannas. Part of this region is derived savanna which was once covered in forest but has lost tree cover due to agricultural and other pressures on land. Annual rainfall here hovers between . Annual precipitation in Ilorin for example is . Tree species here include the &quot;Blighia sapida&quot; more commonly known as ackee in English and &quot;ishin&quot; in Yoruba, and &quot;Parkia biglobosa&quot; which is the locust bean tree used in making iru or ogiri, a local cooking condiment.

The monsoon (rainy period) in both climatic zones is followed by a drier season characterized by northwest trade winds that bring the harmattan (cold dust-laden windstorms) that blow from the Sahara. They normally affect all areas except a small portion of the southern coast. Nonetheless, it has been reported that the harmattan has reached as far as Lagos in some years.

==Prehistory and oral tradition==

===Settlement===
Oduduwa is regarded as the legendary progenitor of the Yoruba, and almost every Yoruba settlement traces its origin to princes of Ile-Ife in Osun State, Nigeria. As such, Ife can be regarded as the cultural and spiritual homeland of the Yoruba nation, both within and outside Nigeria. According to an Oyo account, Oduduwa was a Yoruba emissary; said to have come from the east, sometimes understood by some sources as the &quot;vicinity&quot; true east on the cardinal points, but more likely signifying the region of the Ekiti and Okun sub-communities in Yorubaland, Nigeria.
On the other hand, linguistic evidence seems to corroborate the fact that the eastern half of Yorubaland was settled at an earlier time in history than the western regions, as the Northwest and Southwest Yoruba dialects show more linguistic innovations than their central and eastern counterparts.

===Pre-Civil War===
Between 1100 and 1400, the Yoruba Kingdom of Ife experienced a golden age, part of which was a sort of artistic and ideological renaissance. It was then surpassed by the Oyo Empire as the dominant Yoruba military and political power between 1700 and 1900. Yoruba people generally feel a deep sense of culture and tradition that unifies and helps identify them. There are sixteen established kingdoms, states that are said to have been descendants of Oduduwa himself. The other sub-kingdoms and chiefdoms that exist are second order branches of the original sixteen kingdoms.

There are various groups and subgroups in Yorubaland based on the many distinct dialects of the Yoruba language, which although all mutually intelligible, have peculiar differences. The governments of these diverse people are quite intricate and each group and subgroup varies in their pattern of governance. In general, government begins at home with the immediate family. The next level is the extended family with its own head, an Olori-Ebi. A collection of distantly related extended families makes up a town. The individual chiefs that serve the towns as corporate entities, called Olóyès, are subject to the Baálès that rule over them. A collection of distantly related towns makes up a clan. A separate group of &quot;Oloyes&quot; are subject to the Oba that rules over an individual clan, and this &quot;Oba&quot; may himself be subject to another &quot;Oba&quot;, depending on the grade of the Obaship.

== History ==

===Government===
Ife was surpassed by the Oyo Empire as the dominant Yoruba military and political power between the year 1600 and 1800. The nearby kingdom of Benin was also a powerful force between 1300 and 1850. Most of the city states were controlled by Obas, priestly monarchs, and councils made up of Oloyes, recognised leaders of royal, noble and, often, even common descent, who joined them in ruling over the kingdoms through a series of guilds and sects. Different states saw differing ratios of power between the kingship and the chiefs&#x27; council. Some, such as Oyo, had powerful, autocratic monarchs with almost total control, while in others the senatorial councils were supreme and the Ọba served as something of a figurehead. In all cases, however, Yoruba monarchs were subject to the continuing approval of their constituents as a matter of policy, and could be easily compelled to abdicate for demonstrating dictatorial tendencies or incompetence. The order to vacate the throne was usually communicated through an &quot;aroko&quot; or symbolic message, which usually took the form of parrot eggs delivered in a covered calabash bowl by the Basorun the head of Oyomesi (the lawmakers) after Judgements from the Ogbonis which were in the judiciary wing. In most cases, the message would compel the Oba to take his own life, which he was bound by oath to do.

===Civil War===
Following a jihad (known as the Fulani War) led by Uthman Dan Fodio (1754–1817) and a rapid consolidation of the Hausa city-states of contemporary northern Nigeria, the Fulani Sokoto Caliphate annexed the buffer Nupe Kingdom and began to press southwards towards the Oyo Empire. Shortly after, they overran the Yoruba city of Ilorin and then sacked Ọyọ-Ile, the capital city of the Oyo Empire. Further attempts by the Sokoto Caliphate to expand southwards were checked by the Yoruba who had rallied to resist under the military leadership of the city-state of Ibadan, which rose from the old Oyo Empire, and of the Ijebu kingdom.

However, the Oyo hegemony had been dealt a mortal blow. The other Yoruba city-states broke free of Oyo dominance, and subsequently became embroiled in a series of internecine wars, a period when millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas and the Caribbean, eventually ending up in such countries as the Bahamas, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Haiti and Venezuela, the United States, among others.

===British colonization of Yorubaland===

During the 19th century, the British Empire gradually colonized Yorubaland. In 1892, the British declared war on the Ijebu Kingdom in response to its barriers on trade. The British emerged victorious in the conflict and occupied the Ijebu capital. After British colonization, the capital served as an administrative center for colonial officials as the kingdom was annexed to the colony of Southern Nigeria. The colony was gradually expanded by protectorate treaties. These treaties proved decisive in the eventual annexation of the rest of Yorubaland and, eventually, of southern Nigeria and the Cameroons.

In 1960, greater Yorubaland was subsumed into the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
According to Yoruba historians, by the time the British came to colonize and subjugate Yorubaland first to itself and later to the Fulani of Northern Nigeria, the Yoruba were getting ready to recover from what is popularly known as the Yoruba Civil War. One of the lessons of the internecine Yoruba wars was the opening of Yorubaland to Fulani hegemony whose major interest was the imposition of sultanistic despotism on Old Oyo Ile and present-day Ilorin. The most visible consequence of this was the adding of almost one-fifth of Yorubaland from Offa to Old Oyo to Kabba to the then-Northern Nigeria of Lord Frederick Lugard and the subsequent subjugation of this portion of Yorubaland under the control of Fulani feudalism.

<text>Lucy Dawidowicz ( Schildkret; June 16, 1915 – December 5, 1990) was an American historian and writer. She wrote books about modern Jewish history, in particular, about the Holocaust.

==Life==
Dawidowicz was born in New York City as Lucy Schildkret. Her parents, Max and Dora (née Ofnaem) Schildkret, Jewish immigrants from Poland, were secular-minded with little interest in religion. Dawidowicz did not attend a service at a synagogue until 1938.

Dawidowicz&#x27;s first interests were poetry and literature. She attended Hunter College from 1932 to 1936 and obtained a B.A. in English. She went on to study for a M.A. at Columbia University, but abandoned her studies because of concerns over events in Europe. At the encouragement of her mentor, the historian Jacob Shatzky, Dawidowicz decided to focus on history, especially Jewish history. Dawidowicz made the decision to learn Yiddish, and at Shatzky&#x27;s urging, she relocated to Wilno, Poland (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) in 1938 to work at the Yiddish Scientific Institute (known by its Yiddish acronym as the YIVO). With the help of Shatzky she became a research fellow there.

Dawidowicz lived in Wilno until August 1939 when she returned to the United States just weeks before the war broke out. During her time at the YIVO, she became close to three of the leading scholars there, namely Zelig Kalmanovich, Max Weinreich and Zalmen Reisen. Weinreich escaped the Holocaust because he went to New York to establish a branch of the YIVO there before World War II, but Kalmanovich and Reisen perished. Dawidowicz had been close to Kalmanovich and his family, whom she reportedly described as being her real parents. From 1940 until 1946, Dawidowicz worked as an assistant to a research director at the New York City office of the YIVO. During the war, like most Americans, she was aware of the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Europe, although it was not until after the war that she became aware of the full extent of the Holocaust.

===Following World War II===
In 1946, Dawidowicz traveled back to Europe, where she worked for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee as an aid worker among the Jewish survivors in the Displaced Persons (DP) camps. She helped the survivors to re-create schools and libraries. Over a period of months in Frankfurt, she examined books that had been looted from Jewish institutions by the Nazis and identified those to be returned to the YIVO headquarters in New York, recovering in this way vast collections of books.

In 1947, she returned to the U.S. and on January 3, 1948, she married a Polish Jew, Szymon Dawidowicz. Upon her return to the U.S. she worked as a researcher for the novelist John Hersey&#x27;s book &quot;The Wall&quot;, a dramatization of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. From 1948 until 1960, Dawidowicz worked as a historical researcher for the American Jewish Committee. During the same period, Dawidowicz wrote frequently for &quot;Commentary&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;.

An enthusiastic fan of the New York Mets, Dawidowicz lived the rest of her life in New York. In 1985, she founded the Fund for the Translation of Jewish Literature from Yiddish and Hebrew into English. A fierce anti-Communist, Dawidowicz campaigned for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. She died in New York City in 1990, aged 75, from undisclosed causes.

==Holocaust study and historiography==
Dawidowicz’s major interests were the Holocaust and Jewish history. A passionate Zionist, Dawidowicz believed that had the Mandate for Palestine been implemented as intended, establishing the Jewish State of Israel before the Holocaust, &quot;the terrible story of six million dead might have had another outcome&quot;.
Dawidowicz took an Intentionalist line on the origins of the Holocaust, contending that, beginning with the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Hitler conceived his master plans, and everything he did from then on was directed toward the achievement of his goal, and that he had &quot;openly espoused his program of annihilation&quot; when he wrote &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in 1924.

Dawidowicz&#x27;s conclusion was: &quot;Through a maze of time, Hitler&#x27;s decision of November 1918 led to Operation Barbarossa. There never had been any ideological deviation or wavering determination. In the end only the question of opportunity mattered.&quot;

In her view, the overwhelming majority of Germans subscribed to the &quot;völkische&quot; antisemitism from the 1870s onward, and it was this morbid antisemitism that attracted support for Hitler and the Nazis. Dawidowicz maintained that from the Middle Ages onward, German Christian society and culture were suffused with antisemitism and there was a direct link from medieval pogroms to the Nazi death camps of the 1940s.

Citing Fritz Fischer, Dawidowicz argued that there were powerful lines of continuity in German history and there was a &quot;Sonderweg&quot; (Special Path), which inevitably led Germany to Nazism.

Dawidowicz criticized what she considered to be revisionist historians as incorrect and/or sympathetic to the Nazis, as well as German historians who sought to minimize German complicity in the Nazi era attempt to annihilate Europe&#x27;s Jews.

For Dawidowicz, Nazism was the essence of &quot;total evil,&quot; and she wrote that the Nazi movement was the &quot;... daemon let loose in society, Cain in corporate embodiment.&quot;
Regarding foreign policy questions, she sharply disagreed with A.J.P. Taylor over his book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;. In even stronger terms, she condemned the American neo-Nazi historian David Hoggan for his book &quot;War Forced on Germany&quot; as well as David Irving&#x27;s revisionist &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, which suggested Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust.

In her view, historians who took a functionalist line on the origins of the Holocaust question were guilty of ignoring their responsibility to historical truth.

===Disputes with Arno Mayer===
Dawidowicz was a leading critic of the American historian Arno J. Mayer&#x27;s account of the Holocaust in his 1988 book &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot; arguing that Mayer played up anti-communism at the expense of antisemitism as an explanation for the Holocaust.

Dawidowicz titled her review of &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot; in the October 1989 edition of &quot;Commentary&quot; as &quot;Perversions of the Holocaust&quot;. Dawidowicz argued against Mayer that the historical evidence shows that Hitler was not convinced that the war was lost as early as December 1941 and that Mayer&#x27;s theory is anachronistic.

Dawidowicz commented that the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; had been massacring Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and that Mayer&#x27;s claim that the Jews were only surrogate victims due to Germany&#x27;s inability to defeat the Soviet Union was, in her opinion, rubbish.

Dawidowicz attacked Mayer for saying that more Jews died at Auschwitz from disease than from mass gassing and for supporting Holocaust denial by writing that Holocaust survivor testimony was highly unreliable as a historical source.

Dawidowicz questioned Mayer&#x27;s motives in listing the works of Arthur Butz and Paul Rassinier in his bibliography.

Dawidowicz ended her review of &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot; by accusing Mayer of excusing German racism, rationalizing the Nazi dictatorship, of portraying Soviet Jews as better off than they were under the Soviet dictatorship, and by presenting the Holocaust as due to reasonable political goals instead of, as she believed, being an ideological decision fueled by fanatical antisemitism.

===Other===
She criticized the British historian Norman Davies, the author of &quot;God&#x27;s Playground: A History of Poland&quot;, for &quot;his virtuosity in erasing Polish antisemitism from the history books he writes&quot; and for peppering some of his writing &quot;with anti-Semitic tidbits.&quot; Ronald Hilton, professor emeritus at Stanford University replied: &quot;Davies is not anti-Semitic, his reputation for fairness is recognized internationally.&quot; He also added: &quot;People are frightened to speak up about this.&quot; Davies &quot;absolutely&quot; denied being antisemitic.

During the same period, Dawidowicz denounced the work of the philosopher Ernst Nolte, whom she accused of seeking to justify the Holocaust. In her &quot;The War Against the Jews 1933-1945&quot; (1975), she writes that antisemitism has had a long history within Christianity.

In her opinion, the line of &quot;anti-Semitic descent&quot; from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler was &quot;easy to draw&quot;. She wrote that Hitler and Luther were both obsessed by the &quot;demonologized universe&quot; inhabited by Jews and that the similarities between Luther&#x27;s anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of Judenhass.
In Raul Hilberg 1961 The Destruction of the European Jews Hilberg&#x27;s own detailed breakdown in The Destruction reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews.In her book &quot;The War Against the Jews 1933-1945&quot; (1975) Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews

===Criticism of Dawidowicz===
Raul Hilberg criticized Dawidowicz for her work &quot;The War Against the Jews&quot;, stating that it builds &quot;largely on secondary sources and conveying nothing whatever that could be called new,&quot; and then going on to say in regards to Dawidowicz&#x27;s portrayal of Jewish resistance and resisters that she included &quot;soup ladlers and all others in the ghettos who staved off starvation and despair.&quot; Hilberg suggests that &quot;nostalgic Jewish readers [would find here] vaguely consoling words, [which] could be easily clutched by all those who did not wish to look deeper.&quot; He then lists over 20 key authors on the subjects that Dawidowicz covers, that she did not use as references in her own work. Hilberg ends on the subject of Dawidowicz stating &quot;To be sure, Dawidowicz has not been taken all that seriously by historians&quot;.

==Books by Dawidowicz==
Her books include &quot;The War Against the Jews 1933-1945&quot;, her best-selling 1975 history of the Holocaust, and &quot;The Holocaust and the Historians&quot;, a study of Holocaust historiography.

A collection of her essays relating to Jewish history, &quot;What Is the Use of Jewish History?&quot;, was published posthumously in 1992. Dawidowicz wrote &quot;The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe&quot; to document Jewish civilization in Eastern Europe before its destruction during the Holocaust.

In &quot;On Equal Terms: Jews in America, 1881-1981&quot;, Dawidowicz wrote an account of Jews in the United States that reflected an appreciation for her American citizenship, which saved her from being a victim herself in the Holocaust.

<text>Provisional Administration (Polish &quot;Administracja Zastępcza&quot;) was one of the branches of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Government Delegate’s Office at Home in Poland during World War II.

It was created in 1940 as a joint initiative of the Headquarters of the Armia Krajowa and the Delegate&#x27;s Office. It was a kind of shadow administration prepared for the moment of either liberation of Poland or the start of an all-national armed uprising.

It was based on the Polish pre-war administrative division, composed of three grades (voivodeship-powiat-gmina), combined with the pre-war military division. In August 1943 the division of competences between the army and the civilian authorities was agreed. The organization of the Provisional Administration was later accepted by the President of Poland on April 26, 1944.

In 1944 during Operation Tempest, as the sole representatives of the legitimate Polish government, the members of the Provisional Administration took power from the withdrawing German troops and welcomed the advancing Red Army . However, most of them were arrested by the NKVD and either sent to Russia for interrogation, sent to the GULag or killed on the spot.</text><links>

<text>Neal B. Shapiro (born March 9, 1958) is the president and CEO of WNET. He worked previously as the president of NBC News and the executive producer for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;. Prior to this Shapiro spent 13 years as a news producer at ABC News.

== Early life==
Shapiro was born to a practicing Jewish family and raised in Delmar, New York. He attended Bethlehem Central High School graduating in 1976. He went on to graduate &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Tufts University in 1980, with degrees in history and political science.

==Career with ABC==
Shapiro worked with ABC News from 1980 until 1993, where he eventually became a producer for &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot;. He also produced for &quot;Nightline&quot; and spent time working in the Chicago news bureau.

==Career with NBC==
===Executive producer of Dateline NBC===
In 1993 he was named the executive producer of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, and worked to address the aftermath of a series of dismissals at NBC regarding a fake news story produced by the show. According to his alma mater, &quot;Shapiro oversaw the production of several major breaking-news stories, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the death of Princess Diana, the Columbine tragedy, the war in Kosovo, and the Clinton impeachment trial when he worked as the executive producer of the Emmy Award winning Dateline. He also served as the executive producer for several hour-long specials, including reports on corporate layoffs in America, migrant farm workers, and welfare reform.&quot;

In 1998 Shapiro took the show from one night to five nights per week, producing about 800 news stories per year. Upon the expansion of the program, Shapiro stated that the news magazines of each of the major American networks had each pushed the genre, and helped &quot;Dateline&quot; become a nightly primetime program. That year the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that, &quot;Under Mr. Shapiro&#x27;s guiding hand – and not always to the delight of media critics – &quot;Dateline&quot; has rewritten the rules of the news magazine show.&quot; In a later article, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said of Shapiro&#x27;s time at &quot;Dateline&quot; that he &quot;presided over the expansion of that show to multiple nights, a trend that was later followed by newsmagazines at both ABC and CBS. Under Mr. Shapiro, &quot;Dateline&quot; won 25 Emmy Awards 19 Edward R. Murrow Awards, three Columbia-DuPont awards&quot; and a Gerald Loeb Award.

===President of NBC News===
Shapiro was appointed the president of NBC News in June 2001, and was also put in charge of overseeing MSNBC. He oversaw the transition between &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchors Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams. In 2003 he was the architect of the NBC news coverage of the Iraq War.

&quot;TV News Check&quot; summarized some additional projects that Shapiro undertook, writing that, &quot;He led the No. 1-rated news programs in every day part: &quot;Today&quot; in the morning, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in the evening and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on Sunday morning ... On cable, Shapiro oversaw the news operations of MSNBC and developed &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; with Joe Scarborough. He also created NBC News Productions which produces programming for many cable channels, including A&amp;E, Bravo, Court TV, Discovery, History, and Lifetime.

In the world of syndication, Shapiro developed two successful syndicated programs produced by NBC News, &quot;The Chris Matthews Show&quot; and &quot;Your Total Health with Hoda Kotb&quot;. On the Web, he spearheaded a number of changes at MSNBC. He expanded NBC News Radio, and began podcasts and cell phone reports. He also helped create and launch NBC&#x27;s digital weather channel, Weatherplus.&quot;

In all, Shapiro won 32 Emmys, 31 Edward R. Murrow Awards, and 3 Columbia DuPont awards during his time at NBC (including those awarded during his time at &quot;Dateline&quot;).

==Career with WNET==
In January 2008 Shapiro was named CEO of WNET public television. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, one of his first moves was to start the programs &quot;&quot;Sunday Arts&quot;, which features the great museum exhibits, films, galleries and performances going on in New York City, and ... &quot;Reel 13&quot;, which air[ed] on Saturday nights and pair[ed] a classic movie with an indie film and a short film created by [their] viewers&quot;.

Shapiro created the news program &quot;Worldfocus&quot; as a public television owned news broadcast in lieu of the prior practice of airing foreign news programs on American public television, saying that, &quot;it’s good for public television to have a show that belongs to public television ... Are we taking a chance? Absolutely; that’s what innovation is about.&quot; The show ran from 2009 to 2010, receiving internal financing as well as funding from The Peter G. Peterson Foundation. He also oversaw the sale of the public television news coverage paper &quot;Current&quot;, a public media-focused trade publication, to the American University School of Communication, saying, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;he found it odd for his organization to publish a paper&quot; about its own industry. In 2011 Shapiro led the bid to manage New Jersey’s public television station that was then renamed NJTV, which brought New Jersey public television under the same umbrella.

Other programs Shapiro commissioned include &quot;New York War Stories&quot;, &quot;New York Goes to War&quot;, &quot;Need to Know&quot;, and &quot;A Cry for Help: A Generation at Risk?&quot;, in addition to the expansion of the network&#x27;s classic movie slots to include more recent independent pictures that appeal to a younger audience.

==Other positions and recognition==
Shapiro has taught at both the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and his alma mater, Tufts University. He has also lectured at schools including MIT and Stanford. In 2002 he was awarded the Light on the Hill award by Tufts, and spoke on his method of reporting the news following 9/11. In 2008, Shapiro received the P.T. Barnum Award from Tufts for his exceptional work in the field of media and entertainment. He has also been the recipient of Sigma Delta Chi Awards, Chris Awards, the George Polk Award, and the Investigative Reporter and Editor Award.

In 2007 Shapiro was elected to the board of directors of the Gannett Company for his &quot;diverse experience with network news and public television&quot; according to chairman Craig A. Dubow. On October 6, 2008, Shapiro was chosen to ring the closing bell of the NASDAQ exchange in New York City. He has served as chairman of the Communications and Media Studies Alumni Advisory Board for his alma mater Tufts University. He is also a member of
the Peabody Awards board of directors, which is presented by the University of Georgia&#x27;s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Shapiro married ABC News correspondent Juju Chang. Chang converted to Judaism upon their marriage. They have three sons: Jared (born 2000), Travis (born 2003), and Mason (born 2007).

<text>A comptroller (pronounced either the same as &quot;controller&quot; or as ) is a management-level position responsible for supervising the quality of accounting and financial reporting of an organization. A financial comptroller is a senior-level executive who acts as the head of accounting, and oversees the preparation of financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements.

In most Commonwealth countries, the comptroller general, auditor general, or comptroller and auditor general is the external auditor of the budget execution of the government and of government-owned companies. Typically, the independent institution headed by the comptroller general is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. In American government, the comptroller is effectively the chief financial officer of a public body.

In business management, the comptroller is closer to a chief audit executive, holding a senior role in internal audit functions. Generally, the title encompasses a variety of responsibilities, from overseeing accounting and monitoring internal controls to countersigning on expenses and commitments.

==Etymology==
The word is a variant of &quot;controller&quot;. The &quot;cont-&quot; or &quot;count-&quot; part in that word was associated with &quot;compt-&quot;, a variant of the verb &quot;count&quot;. The term, though criticized by lexicographers such as Henry Watson Fowler, is probably retained in part because in official titles it was deemed useful to have the title dissociated from the word and concept &quot;control&quot;.

A variant explanation is that &quot;comptroller&quot; evolved in the 15th century through a blend of the French &quot;compte&quot; (&quot;an account&quot;) and the Middle English (someone who checks a copy of a scroll, from the French &quot;contreroule&quot; &quot;counter-roll, scroll copy&quot;), thus creating a title for a who specializes in checking financial ledgers. This etymology explains why the name is often pronounced identically to &quot;controller&quot; despite the distinct spelling. However, &quot;comptroller&quot; is sometimes pronounced phonetically by those unaware of the word&#x27;s origins or who wish specifically to avoid confusion with &quot;controller&quot;.

==Business role==
In business, the comptroller is the person who, independently from the chief financial officer in some countries, oversees accounting, and the implementation and monitoring of internal controls. In countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Canada, a comptroller or financial comptroller reports to the CFO in companies that have one.

Businesses typically use the spelling &quot;controller&quot;, while government organizations use &quot;comptroller&quot;.

<doc id="965046" wikidata="Q174478" url="?curid=965046" title="Blind Boy Fuller">
<text>Fulton Allen (July 10, 1904 – February 13, 1941), known as Blind Boy Fuller, was an American blues guitarist and singer. Fuller was one of the most popular of the recorded Piedmont blues artists, along with Blind Blake, Josh White, and Buddy Moss.

==Life and career==
Allen was born in Wadesboro, North Carolina, United States, one of ten children of Calvin Allen and Mary Jane Walker. Most sources date his birth to 1907, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc indicate 1904. After the death of his mother, he moved with his father to Rockingham, North Carolina. As a boy he learned to play the guitar and also learned from older singers the field hollers, country rags, traditional songs and blues popular in poor rural areas.

He married young, to Cora Allen, and worked as a laborer. He began to lose his eyesight when he was in his mid-teens. According to the researcher Bruce Bastin, &quot;While he was living in Rockingham he began to have trouble with his eyes. He went to see a doctor in Charlotte who allegedly told him that he had ulcers behind his eyes, the original damage having been caused by some form of snow-blindness.&quot; Only the first part of this diagnosis was correct. A 1937 eye examination attributed his vision loss to the long-term effects of untreated neonatal conjunctivitis.

By 1928 he was completely blind. He turned to whatever employment he could find as a singer and entertainer, often playing in the streets. By studying the records of country blues players like Blind Blake and live performances by Gary Davis, Allen became a formidable guitarist, playing on street corners and at house parties in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Danville, Virginia; and then Durham, North Carolina. In Durham, playing around the tobacco warehouses, he developed a local following, which included the guitarists Floyd Council and Richard Trice, the harmonica player Saunders Terrell (better known as Sonny Terry), and the washboard player and guitarist George Washington.
In 1935, James Baxter Long, a record store manager and talent scout in Burlington, North Carolina, secured Allen a recording session with the American Recording Company (ARC). Allen, Davis and Washington recorded several tracks in New York City, including the traditional &quot;Rag, Mama, Rag&quot;. To promote the records, Long credited Allen as Blind Boy Fuller and Washington as Bull City Red.

Over the next five years Fuller recorded over 120 sides, which were released by several labels. His style of singing was rough and direct, and his lyrics were explicit and uninhibited, drawing on every aspect of his experience as an underprivileged, blind black man on the streets—pawnshops, jailhouses, sickness, death—with an honesty that lacked sentimentality. Although he was not sophisticated, his artistry as a folk singer lay in the honesty and integrity of his self-expression. His songs expressed desire, love, jealousy, disappointment, menace and humor.

In April 1936, Fuller recorded ten solo performances and also recorded with guitarist Floyd Council. The following year, after auditioning for J. Mayo Williams, he recorded for Decca Records, but then reverted to ARC. Later in 1937, he made his first recordings with Sonny Terry.

In 1938 Fuller, who was described as having a fiery temper, was imprisoned for shooting a pistol at his wife, wounding her in the leg. His imprisonment prevented him from performing in &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot;, a concert produced by John Hammond in New York City that year. Sonny Terry performed in his place; it was the beginning of Terry&#x27;s long career in folk music. After Fuller was released from prison, he held his last two recording sessions, in New York City in June 1940, but by then he was increasingly physically weak, and much of the material did not match the quality and energy of his earlier recordings.

Fuller&#x27;s repertoire included a number of popular double-entendre &quot;hokum&quot; songs, such as &quot;I Want Some of Your Pie&quot;, &quot;Truckin&#x27; My Blues Away&quot; (1936) (the inspiration for Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27; &quot; comic), &quot;Let Me Squeeze Your Lemon&quot;, and &quot;Get Your Yas Yas Out&quot; (1938) (adapted as &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out&quot; for the title of an album by the Rolling Stones), and the autobiographical &quot;Big House Bound&quot;, about his time in prison. Much of his material was culled from traditional folk and blues songs. He possessed a formidable fingerpicking guitar style. He played a steel National resonator guitar. He was criticised by some as a derivative musician, but his ability to fuse together elements of traditional and contemporary songs and reformulate them in his own performances attracted a broad audience. He was an expressive vocalist and a masterful guitar player, best remembered for his up-tempo ragtime hits, including &quot;Step It Up and Go&quot;. At the same time he was capable of deeper material; his versions of &quot;Lost Lover Blues&quot;, &quot;Rattlesnakin&#x27; Daddy&quot; and &quot;Mamie&quot; are as deep as most Delta blues. Because of his popularity, he may have been overexposed on records, but most of his songs stayed close to tradition, and much of his repertoire and style is kept alive by other Piedmont artists to this day.

==Death==
Fuller underwent a suprapubic cystostomy in July 1940, probably due to the urethral stricture noted on Fuller&#x27;s death certificate, a narrowing or blockage of the urethra which can be caused by syphilitic chancres, infections from gonorrhea, or chlamydia, but continued to require medical treatment. He died at his home in Durham, North Carolina, on February 13, 1941. The cause of death was pyemia, due to an infected bladder, gastrointestinal tract and perineum, plus kidney failure.

He was so popular when he died that his protégé, Brownie McGhee, recorded &quot;The Death of Blind Boy Fuller&quot; for Okeh Records, and then reluctantly began a short-lived career as Blind Boy Fuller No. 2, so that Columbia Records could profit from the deceased musician&#x27;s popularity.

==Grave location==

Fuller&#x27;s grave is Grove Hill Cemetery, located on private property in Durham. State records indicate that this was once an official cemetery, and Fuller&#x27;s interment is recorded. Only one headstone remains, that of one Mary Caston Langey. The funeral arrangements were handled by McLaurin Funeral Home of Durham, and the burial took place on February 15, 1941.

Fuller has been recognized with two plaques in Durham. A plaque placed by the North Carolina Division of Archives and History is located a few miles north of Fuller&#x27;s gravesite, along Fayetteville St. The city of Durham officially recognized Fuller on July 16, 2001, with a commemorative plaque located along the American Tobacco Trail, adjacent to the property where Fuller&#x27;s unmarked grave is located (several hundred feet east of Fayetteville St.).

== Posthumous recognition ==
Blind Boy Fuller was, with Reverend Gary Davis, recognized as one of two Main Honorees by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon them for their contributions to the Piedmont Blues. His influence is acknowledged by many rock artists whose styles draw from the blues, including the Rolling Stones, Rory Gallagher, Eric Clapton and others. Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd was inspired to name the band after seeing the names of blues singers Pink Anderson and Floyd Council in the liner notes of a 1962 album by Fuller (Philips BBL-7512).

<text>HMAS &quot;Hobart was a [[Leander-class cruiser (1931)|modified &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruiser]] which served in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) during [[World War II]]. Originally constructed for the [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Apollo, the ship entered service in 1936, and was sold to Australia two years later. During the war, &quot;Hobart&quot; was involved in the evacuation of British Somaliland in 1940, fought at the Battle of the Coral Sea and supported the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Tulagi in 1942. She was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1943, then returned to service in 1945 and supported the landings at Tarakan, Wewak, Brunei, and Balikpapan. &quot;Hobart&quot; was placed in reserve in 1947, but plans to modernise her and return her to service as an aircraft carrier escort, training ship, or guided missile ship were not followed through. The cruiser was sold for scrapping in 1962.

==Design and construction==

The ship was one of three Modified &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy. The main difference to the previous five &quot;Leander&quot;s was that the newer ships had their machinery and propulsion equipment organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each machinery space, gave the modified ships a different profile from the early &quot;Leander&quot;s, which had a single funnel. To cover the separate machinery spaces, the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation. During design, it was planned to modify the forward-most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship&#x27;s top speed and causing problems with effective fire control.

The cruiser was laid down at HM Dockyard, Devonport, England on 15 August 1933 as HMS &quot;Apollo&quot;. She was launched on 9 October 1934 by Lady Florence, wife of Admiral Sir William Boyle. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 13 January 1936.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy service===

&quot;Apollo&quot; served on the North American and West Indies Station until 1938. On 15 November 1937, the ocean liner , which operated between Liverpool and Valparaíso, Chile, via Bermuda, the West Indies and the Panama Canal, stopped at Bermuda on its way to Chile with the body of former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald who had died aboard on 9 November. MacDonald&#x27;s body was transferred to the Royal Navy at Bermuda for return to Plymouth. All of the Bermuda-based cruisers of the America and West Indies Station were away from Bermuda at that time except for HMS Orion and HMS Apollo. As &quot;Apollo&quot; was undergoing a refit at the dockyard, it would have fallen to &quot;Orion&quot; to deliver MacDonald&#x27;s body, but as she had been temporary flagship since had departed on 27 October for Trinidad (due to civil unrest there) she could not leave the station and &quot;Apollo&quot; was consequently hurried through her refit instead. &quot;Orion&quot; was tasked with the memorial service for MacDonald, whose body was taken aboard the Royal Navy tug &quot;Sandboy&quot; once the &quot;Reina del Pacifico&quot; was in Bermudian waters and landed on Front Street in the City of Hamilton along with the Royal Naval Dockyard Chaplain, the Orion&#x27;s Chaplain, an Honour Guard, sentries and coffin bearers. MacDonald&#x27;s coffin was borne on a gun carriage to the Church of England&#x27;s Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, in a procession that included the ship&#x27;s company of &quot;Orion&quot; and a detachment of the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), serving in the Bermuda Garrison and based at Prospect Camp Scotland. At the cathedral, Arthur Browne, the Bishop of Bermuda, conducted the memorial service, which was followed by a lying in state. Thousands visited to pay their respects. MacDonald&#x27;s body and his daughter departed Bermuda the following day aboard &quot;Apollo&quot;, arriving at Plymouth on 25 November. His funeral was in Westminster Abbey on 26 November, followed by a private cremation service at Golders Green. After cremation, his ashes were taken to Lossiemouth, where a service commenced in his house, &quot;The Hillocks&quot; followed by a procession to Holy Trinity Church, Spynie where they were buried alongside his wife Margaret and their son David at in his native Morayshire.

===Australian acquisition===
The ship was purchased by the Australian Government in 1938, with the transfer of the seaplane tender to the Royal Navy as part of the payment. She was originally to be renamed and transferred to the RAN on 6 October, but the mobilisation of the British Home Fleet in response to the Munich Crisis brought this forward to 28 September. The cruiser arrived in Australia at the end of 1938, and visited her namesake city during February 1939.

===World War II===
At the start of World War II, &quot;Hobart&quot; was initially deployed on patrols of Bass Strait. A month later, on 13 October, the cruiser sailed for Singapore with several RAN destroyers. After arrival, she was assigned to patrol and convoy escort duties in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. In February 1940, she escorted an Australian troop convoy from Colombo to the Middle East, then spent time in Ceylon as flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, before being transferred to Aden with in April to form the core of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Red Sea Force.

The cruiser fired in anger for the first time on 12 June 1940, in retaliation to Italian aircraft attacking Aden. On 19 June, the cruiser&#x27;s Walrus amphibious aircraft dropped bombs on an Italian wireless station on Centre Peak Island in the Red Sea. At the start of August, &quot;Hobart&quot; escorted a relief force to Berbera, in response to the Italian invasion of British Somaliland. Two weeks later, the decision was made to abandon British Somaliland, and &quot;Hobart&quot; was designated headquarters for the evacuation. The Walrus was used to successfully fend off air raids and bomb the Italian headquarters at Zeila, while a 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun was converted into an anti-tank gun and sent to assist in the rearguard action, although the three volunteers crewing the weapon were captured. &quot;Hobart&quot;″s captain orchestrated the evacuation of over 7,000 soldiers and civilians aboard a heterogenous flotilla of vessels. The cruiser was the last ship to leave on 19 August, collecting stragglers in the ship&#x27;s boats while demolition teams and the ship&#x27;s guns destroyed anything of value.
&quot;Hobart&quot; remained in the Red Sea until October, when she sailed to Colombo for refit, then returned to Australia. Shortly after arrival, Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace transferred his flag from to &quot;Hobart&quot;. The cruiser was used as an escort in Australian waters until June 1941, when the ship&#x27;s seaplane and catapult were removed, Crace transferred his flag back to &quot;Canberra&quot;, and &quot;Hobart&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean to relieve sister ship . On 13 July, &quot;Hobart&quot; was in Port Tewfik when the area was bombed. The troopship &quot;Georgic&quot; was damaged by bombs and attempted to beach, but collided with the transport &quot;Gleneran&quot; and forced her ashore as well. &quot;Hobart&quot;″s company helped to evacuate crew and passengers from the ships during the evening, and helped to refloat &quot;Georgic&quot; the next day. On joining the Mediterranean Fleet, &quot;Hobart&quot; was assigned to support Allied forces during the Western Desert campaign until December 1941, when the Japanese declaration of war required the ship to relocate to Australian waters.

The cruiser was diverted to escort a convoy from Colombo to Singapore; the ships arrived on 3 January, the same day as a Japanese air raid. &quot;Hobart&quot; reached Fremantle on 11 January, then escorted a convoy to Java before the month&#x27;s end. On 3 February 1942, while sailing from Singapore to Batavia, &quot;Hobart&quot; and the destroyer came to the aid of the merchant ship &quot;Norah Moller&quot;, which had been bombed by three aircraft. The cruiser collected 57 of the 70 aboard, with the rest aboard &quot;Tenedos&quot;. From this point, the ship was almost constantly deployed on convoy escort duties with the Eastern Fleet. On 25 February, the cruiser was attacked by 27 bombers while refuelling from a tanker at Tanjung Priok. There was only minor damage, but the fuelling operation could not be completed, and &quot;Hobart&quot; was unable to join the Allied force that was defeated during the Battle of the Java Sea two days later.

At the start of May, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and &quot;Hobart&quot; was sent with to rendezvous with United States forces in the Coral Sea. At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral Crace, embarked aboard &quot;Australia&quot; as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Hobart&quot;, US cruiser , and US destroyers , , and ) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands. The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired on a group of eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06; no ships were damaged for the loss of five aircraft. At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships; no ships were hit directly, the only casualties (aboard &quot;Chicago&quot;) were from shrapnel. A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle. The task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby.

On 7 August, &quot;Hobart&quot; supported the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Tulagi.
On the evening of 20 July 1943, while sailing to Espiritu Santo as part of Task Force 74, &quot;Hobart&quot; was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine . The torpedo struck the port quarter and caused serious damage. The damage included significant structural damage around the wardroom, and the loss of electricity supply and steering control. Seven officers and six sailors were killed, while another six officers and one sailor were injured. No submarine was detected prior to or after the attack, and post-attack reconstructions concluded that the unidentified submarine, positioned ahead of the eastward-sailing task force, saw the ships silhouetted against the sunset and fired a spread of torpedoes at &quot;Australia&quot; from at least ; these missed the heavy cruiser, and the torpedo at one edge of the fan impacted against &quot;Hobart&quot; instead. After electrical power and steering were restored, the cruiser limped to Espiritu Santo under the escort of and for temporary repairs, which were performed by , then sailed for Australia on 21 August with the destroyers and escorting. The cruiser arrived in Sydney on 26 August, and was docked at Cockatoo Island Dockyard for repairs and refurbishment; the quantity of damage meant that she was out of service until 1945.

Following her return, &quot;Hobart&quot; was involved in the landing at Tarakan on 25 April 1945, at Wewak on 11 May, at Brunei in June, and at Balikpapan in July. &quot;Hobart&quot; entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August, and was present for Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Following the war, &quot;Hobart&quot; spent 1946 and 1947 in Japanese waters.

&quot;Hobart&quot; received eight battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Mediterranean 1941&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1941&quot;, &quot;Coral Sea 1942&quot;, &quot;Savo Island 1942&quot;, &quot;Guadalcanal 1942&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, &quot;East Indies 1940&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;.
==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Hobart&quot; was paid off into the reserve fleet on 20 December 1947. In 1950, following the failure to find a suitable new British cruiser design, and a dollar shortage preventing the purchase of US vessels, it was decided to modernise &quot;Hobart&quot; and use her as a stop-gap aircraft carrier escort until the destroyers entered service, after which she would serve as a troop convoy escort to the Middle East in the event of a future conflict. This planned role changed in 1952 following a series of financial cutbacks and the realisation that the destroyers were suitable carrier escorts; instead, &quot;Hobart&quot; was to replace &quot;Australia&quot; as the training cruiser. She was taken to the State Dockyard, Newcastle for modification.

During 1953 and 1954, further reductions in the RAN saw one carrier taken off active duty for use as a training vessel, eliminating the need to return &quot;Hobart&quot; to service. Other options for reactivating the cruiser were explored, including conversion to a guided missile ship, but by April 1955, all proposals were abandoned. Despite the conversion work to date having cost £A1 million, the modification was cancelled, and &quot;Hobart&quot; was returned to the reserve fleet and marked for disposal. &quot;Hobart&quot; was sold for scrap on 22 February 1962 to Japanese firm Mitsui &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd. The ship left Sydney under tow on 3 March, and arrived in Osaka on 2 April for breaking up.

<text>HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot; (D 39) was a guided missile destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built in the United States of America to a slight variant of the United States Navy (USN) , she was commissioned into the RAN in 1965. In March 1967, &quot;Hobart&quot; became the first RAN combat ship deployed to fight in the Vietnam War. This marked the start of consistent six-month deployments to the warzone, which continued until late 1971; &quot;Hobart&quot; was redeployed in 1969 and 1970. During the 1968 tour, the destroyer was attacked by a United States Air Force aircraft.

After the Vietnam War, &quot;Hobart&quot; saw service during Operation Navy Help Darwin; the RAN disaster relief effort following Cyclone Tracy, was the first RAN ship to dock at in Western Australia, and completed a round-the-world voyage in 1976. The ship was modernised during the late 1970s. &quot;Hobart&quot; was decommissioned in 2000, and sunk as a dive wreck off South Australia.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Hobart&quot; was one of three guided missile destroyers built for the RAN. Based on the United States Navy&#x27;s , &quot;Hobart&quot; had a displacement of 3,370 tons at standard load, and 4,618 tons at full load, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by two General Electric turbines, which provided to the destroyer&#x27;s two propeller shafts. &quot;Hobart&quot; could achieve speeds of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 20 officers and 312 sailors.

As a guided missile destroyer, &quot;Hobart&quot;″s main armament consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher firing Tartar missiles and two Ikara anti-submarine missile launchers. This was supplemented by two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 guns and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets. Over the course of the ship&#x27;s career, the Mark 13 launcher was modified to fire Standard missiles, the Ikara launchers were stripped out in 1989 and two Phalanx CIWS units were installed in 1991.

&quot;Hobart&quot; was laid down by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company at Bay City, Michigan on 26 October 1962. The ship was launched on 9 January 1964 by Alison Hay, the wife of David Hay, the Australian ambassador to the United Nations. &quot;Hobart&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 18 December 1965. The cost of the destroyer was approximately A$45 million, including the initial load of supplies and ammunition. During construction, the ship was assigned the United States Navy hull number DDG-26. After commissioning, &quot;Hobart&quot; remained in American waters for eight months on trials and training exercises. &quot;Hobart&quot; left the US on 3 August 1966, and sailed via Hawaii and Fiji before reaching her namesake city on 1 September. The ship spent very little time in Australian waters before being deployed to fight in the Vietnam War in March 1967.

==Operational history==

===Vietnam deployments===

During the mid-1960s, the United States government pressured Australia to increase the resources it was committing to the Vietnam War; one of the requests was for a combat vessel to help the USN meet the demand for naval gunfire support operations. The idea of deploying a RAN combat ship was initially hampered by the number of ships available, particularly with commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve and involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, along with the difficulty of operating and maintaining British-designed ships with USN resources. On 14 December 1966, the Australian Cabinet approved the deployment of &quot;Hobart&quot; as part of increases to Australian military commitment to the conflict. Destroyers deployed to the Vietnam theatre generally operated in one of four roles:
* Patrols along the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon to interdict coastal shipping, with secondary attacks on inland supply lines and military targets, along with coastal defence sites that had fired on American and Australian ships. Ships assigned to Sea Dragon were normally split into a northern and southern unit (although during 1967 up to four units were operating at any time), with each unit made up of two to three ships. However, the Australian government forbade RAN vessels from operating in the northern area.
* Naval gunfire support operations to assist ground forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps units operating closest to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Seven ships were usually stationed on the &#x27;gunline&#x27;, and attacks fell into two categories: &#x27;unspotted&#x27; shelling of areas where People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) or Viet Cong (VC) forces and facilities were known or believed to be, and &#x27;spotted&#x27; fire missions in direct support of ground troops. During these operations, &quot;Hobart&quot; operated under the callsign &quot;Royal Purple&quot;.
* Anti-infiltration operations under Operation Market Time, which aimed to stop the logistic supply and reinforcement of VC units operating in South Vietnam by tracking, intercepting, and searching coastal shipping. RAN destroyers were never formally assigned to Market Time, but the overlap of the gunline and Market Time operational areas meant the ships were often called on to assist by tracking suspicious ships or participating in raids.
* Escort of USN aircraft carriers involved in Operation Rolling Thunder airstrikes.
Although RAN ships on deployment were expected to fulfil all duties of an equivalent American destroyer, they were forbidden by the Australian government from operating outside the Vietnam theatre on unrelated United States Seventh Fleet duties (such as the Taiwan Patrol Force, guard ship duties at Hong Kong, or the Space Recovery Program). After the invasion of Cambodia in 1970, RAN ships were also prohibited from entering Cambodian waters.

While deployed to Vietnam, the destroyers were placed under the administrative control of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam in addition to that of the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet. Operationally, the RAN vessels were under the command of the Seventh Fleet. Arrangements were made to provide logistic support through the United States Pacific Fleet. A USN lieutenant was assigned to each ship during deployments to act as a liaison with the Seventh Fleet. The deployment of &quot;Hobart&quot; in March 1967 began a pattern of six-month deployments for RAN destroyers, with a constant RAN presence with the Seventh Fleet. Australia was the only allied nation to provide naval support to the United States Navy during the Vietnam War.

====First deployment====
On 15 March 1967, &quot;Hobart&quot; arrived at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay to join the Seventh Fleet. After a comprehensive familiarisation period, &quot;Hobart&quot; replaced on 31 March, taking over the US destroyer&#x27;s gunfire support duties. By 04:45 the next morning, the Australian ship had already fired 100 rounds. On 3 April, the forward 5-inch gun mount became unserviceable, a state which remained for four-and-a-half-days. &quot;Hobart&quot; remained on the gunline until 15 April, during which she fired 1,651 shells. The ship was then rotated to Sea Dragon operations. The destroyer was fired on by shore batteries several times, and on one occasion took minor shrapnel damage. Several explosions in 5-inch/54 gun mounts during the later weeks of April saw all equipped destroyers (including &quot;Hobart&quot;) reassigned to other duties while investigations into the cause (believed to be a bad batch of ammunition) were explored. &quot;Hobart&quot; was attached to the carrier escort group for on 23 April. On 29 April, the destroyer sailed to Subic, underwent self-maintenance, then returned to Sea Dragon operations. Over the next week, &quot;Hobart&quot; and cooperated on the interdiction of coastal shipping during a period of heavy activity; previous successes saw the North Vietnamese begin to increase retaliation with coastal artillery in an attempt to dissuade American operations. Apart from a brief stint on the gunline, &quot;Hobart&quot; remained assigned to Sea Dragon until 26 May, when sailed to Subic for maintenance, with both 5-inch gun barrels replaced.
After delays caused by monsoonal conditions, the ship returned to the gunline on 18 June. During this period, the destroyer was also called on to escort the amphibious warfare ships involved in the Beacon Torch landings. After mid-June, the number of fire missions undertaken by &quot;Hobart&quot; dropped because of a need to conserve 5-inch/54 ammunition across the Seventh Fleet, and the fact that Marines in the area had successfully established their own artillery units in the area and were less reliant on naval gunfire. On 23 June, &quot;Hobart&quot; rotated to Sea Dragon. A reduction in the number of seaborne infiltration attempts and the increasing availability of spotter aircraft meant that most gunfire missions were against inland targets like truck convoys. On 10 July, the destroyer left the operational area and sailed to Subic via Hong Kong, and underwent self-maintenance. This was completed on 24 July, and &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed for the operational area. The ship was double tasked to the escort group and Sea Dragon operations; three destroyers were required to escort the carrier at any time, with any additional ships operating on Sea Dragon duties. On 29 July, a fire aboard the carrier necessitated the carrier&#x27;s removal from the operational area; &quot;Hobart&quot; was one of the ships assigned to escort and assist with casualties. The ship returned to Sea Dragon operations on 31 July. This continued until 16 August, and after maintenance at Subic, &quot;Hobart&quot; was attached to the gunline on 6 September. On 14 September, &quot;Hobart&quot; arrived in Subic, handed over responsibility to , and sailed for home.

During this deployment, &quot;Hobart&quot; fired over 10,000 rounds at 1,050 targets during 160 days at sea, and was fired on ten times, with no casualties. &quot;Hobart&quot; was awarded the United States Navy Unit Commendation for this tour of duty. Personnel awards included a Distinguished Service Order, a British Empire Medal, a Mention in Despatches and 25 Naval Board commendations.

====Second deployment====
&quot;Hobart&quot; was deployed to Vietnam for the second time in 1968, relieving &quot;Perth&quot; on 31 March. On 13 April, the destroyer arrived on the gunline to relieve . Five days later, she began Sea Dragon operations with . The ships were unsuccessfully shelled by coastal artillery on 22 and 23 April, then spent the next three days attempting to attract attention from shore batteries so they could be bombed by aircraft. &quot;Hobart&quot;″s participation in Sea Dragon ended in late April, and after maintenance in Hong Kong and Taiwan from 1 to 20 May, resumed gunline duties. This continued until 2 June, when the destroyer&#x27;s guns required new barrels. On 11 June, the destroyer returned to the Sea Dragon area of operations, joining . During this deployment, boat traffic between the mainland and Tiger Island was seen as a priority, with gunline ships also granted approval to operate against targets in this area. Early in the month, problems with the 5-inch/54 guns aboard &quot;Hobart&quot; and several US destroyers appeared; &quot;Hobart&quot;″s captain decided to only fire the guns in emergencies until the problem was clearly identified. The destroyer joined &quot;Hobart&quot; and &quot;Chandler&quot; to make up for the lack of firepower.

During the evening of 16–17 June, the three destroyers were ordered to undertake surveillance missions around Tiger Island, because of reports of North Vietnamese helicopter activity in the area. At 03:09, &quot;Hobart&quot;″s radar picked up an aircraft approaching with no IFF transponder active. At 03:14, the aircraft fired a single missile at the ship, which killed one sailor, wounded two others and damaged the chief petty officer&#x27;s mess, air search radar and missile control compartments and the ship&#x27;s funnels. Two minutes later, the aircraft made a second pass and fired two missiles. The missiles hit simultaneously: one penetrated the superstructure and damaged the gunners&#x27; store, engineers workshop and aft seamans&#x27; mess, while the other hit close to the original missile, causing further damage to the mess and missile control room, while also damaging the Tartar checkout room, killing another sailor and wounded six others. There was also major damage around the destroyer&#x27;s Ikara magazine, but as &quot;Hobart&quot; was not carrying any Ikara missiles at the time, the potential magazine fire did not occur. The aircraft came around for a third attack run, but was scared off when &quot;Hobart&quot;″s forward gun turret, under independent control, fired five rounds at the aircraft. At 03:30, &quot;Edson&quot; reported coming under fire, and &quot;Hobart&quot; captain ordered the three destroyers to take up anti-aircraft formation. At 05:15, the three destroyers linked up with the cruiser (which had been hit by a missile from another aircraft) and the escorting destroyer , and continued anti-aircraft manoeuvring. After being relieved, &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed for Subic Bay, where the damage was inspected by RAN and USN personnel, including three admirals. Debris collected from &quot;Hobart&quot; and the other ships indicated that the missiles were of United States Air Force (USAF) origin.
The attacks on &quot;Hobart&quot; and the other ships were the capstone of a series of firing incidents between 15 and 17 June, and an inquiry was held by the USN into the incidents, with three RAN personnel attending as technical advisors. The inquiry found that a few hours before the attack on &quot;Hobart&quot;, Patrol Craft Fasts PCF-12 and PCF-19, along with , were attacked by what they identified at the time as hovering enemy aircraft, but were believed to be friendly planes; PCF-19 was sunk in the attack. F-4 Phantoms of the USAF Seventh Air Force, responding several hours after the attack on the PCFs, were unable to distinguish between the radar signature of surface ships and airborne helicopters and instead opened fire on &quot;Hobart&quot;, &quot;Boston&quot;, and &quot;Edson&quot;. &quot;Hobart&quot; underwent repairs in Subic Bay, and returned to duty on the gunline on 25 July.

During the evening of 27 July, &quot;Hobart&quot; was involved in another friendly fire incident; this time, shells from the ship fell close to a Marine unit&#x27;s command post and injured three Marines. The fault was found to be with the Marine unit&#x27;s spotter, who was inexperienced, failed to signal the close proximity of friendly units to the target, and failed to fully identify the target before calling for five rounds of shellfire. Although &quot;Hobart&quot; was asked to rotate Sea Dragon duties on 2 August to relieve a destroyer experiencing gunnery faults, nine days early, the destroyer&#x27;s captain refused, as he wanted more time to prepare the ship after the repairs, particularly as the air warning radars were yet to become operational, and the gun mounts were experiencing minor problems. The Sea Dragon deployment did not eventuate, and after operating near the DMZ, &quot;Hobart&quot; was reassigned to gunfire support duties around southern Vietnam on 12 August. On 22 August, the destroyer fired to support the 1st Australian Task Force in Phuoc Tuy Province: the first time a RAN destroyer provided naval gunfire support for Australian soldiers in the war. On 29 September, &quot;Perth&quot; relieved &quot;Hobart&quot; at Subic, and &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed for home. One sailor was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his actions during the 17 June attack (the government received advice that as it was a friendly fire incident, a non-combat medal like the British Empire Medal should be awarded instead, but this was ignored), while two Mentions in Despatches and 23 Naval Board commendations were also issued.

====Third deployment====
&quot;Hobart&quot; returned to Vietnam for her third tour on 28 March 1970, taking over from the destroyer . After working up, the destroyer relieved from gunline duties on 6 April. On 21 April, the ship moved north to near the DMZ. Three days later, the destroyer rammed and sank a South Vietnamese fishing craft, but rescued the five crew and transported them to shore. At the end of April, the ship sailed to Subic for maintenance. After this was completed, &quot;Hobart&quot; returned to gunline duties on 11 May, and remained on station until 24 May, when the destroyer sailed to Singapore for maintenance. &quot;Hobart&quot; resumed gunline operations on 6 June; these continued until 28 June, when she sailed to Subic for rebarrelling. The ship returned to the gunline on 9 July, and operated until 29 August, when she sailed to Singapore for maintenance, then Bangkok for naval exercises. Returning on 13 September, &quot;Hobart&quot; was called to relieve on the gunline after an explosion in one of the American destroyer&#x27;s gun mounts. On 22 September, &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed to Subic. The destroyer was relieved by &quot;Perth&quot; on 26 September. Two personnel were mentioned in despatches, and 23 Naval Board commendations were issued for the deployment.

During 1971, the Australian government decided to withdraw all forces from Vietnam by the end of the year. &quot;Hobart&quot; made no further deployments to Vietnam, and after completed her assigned operations in September 1971, no further RAN ships were deployed to the warzone for combat operations. &quot;Hobart&quot; received the battle honour &quot;Vietnam 1967–70&quot; for her wartime service, adding to the eight honours inherited from the previous ship of the name.

===1970s–1980s===

In 1972, &quot;Hobart&quot; underwent modernisation in the US. In June 1974, the destroyer was involved in the Exercise Kangaroo One. On 15 October, &quot;Hobart&quot; departed from Sydney with for a five-week tour of Australian and New Zealand ports. While in her namesake city, &quot;Hobart&quot; was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales; the first time the royal had boarded an Australian warship.

On 27 December 1974, &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed from Sydney as one of thirteen RAN ships involved in Operation Navy Help Darwin; the RAN disaster relief effort following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy on 24–25 December 1974. Later in the year, the destroyer participated in the multinational exercise RIMPAC 75, then embarked on a three-month deployment in the Indian Ocean, during which &quot;Hobart&quot; became the first RAN ship to visit Malé in the Maldives, and the first warship to dock at , the new naval base in Western Australia. Between May and September 1976, &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed on a round-the-world voyage; the 109-day deployment was named Exercise Phineas Fogg after the main character from &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. During this voyage, the ship visited nineteen ports in twelve countries, and represented Australia at the fleet review off New York City commemorating the United States Bicentennial.

During 1977 and 1978, &quot;Hobart&quot; underwent a half-life modernisation, during which the propulsion system was converted from furnace oil to diesel fuel, and a Naval Combat Data System was installed. In July 1979, &quot;Hobart&quot; and the Antarctic Support Vessel &quot;Thala Dan&quot; were sent to Macquarie Island to retrieve a badly injured researcher and return him to Australia. In order to transfer the researcher to the ship, &quot;Hobart&quot;″s personnel constructed a makeshift helipad, which was used by &quot;Thala Dan&quot;″s helicopter to deliver the injured man to the destroyer. &quot;Hobart&quot; remained in Australian waters during the early 1980s, with the exception of deployments to Hawaii for RIMPAC, to the North West Indian Ocean for 6 months in 1981 and participation in Kangaroo exercises. The destroyer underwent refit in 1984. In 1985, &quot;Hobart&quot; sailed to Canada to represent Australia at a naval review recognising the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s founding. During 1986, the ship was deployed to South-east Asia, which was repeated in 1987. During early 1988, the destroyer participated in activities celebrating Australia&#x27;s Bicentenary, then later in the year sailed to join the RIMPAC exercise. In 1989, the destroyer&#x27;s Ikara launchers were removed during a refit.

===1990s–2000===
&quot;Hobart&quot; visited New Zealand in 1991 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Royal New Zealand Navy. During 1992, the destroyer participated in RIMPAC. In 1993, &quot;Hobart&quot; visited South-east Asia, then participated in the first Exercise Kakadu. The ship returned to Hawaii for RIMPAC 94, and was assigned command of one of the exercise task groups. In 1995, the ship was again deployed to South-east Asia, participated in celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Pacific War&#x27;s end, and visited New Zealand. &quot;Hobart&quot; won the Gloucester Cup for 1995, a trophy awarded to the most efficient ship of the RAN during a calendar year; this was the eighth time the Cup was won by the destroyer. The ship was docked for refit for most of 1996, with post-refit trials extending into 1997.

During early 1998, &quot;Hobart&quot; was deployed to exercises in New Zealand, then sailed to Queensland in May. From August until December, the ship, accompanied by , , and , visited ports in Indonesia and South-east Asia. &quot;Hobart&quot; spent most of 1999 either alongside in Sydney, or on exercises in Jervis Bay.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Hobart&quot; paid off on 12 May 2000. She was given to the South Australian Government by the federal Department of Defence in August 2000.

Prior to the scuttling, preparatory work was done to ensure safe diving and minimal environmental impact, based on international best practices and mostly undertaken at Port Adelaide by contracted labour and some volunteers. Oil and other contaminants were removed. The goal was to maintain the vessel&#x27;s character as a fighting ship, but in the interests of safety, some entrances were sealed, some doors, hatches and sharp and protruding objects were removed, and corridors and openings widened. All furniture and equipment obstructing access or not secured was removed.

The ship was sunk as a dive wreck on 5 November 2002 in Yankalilla Bay, South Australia at , west-north-west of Marina St. Vincent, within the Encounter Marine Park. The wreck site is officially known as the Fleurieu Artificial Reef. The scuttled ship is scheduled as a historic shipwreck as per the South Australian &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981&quot; and has a protected zone of radius which prohibits boating activity unless the operator has a permit.

The HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot; Memorial Lookout is located is north of Wirrina Cove, at Little Gorge, on the road to Normanville.

<doc id="965065" wikidata="Q135256" url="?curid=965065" title="Menticirrhus">
<text>Menticirrhus is a genus of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Sciaenidae, the drums or croakers. They are commonly known as kingcroakers or kingfish. These fish are found in the Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Menticirrhus&quot; was first proposed as a genus in 1861 by the American biologist Theodore Gill with &quot;Perca alburnus&quot;, a species described by Linnaeus in 1763 from Charleston, as its only species and designated as its type species. This genus has been placed in the subfamily Sciaeninae by some workers, but the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; does not recognise subfamilies within the Sciaenidae which it places in the order Acanthuriformes.

==Etymology==
&quot;Menticirrhus&quot; is a combination of &quot;mentum&quot;, meaning &quot;chin&quot;, and &quot;cirrhus&quot;, which means barbel, an allusion to the single thick barbel on the chin.

==Species==
&quot;Menticirrhus&quot; contains the following species:
*&quot;Menticirrhus americanus&quot; (Southern kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus elongatus&quot; (Pacific kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus littoralis&quot; (Gulf kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus nasus&quot; (Highfin king croaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus ophicephalus&quot; (Snakehead kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus paitensis&quot; (Paita kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus panamensis&quot; (Panama kingcroaker)
*&quot;Menticirrhus saxatilis&quot; (Northern kingfish)
*&quot;Menticirrhus undulatus&quot; (California kingcroaker)

==Characteristics==
&quot;Menticirrhus&quot; kingfish have elongated bodies which have a rounded cross section and a flat underside. The head is long and low with a somewhat conical snout which protrudes past the horizontal mouth. There are slits and pores above the mouth with a short, stout barbel on the chin with a pore at its tip and a number of pores at its base. The preoperculum may be smooth or weakly serrated and the gill cover is incised at its angle. The dorsal fin is supported by between 10 and 13 flexible sins and between 19 and 27 soft rays while the anal fin has a single weak spine and 7 to 9 soft rays. The scales are small and ctenoid. The largest species in the genus is the California kingcroaker (&quot;M. undulatus&quot;) which has a maximum published total length of and the smallest is the Paita kingcroaker (&quot;M. paitensis&quot;) which has a maximum published total length of .

==Distribution==
&quot;Menticirrhus&quot; fishes are found in the eastern Pacific between California and Peru and in the western Atlantic from Massachusetts in the north to northern Argentina.

<text>Państwowy Korpus Bezpieczeństwa (Polish for &quot;National Security Corps&quot;, abbreviated PKB; sometimes also called &quot;Kadra Bezpieczeństwa&quot;) was a Polish underground police force organized under German occupation during World War II by the Polish Home Army and Government Delegation for Poland. It was trained as the core of a future police force for a planned Polish all-national uprising, and for after Poland&#x27;s liberation. The Corps&#x27; first commander was Lt. Col. Marian Kozielewski. He was later replaced by Stanisław Tabisz. In October 1943 the &quot;PKB&quot; had 8,400 officers; by early 1944 the number had grown to almost 12,000.

The PKB was created by the Department of the Internal Affairs of the Delegate&#x27;s Office in 1940, mostly from members of the pre-war Polish police and volunteers. PKB carried out investigation and criminal intelligence duties as well as gathered reports of the Gestapo and Kripo in the General Government. It enforced the verdicts prepared by the Directorate of Civil Resistance and Directorate of Underground Resistance and passed by the Underground court.

A unit of PKB commanded by Henryk Iwański purportedly distinguished itself during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943. However, according to the work of a Polish-Israeli research team (Dr. Dariusz Libionka and Dr. Laurence Weinbaum), much of what Henryk Iwański wrote should be relegated to the realm of confabulation or manipulation of the Communist secret police.

<doc id="965082" wikidata="Q3087558" url="?curid=965082" title="Stock footage">
<text>Stock footage, and similarly, archive footage, library pictures, and file footage is film or video footage that can be used again in other films. Stock footage is beneficial to filmmakers as it saves shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is called a &quot;stock shot&quot; or a &quot;library shot&quot;. Stock footage may have appeared in previous productions but may also be outtakes or footage shot for previous productions and not used. Examples of stock footage that might be utilized are moving images of cities and landmarks, wildlife in their natural environments, and historical footage. Suppliers of stock footage may be either rights managed or royalty-free. Many websites offer direct downloads of clips in various formats.

==History==
Stock footage companies began to emerge in the mid-1980s, offering clips mastered on Betacam SP, VHS, and film formats. Many of the smaller libraries that specialized in niche topics such as extreme sports, technological or cultural collections were bought out by larger concerns such as Corbis or Getty Images over the next couple of decades.

==Films and television==
Stock footage can be used to integrate news footage or notable figures into a film. For instance, the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; used stock footage extensively, modified with computer-generated imagery to portray the lead character meeting such historic figures such as John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon.

 News programs use film footage from their libraries when more recent images are not available. Such usage is often labeled on-screen with an indication that the footage being shown is file footage.

Television and movies series also often recycle footage taken from previous installments. For instance, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise kept a large collection of starships, planets, backgrounds, and explosions, which would appear on a regular basis throughout Star Trek&#x27;s five series and ten films, being used with minimal alteration. That kept production costs down as models, mattes, and explosions were expensive to create. The advances in computer graphics in the late 1990s and early 2000s helped to significantly reduce the cost of Star Trek&#x27;s production and allowed for a much wider variety of shots than previous model and painting-based visuals. Other films that re-used film footage from previous productions include &quot;&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;Hitman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Halloween II&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; &quot;&amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;.

Some series, particularly those made for children, such as &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, reuse footage that is shown in many episodes. Meant for a young audience, the approach increases viewers&#x27; familiarity between shows. This introduces problems such as the requirement to, for example, wear the same clothing and inconsistency can sometimes become a problem. When cleverly filmed it is possible to avoid many of these problems.

Many broadcast shows use stock-footage clips as establishing shots of a particular city, which imply that the show is shot on location when in fact, it may be shot in a backlot studio. One or two establishing shots of an exotic location such as the Great Wall of China, Easter Island, or French Polynesia will save production companies the major costs of transporting crew and equipment to those actual locations.

Stock footage is often used in commercials when there is not enough money or time for production. More often than not these commercials are political or issue-oriented in nature. Sometimes it can be used to composite moving images that create the illusion of having on-camera performers appear to be on location. The term &quot;B-roll&quot; may refer to stock footage or newly shot scenes.

Stock footage that appears on television screens or monitors shown in movies or television shows is referred to as &quot;playback&quot;. In &quot;Power Rangers&quot; or &quot;&quot;, which was written by and starring Will Ferrell as a San Diego news anchor, the studio purchased archival 1970s clips from San Diego stock footage firm New &amp; Unique Videos. The playback footage of a hurricane featured in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Smart House&quot; came from the vaults of the same San Diego firm.

Stock footage also appears many a time in animated series which is mostly a transition to live-action stock footage.

One of the most common uses of stock footage is in documentaries. Use of stock footage allows the filmmaker to tell the story of historical events such as World War II &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series, to document modern underwater archaeology activities, or to supplement content in natural history documentaries. Budgets may not be sufficient to keep a production crew on site for long-term projects, and stock footage allows the producer to pick the moments in time that are most important to the story or to give context to historical events.

Several films that would otherwise be completely lost have surviving footage due to the film being used as a stock footage. For example, &quot;The Cat Creeps&quot; has some scenes preserved in the movie &quot;Boo&quot;, and scenes from &quot;Queen of the Night Clubs&quot; are preserved as stock footage in &quot;Winner Take All&quot;. If not for its use as stock footage, these films would be lost entirely.

Stock footage is also used in live reality TV shows such as &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot;.

In the early 2020s, stock footage of studio audience applause and reactions was used in television shows in place of a live studio audience due to the then-current COVID-19 pandemic.

==Corporate usage==

Companies throughout the world use stock footage in their video productions for in-house meetings, annual conventions, seminars, and other events. It has become popular to videotape interviews of CEOs and other VIPs using a green screen backdrop. When the green is keyed out during post-production, stock footage or stock shots are inserted, to impart a particular message.

==Public domain==
One of the largest producers of public domain stock footage is the United States government. All videos produced by the United States military, NASA, and other agencies are available for use as stock footage. There are a number of companies that own the copyrights to large libraries of stock footage and charge filmmakers a fee for using it, but they rarely demand royalties. Stock footage comes from myriad sources including the public domain, other movies and television programs, news outlets, and purpose-shot stock footage.

==Format==

===Evolution===

With each introduction of new standard, it requires reshooting, rerendering, or rescanning the popular footage as well as new images to show the capabilities of the next standard. Betacam SP, VHS, and early digital footage was shot in standard-definition (SD), in 4:3 aspect ratio. Next came a higher resolution format, High Definition (HD), with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is closer to cinema widescreen formats, which has now been advanced by Ultra-high-definition television (UHD). Many stock-footage companies and producers were concerned that their libraries would become irrelevant. Many companies are also including virtual reality (VR) and 360-degree video footage.

===Container===
Popular digital container formats include MOV (QuickTime File Format) AVI, FLV, MP4, and MXF, which are commonly used in non-linear editing system applications such as Avid, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere Pro.

<text>HMS &quot;Afridi&quot; was one of 16 destroyers built for the Royal Navy shortly before the beginning of Second World War in 1939. Completed in 1938 the ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet where she served as a flotilla leader. &quot;Afridi&quot; was briefly involved enforcing the arms blockade on the combatants in the Spanish Civil War. The ship returned home shortly after the start of the Second World War and was assigned convoy escort duties. She played an active role in the Norwegian Campaign of April–May 1940, escorting convoys to and from Norway. &quot;Afridi&quot; was sunk by German dive bombers on 3 May as she was escorting the evacuation convoy after the failure of the Namsos Campaign.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Afridi&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

== Construction and career ==
Authorized as one of seven Tribal-class destroyers under the 1935 Naval Estimates, &quot;Afridi&quot; was the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 10 March 1936 from Vickers-Armstrong and was laid down on 9 June at the company&#x27;s High Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, shipyard. She was launched on 8 June 1937 by Lady Foster. &quot;Afridi&quot; was completed on 29 April 1938 and commissioned on 3 May at a cost of £341,462 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Tribal Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet and arriving at Malta on 3 June. In July, she sailed for the Mediterranean Spanish coast to enforce the arms embargo imposed by the Non-Intervention Committee on both sides of the Spanish Civil War. The following month &quot;Afridi&quot; hosted Rear-Admiral John Tovey, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet&#x27;s destroyers, for exercises in the Ionian Sea. On 18 September, &quot;Afridi&quot; rendezvoused with her sister ship, , and the heavy cruiser in the Aegean Sea before continuing onwards to Istanbul, Turkey, for a formal visit the next day. Rising tensions during the Munich Crisis caused the remainder of the Black Sea cruise to be cancelled on 21 September. The ship sailed for Alexandria, British Egypt, where the destroyer was briefly refitted from 9 November to 17 December. &quot;Afridi&quot; then joined the rest of the first batch of Tribals in Malta which had also been assigned to the flotilla and Captain G. H. Creswell could assume his role as Captain (D).

On 23 February 1939, the ship led her flotilla to Gibraltar where the Mediterranean and Home Fleets were gathering for combined exercises. These ran from 28 February to 18 March and involved dozens of ships from both commands. The ships of the Mediterranean Fleet then split up for visits to various nearby ports; &quot;Afridi&quot; was lightly damaged when she collided with the light cruiser off Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, during the transfer of mail on the night of 21/22 March and had to return to Malta for repairs. When Italy invaded Albania on 7 April, the Mediterranean Fleet was mobilised and remained on a war footing for most of May. During this time the 1st Tribal Destroyer Flotilla was redesignated as the 4th Destroyer Flotilla (DF). By July 7 tensions had decreased such that &quot;Afridi&quot; and her sisters , , and were able to escort the aircraft carrier on a visit to Athens, Greece. The following month, the fleet spent a week exercising in the area between the Greek island of Crete and British Cyprus. As tensions rose in Europe later in August, the fleet was mobilised and continued to train in preparation for war with Italy. As part of its preparations, the Admiralty had closed the Mediterranean to British shipping and &quot;Afridi&quot; and seven other destroyers escorted one group of ships that had collected at Suez, Egypt, through the Red Sea to reduce the congestion.

=== Second World War ===
When Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September, &quot;Afridi&quot; was still in the Red Sea. As Italy took steps to prove her neutrality, the destroyers were released from their mission and returned to Alexandria where they began escorting convoys and conducting contraband inspections of non-British ships. This was not the best use of the Tribals and the 4th DF was ordered back to England in October. It was based at Immingham on the Humber and mostly escorted convoys up and down the eastern coast of Britain. The flotilla was transferred to Rosyth, Scotland, to carry out convoy escort duties between the UK and Norway in December. Cresswell was relieved by Captain Philip Vian on 31 December.

By January 1940, a number of defects had become noticeable, including leaks and problems with turbine blades that caused &quot;Afridi&quot; to begin a refit at a commercial shipyard in West Hartlepool on 17 January. Vian decided that Captain Robert Sherbrooke of &quot;Cossack&quot; needed some leave and so exchanged ships with him for the duration of the refit which lasted until 19 March. The 4th DF was then allocated to Plan R 4, a preemptive occupation of cities in western Norway after a German invasion had begun, and was tasked to escort the troop-laden ships of the 1st Cruiser Squadron to Bergen and Stavanger. The Germans decided to move first and occupied most Norwegian ports in a sea- and airborne assault (Operation Weserübung) on 9 April that took both the Norwegians and the Allies by surprise.
Receiving word that the Royal Air Force had attacked north-bound German warships in the North Sea on 7 April, the Home Fleet put to sea that evening. The 2nd Cruiser Squadron departed Rosyth with its two light cruisers, escorted by &quot;Afridi&quot; and the 4th DF, with orders to sweep through the North Sea before rendezvousing with the main body of the Home Fleet. On the morning of 9 April the 4th DF, minus , was tasked with attacking Bergen, covered by the 18th Cruiser Squadron, but the Admiralty cancelled the attack that afternoon when it received reports that two German light cruisers were in port. As the British ships were falling back on the main body of the Home Fleet, they were attacked by 88 bombers of Bomber Wing 26 (Kampfgeschwader 26) and Bomber Wing 30 (Kampfgeschwader 30), sinking &quot;Gurkha&quot; and lightly damaging the battleship .

After refuelling at Scapa Flow the following day, &quot;Afridi&quot;, five of her sisters and two light cruisers departed on the evening of 11 April, arriving off Stadlandet the following morning. The destroyers were split up to search the area for German ships before rendezvousing with the cruisers at dusk, but an inaccurate spot report of a German battlecruiser and cruiser that afternoon, interrupted the searches when the destroyers were recalled. On the morning of 13 April the destroyers were sent to search the Romsdalsfjord and only found four merchant ships. As they were leaving Ålesund they were unsuccessfully attacked by a dozen bombers from III Group, Demonstration Wing 1 (Lehrgeschwader 1). The following morning they were ordered north to the Namsos area to examine its suitability for an Allied landing and to coordinate with local Norwegian forces. Harbour facilities were assessed as inadequate and that troops should be landed elsewhere and transferred to destroyers for off-loading at Namsos. The Admiralty ordered that the 148th Infantry Brigade, already at sea, to be diverted to the anchorage at Lillesjona; its troopships arrived there at dawn on 16 April and began transferring their troops to the destroyers after they had completed refuelling. Major General Adrian Carton de Wiart, commander of the Namsos-area forces, also moved from to &quot;Afridi&quot;. Half-a-dozen Luftwaffe bombers disrupted the transfer that afternoon, but their only success was to put some fragments through &quot;Afridi&quot;″s bow. The destroyers unloaded their troops that night and the rest of the troops arrived the following evening. The destroyers and their covering cruisers were ordered home on 19 April and &quot;Afridi&quot; transferred Carton de Wiart to the anti-aircraft cruiser before departing.

&quot;Afridi&quot; and four other destroyers escorted a small supply convoy to Åndalsnes and Molde that was so heavily attacked by the Luftwaffe on 27 April that they had to abort their mission before two of the ships could complete their unloading. The former town was set on fire, but the ships only suffered splinter damage. They were attacked again the following day as they withdrew.

The Allied defeat during the Namsos Campaign forced them to evacuate the survivors. &quot;Afridi&quot; was one of the escorts for the troopships that arrived at the entrance to the Namsenfjorden on 1 May to take them off, but thick fog delayed them until the following day. On the evening of 2 May, the destroyer led the heavy cruiser and three French troopships to Namsos. Two transports were able to dock in the harbour, but the third and &quot;York&quot; had to have the troops ferried to them by the destroyers and trawlers. All the ships except &quot;Afridi&quot; departed at 02:30, but she waited until 03:15 for the rearguard to reach the port before leaving herself.

The Germans spotted the evacuation convoy early that morning and Luftwaffe attacks began around 08:45. At 10:00 a &quot;Junkers Ju 87&quot; &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber of I Group, Dive-bomber Wing 1 (Sturzkampfgeschwader 1) hit the with a bomb that caused her forward magazine to explode. &quot;Afridi&quot; and the destroyers and went to her aid and fought off two more air attacks while rescuing survivors. &quot;Afridi&quot; sank &quot;Bison&quot; by gunfire around noon after twice missing with torpedoes and departed the area with 69 survivors on board. When she rejoined the convoy at 14:00, another dive bombing attack developed. The ship was targeted by more Stukas diving from each side, making evasive manoeuvres ineffectual. She was hit by two bombs, one passing through the wireless telegraphy office and exploding beside the forward boiler room, the second hitting just forward of the bridge and starting a severe fire at the after end of the mess decks. &quot;Imperial&quot; came alongside to port and to starboard to take aboard survivors. At 14:45 hours, &quot;Afridi&quot; capsized and sank bow-first with the loss of 52 crewmen at . Thirteen soldiers were also lost—the only casualties among the whole force evacuated from Åndalsnes and Namsos–and 30 of the 69 Frenchmen she had picked up from &quot;Bison&quot;.

<text>Freaks and Geeks is an American teen comedy-drama television series created by Paul Feig and executive-produced by Judd Apatow that aired on NBC during the 1999–2000 television season. The show is set in a suburban high school near Detroit during 1980–81. The theme of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; reflects &quot;the sad, hilarious unfairness of teen life&quot;. With little success when it first aired, because of an erratic episode schedule and conflicts between the creators and NBC, the series was canceled after airing 12 out of the 18 episodes. The series became a cult classic, and Apatow continued the show&#x27;s legacy by incorporating the actors in future productions.

The series has appeared in numerous lists of the greatest television shows of all time, including lists by &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;. It launched most of its young actors&#x27; careers, such as James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, John Francis Daley, Martin Starr, Samm Levine and Linda Cardellini.

==Plot==
Teenager Lindsay Weir and her younger brother, Sam, attend William McKinley High School during the 1980–81 school year. The show is set in the town of Chippewa, Michigan, a fictional suburb of Detroit (named after Chippewa Valley High School, which series creator Paul Feig attended).

Lindsay joins a group of friends who are referred to as the &quot;freaks&quot; — Daniel Desario, Ken Miller, Nick Andopolis and Kim Kelly — while Sam&#x27;s friends, Neal Schweiber and Bill Haverchuck, constitute the &quot;geeks.&quot; The Weir parents, Harold and Jean, are featured in every episode, and Millie Kentner, Lindsay&#x27;s nerdy and highly religious former best friend, is a recurring character, as well as Cindy Sanders, the popular cheerleader on whom Sam has a crush.

Lindsay finds herself attempting to transform her life as an academically proficient student, star &quot;mathlete&quot; into a rebellious teenager who hangs out with troubled slackers. Her relationships with her new friends and the friction they cause with her parents and her own self-image form one central strand of the show. The other follows Sam and his group of geeky friends as they navigate a different part of the social universe and try to fit in.

The show&#x27;s producers were resistant to stunt casting. For example, they resisted the network&#x27;s suggestion that they have Britney Spears appear as a waitress in one episode; they thought such appearances would detract from the show&#x27;s realism.

Several of the screenwriters appeared on the show. Mike White played Kim Kelly&#x27;s oft-discussed injured brother, and first appeared in episode 4, &quot;Kim Kelly is My Friend&quot;. Paul Feig, Gabe Sachs and series composer Michael Andrews appear uncredited as members of the fictional band Dimension in &quot;I&#x27;m With the Band&quot;.

Numerous actors who starred on &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; would later appear on Judd Apatow&#x27;s later TV series &quot;Undeclared&quot;, including Rogen, Segel, Levine, Starr, Phillips and Melnick, among several others.

==Episodes==
The script for the pilot episode of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; was written by Paul Feig as a spec script. Feig gave the script to producer Judd Apatow, who sold it to DreamWorks, where Apatow was under an overall deal. DreamWorks sold it to NBC, who greenlit a pilot. Before the script was shot, Feig wrote a second episode at the behest of Apatow. He showed this second script to Apatow and pilot director Jake Kasdan, and they suggested that he combine the two episodes to form a stronger pilot. Notable additions include the introduction of Kim Kelly and Lindsay&#x27;s recollection of her grandmother&#x27;s death. Feig wrote a final draft after a read-through with the cast, this time incorporating a first meeting between Lindsay and the freaks (in previous drafts, Lindsay was already part of the group).

The show ran for 18 episodes, three of which — &quot;Kim Kelly Is My Friend&quot;, &quot;Dead Dogs and Gym Teachers&quot; and &quot;Noshing and Moshing&quot; — were unaired by NBC and not seen until Fox Family ran the show in 2000. The final three episodes premiered at the Museum of Television and Radio prior to being broadcast on television. The list below is ordered by the chronology of the storyline.

* Initial airing occurred on Fox Family.

===Planned storylines===
In a 2012 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Paul Feig detailed what would have happened to the characters if the show had continued: Lindsay would become a human rights lawyer, years after following the Grateful Dead. Sam would have joined the drama club. Neal would cope with his parents&#x27; divorce by joining a swing choir in school. Bill would join the basketball team, becoming a jock and leading to tension with the geeks. Daniel would end up in jail. Kim would become pregnant on tour while following the Grateful Dead. Nick would be pressured by his strict father to join the Army.

==Media releases==

===DVD and Blu-ray===
On April 6, 2004, a six-DVD &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; box set was released through Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment. A limited &quot;yearbook edition&quot; set, including two additional discs, was also available through the official website for the show. Fans who had signed an online petition to get the show on DVD got priority in purchasing the special set.

On November 25, 2008, the deluxe &quot;Yearbook Edition&quot; box set was re-released through Vivendi Entertainment. The set features all of the episodes, commentaries and special features of the &quot;Complete Series&quot; six-DVD set, plus two extra discs and deluxe packaging. It is packaged as an 80-page color yearbook with essays, pictures and episode synopses.

In July 2015, Shout! Factory announced it had begun preparing for a Blu-ray release of the series. It was subsequently confirmed in December 2015 that Shout! would release the complete series on Blu-ray on March 22, 2016, and the set would contain all special features from the previous releases and the episodes in both their original aspect ratio and widescreen.

As of July 1, 2021, all U.S. DVD and Blu-ray releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

===Books===
In October 2004, Newmarket Press released two &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; books: &quot;Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 2&quot;. Each book covers nine scripts from the series, compiled by Paul Feig and Judd Apatow. Extra content includes behind-the-scenes memos and notes, photos, additional plot lines and excerpts from the &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; series bibles.

===Soundtrack===

&quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;″ creators made it a priority to feature genuine, period-specific music that would help to create the show&#x27;s tone. Clearing such names as Billy Joel, Cheap Trick, the Grateful Dead, Rush, Styx, The Moody Blues, The Who and Van Halen required much of the show&#x27;s budget. Eventually, this became an obstacle in releasing the show on DVD due to the difficulty and expense of clearing all of the music rights for the series. Music cues were changed or removed for &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; when it aired in reruns on Fox Family. However, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;″ creators chose to wait to release the DVD until they could find a company willing to pay for the original music. Shout! Factory, a music and video company specializing in comprehensive reissues and compilations, eventually brought &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; to DVD with all of its music intact.

==Appearances==
In 2000, the cast of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; was featured in an episode of the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; hosted by Louie Anderson.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
At Metacritic, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; has a score of 88 out of 100, based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a score of 100% with an average rating of 9.7 out of 10, based on 34 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; lampoons real-life adolescence while affectionately embracing every growing pain along the way with refreshing honesty.&quot;

===Ratings===
The show averaged 6.77 million viewers and was #93 in the rankings during the only season it ran.

===Awards and nominations===
The series received three Emmy Award nominations: creator Paul Feig was nominated twice for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, for the episodes &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;Discos and Dragons&quot;, and it won for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series (Allison Jones, Coreen Mayrs and Jill Greenberg). It was also nominated for two Television Critics Association Awards, for New Program of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Drama. For acting, the series won for Best Family TV Series – Comedy and was nominated for Best Performance in a TV Series – Young Ensemble at the Young Artist Awards. For the YoungStar Awards, John Francis Daley and Sarah Hagan were nominated for Best Young Actor/Performance in a Comedy TV Series, and the ensemble was nominated for Best Young Ensemble Cast – Television. The series also received several other nominations in other categories.

The series appeared on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2007 &quot;100 Greatest Shows of All Time&quot; list, and placed third on the magazine&#x27;s list of greatest television shows of the 2000s. In 2004 and 2007, respectively, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; ranked No. 25 and No. 21 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it the 13th-best series of the past 25 years. The same year, AOL TV named it the Best School Show of All Time. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time, and ranked it No. 1 on their list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;. In 2016, it was named the 11th-greatest television series of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Cancellation and legacy==
One of the cited reasons for its early cancellation was its inability to gain an audience due to its &quot;erratic scheduling&quot; and poor time slots, competing with the high-rated &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. The producers created a website for the series, but NBC would not share its URL because &quot;they didn&#x27;t want people to know the Internet existed; they were worried about losing viewers to it&quot;, as explained by Judd Apatow. &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; was only averaging under 7 million viewers, while other NBC series such as &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; were averaging over 14 million viewers each.

NBC and the creative directors of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; did not have the same vision for the series. After the network picked up the pilot, Garth Ancier replaced Scott Sassa as president of NBC Entertainment. Ancier &quot;didn&#x27;t understand public school life&quot; and its relevance because he went to a boarding school and then on to Princeton. Creator Paul Feig expressed the &quot;irony of the situation&quot;, as everyone involved wanted &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; to be a success, but the network didn&#x27;t understand the concept of realistically showcasing life as ordinary teenagers. Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow had multiple arguments with the network concerning &quot;lack of victories&quot; in the script and that the characters needed to be &quot;cool.&quot; The writers wanted to produce something that would represent the average high school experience, but the network wanted to produce something that would make high school seem cool. Because the network did not think the series would be a success, they let the writers add things to the script that they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have if they thought the show would resurface the next season&quot;, like the use of the phrase, &quot;ambiguous genitalia&quot;. Apatow said in 2014 that &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve done, in a way, is revenge for the people who cancelled &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;.&quot;

===Syndication and cast reunions===

In June 2010, it was announced that IFC had acquired the rights to air both &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; and &quot;Undeclared&quot;. &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;″s 18-episode run on IFC finished with all episodes having aired as of October 29, 2010. &quot;Undeclared&quot;″s IFC run began on November 5, 2010. Both shows have also joined TeenNick&#x27;s lineup as of June 13, 2011.

A reunion of several cast members and producers of both shows took place at the Paley Center for Media&#x27;s PaleyFest on March 12, 2011.

===Documentary===
A documentary directed by Brent Hodge chronicling the history and production of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; and featuring interviews with the cast and crew, &quot;Freaks and Geeks: The Documentary&quot;, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018. The documentary had its television debut on July 16, 2018, on A&amp;E.

<text>&quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; (Roud 861) (also called &quot;Our Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;My Young Love Said to Me&quot;, &quot;I Once Had a True Love&quot;, &quot;She Moves Through the Fair&quot; or &quot;She Moved Through the Faire&quot;) is a traditional Irish folk song, with a number of iterations, that has been performed and recorded by various artists. The narrator sees his lover move away from him through the fair, after telling him that since her family will approve, &quot;it will not be long [love] &#x27;til our wedding day&quot;. She returns as a ghost at night, and repeats the words again, intimating her own tragic death and the couple&#x27;s potential reunion in the afterlife. There are numerous alternate versions, some sung about a male lover, with different lyrics, such as &quot;Our Wedding Day&quot; and &quot;My Young Love Said to Me&quot;, among others.

==Origins and structure ==
&quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; has been found both in Ireland and in Scotland, but pieces of the song were apparently first collected in County Donegal by Longford poet Padraic Colum and the musicologist Herbert Hughes. 

The melody is in Mixolydian mode (major scale with a flattened seventh—a fairly common mode within Irish and Scottish musical traditions), placing a large emphasis on the 1st, 4th, 5th and 7th chords of the scale. John Loesberg speculated: &quot;From its strange, almost Eastern sounding melody, it appears to be an air of some antiquity,&quot; but he does not define its age any more precisely. 

==Origins and publishing of the lyrics==
The lyrics were first published in Hughes&#x27; &quot;Irish Country Songs&quot;, published by Boosey &amp; Hawkes in 1909. A common version goes as follows:



In a letter published in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 1970, Padraic Colum stated that he was the author of all but the final verse. He also described how Herbert Hughes collected the tune and then he, Colum, had kept the last verse of a traditional song and written a couple of verses to fit the music.

One verse was not included in the first publication: Colum soon realised that he had not put in the poem the fact that the woman had died before the marriage, and so he wrote the verse that begins: &quot;The people were saying, that no two were e&#x27;er wed, but one had a sorrow that never was said ...&quot; and sent it on to Hughes, too late for publication in that particular collection. This extra verse was published in other collections, along with the other three verses. The lyrics were also published in Colum&#x27;s collection &quot;Wild Earth: And Other Poems&quot; (1916), though the traditional origin of the final verse is not mentioned there.

In the course of the same &quot;Irish Times&quot; correspondence, however, another music collector, Proinsias Ó Conluain, said he had recorded a song called &quot;She Went Through the Fair&quot;, with words the same as the other three verses of &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;, sung by an old man who told him that &quot;the song was a very old one&quot; and that he had learned it as a young man from a basket-weaver in Glenavy.

== &quot;Our Wedding Day&quot; version ==

Irish singer Paddy Tunney related how Colum wrote an alternate version called upon returning from a literary gathering in Donegal with Herbert Hughes, among others. However, as the melody remains the same, Tunney suggested that it would be more accurate to say that Colum simply added new lyrics to an existing traditional song that, by then, had generated many variations throughout Ireland

Tunney, himself, collected a version from an Irish singer named Barney McGarvey. This version, similarly to the lyrics of &quot;Our Wedding Day&quot;, was called &quot;I Once Had a True Love&quot;. The opening four lines are highly reminiscent of &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;, and the second four lines are unmistakably taken from that composition.

The first verse says:
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;

The remaining two verses are quite different. Tunney also points to a version of the song that he obtained from his mother, who called it &quot;My Young Love Said to Me&quot;, which recalls lyrics from the alternate version, as well. The first verse is virtually the same as Colum&#x27;s, but the latter three verses are quite different:
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;
:&quot;&quot;

==Variants and related songs==
One variant of the song is called &quot;Our Wedding Day&quot;. A related song, &quot;Out of the Window&quot;, was collected by Sam Henry from Eddie Butcher of Magilligan in Northern Ireland in around 1930 and published in 1979. Yet another song, &quot;I Once Had a True Love&quot;, also appears to be related, as it shares some lyrics with &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;. 

&quot;I Was In Chains&quot;, written by Gavin Sutherland and recorded by The Sutherland Brothers on their album &quot;The Sutherland Brothers Band&quot; (1972), has a similar tune but completely different words. Paul Young covered this song on his album &quot;The Secret of Association&quot; (1985).

The 1989 song &quot;Belfast Child&quot; by Simple Minds incorporates the melody of &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;.

In the 1990s the tune was used in the winning entry in the &quot;Comórtas na nAmhrán Nuachumtha&quot; (&quot;Competition for newly composed songs&quot;) in Ráth Cairn. The subject of the song, &quot;Bailéad an Phíolóta&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of the Pilot&quot;), was a plane crash that took place in 1989 on an unlit runway on Árainn Mhór.

Other name variants include &quot;She Moved Thru&#x27; The Fair&quot;, &quot;She Moved Thro&#x27; The Fair&quot;, and &quot;He Moved Through The Fair&quot; 

==Performances and recordings==

Scottish tenor Sydney MacEwan recorded the song in 1936 and Irish tenor John McCormack recorded it in 1941. 
In 1952, folklorist Peter Kennedy recorded the McPeake Family singing a version based on that of Margaret Barry entitled &quot;Our Wedding Day.&quot; It featured a bagpipe accompaniment by Francis McPeake, II. The traditional singer Paddy Tunney learned &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; in County Fermanagh and recorded it in 1965. Other singers who sang it in the 1950s and the 1960s included Patrick Galvin, Dominic Behan and Anne Briggs. It was popular among members of the Traveller community in Ireland at that time.

Fairport Convention recorded the song in 1968, adapting the style of the song from the Traveller Margaret Barry, though she herself had learned it from the John McCormack vinyl recording. Former Fairport Convention guitarist and songwriter Richard Thompson regularly includes the song in concert performances. Also of note are the recordings of the song by Alan Stivell in 1973. Art Garfunkel (formerly of Simon &amp; Garfunkel) recorded a particularly lush version on his album &quot;Watermark&quot; (1977), which featured Irish traditional band The Chieftains and was arranged by Paddy Moloney and Jimmy Webb.

Versions of the song recorded by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor (as used on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;), Trees and Nana Mouskouri change the gender of the pronouns, so the song became &quot;&quot;He&quot; Moved Through the Fair&quot;. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s and Trees&#x27; versions keep the original title even so, but Mouskouri changes it. In a 2015 interview, O&#x27;Connor expressed regret for having changed the gender. An alternative version of the lyrics is also used in Mary Black&#x27;s version of the song.

In June 2016, the BBC TV series &quot;The Living and the Dead&quot; premiered a version of the song sung by Elizabeth Fraser in collaboration with The Insects.

<doc id="965106" wikidata="Q895116" url="?curid=965106" title="Boulton Paul Overstrand">
<text>The Boulton Paul P.75 Overstrand was a twin-engine biplane medium bomber designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Boulton Paul. It was the final example of a series of biplane medium bombers that had served in the Royal Air Force since the First World War, starting with the likes of the Vickers Vimy and Handley Page Type O. The Overstrand was also the first aircraft to be fitted with a fully-enclosed power-operated turret.

First flown in 1933, the Overstrand was essentially an improved model of the Boulton Paul Sidestrand of the 1920s, thus early references to the type referred to it as the &quot;Sidestrand Mk IV&quot; instead. It demonstrated a higher maximum speed than its predecessor and was procured for the RAF in limited numbers. As such, the type entered service during the mid 1930s, but became increasingly overshadowed by the new generation of monoplane medium bombers, such as the Vickers Wellington and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Nevertheless, the Overstrand remained operational during the early years of the Second World War, albeit only being flown by training units. The few surviving aircraft were withdrawn from service during 1941, having been rendered surplus to requirements.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
The Overstrand was a development of the Boulton Paul Sidestrand, which had first flown in 1928 and like the Sidestrand, it was named after a village in Norfolk, home also of Boulton Paul&#x27;s Norwich factory. The earlier Sidestrand had been largely similar to its predecessors of the First World War, featuring open cockpits and hand-operated defensive machine guns. Unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at speed of up to , which made operating the guns in exposed positions difficult, particularly in the nose. To address this difficulty, the Overstrand was furnished with an alternative nose turret design, which was both enclosed and powered. At the time this was a relatively novel feature, the resulting aircraft being the first in the world to feature a fully-enclosed power-operated turret.

The Overstrand&#x27;s innovative turret was largely developed in-house by Bolton Paul&#x27;s chief armament designer H. A. Hughes. In terms of its basic design, the turret was a metal-framed cylinder with a domed upper and lower area; Perspex was used as glazing, in which there was a vertical slot for the single Lewis gun, which was covered by a canvas strip with a zip fastener to facilitate movement of the gun itself. Traverse motion of the turret was driven by pneumatic motors, powered by air bottles on board that were pressurised to using an engine-driven air compressor. The turret could move through a fully 360-degree circle if the gun was raised sufficiently, helping the turret to cover the widest area of any turret system. A geared spindle at the base of the turret was supported by a series of ball bearings. Elevation was achieved manually.

In addition to the turret, various other revisions and improvements were also incorporated. It was decided that the cockpit ought to also be fully enclosed within a canopy of anti-glare Perspex, complete with a sliding hood. The airframe was strengthened considerably in many areas, which facilitated an increased bomb capacity of up to , up to two bombs could be carried in the aircraft&#x27;s recessed bomb cell in addition to two bombs on external carriers. A new levered main undercarriage, complete with larger wheels, was also fitted, while the tailskid of the Sidestrand was replaced by a tailwheel. The wing design was also revised, a noticeable sweepback was added to the outer sections in order to compensate for the aircraft&#x27;s heavier nose section.

===Into flight===
During 1933, the first Overstrand performed its maiden flight, at which point the type was still known as the &quot;Sidestrand Mk IV&quot;. Shortly thereafter, it was decided to rename the aircraft after the village of Overstrand. On 22 February 1934, the prototype was delivered to RAF Andover for trials conducted by No. 101 Squadron. Some criticisms of the aircraft were produced during this time, one early report by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) observed the powered turret to be somewhat cramped, while excessive engine vibration and issues with the longitudinal controls were also noted. Various positive attributes were also noted, such the addition of crew comfort features, as well as the aircraft&#x27;s ability to attain speeds as high as at an altitude of without any negative impact upon its manoeuvrability.

Modifications were made after the aircraft&#x27;s return on 19 March to refine the design. This led to a second Sidestrand being converted to the Overstrand configuration, incorporating these improvements, such as larger diameter turret, tweaks to the fins and elevators, and a simplification of the rear engine mount area. While the initial example had been powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus IM.3 radial engines, each capable of generating up to , in comparison to the provided by the Bristol Jupiters used upon the Sidestrand, the second aircraft was outfitted with the improved Bristol Pegasus II.M3 engine, capable of , instead.

Continued flight testing revealed the vibration issues to be present still, but would be largely resolved upon later new-build Overstrands. Having been encouraged by the demonstrated performance, which displayed a meaningful improvement over the Sidestrand, the Air Ministry authorised the modification of a further two Sidestrands into Overstrands. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry selected the type to fulfil Specification 23/34 and issued an initial order for 19 Overstrands. A small follow-on order for five new-built Overstrands would lead to a total of 24 aircraft being built in addition to the four converted Sidestrands.

At one stage, plans were drawn up for an improved variant of the aircraft to be developed, the principal difference being the adoption of a retractable undercarriage, designated the P.80 &quot;Superstrand&quot;; however, this project was ultimately abandoned due to alternative options involving rival monoplane designs proving to be more attractive in the eyes of military planners.

==Operational history==
A total of 24 Overstrands would be procured for the RAF, a quantity that facilitated the complete replacement of the older Sidestrands flown by No. 101 Squadron, the only squadron equipped with the type, to commence in January 1935. The type was also briefly adopted by No. 144 Squadron, although it was quickly replaced by the more modern Bristol Blenheim bomber during 1938. The Overstrand proved to be relatively popular with its crews, who often appreciated the attention paid to crew comfort as well as the ability of the newly developed powered turret.

While aerial refuelling was still a somewhat experimental capability during the late 1930s, it is known that at least one Overstrand was modified to receive fuel from a Vickers Virginia tanker aircraft. The type would perform regular public displays of its capabilities, from mock interceptions to bombing demonstrations, throughout the 1930s; one particularly prominent occasion was during the Silver Jubilee of George V, with the King himself inspecting one such aircraft externally and internally. During 1935, an Overstrand of No. 101 Squadron was awarded to Sassoon Trophy for aerial reconnaissance, having the highest score achieved at that time.

Due to the rapid advances made in bomber technology during the late 1930s, the Overstrand had been effectively rendered obsolete by 1938, the final example of the type being withdrawn from frontline duties during the summer of that same year. Despite this, it continued to be operated in secondary roles, such as experimental flights and for gunnery training missions. Accordingly, the surviving Overstrands were allocated to the Armament Training Camps during 1938. At the outbreak of the Second World War, eleven Overstrands remained in service and six were used for gunnery training. They remained in operation until May 1941, though flying was limited following the fatal mid-air breakup of Overstrand &quot;K8173&quot; on 22 April 1940.

== Aircraft on display ==
A replica of an Overstrand nose section, marked as K4556, is on display at the Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Museum.

<text>Christie Allen (born June Dorothy Allen; 24 July 195412 August 2008) was an English-born Australian pop singer who had a successful career in Australia. Her top four hits on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart were &quot;Goosebumps&quot; (October 1979) and &quot;He&#x27;s My Number One&quot; (February 1980). Allen was voted the Most Popular Female Performer at the &quot;TV Week&quot; / &quot;Countdown&quot; Music Awards for 1979 and 1980. At the 1979 awards, &quot;Goosebumps&quot; also won the Best Songwriter award for Terry Britten. Allen died on 12 August 2008 of pancreatic cancer, aged 54.

==Biography==
Christie Allen was born June Dorothy Allen on 24 July 1954 in Romford, England, to Keith Frederick Allen (1932–2004) and Vera Helen née Kettle (1932–2001). Allen has three brothers, Keith, Stephen and Mark. At the age of eight years, Allen sang &quot;My Johnny&#x27;s Gone Away&quot; in a talent quest. In 1965, the Allen family migrated to Australia and settled in Perth. Allen and her brothers formed a band, Pendulum, where she provided lead vocals.

Whilst performing with Pendulum, Allen contacted UK-born Terry Britten, a songwriter and record producer and was the lead guitarist of Australian rock group, the Twilights, Britten had worked with Cliff Richard for whom he co-wrote &quot;Devil Woman&quot; in 1976 with Kristine Holmes. By the mid 1970s, Britten was living in Australia and was impressed by Allen&#x27;s vocal ability and bubbly personality and began songwriting for her. In 1978, Allen signed a recording contract with Mushroom Records and in September 1978 she released her debut single &quot;You Know That I Love You&quot;, which reached the top 100 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, and attracted some national radio airplay and positive reviews.

Her next three singles from her debut album, &quot;Magic Rhythm&quot; (November 1979), were top 20 hits; &quot;Falling in Love with Only You&quot; reached No. 20 in April 1979. while her next two singles were strongly influenced by the popular disco style of music at the time.&quot;Goosebumps&quot;, which reached No. 3 in September 1979, and &quot;He&#x27;s My Number One&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in February 1980. &quot;Goosebumps&quot; achieved sales of more than 60,000.

Allen toured Australia backed by The Hot Band, which was composed of Max Chazan on guitar (Rubes), Greg Cook on guitar (ex-Cam-Pact, the Mixtures, Ram Band, Mondo Rock), Bruce Haymes on organ (Rubes, Richard Clapton Band), Michael Hegerty on bass guitar (Richard Clapton Band), and Rick Puchala on drums (Richard Clapton Band); and later Yuri Worontschak on keyboards: Yamaha CP70B and Minimoog (ex Spitfire).

Allen was voted the &#x27;Most Popular Female Performer&#x27; at the &quot;TV Week&quot; / &quot;Countdown&quot; Music Awards for 1979 and 1980. At the 1979 awards ceremony on 13 April 1980, Allen performed, &quot;He&#x27;s My Number One&quot;. At the same ceremony, Britten won the &#x27;Best Songwriter&#x27; award for &quot;He&#x27;s My Number One&quot;. Allen won the 1980 award for &#x27;Most Popular Female Performer&#x27;, broadcast on 22 March 1981.

Besides performing, Allen also appeared on &quot;Countdown&quot; as a guest host in November 1979 with Russell Hitchcock (Air Supply), and in April 1980 with Molly Meldrum. In the early 1980s Allen supplied the voice-over and sang the jingle &#x27;Come Tarino with Me&#x27; for Tarino orange soft drink commercials.

In August 1980, Allen released the singles &quot;Baby Get Away&quot;, &quot;Switchboard&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Put Out the Flame&quot; and her second and final studio album &quot;Detour&quot;. By the mid-1980s a long illness prevented Allen from adequately promoting her career and she subsequently retired.

Allen and her second husband, Angelo, had a daughter Christaleah. In the 1990s Allen returned to performing as a vocalist, with country music bands. In October 1998 Allen married her partner, Marc, and at that time Michael Gudinski appealed on national radio for information on Allen&#x27;s whereabouts—Gudinski wanted her to perform at a televised tribute concert for the 25th anniversary of his company, Mushroom Records. On 14 November 1998 Allen sang &quot;Goosebumps&quot; before a huge crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground—she retired following her performance which was released on the VHS album, &quot;Mushroom 25 Live&quot; (December 1998).

In 2006, Gudinski asked Allen to participate in the Countdown Spectacular tour; however, due to ill health, she declined. In March 2008 Allen was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died at her home in rural Western Australia on 12 August 2008, aged 54.

===Personal life===
Allen had an older brother, Keith, and two younger brothers, Stephen and Mark. With all three brothers, she formed a Perth-based group, Pendulum.
In the 1970s, Allen lived with her first husband, Frank Rechichi in Karratha, Western Australia.
By the 1990s, with Mark, her domestic partner, Allen had a daughter. In October 1998, Allen married her partner, Mark.

<text>Christine Joy Amphlett (; 25 October 1959 – 21 April 2013) was an Australian singer, songwriter and actress, best known as the frontwoman of the rock band Divinyls. She was notable for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances and media interviews.

Amphlett, Jeremy Paul and guitarist Mark McEntee formed Divinyls in Sydney in 1980. With Amphlett and McEntee as its core members, the band underwent various lineup changes before dissolving in 1996. The band&#x27;s biggest-selling single, &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; (1990), achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the United States and No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK). The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006.

On the stage, Amphlett, who was 17 years old, played Linda Lips in the R-rated adults only musical comedy &quot;Let My People Come&quot; (1976), starred in the musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (1988) and portrayed Judy Garland in multiple productions of &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;. On the screen, she played a supporting role in &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1982).

== Early life and education ==
Christine Joy Amphlett was born on 25 October 1959 in Geelong, Victoria. Her mother was from a well-off Hawthorn family, while her father was a World War II veteran whose mother was a German immigrant and his father a Melbourne chef. Amphlett was a first cousin of Australian singer Little Pattie (Patricia Amphlett).

She worked as a child model from the age of three until 12, and later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t come from a very wealthy family so that actually clothed me and allowed me to have things&quot;.

Amphlett attended Belmont High School.

== Music ==
=== Divinyls ===

Amphlett met Mark McEntee at a concert at the Sydney Opera House in 1980 and they formed Divinyls with Jeremy Paul (Air Supply). Having performed in Sydney for some time, they recorded several songs for the film &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;, in which Amphlett also acted.

Divinyls consisted of an ever-changing line-up formed around Amphlett and McEntee, whose relationship was always volatile. Nevertheless, the band released six albums between 1982 and 1996, peaking in 1991 with the success of their single &quot;I Touch Myself&quot;, which reached #1 in Australia, #4 in the US and #10 in the UK. The band, which underwent various lineup changes, broke up in 1996.

The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006.

Amphlett and McEntee barely spoke after the band broke up, but resumed contact when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and eventually announced a new tour and album. The band recorded and released a single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Do This&quot;, and toured Australia, but the proposed reunion album was never made.

=== Other work ===
Amphlett performed Divinyls&#x27; and other songs with a 30-piece orchestra for the Australian Rock Symphony in January 2010.

In 2011, she released the single &quot;Summer Song&quot; under the name The Tulips, a band consisting of Amphlett, Charley Drayton and Kraig Jarret Johnson. It was used in the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Music Never Stopped&quot;.

=== Image ===
Known for her brash, sexualised persona, Amphlett employed subversive humour in performances, lyrics and media interviews.

== Acting ==
At the age of 17 in 1976, Amphlett was part of the original cast of the Australian production of the Earl Wilson Jr. penned stage musical comedy &quot;Let My People Come&quot;, playing the role of Linda Lips. The adult-themed musical opened at the Total Theatre in Melbourne, running for nine months, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in Sydney for an additional three months. Amphlett made her film debut in &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1982) in a supporting role as Angela, the temperamental lead singer of a rock band.

In 1988, she starred opposite Russell Crowe in the first Australian production of Willy Russell&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;.

Amphlett played Judy Garland in the original touring production of &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;, with Todd McKenney playing the role of Peter Allen. When the highly successful show transferred to Broadway in the year 2000, Garland was played by American performer Isabel Keating and Allen by Hugh Jackman. On its return to Australia as an arena spectacular, Amphlett resumed playing the role.

== Personal life ==
Chrissy Amphlett and Mark McEntee being bandmates at the same time were romantically involved from 1982 to 1993. They met in 1980 and began a relationship two years later when McEntee split up with his wife. Their relationship was highly volatile, being marred by drug and alcohol use and physical fights. However, the band&#x27;s manager, Vince Lovegrove, later stated that the nature of their &quot;weird&quot; relationship was the &quot;magic of Divinyls&quot;.

On 27 July 1999, Amphlett married American drummer Charley Drayton, who played drums on the Divinyls&#x27; eponymous album and was the drummer in the reformed group.

In an interview on the Nine Network program &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, on 7 December 2007, Amphlett revealed that she had multiple sclerosis. On 20 October 2010, she announced that she had breast cancer and was being treated in New York, where she lived with her husband. She also said that her sister was a breast cancer survivor. On 24 January 2011, she stated she was free of cancer.

=== Death and legacy ===
Amphlett died, aged 53, on 21 April 2013, at her home in Manhattan, after a long battle with breast cancer. Due to the multiple sclerosis that Amphlett concurrently had, she reported that she was unable to receive radiation treatment or chemotherapy as cancer treatment. Following the announcement of Amphlett&#x27;s death, numerous tributes were received from artists, performers and musicians. Russell Crowe wrote: &quot;RIP Chrissie Amphlett, [she] played my mum in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, 1988.&quot;

A Melbourne central city laneway has been named &quot;Amphlett Lane&quot; in Amphlett&#x27;s honour, complete with a commemorative plaque and two artworks. In November 2018, Amphlett was posthumously inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

==== I Touch Myself Project ====
Amphlett&#x27;s family and friends and Cancer Council NSW launched the breast cancer awareness project &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; in 2014, as a tribute to Amphlett. Part of the project included a cover of &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; and features 10 female Australian artists (Olivia Newton-John, Megan Washington, Sarah McLeod, Katie Noonan, Sarah Blasko, Suze DeMarchi, Deborah Conway, Kate Ceberano, Little Pattie and Connie Mitchell). The song was released in June 2014 and peaked at number 72 on the ARIA charts.

Cancer Council NSW stated, &quot;Through this campaign we are encouraging women to get to know their breasts better, to know what is normal for them and to participate in breast screening if they&#x27;re in the right age range.&quot;

<doc id="965110" wikidata="Q1900315" url="?curid=965110" title="Mark Neumann">
<text>Mark William Neumann (born February 27, 1954) is an American businessman and politician. He represented for two terms, from 1995 to 1999. In 2010, Neumann unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor. In 2012, Neumann ran for the U.S. senate seat held by retiring Democratic senator Herb Kohl, placing third in the Republican primary.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Neumann was born in East Troy, Wisconsin, one of five siblings. His parents were Stella and Kurt Neumann. His father was an electrical engineer for General Motors and his mother was an executive assistant. Neumann graduated from East Troy High School in 1972. After high school, he briefly attended General Motors Institute (now Kettering University). In 1973, Neumann married Sue Link, his high school sweetheart, whom he met in Sunday school in the 4th grade. That same year, Neumann enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, where he graduated with honors in 1975, earning a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. After graduating from Whitewater, Neumann moved to River Falls, Wisconsin, where he taught mathematics at River Falls High School while attending the University of Wisconsin–River Falls, earning a Masters of Science in Supervision and Instructional Leadership. Neumann did additional post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

After college, Neumann relocated to Milton, Wisconsin, where he began his career teaching Mathematics at Milton High School and Milton College before the campus closed in 1982. Neumann is a member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.
He started his first company in 1986 in his basement, building homes in the Milton and Janesville, Wisconsin areas. By 1991, Neumann&#x27;s company was listed as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. by &quot;Inc. Magazine&quot;.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1992
Neumann decided to run for the House of Representatives as a Republican in 1992. He faced Congressman Les Aspin and lost 58% to 41%, while spending $700,000.

;1993 special election
Shortly after defeating Neumann, Aspin was appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Just months after being defeated by over 17%, Neumann entered the special election to fill the seat vacated by Aspin. Neumann lost narrowly to his opponent, Peter Barca by only 675 votes; 49.3% to Barca&#x27;s 49.9%.

| colspan=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; background:#e9e9e9;&quot;| General Election



;1994
After losing in both 1992 and 1993, Neumann once again entered the race for Wisconsin’s First Congressional District. After losing to Peter Barca by 675 votes in the previous year, Neumann defeated Barca by 1,120 votes, becoming the first Republican to hold that seat since 1971. Neumann&#x27;s victory was one of 52 Republican pick-up seats during the Republican Revolution.

;1996
Neumann won re-election by 4,260 votes in a close 1996 race against Lydia Spottswood.

| colspan=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; background:#e9e9e9;&quot;| General Election


===Tenure===
Neumann was sworn into the 104th United States Congress on January 3, 1995, when the Republican Party gained control of both houses for the first time since the 1950s. Neumann was assigned to the Appropriations committee, being the only freshman appointed to the committee that year. While on the committee, Neumann wrote his own version of the budget, which would produce a balanced budget by 1999. Neumann voted present in the election for Speaker of the House in 1997, instead of voting for Newt Gingrich.

In September 1995, Neumann introduced an amendment requiring congressional approval of troop deployment to Bosnia which failed to pass. Then, on September 29, he voted to defeat the $243 billion military appropriation, along with other freshman Members, because it did not contain his amendment. As punishment for his vote, Bob Livingston removed him from the committee. This was brief, and Neumann was eventually reassigned to the committee.

Neumann has been critical of LGBT rights in the past. In 1996, he commented to the New York Times that &quot;if I was elected God for a day, homosexuality wouldn&#x27;t be permitted, but nobody&#x27;s electing me God&quot;.

===Committee assignments===
Congressman Neumann served on the following committees and subcommittees:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Veterans Administration
** Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
* Committee on the Budget

==1998 U.S. Senate election==
In September 1997, Neumann announced his candidacy for the United States Senate against incumbent Russ Feingold. Both candidates had similar views on the budget surplus, although Neumann was for banning partial-birth abortion while Feingold was against a ban. Both candidates limited themselves to $3.8 million in campaign spending ($1 for every citizen of Wisconsin), although outside groups spent more than $2 million on Neumann; Feingold refused to have outside groups spend on his behalf. Feingold defeated Neumann by a 3% margin in the election, 51% - 48%. Neumann had a 68,000-vote deficit in Milwaukee County.
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; background:#e9e9e9;&quot;| General Election




==Post-congressional career==
Neumann stayed out of the 2004 Senate campaign, instead supporting former Lt. Governor Margaret Farrow, who did not run. Despite speculation that Neumann might run against Senator Herb Kohl or Governor Jim Doyle, he did not choose to seek elective office during the 2006 election cycle. He had considered a run for governor, but did not enter the race in deference to Scott Walker, who withdrew in favor of former Congressman Mark Green. 

===2010 gubernatorial election===
Neumann told the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; on April 23, 2009 that he intended to run for governor in 2010, and on July 1, 2009, Neumann officially declared his candidacy.

In 2010 Neumann stated his opposition to same-sex marriage, and claimed that he wanted to focus on jobs and economic development.

Neumann was defeated 59% to 39% in the September 14, 2010, primary by opponent Scott Walker. Walker was ultimately elected governor in the general election.

===2012 U.S. Senate election===
In August 2011, Neumann announced his candidacy for the Senate seat of retiring senator Herb Kohl. On October 6, 2011, it was announced that he had raised $300,000 during the first month of the campaign.
After receiving endorsements from conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Americans For Prosperity, Neumann split the Tea Party vote with millionaire businessman Eric Hovde. Neumann came in third place, taking 23% of the vote.

<text>Hope of the States are an English post rock-influenced indie band, formed in Chichester in 2000. 

Following the release of 2 albums, the band split up in 2006 before reuniting in 2024.

==History==
The band formed in 2000, naming themselves after &quot;The Shame of the States&quot;, Albert Deutsch&#x27;s 1948 book on the state of mental healthcare in the United States. They were discovered after sending a demo to the Planet Sound teletext page, and were signed to Sony BMG. The band&#x27;s bass player Scott R. Walker left the band after the first initial releases and then went on to form Kasms with Rory Attwell. 

The band&#x27;s guitarist James &quot;Jimmi&quot; Lawrence died from suicide by hanging on 15 January 2004, during recording sessions for their debut album at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire. They then enlisted guitarist Michael Hibbert, with Herlihy stating that the guitarist had fit in &quot;incredibly. Not just as a guitarist but in handling the situation. He plays in his own way, jumps around and that&#x27;s exactly what we need. I don&#x27;t want someone who&#x27;s going to stand there depressed, or try to copy Jimmi&quot;.

The band released their debut album &quot;The Lost Riots&quot; om on 7 June 2004, and reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Black Dollar Bills&quot;, was packaged in a hessian sleeve, each hand-sewn by a band member. The band&#x27;s most extensive UK tour started in October 2004, beginning with a date in Belfast&#x27;s Mandela Hall, including an appearance at the Dance Academy in Plymouth.

Much of 2005 was spent recording the follow-up to &quot;The Lost Riots&quot;, and the band only made six live appearances. The band performed some songs to be included on their second album at an acoustic performance in London. The band worked with fansite &quot;The Halfway Home&quot; to produce an advent calendar for Christmas 2005. The only studio recording released in 2005 was the track &#x27;Shalom&#x27;, included as Day 24 on the calendar.

In April 2006 the band released a new EP, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, accompanied by a low-key UK tour beginning in The Cockpit in Leeds. The EP was limited to 2,000 copies, available on vinyl, and was also available for download. The single &quot;Sing it Out&quot; was released in June 2006, reaching No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart, and their second album &quot;Left&quot; followed on 19 June.

The band appeared at T in the Park on 8 July, and then the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August, where they played on the BBC Radio 1/NME stage. During their set on 27 August at Reading, it emerged it may be their last ever show as the band were splitting up. This was suggested further later in the day by friends Broken Social Scene, who dedicated their festival set to the band. On 30 August, Sam Herlihy made a statement on the band&#x27;s forum confirming the split and that Reading was their last show.

Following the band&#x27;s split, Sam Herlihy and Simon Jones formed The Northwestern, who split in 2012. The rest of the band formed Troubles, with Michael Hibbert leaving in 2007 to form Chapel Club, who split in 2013.

On 8 July 2024, the band announced that they had reunited to play 3 gigs in December 2024 and were recording new material with producer Jolyon Thomas. A fourth date was added following strong ticket sales.

&quot;Long Waits in A&amp;E&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new song since 2006, was released to digital and streaming platforms on 1 November 2024. A single-sided vinyl release, limited to 1,000 copies, was sold at the band&#x27;s comeback gigs in December 2024.

This was followed by the release of &quot;The Magic Kingdom (B-sides 2002-2006)&quot; to digital and streaming platforms on 17 December 2024. The compilation features all the B-sides from the band&#x27;s single releases from &quot;Black Dollar Bills&quot; to &quot;Left&quot;, including several which had not previously been available on streaming services.

<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was built by Adam Hayes at Deptford Dockyard and launched on 16 May 1763, having been adapted from a design of the old 90-gun ship which had been built in 1730. She was the first ship to be called HMS Albion. She was the first of a series of ships built to the same lines, which became known as the .

She saw her first action in the American War of Independence in July 1779 at the indecisive Battle of Grenada, when the British Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Byron managed to avoid defeat from superior French forces.

&quot;Albion&#x27;s&quot; next action was a year later on 17 April 1780, when British and French fleets met in the Battle of Martinique. A month later, on 15 May, the fleets met again and after a few days of manoeuvring the head of the British line confronted the rear-most French warships. &quot;Albion&quot;, leading the vanguard of the British fleet suffered heavy casualties, but with little to show for it. Just four days later the two fleets clashed for the third time but again it was indecisive with &quot;Albion&quot; heavily engaged as before, suffering numerous casualties in the process.

In 1794 &quot;Albion&quot; was consigned to the role of a 60-gun floating battery armed with heavy carronades and moored on the Thames Estuary. She was positioned in the Middle Swin, seven miles north-east of Foulness Point.

==Fate==

In April 1797, while heading to a new position in the Swin Channel, off Maplin Sands and Foulness she ran aground due to pilot error. Two days later, during salvage efforts, her back broke, and she was completely wrecked. rescued Captain Henry Savage and his crew. The crew later transferred to the newly built .

The subsequent court-martial blamed the pilots, William Springfield and Joseph Wright, for imprudent maneuvering and going too far back before altering course. The court ordered that they lose all pay due to them and they never serve as pilots again.

<doc id="965135" wikidata="Q2290063" url="?curid=965135" title="Gautreks saga">
<text>Gautreks saga (Gautrek&#x27;s Saga) is a Scandinavian legendary saga put to text towards the end of the 13th century which survives only in much later manuscripts. It seems to have been intended as a compilation of traditional stories, often humorous, about a legendary King Gautrek of West Geatland, to serve as a kind of prequel to the already existing &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot; (&quot;Saga of Hrólf son of Gautrek&quot;). See also king of the Geats.

==Summary==
As it stands, the saga seems incomplete, for a promise is made that the tale will return to King Gautrek of Götaland and his sons, to &quot;the same story as told in Sweden&quot;, and that promise is not kept. Indeed, other than the reference to &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;, no sons are mentioned. But it seems that Gautrek was noted in many tales for his generosity and bravery, but not for deep thinking, according to a passage near the end. It is probable there were more amusing anecdotes to that effect that the author planned to include.

There are actually two main versions of &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;: a shorter, apparently older, version; and a longer, apparently more recent, one.

===Shorter version===

The shorter version begins by relating how Gautrekr&#x27;s father-to-be, King Gauti of West Götaland, becomes lost while hunting, and spends the night in an isolated homestead of strange, arguably insane, backwoods bumpkins: a stingy farmer named Skafnörtungr (&#x27;Skinflint&#x27;), his equally stingy wife Tötra (&#x27;Tatters&#x27;), and their three sons and three daughters. That night Gauti fathers Gautrekr on Snotra, the eldest of the farmer&#x27;s daughters and supposedly the most intelligent of the family. The account bristles with grisly humor as it relates how one by one the members of the family go on to kill themselves over the most trivial losses, believing that they will go to Óðinn in Valhöll, until at last only Snotra and her child Gautrekr remain. At that point Snotra takes Gautrekr to Gauti&#x27;s court; years later, on his deathbed, King Gauti makes Gautrekr his heir. This section is sometimes referred to as &quot;Dalafífla þáttr&quot; (&quot;The Tale of the Fools in the Valley&quot;).

The saga then shifts to a folk-tale-like account of how Refr, the lazy son of a farmer, forces his father&#x27;s stupendous ox as gift upon the stingy but extraordinarily intelligent Jarl Neri and requests only Neri&#x27;s advice in return. Jarl Neri normally never accepts gifts because he is too stingy to repay them. But he takes the ox and gives Ref a whetstone in return, telling him how to employ it as a gift to King Gautrekr to get greater wealth. The saga has mentioned Gautrek&#x27;s marriage to Álfhildr, daughter of King Haraldr of Wendland, and Álfhildr&#x27;s subsequent death by illness years later, which has driven the grieving Gautrekr somewhat out of his mind: ignoring all matters of state, Gautrekr spends all his time on Álfhildr&#x27;s burial mound, flying his hawk. On Neri&#x27;s advice, Refr gives the whetstone to Gautrekr at the moment that the king needs something to throw at his hawk; Gautrekr promptly gives Refr a gold ring. Refr goes on to visit king after king, in each case giving part or all of that which he received from the previous king, and getting in return a greater gift, since none of the kings want to be outdone by Gautrekr, who &quot;gives gold in exchange for pebbles.&quot; At last, through Neri&#x27;s advice and trickery, Refr gains the hand of Gautrekr&#x27;s daughter Helga and an earldom that Neri held from King Gautrekr. This is often known as &quot;Gjafa-Refs þáttr&quot; (&#x27;the story of Gift-Refr&#x27;).

The shorter version of the saga ends with an account of King Gautrekr&#x27;s remarriage to the fair Ingibjörg, daughter of a powerful hersir in the Sogn region of Norway. Ingibjörg chooses Gautrekr for his fame and generosity, despite his age, over the young prince Óláfr who has also asked for her hand. Gautrekr fights off an attack by the rejected and disappointed Óláfr, marries Ingibjörg, and fathers two sons named Keti&#x27;l and Hrólfr with her.

===Longer version===

The younger and much better known version of the saga includes these two lighthearted tales, but inserts between them an account of the ancestry, birth, and earliest exploits of Starkaðr, who is perhaps the grimmest and strangest of Scandinavian legendary heroes. This account, sometimes known as &quot;Víkars þáttr&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Víkar&quot;), was probably extracted or retold from a lost saga about Starkaðr; it contains extensive poetry, ostensibly by Starkaðr himself, and it ends tragically. A high point of this section is the evocative episode where Starkaðr&#x27;s foster-father Grani Horsehair awakens his foster-son Starkaðr at about midnight, takes him to an island where eleven men are at council, and, sitting in a twelfth chair reveals himself as the god Óðinn. In a long dialogue between the gods Þór and Óðinn, the two alternately bestow curses and blessings upon Starkaðr. When this is done, Óðinn requires Starkaðr to sacrifice King Víkar, his sworn lord, friend, and benefactor. Starkaðr persuades Víkar to put his neck in a noose of stretchy calf intestines and be stabbed with a fragile reed, thus undergoing a mock sacrifice. Unfortunately, the sacrifice turns real when the noose becomes rope and the reed turns into a spear, leaving Vikar stabbed and hanged, and bringing down grief and disgrace on Starkaðr for killing his lord.

This middle section is so stylistically unlike the happier stories that &quot;bookend&quot; it that some have questioned whether it should have been included at all. The only obvious link is because King Vikar, who appears prominently in it, is father of Jarl Neri who plays a very important role in the material following and also because Eirík king of Sweden, who appears in it, was prominent in &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;. Nonetheless, there are themes that connect all three sections of this saga; for example, both Starkaðr and Refr are unpromising youths, and both Neri and Skafnortung are misers. The entire saga seems to be a meditation on generosity: sacrifice to the gods is useless, and stinginess is not admirable—but giving and receiving gifts, participating in networks of reciprocal exchange, is the way to good fortune.

The longer version does not include the story of Gautrekr&#x27;s remarriage, but essentially the same account appears at the beginning of &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;.

==Analogues==
Snorri Sturluson introduces Gauti and Gautrek in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; where Gauti &quot;after whom Gautland (Götaland) is named&quot; is mentioned as the father of Gautrek the Generous the father of King Algaut the father of Gauthild who married Ingjald the son of King Önund of Sweden. This should make Gautrek live in the early 7th century, approximately contemporary with Önund&#x27;s father Yngvar or possibly Yngvar&#x27;s father Eystein in whose days, according to Snorri, the Danish king Hrólf Kraki died. And indeed Hrólf Kraki is one of the kings whom Ref visits in the saga. Another king visited by Ref is Ælle of England and the historical King Ælle of Deira could well be contemporary to the legendary Hrólf Kraki of Denmark. However in the section concerning Starkad, the kings of Sweden are the brothers Alrek and Eirík which, if one trusts the order of kings in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, would put Gautrek generations earlier.

However in &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauds&quot; (&quot;The saga of Herraud and Bósi&quot;), Gautrek&#x27;s supposed half-brother Hring is a contemporary of King Harald Wartooth.

&quot;Gjafa-Refs þáttr&quot; has a close parallel in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. The parallels are summarised by Michael Chesnutt as follows:

==In popular culture==
Translated into Swedish in 1664, the saga&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;Ættarstapi&quot; gave rise to a fashion in early-modern Sweden for labelling inland cliffs with the Swedish equivalent of that name, &quot;Ättestupa&quot;. The idea of the &quot;ättestupa&quot; went on to appear extensively in popular culture.

The saga is one of the key inspirations for Bjarni Bjarnason&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Mannorð&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was launched at Perry&#x27;s Blackwall Yard on the Thames on 17 June 1802. She was broken up at Chatham Dockyard in 1836.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In May 1803 she was under the command of Captain John Ferrier and joined Admiral Cornwallis&#x27; fleet, which was blockading the vital French naval port of Brest. &quot;Albion&quot; was among the vessels of the squadron that shared in the proceeds of the capture of:

:&quot;Juffrow Bregtie Kaas&quot; (30 May 1803);
:&quot;Eendraght&quot; (31 May);
:&quot;Morgen Stern&quot; (1 June);
:&quot;Goede ferwachting&quot; (4 June);
:&quot;De Vriede&quot; (5 June).

&quot;Albion&quot; was soon detached from the fleet to deploy to the Indian Ocean where she was to remain for several years.

&quot;Albion&quot; and left Rio de Janeiro on 13 October, escorting &quot;Lord Melville&quot;, &quot;Earl Spencer&quot;, &quot;Princess Mary&quot;, &quot;Northampton&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Ann&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot;. They were in company with the 74-gun third rate ship of the line , and the fourth rate . Three days later &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot; separated from the rest of the ships.

On 21 December 1803, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot; captured the French privateer &quot;Clarisse&quot; at in the eastern Indian Ocean. &quot;Clarisse&quot; was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 157 men. She had sailed from Isle de France (Mauritius) on 24 November with provisions for a six-month cruise to the Bay of Bengal. At the time of her capture she had not captured anything. &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, and &quot;Clarisse&quot; arrived at Madras on 8 January 1804.

On 28 February 1804, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot; met up in the straits of Malacca with the fleet of Indiamen that had just emerged from the Battle of Pulo Aura and conducted them safely to Saint Helena. From there escorted the convoy to England.

On 28 August 1808, &quot;Albion&quot; recaptured &quot;Swallow&quot;, which was carrying among other things, a quantity of gold dust.

Next, &quot;Albion&quot; escorted a fleet of nine East Indiamen returning to Britain. They left Madras on 25 October, but a gale that commenced around 20 November at by 22 November had dispersed the fleet. By 21 February three of the Indiamen —&quot;Lord Nelson&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, and &quot;Experiment&quot;— had not arrived at Cape Town. Apparently all three had foundered without a trace.

&quot;Caroline&quot;, of Riga, arrived at Yarmouth on 17 August 1810 having been detained by &quot;Albion&quot;.

==War of 1812==
In 1814, the year that Napoleon was finally toppled, and after a long period under extensive repair, she became flagship of Rear Admiral George Cockburn, taking part in a war (War of 1812) against the United States — a duty that the first &quot;Albion&quot; had once undertaken. In the summer of 1814, she was involved in the force that harried the coastline of Chesapeake Bay, where she operated all the way up to the Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, destroying large amounts of American shipping, as well as US government property. The operations ended once peace was declared in 1815.

==Post-war==

Just a year later, &quot;Albion&quot; was part of a combined British-Dutch fleet taking part in the bombardment of Algiers on 27 August 1816, which was intended to force the Dey of Algiers to free Christian slaves. She fired 4,110 shots at the city, and suffered 3 killed and 15 wounded by return fire. In 1827, she was part of a combined British-French-Russian fleet under the command of Admiral Codrington at the Battle of Navarino, where a Turkish-Egyptian fleet was obliterated, securing Greek independence. &quot;Albion&quot; suffered 10 killed and 50 wounded, including her second-in-command, Commander John Norman Campbell. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with the clasps &quot;Algiers&quot;, and &quot;Navarino&quot; to all surviving claimants from the battles.

==Fate==
&quot;Albion&quot; was hulked as a quarantine ship in 1831, and finally broken up in 1836.

<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was a 90-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Ordered in 1839, she was built at Plymouth Dockyard, launched on 6 September 1842, and completed on 23 January 1844. &quot;Albion&quot; was designed by Sir William Symonds, was the only ship of her class to ever serve as a sailing ship, and the last British two-decker to be completed and enter service without a steam engine. She was the name ship of a class of three second rates—the others being and .

==Career==

&quot;Albion&quot; entered service in 1844 and was deployed to the Black Sea during the Crimean War. Her crew suffered many casualties from Cholera in August 1854. She took part in the siege of Sevastopol, with her commanding officer, Captain Stephen Lushington taking charge of a Naval Brigade providing vital heavy artillery support for the Allied forces besieging Sevastopol. On 17 October 1854, &quot;Albion&quot;, under the command of Commander Henry Rogers joined over 50 British and French warships of various types in an initial seaborne bombardment of Sevastapol. The Russians suffered heavy casualties (at least 1,100 men) but the Allies had failed to seriously damage the batteries. The Anglo-French fleet had received comparatively light casualties, with about 500 killed or wounded in total. However, the Allies had taken a beating from the Russian batteries, and &quot;Albion&quot; had been set on fire three times during the engagement, with 11 killed and 71 injured. Without the assistance of tugs, it is probable that &quot;Albion&quot; would have run aground. On 17 August 1855 &quot;Albion&quot; took part in the fifth bombardment of Sevastopol.

==Fate==
From 1860 until 1861, she was converted to steam screw propulsion at Devonport, but the modifications were never finished. She was kept in reserve in Devonport for more than twenty years, before the decision was made to scrap her, and she was finally broken up at Devonport in 1884.

<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the British Royal Navy and a member of the . Intended for service in Asia, &quot;Albion&quot; and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. &quot;Albion&quot; was laid down in December 1896, launched in June 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in June 1901.

&quot;Albion&quot; spent the first few years of her career abroad on the China Station from 1901 to 1905, before returning to British waters to serve with the Channel Fleet and later the Atlantic Fleet. After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised and returned to the Channel Fleet, but was quickly sent to the Atlantic to help defend against the possibility of German warships breaking out of the North Sea. In December and January 1915, she supported operations against German Southwest Africa.

The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea in January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. During these operations, &quot;Albion&quot; was damaged by Ottoman artillery twice. In October 1915, she was transferred to Salonika to support the Allied operations against Bulgaria through then-neutral Greece, but she saw no further action. She was transferred back to Ireland in April 1916 for service as a guard ship, a role she filled until October 1918, when she was reduced to a barracks ship. &quot;Albion&quot; was sold for scrap in December 1919 and broken up the following year.

&quot;Albion&quot; and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. &quot;Albion&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s.

&quot;Albion&quot; had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull, two on each broadside near the forward and aft barbette.

To save weight, &quot;Albion&quot; carried less armour than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s— in the belt compared to —although the change from Harvey armour in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s to Krupp armour in &quot;Albion&quot; meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==

HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was laid down by Thames Iron Works at Leamouth, London on 3 December 1896. Tragedy struck when she was launched on 21 June 1898; after Mary of Teck, The Duchess of York christened her, a wave created by &quot;Albion&quot;″s entry into the water caused a stage from which 200 people were watching to collapse into a side creek, and 34 people, mostly women and children, drowned in one of the worst peacetime disasters in Thames history. Both the launch and the stage collapse were captured on film by E. P. Prestwich and Robert W. Paul. The decision to distribute these films was controversial in its day, sparking one of the earliest debates surrounding videojournalism.

&quot;Albion&quot;″s completion then was delayed by late delivery of her machinery. She finally began trials late in 1900, during which she was further delayed by machinery and gun defects, and she was not finally completed until June 1901. HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was commissioned on 25 June 1901 at Chatham Dockyard, by Captain W. W. Hewett and a complement of 779 officers and men, to relieve battleship &quot;Barfleur&quot; on the China Station.

She arrived at Hong Kong on 11 September 1901, and relieved &quot;Barfleur&quot; as second flagship of the China Station, based in that city. Captain Martyn Jerram was appointed flag captain in March 1902. During her time on the station, she underwent refits at Hong Kong in 1902 and 1905. In 1905, the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance, reducing the requirement for a large British presence on the China Station, and the Royal Navy recalled all its battleships from the station. At Singapore, &quot;Albion&quot; rendezvoused with her sister ships &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Vengeance&quot; and battleship &quot;Centurion&quot;, and on 20 June 1905 the four battleships departed to steam in company to Plymouth, where they arrived on 2 August 1905. &quot;Albion&quot; then became part of the Channel Fleet. She soon suffered a mishap, colliding with battleship &quot;Duncan&quot; at Lerwick on 26 September 1905, but suffered no damage. &quot;Albion&quot; transferred to the commissioned Reserve on 3 April 1906, and underwent an engine and boiler refit at Chatham. On 25 February 1907, &quot;Albion&quot; paid off at Portsmouth.

On 26 February 1907, &quot;Albion&quot; recommissioned at Portsmouth for temporary service with the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet. She returned to full commission on 26 March 1907 to begin service in the Atlantic Fleet. During this service, she underwent a refit at Gibraltar in 1908 and at Malta in 1909. She was with the fleet that visited London from 17 July to 24 July 1909 to be entertained by the citizens of the city, and on 31 July 1909 was present at the fleet review of the Home and Atlantic Fleets at Cowes by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. &quot;Albion&quot; ended her Atlantic Fleet service by paying off on 25 August 1909. She then began service at the Nore as parent ship of the 4th Division, Home Fleet. She became a unit of the 3rd Fleet at the Nore in May 1912, and underwent a refit at Chatham that year. She was stationed at Pembroke Dock in 1913.

===First World War===
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, &quot;Albion&quot; was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet. On 15 August 1914, she became second flagship of the new 7th Battle Squadron. On 21 August 1914, she was sent to the Saint Vincent-Finisterre Station to provide battleship support to cruiser squadrons operating in the Atlantic in case Imperial German Navy heavy ships broke out into the open Atlantic. Here, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral H. L. Tottenham. On 3 September 1914, she transferred her flag, becoming a private ship, and moved to the Cape Verde-Canary Islands station to relieve her sister ship there. &quot;Albion&quot; was transferred to the Cape of Good Hope Station in South Africa in October 1914, where she took up duty as a guard ship at Walvis Bay through November 1914. Following the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, where a British cruiser squadron was defeated by the German East Asia Squadron, the Admiralty ordered Rear Admiral Herbert King-Hall, the commander of the Cape of Good Hope Station, to concentrate his squadron to prevent Spee from defeating him in detail. &quot;Albion&quot; was accordingly recalled from Walvis Bay to Table Bay. In December 1914 and January 1915, she participated in Allied operations against German Southwest Africa. Later in January, &quot;Albion&quot; returned to port in Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, before proceeding to the Mediterranean Sea.

====Dardanelles campaign====

&quot;Albion&quot; transferred to the Mediterranean in January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles campaign. She took part in the bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the outer entrance to the Dardanelles on 19 February 1915. This was the first stage in a plan to force the Dardanelles and enter the Sea of Marmara. &quot;Albion&quot; was joined by three other British battlecruisers and battleships—, , and —and two French battleships— and . Once these ships had cleared the initial defences, additional ships would join the attack; heavy Ottoman resistance instead stalled the initial attack before &quot;Albion&quot; could begin her part of the operation, and she did not see action that day. Nevertheless, she did sweep an area for naval mines along with the protected cruiser ; while on the operation, &quot;Albion&quot; fired eight 6-inch shells in an unsuccessful attempt to draw Ottoman attention so their guns could be destroyed by counter-battery fire.

&quot;Albion&quot; participated in another attack on the forts on 25 February; she was tasked with covering a group of minesweepers, along with &quot;Triumph&quot; and several destroyers after the main bombardment force suppressed the Ottoman batteries. During their operation, &quot;Albion&quot; came under fire from a gun from Battery &quot;Orkaniye&quot;; counter fire from &quot;Albion&quot;, and forced the Ottomans to check their fire. By the afternoon, most of the Ottoman artillery had ceased firing, apart from some field guns that could not be observed, and so the minesweepers were ordered to begin clearing the mines, covered by &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot;, and &quot;Vengeance&quot;. The following day, &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot;, and were assigned to the force that was to break into the Dardanelles and destroy the fortresses at close range. &quot;Albion&quot; was assigned to the fort at Dardanus, and she opened fire with her main battery at a range of , though the Ottoman response was light. After the guns fell silent, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; moved on but quickly came under fire from dispersed, mobile field guns, and both vessels were forced to take evasive maneuvers to avoid serious damage. After &quot;Majestic&quot; was holed below the waterline, Admiral John de Robeck ordered them to break off the attack.

On 28 February, &quot;Albion&quot; took part in another attempt to suppress the Ottoman defences in the Dardanelles; she and &quot;Triumph&quot; led the operation, and were tasked with neutralizing the repaired fortress at Dardanus, while &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Ocean&quot; supported them by engaging the mobile field guns. As &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot; approached Dardanus, they came under heavy fire from Ottoman guns on the European side of the straits, including the fortress at Erenköy, and were forced to circle to avoid taking hits. Unable to engage Dardanus under these conditions, the ships instead opened fire on the guns at Erenköy, which initially seemed to be effective, as the Ottoman fire slackened. &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; approached in an attempt to attack Dardanus, but they too came under renewed, furious fire from Erenköy, and de Robeck again ordered a withdrawal. The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from &quot;Triumph&quot; went ashore and disabled a number of light guns. The inability of the British and French fleets to neutralize the mobile field guns convinced the Allied command that the only way forward would be to make a major amphibious assault to clear the guns by land.

&quot;Albion&quot; supported another operation in the Dardanelles on 3 March; she, &quot;Triumph&quot; and covered a landing force that was to raid Sedd el Bahr. Heavy weather delayed the start of the attack, but the landing took place without incident. &quot;Albion&quot; shelled Erenköy, which did not return fire, and the landing party discovered a battery of six 15-pounder field guns that they destroyed. Two days later, &quot;Albion&quot; conducted an indirect fire test to determine the efficacy of attempting to neutralize the fortresses at ranges where the Ottomans would be unable to reply; this was planned to demonstrate the feasibility of using the powerful dreadnought , armed with guns, in that role. &quot;Albion&quot; was tasked with shelling one of the fortresses protecting Çanakkale, and she was covered by several British and French battleships. On entering the straits, &quot;Albion&quot; came under heavy fire, particularly from Dardanus; three of the covering battleships joined her to suppress those guns, briefly allowing &quot;Albion&quot; to anchor and begin the planned bombardment. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; joined the bombardment, but mobile howitzers quickly found both vessels and forced de Robeck to break off the operation.

On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet mounted a major attack on the Ottoman defences; &quot;Albion&quot; joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and suppress the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans they were going to land troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship and then &quot;Inflexible&quot; began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, and the battleship &quot;Bouvet&quot; struck a mine and exploded. &quot;Albion&quot; and several other battleships attempted to suppress Ottoman guns firing on the boats that went to rescue &quot;Bouvet&quot;″s crew.

She supported the main landings at V Beach at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915. Starting at around 04:30 on the morning of the landings, &quot;Albion&quot; bombarded the high ground overlooking the beach, but by around 05:30, heavy smoke and mist prevented her gunners from observing targets and so she ceased fire. After the Allied forces began to go ashore, &quot;Albion&quot; supported their advance on the village of Sedd el Bahr, but by around 07:30 had to check fire again, as friendly troops had entered the town. She then shifted fire to support the men going ashore at W Beach, but heavy Ottoman fire repulsed the landing and the Allied soldiers were forced to withdraw. As it turned out, the report of Allied troops in Sedd el Bahr proved to be erroneous, and further attacks were launched against the Ottoman defenders the following day, which &quot;Albion&quot; supported. After &quot;Albion&quot; knocked out a machine gun position on the south-west corner of the village, the troops were able to advance into the town and force the Ottomans to retreat.

On 28 April 1915 she took part in an attack on Krithia, led by five French battleships and supported by four other British battleships. &quot;Albion&quot; suffered significant damage from Ottoman shore batteries, forcing her to retire to Mudros for repairs, leaking badly. The repair work took three days to complete. Back in action on 2 May 1915, she again was hit by shells from Ottoman batteries on the Asian side of the straits, necessitating further repairs at Mudros. On the night of 22–23 May 1915, &quot;Albion&quot; beached on a sandbank off Gaba Tepe and came under heavy fire from Ottoman shore batteries. About 200 fragmentation shells hit her, but they could not penetrate her armour and did no serious damage, and &quot;Albion&quot; suffered fewer than a dozen casualties. After efforts were made to free her by reducing her weight and by using the recoil of firing her main guns simultaneously, her sister ship &quot;Canopus&quot; towed her to safety on 24 May 1915, &quot;Albion&quot; still firing at the Ottoman forts while being towed clear. &quot;Albion&quot; left the area for repairs on 26 May 1915 and underwent a refit at Malta in May–June 1915.

====Later operations====
In late September, after Bulgaria entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, Britain and France negotiated with Greece to allow an expeditionary force to debark at Salonika to attack Bulgaria. On 4 October 1915, &quot;Albion&quot; arrived at Salonika to become a unit of the 3rd Detached Squadron, tasked with assisting the French Navy in a blockade of the coasts of Greece and Bulgaria and with reinforcing the Suez Canal Patrol. She embarked the first British Army contingent of 1,500 troops for Salonika and escorted French troopships carrying the French second contingent. &quot;Albion&quot; served on the Salonika Station until April 1916, then became a guard ship at Queenstown, Ireland, later that month. In May 1916 she moved to Devonport for a refit; that completed, she moved on to the Humber in August 1916 for service as a guard ship there. In October 1918, &quot;Albion&quot;″s service as a guard ship came to an end, and she was reduced to service as an accommodation ship. In August 1919, &quot;Albion&quot; was placed on the disposal list at Devonport. She was sold for scrapping on 11 December 1919. She left Devonport under her own steam on 3 January 1920, arriving at Morecambe for scrapping on 6 January 1920.

<doc id="965152" wikidata="Q4040001" url="?curid=965152" title="HMS Antelope (1703)">
<text>HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; was a 50-gun fourth rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Rotherhithe on 13 March 1703. She was rebuilt once during her career, and served in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolutionary War.

Orders were issued on 9 January 1738 for &quot;Antelope&quot; to be taken to pieces and rebuilt according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment at Woolwich, from where she was relaunched on 27 January 1741.

==Career==

On 16 June 1756, she sailed from England for Gibraltar with Vice Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke and Rear Admiral Charles Saunders. She arrived there on 3 July with an order to supersede Admiral John Byng. &quot;Antelope&quot; returned to England with Byng, sailing on 9 July and arriving at Spithead on 26 July, where Byng was arrested before being landed on 19 August. His trial started on board &quot;St George&quot; on 27 December.

On 30 April 1757, Captain Samuel Hood took command of &quot;Antelope&quot;. On 15 May, after a short action off Brest, France, the French &quot;Aquilon&quot;, 50, was driven on to the rocks in Audierne Bay where she was wrecked. Then, on 31 October 1758, in the Kingroad off Portishead, &quot;Antelope&quot; took , 64, one of a French squadron returning from Quebec, that had anchored off Ilfracombe, Antelope opened fire but the French ship surrendered without having fired a shot in return.

Not every action was a success. In 1759, under the command of Captain James Webb, &quot;Antelope&quot; was attached to Commodore William Boys&#x27; squadron, which had been blockading François Thurot in Dunkirk throughout the summer and early autumn. On 15 October, when the squadron had been driven off station during a gale, Thurot made his escape with six frigates and corvettes carrying 1300 troops and sailed to Gothenburg.

In 1762, &quot;Antelope&quot; was stationed in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, under the command of Commodore Thomas Graves, who was the Colony&#x27;s Naval Governor. A French fleet from Brest, under M. de Ternay, with 1500 troops commanded by the Comte d&#x27;Haussonville, sailed into St. John&#x27;s and captured the town on 24 June. Captain Graves immediately sent word to Commodore Lord Colville at Halifax who joined him in blockading the French, and brought troops over from Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island on 11 September. During a gale on 16 September de Ternay evaded the blockade and, abandoning the troops, sailed back to France.

On her way home to England &quot;Antelope&quot; under Admiral Clark Gayton she encountered HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot;, under Captain Thomas Burnett, which had sailed from Havana as part of the escort of a convoy of prizes and transports, but had become separated in very heavy weather. She was leaking so badly that her guns had to be thrown overboard and the pumps kept working. &quot;Antelope&quot; took all her people off on 29 November when she started to founder and she was allowed to sink.

American Revolution:
Under command of Will Judd she captured Schooners &quot;Betsy&quot;, and &quot;Peggy&quot; and sloop &quot;Stordy&quot;, probably between 20–25 December 1776. She captured schooner &quot;Juno&quot;, probably between December, 1776 and March, 1777. She captured brig &quot;Papilllon&quot; and brig &quot;Sunberry&quot;, probably between mid September and mid October, 1777. She captured brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, probably in mid December, 1777.
On 6 April 1778, under command of Capt. Charles Holmes Everitt, she and HMS Diligence captured American schooner &quot;John&quot;.
Later, in 1780, &quot;Antelope&quot; was again patrolling the Labrador coast and intercepted the American ship &quot;Mercury&quot;. As the vessels came to close quarters, a package was thrown overboard from the latter. One of the sailors on &quot;Antelope&quot; dived from the deck and rescued the package, which contained details of secret negotiations then being conducted between the United States and the United Provinces. Antelope Harbour, Labrador, is named for this incident.

&quot;Antelope&quot; was sold out of the service on 30 October 1783.

<doc id="965154" wikidata="Q4771148" url="?curid=965154" title="Antelope (1780 packet)">
<text>Antelope was a West Indian [[packet ship]] launched in 1780. The French captured her in 1781, 1782, and finally, in 1794. She is most famous for a desperate single-ship action in 1793 when her crew captured a better-armed French privateer with a much larger crew.

==Career==
The French first captured her in 1781, and then ransomed her. They then captured her again on 10 October 1782. They took her into Nantes, from where Captain William Kempthorne re-purchased her on 4 April 1783, and took her under command.

On 1 December 1793, &quot;Antelope&quot; was sailing without Captain Kempthorne, who had remained in Falmouth due to illness, and was off Cumberland Harbour, Cuba when she sighted two privateers. Obeying orders, &quot;Antelope&quot; headed back to port to avoid trouble, but the next day the wind failed and one of the privateers, &quot;Atlante&quot; (of eight 3-pounder guns), was able to come alongside and attack. &quot;Antelope&quot; was armed with six 3-pounder (1.4 kg) guns and manned by a crew of 21. &quot;Atlante&quot;, a French privateer from Charleston, South Carolina, had a crew of 65, consisting of Frenchmen, Irishmen, and Americans.

During the battle, both of &quot;Antelope″&quot;s officers were killed or wounded. Before he fell, the master, Mr. Edward Curtis, turned the two bow guns, double shotted, to cover the bow, and fired them at the first boarding party, killing and wounding some 15 men; he fell shortly thereafter. Command fell on Boatswain John Pascoe, who then led the crew in repelling the boarding parties. &quot;Antelope″&quot;s crew repeatedly threw back the privateers, and eventually cut their grapples. In their resistance, &quot;Antelope″&quot;s crew was aided by the fact that she was higher than the &quot;Atlante&quot;, enabling the crew to fire down on the deck of the privateer while being protected. Not content with having repelled the attacks, Pascoe raced up the rigging, lashing the squaresail yard of &quot;Atlante&quot; to &quot;Antelope″&quot;s foreshrouds, and continued the battle until &quot;Atlante&quot; surrendered.

&quot;Antelope&quot; lost 3 killed and 3 wounded, one mortally. The privateer lost her first captain mortally wounded and second captain wounded, 30 men killed in the action, and 17 wounded (three mortally); only 16 of her 65 men were unhurt.

The victorious &quot;Antelope&quot; put into Annotto Bay, Jamaica with her prize. It turned out that &quot;Atlante&quot; had been out of Charlestown a month, during which time she had taken one prize, a Bermudian brig.

Jamaica&#x27;s House of Assembly voted a sum of 500 guineas to the officers and men of &quot;Antelope&quot;. Two hundred guineas went to the widow of Mr. Curtis, the late master. One hundred guineas each went to the first mate, who had been shot through the body during the engagement, and to Mr. Pascoe, the boatswain. The last hundred guineas was divided among the surviving members of the crew. In London, the Committee for Encouraging the Capture of French Privateers too passed out lavish rewards. Pascoe received 50 guineas and a gold whistle; the crew, widows, and dependents received money. The Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, the Earl of Chesterfield too presented prizes but &quot;stressed that this was an award made solely due to the lengthy defence and successful protection of the mail. He did not want to encourage crews to actively seek prize money or ships. Their duty was to the safe and swift delivery of the post.&quot;

==Fate==
On 19 August 1794, &quot;Antelope&quot; sailed for North America with thirty men. On 19 September 1794, she encountered a squadron of French frigates in a dense fog. Her crew sank the mail and surrendered to &quot;Surveillante&quot;. While a captive of the French, Captain Kempthorne died of yellow fever. &quot;Antelope″&quot;s assessed value when lost was £2750 16s 8d (plus £34 for her ordnance stores).

<text>(styled as ROHM) is a Japanese electronic parts manufacturer based in Kyoto, Japan. Rohm was incorporated as Toyo Electronics Industry Corporation by Kenichiro Sato (佐藤 研一郎) on September 17, 1958.

The company was originally called R.ohm, which was derived from R for resistors, the original product, plus ohm, the unit of measure for resistance.

The name of the company was officially changed to Rohm in 1979 and then changed again to Rohm Semiconductor in January 2009.

When Rohm was established, resistors were its main product. Later, the company began manufacturing semiconductors. ICs and discrete semiconductors now account for about 80% of Rohm&#x27;s revenue.

Through 2012, Rohm was among the top 20 semiconductor sales leaders.

==International expansion==
In 2016, Rohm started the construction of their production facility in Kelantan, Malaysia and commenced the operation in April 2017. A few years later in 2022, Rohm expanded their facility by approximately 1.5 times bigger with the plan to start operating in 2023. The original plant mainly focuses on the production of discrete semiconductors such as diodes while the expanded facility will be focusing on the production of analog LSIs and transistors.

== Products ==
Rohm produces a range of products such as power stage ICs aimed at power supplies, CMOS operational amplifier used to boost sensor-signals as well as Hall effect sensors. The company also sells DC to DC controller ICs, current sensor ICs and AC to DC converters.

FeRAM and other LSI integrated circuits are designed and manufactured by the Lapis Semiconductor division of Rohm,
formerly OKI Semiconductor, a division of Oki Electric.

<text>George O. Poinar Jr. (born April 25, 1936) is an American entomologist and writer. He is known for popularizing the idea of extracting DNA from insects fossilized in amber, an idea which received widespread attention when adapted by Michael Crichton for the book and movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Poinar earned a BS and MS at Cornell University, and remained there for his doctoral studies, receiving a PhD in biology in 1962. He spent many of his years of research at University of California, Berkeley in the Department of Entomology, Division of Insect Pathology. There, and during travels around the globe, he performed research on the axenic culture of nematodes, nematode parasites of insects and the fossil records of insects and nematodes in amber.

In 1992 a team consisting of Poinar, his wife entomologist Roberta Poinar, his son Hendrik, and Dr. Raúl J. Cano of California Polytechnic State University successfully extracted insect DNA from a Lebanese weevil in amber that was 125 million years old, collected by Raif Milki in Lebanon. More recent studies of ancient DNA cast doubt on the DNA results, but not on the authenticity of the amber samples.

In 1995, George and Roberta Poinar, a fellow researcher from Berkeley, moved to Oregon, where they opened the Amber Institute. Upon his move to Oregon he received a courtesy appointment to the Department of Entomology of Oregon State University.

In 2016, Poinar announced the discovery of a new plant species that is a 45-million-year-old relative of coffee he found in amber. Named &quot;Strychnos electri&quot;, after the Greek word for amber (electron), the flowers represent the first-ever fossils of an asterid.

In 2017, Poinar published a paper describing a fossilized flower and its tentative pollinator. The paper describes a flower of an ancestral milkweed plant, which was named &quot;Discoflorus neotropicus&quot;, and a termite carrying a pollinium, all covered in Dominican amber.

Poinar&#x27;s son, Hendrik Poinar, is a genetics researcher in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster University.

<text>HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; was a Royal Navy &quot;Alarm&quot;-class torpedo gunboat. She was launched in 1893, reduced to harbour service from 1910 and was sold for scrapping in 1919.

==Design==
The &quot;Alarm&quot; class was designed by Sir William White in 1889. They had a length overall of , a beam of and a displacement of 810 tons. &quot;Antelope&quot; was engined by Yarrows with two sets of vertical triple-expansion steam engines, two locomotive-type boilers, and twin screws. This layout produced , giving her a speed of with forced draught. She carried between 100 and 160 tons of coal and was manned by 91 sailors and officers.

==Armament==
When built &quot;Antelope&quot; was fitted with two QF /45-pounder guns, four 3-pounder guns and one Gardner machine gun. Her three 18-inch torpedo tubes were arranged as a pair of revolving deck mounts and a single bow-mounted tube; three reloads were provided.

==History==
=== Construction ===
&quot;Antelope&quot; was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 21 October 1889. Construction was delayed by several months by problems with the ship&#x27;s propeller shafts. She was finally launched, by Miss Crocker, the daughter of the shipyard manager on 12 July 1893. In 2015, her grandson displayed a commemorative wooden box, holding the mallet and chisel she used to server the rope tethering the ship, on the BBC programme Antiques Roadshow. The ship was completed in May 1894 at a cost of £61,395.

===Service===
In August 1894 &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in that year&#x27;s Naval Manoeuvres, and in July 1896 again took part in the Manoeuvres, On 26 June 1897 she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead in celebration of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, and in July that year took part in the Reserve Fleet Manoeuvres. In April 1899, it was announced that &quot;Antelope&quot; was to be allocated to training of naval reserves, supporting the training Hulk at Bristol.

On 27 June 1900 it was announced that the date of the mobilization for naval manoeuvres had been fixed for 10 July. &quot;Antelope&quot;, together with capital ships, cruisers, torpedo boats and other torpedo gunboats, was ordered to be ready for sea, and took part as part of &#x27;Fleet B&#x27;. In July the next year &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in the 1901 manoeuvres.

Commander Henry Arthur Phillips was appointed in command in early May 1902, and in July 1902 she rejoined the Channel and Home squadrons. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Commander William Nicholson was appointed in command on 10 September 1902.

&quot;Antelope&quot; had been stricken from the effective list by 1905, being described in Parliament as being &quot;of comparatively small fighting value&quot;, although her armament was not removed. Torpedo gunboats that had been re-boilered and re-engined were considered still effective and retained in service, but it was not felt worthwhile to re-engine the remaining torpedo gunboats, such as &quot;Antelope&quot;. &quot;Antelope&quot; was reduced to harbour service from 1910 and used as a training ship at Devonport.

In July 1914 she was listed for sale at Devonport. Following the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Antelope&quot; returned to training duties at Devonport, where she was used for training of stokers.

==Disposal==
&quot;Antelope&quot; was sold to T R Sales for breaking on 27 May 1919.

<text>HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; was a British destroyer, which was completed for the Royal Navy in 1930. &quot;Antelope&quot; served throughout the Second World War, taking part in the sinking of three enemy submarines and in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa.

== Construction and design ==
&quot;Antelope&quot; was ordered on 6 March 1928, and was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie on Tyneside on 11 July 1928. The ship was launched on 27 July 1929 and commissioned on 20 March 1930.

She had a main gun armament of four guns on low angle (30 degree) mounts that were only suitable for anti-ship use, and an anti-aircraft armament of two 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-poms&quot;. Eight torpedo tubes were fitted on two quadruple mounts, with Mark V torpedoes carried. The initial anti-submarine equipment was limited, with no sonar carried and only six depth charges.

In 1941, one of the 4.7 in guns and the aft bank of torpedo tubes was removed, with a anti-aircraft gun replacing the torpedo tubes and an enhanced anti-submarine armament, which included 70 depth charges and the ability to drop patterns of 10 charges. Radar was also fitted, and the destroyer&#x27;s close-in anti-aircraft outfit was supplemented by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, of which two were fitted in 1941 followed by four more later on. The 3 inch gun was removed by 1943, when high-frequency direction finding gear was fitted. A second 4.7 in gun was replaced in 1944 by two QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns.

== History ==

=== Prewar operations ===
Following completion in 1930, &quot;Antelope&quot;, along with the rest of the A class and the destroyer leader joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in patrols off the Spanish coast during the Spanish Civil War, but was damaged in a collision with the destroyers and . After repair &quot;Antelope&quot; returned to the United Kingdom, where she was based at Portsmouth.

=== Second World War ===
On the outbreak of the Second World War, the destroyer was assigned to the 18th Destroyer Flotilla, Channel Force, based at Portsmouth. For the rest of 1939 and the early months of 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; carried out patrol and convoy escort duties in the English Channel and Western Approaches. On 5 February 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; was the sole escort of the outward bound convoy OA 84 south of Ireland when the German submarine attacked the convoy, sinking the freighter &quot;Beaverburn&quot; and damaging the tanker &quot;Ceronia&quot;. &quot;Antelope&quot; retaliated, depth-charging and sinking the U-boat. It was the only U-boat at sea at the time in the area and was the first to be sunk underwater by a single destroyer. &quot;Antelope&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Richard Taylor White R.N. (later Captain R. T. White D.S.O.**, 2nd son of Sir Archibald White, Bt., of Wallingwells) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) on 11 July 1940 for good services to the Royal Navy since the outbreak of the war. White was commander of &quot;Antelope&quot; from 24 September 1938 until 26 February 1941.

=== Norway ===
In April 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; was attached to the Home Fleet for operations as part of the Norwegian Campaign, and when the , flagship of the French forces off Norway, was damaged by German bombers off Namsos, &quot;Antelope&quot; escorted the French cruiser to Scapa Flow. &quot;Antelope&quot; then returned to operations off Norway, but on 13 June 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; collided with the destroyer off Trondheim, Norway, and had to return to the Tyne for repair which continued until August that year, when she joined the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich.

=== Atlantic operations ===
In August 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; sailed in convoy to take part in Operation Menace, the attack on Dakar, but after the cruiser was torpedoed on 1 September 1940, she escorted her back to the Clyde, Scotland. &quot;Antelope&quot; then joined the 12th Destroyer Flotilla based at Greenock, Scotland.

On 31 October 1940, &quot;Antelope&quot; was part of the escort convoy OB 237 when it encountered off northwestern Ireland.

Lt. Cdr. White was awarded his first bar to his D.S.O. following this sinking.

&quot;Antelope&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, with the job of escorting the capital ships of the Home Fleet. In May 1941, &quot;Antelope&quot; formed part of the destroyer escort for the battlecruiser and battleship in the chase for the . Separated from the battleships during the battle of the Denmark Strait, &quot;Antelope&quot; searched for survivors from the sinking of &quot;Hood&quot;, and later was escort to the aircraft carrier .

In August 1941, &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in Operation Gauntlet, an operation that succeeded in destroying the coaling facilities on Spitsbergen, thus denying the coal to Germans. In October, &quot;Antelope&quot; formed part of the escort for the Arctic Convoy PQ 1 to the Soviet Union.

=== Malta ===
&quot;Antelope&quot; sailed to Gibraltar in April 1942, escorting the US aircraft carrier during Operation Calendar, an attempt to deliver badly needed Spitfire fighter aircraft to Malta. She acted as an escort during the follow-up Operation Bowery, when carriers and USS &quot;Wasp&quot; delivered 61 Spitfires and Operation LB when &quot;Eagle&quot; delivered a further 17 during May, and Operations Style and Salient in June 1942, when &quot;Eagle&quot; delivered 55 more Spitfires.

On 11 June, only a day after returning to Gibraltar following Operation Salient, &quot;Antelope&quot; formed part of the escort for Operation Harpoon, a heavily escorted attempt to resupply Malta. After the cruiser was damaged by Italian torpedo bombers, &quot;Antelope&quot; was dispatched from the convoy to tow &quot;Liverpool&quot; back to Gibraltar, with the destroyer as escort. In July, &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in two further Spitfire resupply runs with &quot;Eagle&quot;, Operations Pinpoint and Insect. In August 1942 &quot;Antelope&quot; formed part of the main escort force for Operation Pedestal, another Malta convoy.

After a period stationed off West Africa, &quot;Antelope&quot; escorted troop convoys taking part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French West Africa. On 30 January 1943, &quot;Antelope&quot;, together with the Canadian corvette , sank the . On 13 March 1943, she was escorting the ocean liner , when the liner was sunk by the Italian submarine . In July 1943, &quot;Antelope&quot; took part in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily.

== Disposal ==
In August 1944, &quot;Antelope&quot; returned to the United Kingdom. By this time she was in poor physical condition, and was paid off into reserve on the Tyne in October to free her crew to help ease a manpower shortage in the Royal Navy. In 1946, she was sold and broken up by Hughes Bolckow shipbreakers.
