<text>Datalog is a declarative logic programming language. While it is syntactically a subset of Prolog, Datalog generally uses a bottom-up rather than top-down evaluation model. This difference yields significantly different behavior and properties from Prolog. It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. Datalog has been applied to problems in data integration, networking, program analysis, and more.

== Example ==

A Datalog program consists of &quot;facts&quot;, which are statements that are held to be true, and &quot;rules&quot;, which say how to deduce new facts from known facts. For example, here are two facts that mean &quot;xerces is a parent of brooke&quot; and &quot;brooke is a parent of damocles&quot;:

parent(xerces, brooke).
parent(brooke, damocles).

The names are written in lowercase because strings beginning with an uppercase letter stand for variables. Here are two rules:

ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).

The codice_1 symbol is read as &quot;if&quot;, and the comma is read &quot;and&quot;, so these rules mean:
* &quot;X is an ancestor of Y if X is a parent of Y.&quot;
* &quot;X is an ancestor of Y if X is a parent of some Z, and Z is an ancestor of Y.&quot;

The meaning of a program is defined to be the set of all of the facts that can be deduced using the initial facts and the rules. This program&#x27;s meaning is given by the following facts:

parent(xerces, brooke).
parent(brooke, damocles).
ancestor(xerces, brooke).
ancestor(brooke, damocles).
ancestor(xerces, damocles).
Some Datalog implementations don&#x27;t deduce all possible facts, but instead answer &quot;queries&quot;:

?- ancestor(xerces, X).

This query asks: &quot;Who are all the X that xerces is an ancestor of?&quot; For this example, it would return &quot;brooke&quot; and &quot;damocles&quot;.

== Comparison to relational databases ==

The non-recursive subset of Datalog is closely related to query languages for relational databases, such as SQL. The following table maps between Datalog, relational algebra, and SQL concepts:

More formally, non-recursive Datalog corresponds precisely to unions of conjunctive queries, or equivalently, negation-free relational algebra.


s(x, y).
t(y).
r(A, B) :- s(A, B), t(B).

CREATE TABLE s (
 z0 TEXT NONNULL,
 z1 TEXT NONNULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (z0, z1)
CREATE TABLE t (
 z0 TEXT NONNULL PRIMARY KEY
INSERT INTO s VALUES (&#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (&#x27;y&#x27;);
CREATE VIEW r AS
SELECT s.z0, s.z1
FROM s, t
WHERE s.z1 = t.z0;


== Syntax ==

A Datalog program consists of a list of &quot;rules&quot; (Horn clauses). If &quot;constant&quot; and &quot;variable&quot; are two countable sets of constants and variables respectively and &quot;relation&quot; is a countable set of predicate symbols, then the following BNF grammar expresses the structure of a Datalog program:
&lt;program&gt; ::= &lt;rule&gt; &lt;program&gt; | &quot;&quot;
&lt;rule&gt; ::= &lt;atom&gt; &quot;:-&quot; &lt;atom-list&gt; &quot;.&quot;
&lt;atom&gt; ::= &lt;relation&gt; &quot;(&quot; &lt;term-list&gt; &quot;)&quot;
&lt;atom-list&gt; ::= &lt;atom&gt; | &lt;atom&gt; &quot;,&quot; &lt;atom-list&gt; | &quot;&quot;
&lt;term&gt; ::= &lt;constant&gt; | &lt;variable&gt;
&lt;term-list&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;term&gt; &quot;,&quot; &lt;term-list&gt; | &quot;&quot;
Atoms are also referred to as . The atom to the left of the codice_1 symbol is called the of the rule; the atoms to the right are the . Every Datalog program must satisfy the condition that every variable that appears in the head of a rule also appears in the body (this condition is sometimes called the ).

There are two common conventions for variable names: capitalizing variables, or prefixing them with a question mark codice_3.

Note that under this definition, Datalog does include negation nor aggregates; see for more information about those constructs.

Rules with empty bodies are called . For example, the following rule is a fact:

r(x) :- .
The set of facts is called the or of the Datalog program. The set of tuples computed by evaluating the Datalog program is called the or .

=== Syntactic sugar ===

Many implementations of logic programming extend the above grammar to allow writing facts without the codice_1, like so:
r(x).
Some also allow writing 0-ary relations without parentheses, like so:
p :- q.
These are merely abbreviations (syntactic sugar); they have no impact on the semantics of the program.

== Semantics ==


There are three widely-used approaches to the semantics of Datalog programs: model-theoretic, fixed-point, and proof-theoretic. These three approaches can be proven equivalent.

An atom is called if none of its subterms are variables. Intuitively, each of the semantics define the meaning of a program to be the set of all ground atoms that can be deduced from the rules of the program, starting from the facts.

=== Model theoretic ===

A rule is called ground if all of its atoms (head and body) are ground. A ground rule &quot;R&quot;1 is a &quot;ground instance&quot; of another rule &quot;R&quot;2 if &quot;R&quot;1 is the result of a substitution of constants for all the variables in &quot;R&quot;2. The &quot;Herbrand base&quot; of a Datalog program is the set of all ground atoms that can be made with the constants appearing in the program. The of a Datalog program is the smallest subset of the Herbrand base such that, for each ground instance of each rule in the program, if the atoms in the body of the rule are in the set, then so is the head. The model-theoretic semantics define the minimal Herbrand model to be the meaning of the program.

=== Fixed-point ===

Let be the power set of the Herbrand base of a program &quot;P&quot;. The &quot;immediate consequence operator&quot; for &quot;P&quot; is a map from to that adds all of the new ground atoms that can be derived from the rules of the program in a single step. The least-fixed-point semantics define the least fixed point of to be the meaning of the program; this coincides with the minimal Herbrand model.

The fixpoint semantics suggest an algorithm for computing the minimal model: Start with the set of ground facts in the program, then repeatedly add consequences of the rules until a fixpoint is reached. This algorithm is called naïve evaluation.

=== Proof-theoretic ===

The proof-theoretic semantics defines the meaning of a Datalog program to be the set of facts with corresponding &quot;proof trees&quot;. Intuitively, a proof tree shows how to derive a fact from the facts and rules of a program.

One might be interested in knowing whether or not a particular ground atom appears in the minimal Herbrand model of a Datalog program, perhaps without caring much about the rest of the model. A top-down reading of the proof trees described above suggests an algorithm for computing the results of such &quot;queries&quot;. This reading informs the SLD resolution algorithm, which forms the basis for the evaluation of Prolog.

== Evaluation ==

There are many different ways to evaluate a Datalog program, with different performance characteristics.

=== Bottom-up evaluation strategies ===

Bottom-up evaluation strategies start with the facts in the program and repeatedly apply the rules until either some goal or query is established, or until the complete minimal model of the program is produced.

==== Naïve evaluation ====

&quot;Naïve evaluation&quot; mirrors the fixpoint semantics for Datalog programs. Naïve evaluation uses a set of &quot;known facts&quot;, which is initialized to the facts in the program. It proceeds by repeatedly enumerating all ground instances of each rule in the program. If each atom in the body of the ground instance is in the set of known facts, then the head atom is added to the set of known facts. This process is repeated until a fixed point is reached, and no more facts may be deduced. Naïve evaluation produces the entire minimal model of the program.

==== Semi-naïve evaluation ====

Semi-naïve evaluation is a bottom-up evaluation strategy that can be asymptotically faster than naïve evaluation.

==== Performance considerations ====

Naïve and semi-naïve evaluation both evaluate recursive Datalog rules by repeatedly applying them to a set of known facts until a fixed point is reached. In each iteration, rules are only run for &quot;one step&quot;, i.e., non-recursively. As mentioned above, each non-recursive Datalog rule corresponds precisely to a conjunctive query. Therefore, many of the techniques from database theory used to speed up conjunctive queries are applicable to bottom-up evaluation of Datalog, such as

* Index selection
* Query optimization, especially join order
* Join algorithms
* Selection of data structures used to store relations; common choices include hash tables and B-trees, other possibilities include disjoint set data structures (for storing equivalence relations), bries (a variant of tries), binary decision diagrams, and even SMT formulas

Many such techniques are implemented in modern bottom-up Datalog engines such as Soufflé. Some Datalog engines integrate SQL databases directly.

Bottom-up evaluation of Datalog is also amenable to parallelization. Parallel Datalog engines are generally divided into two paradigms:

* In the shared-memory, multi-core setting, Datalog engines execute on a single node. Coordination between threads may be achieved using locking or lock-free data structures. The shared-memory setting may be further divided into single instruction, multiple data and multiple instruction, multiple data paradigms:
** Datalog engines that execute on graphics processing units fall into the SIMD paradigm.
** Datalog engines using OpenMP are instances of the MIMD paradigm.
* In the shared-nothing setting, Datalog engines execute on a cluster of nodes. Such engines generally operate by splitting relations into disjoint subsets based on a hash function, performing computations (joins) on each node, and then exchanging newly-generated tuples over the network. Examples include Datalog engines based on MPI, Hadoop, and Spark.

=== Top-down evaluation strategies ===

SLD resolution is sound and complete for Datalog programs.

=== Magic sets ===

Top-down evaluation strategies begin with a &quot;query&quot; or &quot;goal&quot;. Bottom-up evaluation strategies can answer queries by computing the entire minimal model and matching the query against it, but this can be inefficient if the answer only depends on a small subset of the entire model. The &quot;magic sets&quot; algorithm takes a Datalog program and a query, and produces a more efficient program that computes the same answer to the query while still using bottom-up evaluation. A variant of the magic sets algorithm has been shown to produce programs that, when evaluated using semi-naïve evaluation, are as efficient as top-down evaluation.

== Complexity ==

The decision problem formulation of Datalog evaluation is as follows: Given a Datalog program split into a set of facts (EDB) and a set of rules , and a ground atom , is in the minimal model of ? In this formulation, there are three variations of the computational complexity of evaluating Datalog programs:

* The is the complexity of the decision problem when and are inputs and is fixed.
* The is the complexity of the decision problem when and are inputs and is fixed.
* The is the complexity of the decision problem when , , and are inputs.

With respect to data complexity, the decision problem for Datalog is P-complete (See Theorem 4.4 in ). P-completeness for data complexity means that there exists a fixed datalog query for which evaluation is P-complete. The proof is based on &quot;Datalog metainterpreter&quot; for propositional logic programs.

With respect to program complexity, the decision problem is EXPTIME-complete. In particular, evaluating Datalog programs always terminates; Datalog is not Turing-complete.

Some extensions to Datalog do not preserve these complexity bounds. Extensions implemented in some Datalog engines, such as algebraic data types, can even make the resulting language Turing-complete.

== Extensions ==

Several extensions have been made to Datalog, e.g., to support negation, aggregate functions, inequalities, to allow object-oriented programming, or to allow disjunctions as heads of clauses. These extensions have significant impacts on the language&#x27;s semantics and on the implementation of a corresponding interpreter.

Datalog is a syntactic subset of Prolog, disjunctive Datalog, answer set programming, DatalogZ, and constraint logic programming. When evaluated as an answer set program, a Datalog program yields a single answer set, which is exactly its minimal model.

Many implementations of Datalog extend Datalog with additional features; see for more information.

=== Aggregation ===

Datalog can be extended to support aggregate functions.

Notable Datalog engines that implement aggregation include:
* LogicBlox
* Soufflé

=== Negation ===

Adding negation to Datalog complicates its semantics, leading to whole new languages and strategies for evaluation. For example, the language that results from adding negation with the stable model semantics is exactly answer set programming.

Stratified negation can be added to Datalog while retaining its model-theoretic and fixed-point semantics. Notable Datalog engines that implement stratified negation include:
* LogicBlox
* Soufflé

== Comparison to Prolog ==

Unlike in Prolog, statements of a Datalog program can be stated in any order. Datalog does not have Prolog&#x27;s cut operator. This makes Datalog a fully declarative language.

In contrast to Prolog, Datalog
* disallows complex terms as arguments of predicates, e.g., codice_5 is admissible but not codice_6,
* disallows negation,
* requires that every variable that appears in the head of a clause also appear in a literal in the body of the clause.

This article deals primarily with Datalog without negation (see also ). However, stratified negation is a common addition to Datalog; the following list contrasts Prolog with Datalog with stratified negation. Datalog with stratified negation

* also disallows complex terms as arguments of predicates,
* requires that every variable that appears in the head of a clause also appear in a positive (i.e., not negated) atom in the body of the clause,
* requires that every variable appearing in a negative literal in the body of a clause also appear in some positive literal in the body of the clause.

== Expressiveness ==

Datalog generalizes many other query languages. For instance, conjunctive queries and union of conjunctive queries can be expressed in Datalog. Datalog can also express regular path queries.

When we consider &quot;ordered databases&quot;, i.e., databases with an order relation on their active domain, then the Immerman–Vardi theorem implies that the expressive power of Datalog is precisely that of the class PTIME: a property can be expressed in Datalog if and only if it is computable in polynomial time.

The for Datalog asks, given a Datalog program, whether it is , i.e., the maximal recursion depth reached when evaluating the program on an input database can be bounded by some constant. In other words, this question asks whether the Datalog program could be rewritten as a nonrecursive Datalog program, or, equivalently, as a union of conjunctive queries. Solving the boundedness problem on arbitrary Datalog programs is undecidable, but it can be made decidable by restricting to some fragments of Datalog.

== Datalog engines ==

Systems that implement languages inspired by Datalog, whether compilers, interpreters, libraries, or embedded DSLs, are referred to as . Datalog engines often implement extensions of Datalog, extending it with additional data types, foreign function interfaces, or support for user-defined lattices. Such extensions may allow for writing non-terminating or otherwise ill-defined programs.

Here is a short list of systems that are either based on Datalog or provide a Datalog interpreter:

===Free software/open source===

===Non-free software===
* FoundationDB provides a free-of-charge database binding for pyDatalog, with a tutorial on its use.
* Leapsight Semantic Dataspace (LSD) is a distributed deductive database that offers high availability, fault tolerance, operational simplicity, and scalability. LSD uses Leaplog (a Datalog implementation) for querying and reasoning and was create by Leapsight.
* LogicBlox, a commercial implementation of Datalog used for web-based retail planning and insurance applications.
* Profium Sense is a native RDF compliant graph database written in Java. It provides Datalog evaluation support of user defined rules.
* .QL, a commercial object-oriented variant of Datalog created by Semmle for analyzing source code to detect security vulnerabilities.
* SecPAL a security policy language developed by Microsoft Research.
* Stardog is a graph database, implemented in Java. It provides support for RDF and all OWL 2 profiles providing extensive reasoning capabilities, including datalog evaluation.
* StrixDB: a commercial RDF graph store, SPARQL compliant with Lua API and Datalog inference capabilities. Could be used as httpd (Apache HTTP Server) module or standalone (although beta versions are under the Perl Artistic License 2.0).

== Uses and influence ==

Datalog is quite limited in its expressivity. It is not Turing-complete, and doesn&#x27;t include basic data types such as integers or strings. This parsimony is appealing from a theoretical standpoint, but it means Datalog &quot;per se&quot; is rarely used as a programming language or knowledge representation language. Most Datalog engines implement substantial extensions of Datalog. However, Datalog has a strong influence on such implementations, and many authors don&#x27;t bother to distinguish them from Datalog as presented in this article. Accordingly, the applications discussed in this section include applications of realistic implementations of Datalog-based languages.

Datalog has been applied to problems in data integration, information extraction, networking, security, cloud computing and machine learning. Google has developed an extension to Datalog for big data processing.

Datalog has seen application in static program analysis. The Soufflé dialect has been used to write pointer analyses for Java and a control-flow analysis for Scheme. Datalog has been integrated with SMT solvers to make it easier to write certain static analyses. The Flix dialect is also suited to writing static program analyses.

Some widely used database systems include ideas and algorithms developed for Datalog. For example, the standard includes recursive queries, and the Magic Sets algorithm (initially developed for the faster evaluation of Datalog queries) is implemented in IBM&#x27;s DB2.

== History ==

The origins of Datalog date back to the beginning of logic programming, but it became prominent as a separate area around 1977 when Hervé Gallaire and Jack Minker organized a workshop on logic and databases. David Maier is credited with coining the term Datalog.

<doc id="968360" wikidata="Q6477060" url="?curid=968360" title="Lake Nacimiento">
<text>Lake Nacimiento is an long lake on the Nacimiento River in northern San Luis Obispo County, California. The lake contains many arms including Snake Creek and Dip Creek, nearer the dam, and the central Las Tablas and Franklin Creeks. Due to the dragon-like shape created by the positions of these arms, it is sometimes referred to as Dragon Lake.

==Geography==
Lake Nacimiento has a low fish population due to the high levels of mercury present in the lake caused by runoff from the closed Klau and Buena Vista Mercury Mines, south of the lake.

Only a few fishermen manage to catch fish. Consumption of bass, crappies, carps, and catfish from the lake is dangerous, but blue gill and sucker fish may be eaten only once per week safely. The lake is unique among California reservoirs in that it contains, among other species, introduced white bass, which thrive in the lake and spawn in the river and inflowing creeks in spring. In fact, the world fly fishing record for a white bass was broken in 1981 at Lake Nacimiento. The fish was caught by Cory Wells, a member of Three Dog Night; the record would stand for over 27 years. Lake Nacimiento can also produce power from a turbine at the base of the dam.

According to the Salinas Californian newspaper, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors (Marc Del Piero, Barbara Shipnuck, Dusan Petrovic, Sam Karas, and Karin Strasser-Kaufman) appropriated the funds to build the turbine, which increased &quot;green energy&quot; supplies for Monterey County.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lake Nacimiento, based on levels of mercury found in fish caught from this water body.

==History==
The lake was designed for irrigation water and flood control as well as recreation. Nacimiento Dam, a earthfill dam, forms the lake. The dam was built by the Monterey County Water Authority which completed construction in 1956. The water authority uses the lake to recharge its groundwater. The lake is near the city of Paso Robles.

Lake Nacimiento has a capacity of . The lake can fill quickly in the winter from river surges resulting from downpours upstream in the Santa Lucia Range so the level is not usually allowed to capacity until May 1 of each year.

The lake was developed and paid for by Monterey County. San Luis Obispo County retained the rights to of water per year. In October 2007, construction started on a pipeline to bring water from the lake to Paso Robles, Templeton, Atascadero, and San Luis Obispo. The project went online in January 2011. The lake&#x27;s dam was shut down during 2014 due to damage that occurred to one of the turbines, and as a result the neighboring Lake San Antonio was emptied to critical levels to supply the Salinas Valley with groundwater.

Even though the lake is entirely inside San Luis Obispo County, the waters are patrolled by the Monterey County Parks Department under a joint powers agreement with San Luis Obispo County. The Monterey County Parks Department&#x27;s primary jurisdiction is the lake waters, up to the high-water mark and the resort area. The San Luis Obispo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has a boat at the lake for access to the backcountry around the lake and has been known to write tickets on the water. Lake Nacimiento is a haven for watersport enthusiasts. The lake provides ample room for waterskiing, wakeboarding, jetskiing, wakesurfing, and other water-related activities.

The lake is also the home of two residential housing developments, which lie on the shore: Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores. There are several smaller (10–40 house) private subdivisions on the southwest side of the lake. These houses were affected by the Chimney Fire in August 2016. Except for the resort area near the dam, most of the property around the lake is private. Overnight camping on the lake, outside of the resort, is not allowed; setting up or venturing on land above the high-water mark is considered trespassing.

<doc id="968377" wikidata="Q5380324" url="?curid=968377" title="Enterprise Investment Scheme">
<text>The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) is a series of UK tax reliefs launched in 1994 in succession to the Business Expansion Scheme. It is designed to encourage investments in small unquoted companies carrying on a qualifying trade in the United Kingdom.

By the end of the 2014–15 tax year, a cumulative total of £14.2 billion had been invested under the scheme into approximately 25,000 companies. In that year, in excess of £1.8 billion was invested under the EIS.

==Purpose==
Investment in companies that are not listed on a stock exchange often carries a high risk of loss of capital, and low market liquidity means that it may be difficult or time consuming to sell or realise the investment. The tax reliefs available under the EIS are intended to offer investors some incentive to counterweigh those risks.

===Provision of tax relief===

The EIS offers several different kinds of tax relief, available both to direct investors and investors through a managed EIS fund or portfolio service. They are conditional upon the company receiving investment being a qualifying company under the scheme. A brief summary of the tax benefits is as follows:

* 30% up front income tax relief, which can be carried back to the previous tax year. The maximum subscription is currently £1,000,000 per investor per year (this rises to £2,000,000 per year if the companies are deemed &#x27;knowledge intensive&#x27;), yielding a potential reduction in tax liability of £300,000 per annum (assuming the investor has sufficient income tax liability).
* Capital gains tax (CGT) deferral – an investor can defer capital gains realised on a different asset, where disposal of that asset was less than 12 months before the EIS investment or less than 36 months after it. This relief is limited to the amount being invested into the EIS and can be claimed by investors whose interest in the company does not exceed 30%. It is available to individuals and trustees. Where gains arise on the EIS investment, taper relief is available.
* No CGT to pay on any gains made when the investment is realised after three years (five years for investments made before 6 April 2000), provided the EIS initial income tax relief was given and not withdrawn on those shares.
* Tax relief from investment losses – if EIS shares are disposed of at any time at a loss, such loss can be set against the investor&#x27;s capital gains or income in the year of disposal, potentially limiting a total loss to 38.5% of an investor&#x27;s capital
* Shares do not form part of the estate for inheritance tax purposes, provided the investments have been held for at least two years at time of death and the company qualifies for business property relief (BPR).

==Qualifying companies and individuals==
The rules for qualifying are complicated; for example, the following are some of the qualifications that must be met:

===The company===
* The company must not have assets greater than £15 million
* The company may have no more than 250 full-time equivalent employees
* All capital employed must be actively engaged in the company within 24 months
* The company must not be in specific industries such as coal and steel production, farming, leasing, financial services and property development.
* Entry into the scheme is subject to a decision and audit made by an appointed tax officer
* The company must not be listed or have any intention of becoming listed at the time of the investment
*The company must not have already received in excess of £12 million total funding (or £5 million within any given year) from the following sources: EIS, SEIS, Venture capital trusts, social investment tax relief, or some forms of state aid.

===The individual===
* The investor may not have more than a 30% interest in the company
* No partner or associate of the investor (including spouse, relations, prior business contacts) may have other interests in the company
* The investor must not have any form of preferential shares
* The investor must not have any other form of controlling interest in the company
* The scheme must not be used for the purposes of avoiding tax

==Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme==
On 6 April 2012, the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) was launched, with the goal to &quot;stimulate entrepreneurship and kick start the economy.&quot;

<text>The Aero A.23 was a Czechoslovakian airliner of the 1920s. Aero Vodochody had produced the first Czech airliner, the A.10, four of which had served with ČSA, the national airline. The A.23, another biplane, was bigger, more powerful, and could carry more passengers.

==Design and development==

The Avia A.23 was a single bay biplane with its wings mounted without stagger. Both wings were almost rectangular, though the tips were slightly angled; both carried light dihedral. The upper wing was a little larger in both span and chord and was in three parts, with a short centre-section held over the fuselage on a low cabane. The lower wing was in two parts and mounted on the lower fuselage, braced to the upper wing with a pair of outward-leaning, parallel interplane struts made of profiled steel tubes. Only the upper wings carried ailerons. The wings were two-spar wooden structures and were fabric covered.

Its single engine was an uncowled, Walter-built Jupiter IV on a steel tube mounting and with a pair of long, airfoil-section fuel tanks placed on the upper wing near the ends of the centre-section. Behind its firewall, the fuselage, built from steel tubes, was rectangular in section and housed a passenger cabin long fitted with six permanent and two folding seats. Each passenger in the fixed places had a window in the plywood walls. There was engine access via a hatch in the front of the cabin and a toilet at the back. Doors over the wings gave access to the cabin. The A.23 was flown from an open, side-by-side cockpit in the upper fuselage aft of the cabin, with the captain on the left and the second pilot/radio operator on his right. A door below the right-hand seat gave access to the engine hatch via the cabin. The cockpit was normally accessed through a low, tetragonal, port-side door. Behind them was a baggage hold.

The A.23&#x27;s straight-edged tailplane, mounted on the upper fuselage and strut-braced from below, was adjustable in flight and carried separate rounded, balanced elevators. Its fin was small, with a large, rounded, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel and worked in a gap between the elevators. All components were steel-framed and fabric-covered.

Its fixed, conventional undercarriage originally had mainwheels on a single axle, mounted on V-struts from the lower fuselage with wire cross-bracing. The rear components of the V-struts had rubber disc shock absorbers. By May 1928 the axle had gone and the landing gear was made more robust with a transverse X-strut. A castoring steel tailskid had its rubber shock absorber.

==Operational history==

The first A.23 flew in 1926. From 1928, seven A.23s flew ČSA&#x27;s Prague-Marienbad (Mariánské Lázně) and Prague-Uzhhorod; some remained in service until 1936.

<text>The is a series of full-size luxury sedans that have served as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota, since 1989. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive. In the fourth generation, Lexus offered all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option, and only one length was offered.

As the first model developed by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as , was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year), the fourth generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.

Development of the LS began in 1983 as the F1 project, the code name for a secret flagship sedan. At the time, Toyota&#x27;s two existing flagship models were the Crown and Century models – both of which catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process at a cost of over US$1 billion and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.

Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been manufactured in the Japanese city of Tahara, Aichi. The name &quot;LS&quot; stands for &quot;Luxury Sedan&quot;, although some Lexus importers have preferred to define it as &quot;Luxury Saloon&quot;. The name &quot;Celsior&quot; is taken from Latin word &quot;celsus&quot;, meaning &quot;lofty&quot; or &quot;elevated&quot;.

== First generation (XF10; 1989) ==

=== 1989–1992 ===
In August 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project (&quot;Flagship&quot; and &quot;No. 1&quot; vehicle; alternatively called the &quot;Circle-F&quot; project), as a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world-class luxury sedan for international markets. The F1 development effort did not have a specific budget or time constraints, and the resulting vehicle did not use existing Toyota platforms or parts. Instead, chief engineer Ichiro Suzuki sought to develop an all-new design, aiming to surpass rival American and European flagship sedans in specific target areas, including aerodynamics, cabin quietness, overall top speed, and fuel efficiency. During development, the 60 designers with 1,400 engineers in 24 teams, 2,300 technicians and over 200 support workers built approximately 450 flagship prototypes and 900 engine prototypes. The teams logged of testing on locations ranging from winter Europe roadways to deserts in Arizona, Australia, or Saudi Arabia, to American highways and wilderness.

In May 1985, designers started work on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung bonnet and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (&quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot; 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather for two years before settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in February 1987, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 20 February 1987 and 13 May 1987.

In January 1989, the LS 400 made its debut as a 1990 model at the North American International Auto Show, in Detroit, Michigan. Production began on 15 May 1989, with the first shipments leaving Japanese ports in late June 1989. The first cars were available in August 1989, and U.S. sales officially began on 1 September 1989, followed by limited exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom starting in 1990. Sales in certain, lesser markets only started in late 1991, nearly three years after the car&#x27;s introduction, as Lexus chose to focus on the North American and home markets. Production was limited to about 50,000 cars per year in order to maintain desired quality standards; 40,000 of these were earmarked for the United States, 8,000 for Japan, and only about 2,000 examples for the rest of the world.

The LS 400&#x27;s new 4.0-litre &quot;1UZ-FE&quot; 32-valve V8 engine, capable of and of torque, was linked to a new four-speed automatic transmission with ECT-i electronically controlled shifts, super-flow torque converter and rear differential. The chassis used an independent, high-mount upper arm double-wishbone suspension setup with twin tube shock absorbers, and a passive air suspension system was optional. The LS 400&#x27;s 0– time was 8.5 seconds, and its top speed was . Compared to its rivals, namely the BMW 735i (E32) and Mercedes-Benz 420 SE (W126), the LS 400 had a quieter cabin, with 58 dB at ; a higher top speed; a lower drag coefficient and curb weight; and it avoided the U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax. In European tests, the noise level at was measured at 74 dBA, equal to a BMW 735i at . At its introduction in 1989, the Celsior won the Car of the Year Japan award.

The LS 400 was among the first luxury sedans to feature an automatic tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver&#x27;s seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.

In Japan, the launch of Lexus was complicated by Toyota&#x27;s existing four domestic dealership networks at the time of its introduction. The Toyota Crown and Toyota Century were exclusive to &quot;Toyota Store&quot; locations. During the LS 400&#x27;s development, local dealers&#x27; requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown, and a right-hand-drive Toyota Celsior-badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400&#x27;s U.S. debut, and introduced on 9 October 1989 and only available at &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations. The Celsior, named after the Latin word for &quot;supreme,&quot; was largely identical to the LS. Models came in either basic &quot;A,&quot; a &quot;B&quot; model with uprated suspension, or fully equipped &quot;C&quot; trim specifications. The Crown and the Crown Majesta, which appeared later in 1991, were only available at &quot;Toyota Store&quot; locations which carried Japan-only Toyota luxury models, like the Century. Ownership costs for Japanese drivers were and are expensive due to Japanese Government dimension regulations and annual road tax obligations. Owning a Celsior in Japan is also considered extravagant due to the fact urban two-way streets are usually zoned at or less. The Celsior introduced two world firsts: high-performance twin-tube shock absorbers and an air suspension combined with an upgraded version of Toyota&#x27;s semi-active Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension, called Piezo TEMS.

Adding incentive for early U.S. sales was a base price of US$35,000 ($ in dollars ), which undercut competitors by thousands of dollars and brought accusations of selling below cost from rival BMW. Being a flagship luxury sedan in the full-size segment, the relatively low starting MSRP was actually targeted to be at $25,000 during initial stages of development. However, the depreciation of the Yen vs. the Dollar resulted in a climb to $35,000. Lexus division general manager Dave Illingworth admitted in an interview with Automotive News that many in product planning were concerned about the price hike and the potential effect it could have on sales success. Part of the concern was due to the fact that the Lexus nameplate lacked the heritage and brand recognition of German rivals such as Mercedes-Benz. Similarly, luxury cars competing in a class slightly below that of the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class averaged in the $25000 range. However, once the LS400 was released, sales figures were very positive, as the vehicle was nearly universally praised for its high standards and levels of specification. 

In December 1989, shortly after the LS 400&#x27;s launch, Lexus ordered a voluntary recall of the 8,000 vehicles sold so far, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. All vehicles were serviced within 20 days, and the incident helped establish Lexus&#x27; customer service reputation. By 1990, U.S. sales of the LS 400 had surpassed those of competing Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar models. Production of the first-generation LS 400 totaled over 165,000 units. The LS 400 made &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; 2007 list of recommended vehicles that regularly last or more, with proper maintenance.

=== 1992–1994 ===
Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model, the refreshed LS 400 (designed through 1991) was introduced with more than 50 changes, largely in response to customer and dealer requests. The vehicle received larger disc brakes, wheels, and tires, and adjustments were made to the suspension and power steering systems to improve handling. Stylistic changes included additional body side moldings and a revised grille, along with a greater selection of colours. For the interior, a standard passenger front airbag (making this vehicle the first Toyota-built series production car available with passenger front airbag), external temperature gauge, digital odometer, seat belt pretensioners, and chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerant were added. In 1992, the Celsior introduced the world&#x27;s first GPS navigation system with voice instructions, supplied by Aisin. By 1994, the LS 400&#x27;s U.S. base price exceeded , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle&#x27;s introduction. Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price.

A considerable point is that in the years after the LS400/Celsior went out of production in 1994, the car has continued to influence the entire world of manufacturing. The Toyota Production System largely infiltrated American manufacturing around the time MIT&#x27;s IMVP academic group coined lean manufacturing, as MBA John Krafcik used his Lexus-influenced knowledge learned to model Genesis, as Hyundai-Kia themselves used TPS to become benchmarks in modern day. 

Within Toyota&#x27;s own development efforts, the LS400&#x27;s innovative advancements spread down through the company line-up. Through leveraging sister platforms, Toyota also used the economic conditions of currency differentials to trickle down to the high standards set by the LS400. This type of reputation-setting effort was monumental and not very profitable for Toyota, but they saw it as a way to gain a sterling reputation for quality and reliability. Afterwards Toyota planners would look for ways to reduce costs in the lower models (in their next generations). For example, the MX83 Toyota Cressida was the first glimpse at the LS400 and SXV10 Camry to come following in 1992. The MX83 was a clear step up from the 2nd generation V20 Camry. Additionally, Toyota saw it as an educational experience of refinement for engineering researchers in the United States market. It was large (notably more so than V20 Camry), and was designed to be a proper mid-size American car. Toyota used the MX83 as a hollow shell to build the LS400 interior concept until that cabin was transferred to a larger, more bubble-type body shell. Extensive audio testing with Nakamichi systems was done by using LS400 prototype interiors in Cressida bodies.

As the LS400 was then refined, Toyota went through extraordinary efforts to refine the standards of the MX83 even slightly further, as fit and finish became the best in the industry. This level of fit and finish trickled down to the 1992 XV10 Toyota Camry/Lexus ES300 shared platform. The 1992 Camry shocked the industry as it was only a non-luxury midsize family sedan (in base non-XLE trims, at least). However, the complex flushed window stamping and flowing one-piece roof were modeled from new processes learned by Toyota making the LS400, as were the triple sealing framed doors. To accomplish this, the doors use indented rubber gaskets to seal the door in a fashion similar to that used by Tupperware food containers. There were no other mid-size sedans built to such fit and finish standards, except the high-end German BMW 5-series and Mercedes-Benz E-class cars. This point was made by Chris Goffey during BBC&#x27;s 1991 Motorfair Top Gear coverage.

Principles such as Heijunka boards, andon pull cords, and Gemba walking have become embedded in aerospace engineering production at Boeing and its subsidiaries. The Federal Aviation Administration lists the FV2400-2TC (a 1UZ-FE derivative) as aviation certified. Intel modeled the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; on what was learned from Toyota&#x27;s LS 400 quality standards.

== Second generation (XF20; 1994) ==


=== 1994–1997 ===

The second-generation Lexus LS 400 (UCF20) debuted in November 1994 (for the 1995 model year) with a longer wheelbase and similar specifications as the original model. The public unveiling of the vehicle occurred in a gala ceremony held at the San Francisco Opera House in California. The sedan was equipped with an updated 4.0-litre &quot;1UZ-FE&quot; V8 engine, producing and of torque. Internally, over 90% of the redesigned LS 400&#x27;s composition was new or redesigned, with increased sound insulation, a strengthened body structure, suspension updates (first LS/Celsior with Skyhook adaptive computerized air suspension), and improved brakes. The redesigned model was lighter than its predecessor and achieved slightly better fuel economy. The 0– time improved to 7.5 seconds.

Development of the second-generation LS 400 began after worldwide launch of the first generation under program code 250T. Given the first-generation model&#x27;s successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400&#x27;s attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto&#x27;s primary goals (he stated that &quot;a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation&quot;). Externally, the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional of rear-seat legroom. However, as the overall length remained the same, boot capacity was slightly reduced. The more aerodynamic body (&quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot; 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body, before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400. Upon final approval in 1992, an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a beveled grille. More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and forward visibility was improved. Production development lasted from 1991 until conclusion in the second quarter of 1994. Design patents were filed at the Japan Patent Office on October 14, 1992 under registration number 732548, using a prototype.

The redesigned LS 400 interior received upgraded features, varying from dual-zone climate controls to rear cupholders. A newly patented seat cushion design, similar to the car&#x27;s suspension, used lightweight internal coil springs and stabilizer bars to improve comfort. One of the first in-dash CD changers was offered as an option. Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones, three-point seat belts at all positions, and a new collapsible steering column. In Japan, the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and top-spec &quot;C&quot; configurations as before, along with an additional selection of exterior colours. Several optional features, such as a compact disc-based Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system and reclining rear seats, were available only in Japan.

At its U.S. debut, the redesigned LS 400 retained a pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market, launching with a base price of US$51,000. However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers. To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, the most expensive marketing effort since the launch of the division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the price of a fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were lower than the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.

Production of the UCF20 ran from October 1994 to July 1997. For 1997, a limited &quot;Coach Edition&quot; LS 400 was produced in partnership with American leather manufacturer Coach Inc. The edition featured Coach leather seats; embroidered emblems on the exterior, floormats, and armrest; special colours and added trim; and a Coach cabin bag. Production was limited to a yearly run of 2,500 units.

=== 1997–2000 ===
Designed through early 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was introduced for the 1998 model year. Changes were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to , with variable valve timing (VVT-i), and an added of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass.

In August 1997, the first production laser adaptive cruise control on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the Celsior version (Japan only). It controlled speed only through throttle control and downshifting, but did not apply the brakes. A CD-ROM-based GPS automotive navigation system became an option in the U.S. Added safety features included front side airbags, vehicle stability control and in 2000, brake assist. Low beam HID headlamps were introduced as well. The headlights were also equipped with a programmable delay feature for proximity illumination. In February 2000, the limited &quot;Platinum Series&quot; LS 400 was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in partnership with American Express. The edition featured most luxury options as standard, along with separate exterior colours, wheels, badging, and two years&#x27; no-fee use of an American Express Platinum Card.

== Third generation (XF30; 2000) ==


=== 2000–2003 ===
The third-generation Lexus LS 430 (UCF30) debuted at the North American International Auto Show in January 2000 as a 2001 model, introducing a new body design with a host of new interior and technological features. It was the first US market Lexus with adaptive cruise control (called Dynamic Laser Cruise Control). It employed a lidar sensor and (unlike the laser ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior) was able to activate brakes for deceleration. The sedan was equipped with a new 4.3-litre &quot;3UZ-FE&quot; engine generating and of torque. The LS 430 was one of the first gasoline V8 vehicles to be certified as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV). The standard suspension had been completely redesigned, with a double-wishbone setup at all four wheels; a tuned suspension was offered for the first time. A new torque-activated electronic control unit made throttle adjustments based on vehicle speed, engine revolutions per minute, and pedal position. The LS 430 sported a 0– acceleration time of 6.7 seconds. Sales began in October 2000 in the United States.

Heading into the planning of the LS 430, division executives concluded that the previous LS redesign had been too restrained in its approach. The LS 430 development team, led by chief engineer Yasushi Tanaka, accordingly opted for a more thorough exterior, interior, and technological redevelopment. The development of the LS 430 took four years. Selected from 16 different concept designs, the resulting vehicle of December 1997—when the final design (by Akihiro Nagaya) was approved—saw the sedan&#x27;s dimensions increase in terms of wheelbase and height. The exterior featured a larger grille with rounded edges, quarter windows on the rear doors, and rounded trapezoidal headlamps. The body was also more aerodynamic than previous LS sedans (&quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot; 0.26; 0.25 with air suspension), and was the product of wind tunnel testing at facilities used for Shinkansen bullet train development. A wheelbase stretch resulted in more interior volume and allowed the engine to be positioned further aft for better balance. Boot space was increased by one-third due to repositioning of the fuel tank.

Compared to previous generations, the LS 430 featured a greater number of model configurations and options. While sharing the same body style, variants were differentiated by chassis configuration and onboard equipment. Models with the tuned sport suspension, sold as the &quot;Touring&quot; package in the United States, featured larger, high-speed brakes. These brakes were also standard on European market models. Fully optioned models with height adjustable air suspension, tuned for a combination of soft ride and responsive handling, were sold in the United States as the &quot;Ultra Luxury&quot; edition.

The LS 430 interior featured walnut wood trim on the dashboard and upper doors, along with semi-aniline leather and oscillating air conditioning vents. A liquid crystal display with touchscreen on the upper center console served as interface. The system was the first LS with voice controlled navigation and the first luxury sedan to transition to DVD-based maps. Lexus also introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In its highest trim specification, the LS 430 included Lexus Link telematics, power door and boot closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 had been previously available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.

At the high end, the LS 430&#x27;s pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became increasingly able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles. Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the previous generation, and production exceeded 140,000 units. The LS 430 was produced until July 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style. In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models.

In every year of production, the LS 430 was the most reliable luxury sedan in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey (with the early and late models of this series the best performing), and the highest recorded scorer in the history of J.D. Power&#x27;s Vehicle Dependability Survey. Thatcham ratings data via the UK Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre listed the theft-prevention capabilities of the LS 430 as a maximum 5 stars, with the LS 430 being the first automobile to achieve the maximum theft-deterrence rating in 2001.

=== 2003–2006 ===
The facelifted LS 430 was revealed at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003. The first radar (instead of previous lidar) sensor on a Lexus sedan allowed the new Dynamic RADAR Cruise Control to work in any weather conditions. The millimetre-wave radar technology also enabled the first Pre-Collision System (PCS) on a Lexus sedan (with partial autonomous braking only on the Japanese market Toyota Celsior version). A &quot;low-speed tracking mode&quot; was added in 2004. The low-speed tracking mode was a second mode that would warn the driver if the car ahead stopped and provide braking; it could stop the car but then deactivated.

The facelifted LS introduced a new six-speed automatic transmission and revised styling. The powerplant remained the same as before. Exterior changes included restyled front and rear fascias, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels. It debuted the first Lexus high-intensity discharge headlights for the high beam (Bi-Xenon), and also the first AFS adaptive curve headlights, which swiveled the projector headlamps in the direction of vehicle turns.

The interior received knee airbags, lighted rear-seat vanity mirrors, and new trim selections, including bird&#x27;s eye maple wood. New options included an updated navigation system, Bluetooth and a backup camera. A driver-programmable electronic key feature allowed the vehicle to detect the key fob in the owner&#x27;s pocket and unlock the doors by touch.

== Fourth generation (XF40; 2006) ==


Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show for the 2007 model year, the fourth-generation Lexus LS became the first Lexus model to be produced in both standard and long-wheelbase versions. Using an all-new platform, the LS 460 (USF40) uses the standard wheelbase, while the LS 460 L (USF41) features a stretched wheelbase. A hybrid version, LS 600h L (UVF46), was previewed at the New York International Auto Show in April 2006. At its introduction in 2006, it won the Car of the Year Japan award for the second time.

The new LS came equipped with a new 4.6-litre &quot;1UR-FSE&quot; V8 producing and of torque, coupled to the first production eight-speed automatic transmission. The development of the LS 460 and its variants, led by chief engineer Moritaka Yoshida, began as Lexus was shifting its design strategy towards a more diversified product lineup, with new-vehicle launches largely focused on global markets. Externally, the Lexus LS received the styling cues of Lexus&#x27; new design direction, called L-finesse. First shown on the LF-Sh concept, the vehicle gained body forms running the length of the car, wheel arches, arrow-shaped chrome trim, a lower-set grille, and crystalline adaptive headlamps.

After debuting a hybrid powertrain with the 2005 LF-Sh concept, Lexus began sales of the LS 600h L (UVF46), the first production V8-powered full-hybrid vehicle, in May 2007 for the 2008 model year. All-wheel drive versions of the non-hybrid LS 460 (USF45) and LS 460 L (USF46) models premiered at the Moscow International Automobile Salon. Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, the revised LS 460 and LS 460 L included restyled front and rear fascias, side mirror turn signals, and new wheel designs. A more substantial facelift was first shown in July 2012, incorporating the new Lexus corporate fascia, comprising the &quot;spindle&quot; grill and consequently sees the fitment of a redesigned bonnet, reshaped front wings and headlamps, and a new bumper. The tail-lamps, boot lid, and rear bumper were also updated.

== Fifth generation (XF50; 2017) ==

=== 2017–2020 ===
Developed under the 200B program, the fifth-generation LS made its debut at the January 2017 North American International Auto Show. This model was previewed by the LF-FC concept that was first shown at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. It is the second Lexus model to be built on GA-L platform, after the LC grand tourer. Dubbed as &quot;LS 500&quot; (VXFA50/55), it is the first LS to be powered by a V6 engine. The 3.4-litre twin-turbo &quot;V35A-FTS&quot; V6 produces and of torque. The wheelbase is longer than the previous long-wheelbase model, the LS 460L. The height is also lower, with the bonnet and boot measuring lower, respectively.

In a couple of Lexus firsts, the fifth-generation LS is the first Lexus sedan to feature a six-sided window design, while the flush-surface windows integrate smoothly with the pillars. In the company&#x27;s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient headroom with a low roofline, the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type panoramic moonroof instead of the conventional, internally retracting item.

The fifth-generation LS also features 3D-surround Mark Levinson audio with in-ceiling array speakers. The next-generation, remote touch infotainment interface called Lexus Enform, is said to be designed to mimic smartphone operation, with support for handwritten input. Alongside the 12.3 inch navigation display, the fifth-generation LS can be specified with an optional 24 inch, colour HUD for the driver&#x27;s view. The LS 500h (GVF50/55) uses the Multi Stage Hybrid System that debuted in the LC 500h. Like the LC 500h, it uses a lithium-ion battery rather than the nickel-metal hydride battery used in the previous LS 600h. Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 is fitted as standard to the LS.

At the 2017 Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau International Auto Show, Lexus unveiled the Chinese-market LS 350 (GSF50), which uses a naturally aspirated &quot;2GR-FKS&quot; V6 engine from the GS 350, producing and of torque. Hong Kong models uses an &quot;8GR-FKS&quot; engine producing and of torque.

=== 2020–present ===
The fifth-generation LS received a facelift in 2020 for the 2021 model year. Notable improvements have been made in several areas of the vehicle. The suspension received enhancements that improves ride quality, handling and ingress/egress of the vehicle. The LS 500&#x27;s 3.4-litre V6 engine has an updated piston design aimed to lower emissions and reduce NVH when the engine is cold while the hybrid variant received several hardware and software upgrades improving the acceleration of the vehicle. The interior of the LS has been further refined with revised seats, touch points, higher-resolution rearview mirror and updated leather options. The facelifted LS uses a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system instead of the mouse-based implementation found in prior model years. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa integration are standard equipment. All grades of the 2021 LS are equipped with Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 as standard and received a number of updates such as Lane Change Assist and Active Steering Assist. Exterior updates include a revised front fascia, radiator intake, headlights, taillights and updated colour options.

In Europe, the updated LS 500h was launched a few months later and the LS 500 was dropped. An update launched on 8 April 2021 includes the Advanced Drive including driver monitor camera and remote software updates. It is able to keep the vehicle in its lane, maintain the distance from other vehicles, navigate a lane split, change lanes, and overtake other vehicles. It also has Advanced Park, an advanced parking assistance system.

In 2025, the LS was discontinued in the UK due to poor sales and regulation/legislation issues. , it continues to be sold in other parts of the world.

== Manufacturing ==

The Lexus LS has been consistently produced on dedicated Lexus assembly lines at Toyota&#x27;s flagship Tahara factory, located in the city of Tahara, in Aichi Prefecture, Chūbu region, southwest of Nagoya, since 1989. Tahara remains the sole production site, having inaugurated its new line number four specifically for assembly of the original LS 400.

For the Lexus LS, the Tahara plant developed new molds and enhanced assembly techniques and instituted measures aimed at increasing the precision of the sedan&#x27;s fit and finish. The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding, allowing for seamless steel welds. A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly. Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring-loaded for a tighter fit. On the LS 400, engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from , with measurements made within ; on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold, to . When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.

Despite Tahara&#x27;s large-scale automation, Lexus LS production also involves specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle&#x27;s V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation. With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced. The production standards used on the Lexus LS were eventually adopted by the manufacturer for other vehicles; in 2007, the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.

== Industrial significance ==
The Lexus LS marked a successful entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, after the first Honda (Acura) Legend, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for the launch of the 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz&#x27;s chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400&#x27;s precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430&#x27;s interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quietness.

According to industry observers, the introduction of the Lexus LS reshaped Toyota&#x27;s image from that of an &quot;econobox&quot; manufacturer to the builder of an automotive standard bearer. This stood in contrast to the predictions of early detractors, including rival manufacturers who dismissed Toyota as incapable of producing a competitive luxury vehicle. Japanese contemporaries from the luxury divisions of Honda (Acura) and Nissan (Infiniti) had differing degrees of success. Honda had entered into a joint venture with Britain&#x27;s Austin Rover Group in November 1981, launching Project XX with an Austin Rover–Honda XX letter of intent to replace the Rover SD1 with the Rover 800 and to provide a midsize, V6-powered luxury sedan for Honda, called the Honda Legend. Marketed as the Acura Legend in the U.S., the sedan initially sold well, but subsequent models (renamed Acura RL) performed below sales expectations. Launched by Nissan in December 1989, the V8-powered Infiniti Q45 closely rivaled the LS 400 in specifications and price, but was unsuccessful in sales (attributed to unconventional styling and marketing), leading to its discontinuation in 2006. The success of the Lexus LS became a test case for mainstream manufacturers targeting upscale segments. By investing in a separate marque, Toyota was able to avoid the stigma attached to a mass-market brand&#x27;s charging premium prices. The effect of the LS 400 on the automotive industry led &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine to add the sedan to its &quot;24 Most Important Vehicles of the 20th Century&quot; list in 1996.

== Sales and production ==
In its largest market, the U.S., the Lexus LS was the top-selling flagship luxury sedan for 15 of the first 17 years following its debut. In Japan, the next-largest market for the Lexus LS, the introduction of the 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders, and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class. Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus&#x27; expanded global launch in 2007, sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand&#x27;s traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales, next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class&#x27; 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide, and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market. In 2008, U.S. sales fell 42% amidst the late-2000s recession, mirroring the overall decline of the luxury car market.

The Lexus LS has not sold as well in Europe, where Lexus suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed dealership network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.

== Awards ==
Notable examples of awards received by the Lexus LS include (2007) World Car of the Year, International Car of the Year, (1991) Canadian Car of the Year, &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year, and &quot;Top Gear&quot; Limousine of the Year. The Lexus LS has been the highest-rated luxury car in &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;, &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, &quot;Fleet World&quot;, and &quot;MotorWeek&quot;. In J.D. Power&#x27;s long-term Vehicle Dependability Study, the Lexus LS has been the most reliable car for fifteen consecutive years, the most for any manufacturer, and &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has ranked the sedan as the most reliable vehicle tested. Safety awards include &quot;Auto Bild&quot;″s 2007 Innovation Prize for the LS 460 pre-collision system, consecutive first place rankings in the &quot;What Car?&quot; Security Supertest, and &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best in Safety for Cars $40,000 and Over&quot;. Technical honors range from Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines, to Edmunds.com&#x27;s &quot;Best Sound System in Cars Over $30,000&quot;.

In U.S. consumer publications, Lexus&#x27; flagship model is recognized as one of the most reliable vehicles ever built, having held the top ranking in J.D. Power and Associates&#x27; U.S. Vehicle Dependability Survey for fifteen consecutive years (1994–2009), again in 2012, third place in 2013, and top again in 2014. A 1996 Lexus LS400 owned by an automotive journalist has surpassed a million miles on what is believed to be its original engine.

<text>The Aero A-24 (also referred to as the A.24) was a twin-engined biplane bomber aircraft of the 1920s. Flight tests showed it to be severely underpowered, making it useless as a combat aircraft. Only a single prototype was built.

Aero proposed a variant designated the A-27 that was to have overcome the A-24&#x27;s shortcomings by re-engining the design with Bristol Jupiters, but the Czech Air Force was not interested in pursuing this option, and all development ceased.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 (company designation: JT3C) is an axial-flow turbojet engine developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney in the early 1950s. The J57 (first run January 1950) was the first 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust class engine in the United States. It is a two spool engine.

The J57/JT3C was developed into the J52 turbojet, the J75/JT4A turbojet, the JT3D/TF33 turbofan, and the XT57 turboprop (of which only one was built). The J57 and JT3C saw extensive use on fighter jets, jetliners, and bombers for many decades.

==Design and development==
The J57 was a development of the Pratt &amp; Whitney XT45 (PT4) turboprop engine that was originally intended for the Boeing XB-52. As the B-52 power requirements grew, the design evolved into a turbojet, the JT3.

Pratt &amp; Whitney designed the J57 to have a relatively high overall pressure ratio to help improve both thrust-specific fuel consumption and specific thrust, but it was known that throttling a single high-pressure-ratio compressor would cause stability problems. As Sir Stanley Hooker explains in his autobiography, the outlet area of a compressor is significantly smaller than that of its inlet, which is fine when operating at the design pressure ratio, but during starting and at low throttle settings the compressor pressure ratio is low so ideally the outlet area should be much larger than its design value. Put crudely the air taken in at the front cannot get out the back, which causes the blades at the front of the compressor to stall and vibrate. The compressor surges, which normally means the airflow reverses direction, causing a sharp drop in thrust.

By the late 1940s, three potential solutions to the stability problem had been identified:

1) bleeding any excess compressed air at part speed overboard through interstage blow-off valves

2) incorporating variable geometry in the first few stages of the compressor

3) splitting the compressor into two units, one of which supercharges the other, with both units being mounted on separate shafts and driven by their own turbine

GE adopted the second option with their General Electric J79, while Pratt &amp; Whitney adopted the two-spool arrangement with their J57.

P&amp;W realized that if they could develop a modest pressure ratio (&lt; 4.5:1) axial compressor to handle adequately at any throttle setting including starting and acceleration, they could put two such compressors in series to achieve a higher overall pressure ratio.

In a two-spool arrangement, the first compressor, usually called Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), is driven by the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), and supercharges another unit known as the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) itself driven by the High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During starting the HP spool starts to rotate first, while the LP spool is stationary. As the HP spool accelerates and the fuel:air mixture in the combustor lights up, at some point there is sufficient energy in the turbine gas stream to start to rotate the LP spool, which accelerates, albeit more sluggishly. Eventually, at full throttle, both spools will rotate at their design speeds. Because the exit temperature of the HPC is obviously higher than that of the LPC, a similar blade tip Mach number for both units is achieved by making the design HP shaft speed significantly higher than that of the LP shaft. Any reductions in compressor diameter going towards the combustor exaggerates the difference.

In the same timeframe as the J57, the Bristol Aeroplane Company Engine Division in the UK also adopted the two-spool arrangement into their Olympus turbojet engine series, which went on to propel the Avro Vulcan bomber and later the Concorde. Within a few months, both P&amp;W and Bristol had had a first run of their prototypes. Both demonstrated superb handling.

Today, most civil and military turbofans have a two spool configuration, a notable exception being the Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan series which has three spools.
Incidentally, most modern civil turbofans use all three of the above options to handle the extremely high overall pressure ratios employed today (50:1 typically).

During the 1950s the J57 was an extremely popular engine, with numerous military applications. Production figures were in the thousands, which led to a very reliable engine. Consequently, it was only natural for Boeing to choose the J57 civil variant, the JT3C, for their 707 jetliner. Douglas did likewise with their DC-8. Pressure to reduce jet noise and specific fuel consumption later resulted in P&amp;W using an innovative modification to convert the JT3C turbojet into the JT3D two spool turbofan, initially for civil purposes, but also for military applications like the Boeing B-52H. The prestigious Collier Trophy for 1952 was awarded to Leonard S. Hobbs, chief engineer of United Aircraft Corporation, for &quot;designing and producing the P&amp;W J57 turbojet engine&quot;. The engine was produced from 1951 to 1965 with a total of 21,170 built.

Many J57 models shipped since 1954 contained 7-15% of titanium, by dry weight. Commercially pure titanium was used in the inlet case and low-pressure compressor case, whereas the low-pressure rotor assembly was made up of 6Al-4V titanium alloy blades, discs and disc spacers. 
Titanium alloys used in the J57 in the mid-50s suffered hydrogen embrittlement until the problem was understood.

On May 25, 1953, a J57-powered YF-100A exceeded Mach 1 on its first flight.

<text>James Harold Kirkup (23 April 1918 – 10 May 2009) was an English poet, translator and travel writer. He wrote more than 45 books, including autobiographies, novels and plays. He wrote under many pen-names including James Falconer, Aditya Jha, Jun Honda, Andrew James, Taeko Kawai, Felix Liston, Edward Raeburn, and Ivy B. Summerforest. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.

==Early life ==
James Kirkup was brought up in South Shields, England, and was educated at Westoe Secondary School, and then at King&#x27;s College, Durham University. During the Second World War, he was a conscientious objector, and worked for the Forestry Commission, on the land in the Yorkshire Dales and at the Lansbury Gate Farm, Clavering, Essex. He taught at The Downs School in Colwall, Malvern, where W. H. Auden had earlier been a master. Kirkup wrote his first book of poetry there; this was &quot;The Drowned Sailor&quot;, which was published in 1947. From 1950 to 1952, he was the first Gregory Poetry Fellow at Leeds University, making him the first resident university poet in the United Kingdom.

He moved south with his partner to Gloucestershire in 1952, and became a visiting poet at Bath Academy of Art for the next three years. Moving on from Bath, Kirkup taught in a London grammar school before leaving England in 1956 to live and work in continental Europe, the Americas and the Far East. In Japan, he found acceptance and appreciation of his work, and he settled there for 30 years, lecturing in English literature at several universities.

==Blasphemy case==
Kirkup came to public attention in 1977, after the newspaper &quot;Gay News&quot; published his poem &quot;The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name&quot;, in which a Roman centurion describes his lust for and attraction to the crucified Jesus. In the &quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot; case, Mary Whitehouse, then Secretary of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, successfully prosecuted the editor of the newspaper, Dennis Lemon, for blasphemous libel under the Blasphemy Act 1697.

==Poetry==
After the writing of simple verses and rhymes from the age of six, and the publication of &quot;The Drowned Sailor&quot; in 1947, Kirkup&#x27;s published works encompassed several dozen collections of poetry, six volumes of autobiography, more than a hundred monographs of original work and translations and thousands of shorter pieces in journals and periodicals. His skilled writing of &quot;haiku&quot; and &quot;tanka&quot; is acknowledged internationally. Many of his poems recall his childhood days in the north-east, and are featured in such publications as &quot;The Sense of the Visit&quot;, &quot;To the Ancestral North&quot;, &quot;Throwback&quot;, and &quot;Shields Sketches&quot;.

In 1995, James Hogg and Wolfgang Görtschacher (University of Salzburg Press / Poetry Salzburg) received a letter from Andorra signed by Kirkup, who had just returned from Japan. Kirkup suggested the republication of some of his early books that had been out of print for quite a while. At the same time he wanted to offer new manuscripts that would establish the Salzburg imprint as his principal publisher. What started in 1995 with the collection &quot;Strange Attractors&quot; and &quot;A Certain State of Mind&quot; – the latter an anthology of classic, modern and contemporary Japanese haiku – ended after more than a dozen publications with the epic poem &quot;Pikadon&quot; in 1997.

Kirkup&#x27;s home town of South Shields now holds a growing collection of his works in the Central Library, and artefacts from his time in Japan are housed in the nearby Museum. His last volume of poetry was published during the summer of 2008 by Red Squirrel Press, and was launched at Central Library in South Shields.

Kirkup held the Atlantic Award for Literature from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1950; he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1962; he won the Japan P.E.N. Club Prize for Poetry in 1965; and was awarded the Scott Moncrieff Prize for Translation in 1992. In the mid-1990s he won the Japanese Festival Foundation Prize for &quot;A Book of Tanka&quot;.

He died in Andorra on 10 May 2009, aged 91.

==Legacy==
Kirkup&#x27;s papers are held at Yale and South Shields.

New Zealand composer Douglas Mews set two of Kirkup&#x27;s poems to music: &quot;Japan Physical&quot; for soprano and piano and &quot;Ghosts, Fire, Water&quot; for unaccompanied choir and alto solo. &quot;Ghosts, Fire, Water&quot; was written for the University of Auckland Festival Choir which performed it at the International Universities&#x27; Choral Festival in New York and at other concerts on its world tour in 1972. The poem from Kirkup&#x27;s anthology &quot;No more Hiroshimas: poems and translations&quot; was based on three of the Hiroshima Panels. Audiences were affected by the poignancy and emotional power of the work and it has continued to be part of the choral repertoire.

<text>Orlando Hernández Pedroso (born October 11, 1965), nicknamed &quot;El Duque&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Duke&quot;), is a Cuban-born right-handed former professional baseball pitcher. He pitched for the Industriales of the Cuban National Series, the New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, and New York Mets of Major League Baseball, and the Cuban national baseball team in international play.

Hernández&#x27;s greatest success came as a starting pitcher for the Yankees during that team&#x27;s run of World Series championships in 1998, 1999, and 2000. He also won a World Series ring in 2005 with the Chicago White Sox. Hernández was the first player to win both an Olympic gold medal and the World Series. 

Hernández was known for his extremely high leg kick and his frequent use of the Eephus pitch, as well as his success in the playoffs.

==Cuban career==
Hernández played for Industriales of Havana in the Cuban National Series, helping the team win that title in 1992 and 1996. He also represented Havana in Selective Series, on teams including Ciudad Habana and Habaneros. He was 126–47 with 3.05 ERA over his ten-year career in the National Series. His career winning percentage in National and Selective Series, .728, is the league record.

Hernández was also a fixture on the Cuba national baseball team, and was part of the gold-winning Olympic team at Barcelona in 1992.

In September 1995, Hernández&#x27;s half-brother, Liván Hernández, defected from Cuba. The Cuban national team left Hernández off of their roster in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Then in July 1996, Hernández was detained by Cuban state security and interrogated about his relationship to an American sports agent. Three months later, he was banned from Cuban baseball. On Christmas Day 1997, Hernández defected from Cuba, departing on a boat from the small city of Caibarién. The U.S. Coast Guard interdicted Hernández, his companion Noris Bosch, another baseball player named Alberto Hernández (no relation) and five others in Bahamian waters, delivering the entire party to Bahamian authorities in Freeport, who confined them in a detention center for illegal immigrants pending eventual repatriation to Cuba, the usual outcome of such cases. However, after lobbying by sports agent Joe Cubas and representatives of the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF), then-Attorney General Janet Reno eventually offered both Hernándezes and Bosch a special status known as &quot;humanitarian parole&quot; that would allow them to enter the U.S., based on (1) what were judged to be realistic fears of persecution should they be returned to Cuba and (2) their status as exceptionally talented athletes, a class of person that — like exceptionally talented people in other professions — can qualify for special admission to the U.S. under State Department rules. However, Hernández declined this offer, eventually accepting an offer of asylum in Costa Rica. If he had immediately become a U.S. resident, he would have been subject to baseball&#x27;s regular draft and could only have negotiated terms with the team that picked him. As a non-U.S. resident, however, he was able to negotiate as a free agent. After two months in Costa Rica, Hernández entered the U.S. on a visa arranged by the New York Yankees, with whom he had negotiated a four-year, $6.6 million contract.

==Major league career==

===New York Yankees===

====1998====
In his first year in the Major Leagues in 1998, Hernández posted a 12–4 record with a 3.13 ERA. He was part of the Yankees&#x27; 1998 World Series-winning team that defeated the San Diego Padres. He finished in fourth place in AL Rookie of the Year voting.

====1999====
Hernández enjoyed his best year as a major league pitcher in 1999; he had a 17–9 record and set career highs in strikeouts (157) and innings pitched (214.1) as a Yankee. In one comical moment during a game against the New York Mets on June 5, 1999, Hernández fielded a ground ball by Rey Ordóñez and hurled his glove with the ball in it at first base to get the out. In the American League Championship Series, he was the starter in Game 1 and Game 5 against the Boston Red Sox. In fifteen combined innings over the two games, he allowed four runs (three earned) and was named ALCS MVP when the Yankees won the series in five games. In the 1999 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, he started Game 1 against Greg Maddux and allowed just one run on seven innings to earn the win in a series the Yankees won in a sweep.

====2000====
Hernández went 12–13 with a 4.51 ERA during the 2000 regular season. The Yankees then won their third straight World Series title, defeating the New York Mets. Over his first three postseasons from 1998 to 2000, Hernández performed well, going 8–1 with a 2.23 ERA.

====2001====
Hernández went 4–7 with a 4.85 ERA in 17 games (16 starts). The Yankees played in the World Series for the fourth year in a row, but were defeated by the Arizona Diamondbacks.

====2002====
Hernández went 8–5 with a 3.64 ERA and one save in 24 games (22 starts). With his fifth straight postseason entry, the Yankees faced the Anaheim Angels in the 2002 ALDS, but lost the series.

===Montreal Expos===
On January 15, 2003, Hernández was traded by the Yankees to the Montreal Expos in a three-team deal that involved the Chicago White Sox. He never appeared in a game for the Expos, missing the entire season due to a rotator cuff injury in his throwing shoulder that required surgery.

===Second stint with Yankees===

Hernández signed a one-year contract to return to the New York Yankees on March 11, 2004. He missed the start of the 2004 season while recovering from his rotator cuff surgery. He started 15 games, going 8–2 with a 3.30 ERA. The Yankees reached the postseason once again, but they lost to the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS.

===Chicago White Sox===
In 2005, while pitching for the Chicago White Sox, Hernández went 9–9 with a 5.12 ERA and one save in 24 appearances (22 starts). He delivered a memorable performance in the sixth inning of Game 3 of the 2005 ALDS against the Red Sox. Brought on in relief with the bases loaded and no outs, Hernández induced two infield pop outs before striking out Johnny Damon without surrendering a run. The White Sox would go on to win the game, sweeping the Red Sox out of the playoffs. The White Sox reached the World Series and swept the Houston Astros to seal their first championship since 1917.
===Arizona Diamondbacks===
After the 2005 season, Hernández was traded—along with relief pitcher Luis Vizcaíno and highly touted prospect outfielder Chris Young—to the Arizona Diamondbacks for former teammate Javier Vázquez. In nine starts, Hernández went 2–4 with a 6.11 ERA.

===New York Mets===

On May 24, 2006, he was dealt to the New York Mets in exchange for relief pitcher Jorge Julio. Hernández&#x27;s debut season in the National League allowed him to attain some offensive feats for the first time in his career. On July 29, 2006, Hernández drove in the first two RBIs of his career. When asked when was the last time he remembered he drove in a run, Orlando said, &quot;In Cuba.&quot; Then, on August 20, 2006, at Shea Stadium, Hernández had the first stolen base of his career.

After his trade to the Mets, Hernández went 9–7 with a 4.09 ERA in 20 starts as the Mets won the National League East. His pitching in September, going 2–2 with a 2.01 ERA, led to him being named the Mets&#x27; Game One starter in the 2006 National League Division Series. However, while running sprints in the outfield the day before the playoffs started, Hernández tore a muscle in his calf and had to be scratched from the postseason roster. He was re-signed by the Mets on November 14, 2006. Injuries limited Hernández to just 24 starts during the 2007 season, but he pitched successfully when healthy, posting a 9–5 record, a 3.72 ERA and 128 strikeouts in 147 innings. Hernández underwent foot surgery following the 2007 season and was not ready to begin the 2008 season with the Mets. He underwent a lengthy post-surgery rehabilitation program in Florida with the intent of joining the Mets in August 2008. A toe injury that required season-ending surgery in late August 2008 ended Hernández&#x27;s season without him throwing a pitch for the Mets. He became a free agent at the end of the year.

===Texas Rangers organization===

On June 11, 2009, Hernández signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to Triple-A Oklahoma. The Rangers informed him that they would not call him up to the major leagues because they did not believe he had the velocity or command to pitch there. Hernández was released on July 17, 2009. At the time of his release, his record with the Triple-A RedHawks was 2–0 in eight relief appearances.

===Washington Nationals organization===
On July 2, 2010, Hernández signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals, attempting a comeback. He went 2–1 with a 1.72 ERA with 21 strikeouts in innings for the Rookie League Gulf Coast Nationals and the Double-A Harrisburg Senators in the Washington Nationals organization. General Manager Mike Rizzo informed Hernández that he would not receive a September call-up, and Hernández left the organization.

===Retirement===
Hernández officially retired from Major League Baseball on August 18, 2011. He broadcast the 2017 World Series for ESPN Deportes Radio.

==Disputed birth year==
When Hernández signed with the Yankees in 1998, he claimed to have been born in 1969. In 1999, &quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; published his divorce decree from Cuba; the document, which had surfaced in connection with a child support case brought by his ex-wife, revealed him to have been born in 1965. The official site of Major League Baseball still gives his year of birth as 1969, while his pages on ESPN and Baseball-Reference.com list it as 1965.

==Other career highlights==
Hernández is a two-time Cuban National Series Champion (1992 and 1996).

In June 2013, Hernández participated in the 67th annual Yankees Old-Timers&#x27; Day. It was his first appearance during Old-Timers&#x27; Day. He returned in 2014.

<doc id="968479" wikidata="Q1323550" url="?curid=968479" title="PP-19 Bizon">
<text>The PP-19 Bizon (, &quot;Pistolet Pulemyot Bizon&quot;, Pistol Submachine Gun &quot;Bison&quot;) is a 9×18mm Makarov submachine gun developed in 1993 by the Russian company Izhmash. The Bizon was designed by a team of engineers headed by Victor Kalashnikov (son of engineer Mikhail Kalashnikov, creator of the AK-47) and including Alexei Dragunov (youngest son of Yevgeny Dragunov, the creator of the SVD sniper rifle).

The Bizon was developed at the request of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and is primarily intended for counter-terrorist and law enforcement units that need fast and accurate fire at close ranges. It features a distinctive helical magazine under the barrel that can hold 64 rounds. Prototypes were trialed by the Special Equipment Research Institute in 1995 where they outperformed several competitors, and the weapon was accepted into service on 28 December 1996.

The Bizon is issued to armed response units of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Ministry of Justice in Russia. It was used in combat operations against separatists in the North Caucasus region, namely Chechnya and Dagestan. The Bizon has been largely replaced by the PP-19-01 Vityaz in Russian service, which was developed directly from the design of the Bizon, due to reliability issues with the helical magazine.

==Design details==
The Bizon is a lightweight selective fire weapon that fires from a closed bolt, a feature that enhances the gun&#x27;s practical accuracy. The weapon has a notably large magazine capacity for the size of it, made possible by the uncommon helical design of the magazine.

It is based on the AKS-74 and features a 60% parts commonality with the AK-74 assault rifle.

Chambered for the standard Russian 9×18mm Makarov pistol cartridge, the gun will also fire a new high-impulse armor-piercing 57-N-181SM round.

===Operating mechanism===
The Bizon uses a simple straight blowback method of operation; an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon&#x27;s operating cycle is characterized by a very short recoil stroke; standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially to the rear of the receiver and results in a cyclic rate of 680 rounds per minute. High-impulse ammunition drives the bolt all the way to the end of the receiver, lightly striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 700–750 rounds per minute is the result. Due to the slow cyclic rate, it has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing firing stability and hit probability.

===Features===
The Bizon has no gas system and the internal components have been modified accordingly. The bolt carrier with fixed charging handle was recycled from the AK, but the piston rod and rotary bolt were removed and the piston extension was plugged with a steel insert. The return spring and guide rod are identical to those of the AK.

The Bizon has a four-groove barrel with a 240 mm (1:9 in) right-hand rifling pitch. The gun&#x27;s muzzle device has a large rectangular port on each side of dead center that serves to reduce muzzle jump, although the main purpose of this device is to protect the muzzle and magazine from impact damage.

The pinned and riveted sheet metal receiver of the Bizon is derived from the AKS-74 and has been modified at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rounded rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also uses the same trigger and safety mechanisms as the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed on the right side of the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost &quot;safe&quot; setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt&#x27;s integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked &quot;АВ&quot;) enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position (&quot;ОД&quot;) will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.

The Bizon also utilizes the AKS-74 side folding stock. It folds to the left side of the receiver but unlike the AKS-74 and AKS-74U, it is not held closed by a spring-loaded capture in the forward end of the receiver. Instead, it is held closed by the forward trunnion pin which is longer on the Bizon than on its AKS-74 predecessors. The extended length of the pin allows it to catch the folding skeleton stock. The pistol grip is identical to the grip on the AK-100 series and is made of a black fiberglass-reinforced polyamide.

===Feeding===
One of the Bizon&#x27;s more unusual features is the magazine, which is often mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel is in fact a 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide 6 and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable compared to a standard drum or stick magazine. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 rounds was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.

===Sights===
The sighting arrangement resembles that used on the AKS-74U and consists of a rear flip-up sight permanently attached to the receiver top cover with two open square notches with 50 m and 100 m elevation settings and a round post front sight taken from the AK series of rifles, common to many Russian small arms. The front sight is contained in a protective cage with a hole in the top to insert an elevation adjustment tool, while the rear sight is shielded by two metal ears.

===Accessories===
The gun is issued with one magazine, a sling, cleaning kit, oil can and magazine pouch.
Other accessories such as scope mounts, Kobra optics and PBS1 sound suppressors were available due to it being largely derived from the AK-74/47 family, thus having the correct thread and AK optics side mount.

==Variants==
The original Bizon was retroactively designated Bizon-1 after the design was improved with the introduction of the Bizon-2.

===Bizon-2===
The Bizon has been continuously modified over its production life, and an improved variant is known as the &quot;Bizon-2&quot;. It features an AK-style iron sights (an open U-notch rear sight on a tangent with three settings: 50, 100 and 150 m and a semi-shrouded front post), a receiver-mounted side rail adapter for optics and a new slotted flash hider designed to accept a quick-detachable sound suppressor. The Bizon-2 is made in several variants to increase the product&#x27;s commercial appeal and demonstrate its versatility; it is offered in 8 different configurations:

*Bizon-2-01: Chambered for the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge using a modified helical magazine with a 53-round capacity.
*Bizon-2-02: Chambered in the .380 ACP (9×17mm Short) pistol round (64-round helical magazine capacity).
*Bizon-2-03: 9×18mm Makarov variant with an integral sound suppressor.
*Bizon-2-04: 9×18mm Makarov semi-automatic carbine model.
*Bizon-2-05: 9×19mm Parabellum semi-automatic only model.
*Bizon-2-06: Semi-automatic only carbine version in .380 ACP (9×17mm Short).
*Bizon-2-07: Select-fire model chambered in 7.62×25mm Tokarev. This model uses a conventional staggered-column 35-round steel box magazine.

===Bizon-3===
A variant known as the Bizon-3 was also developed and features a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds up and over the receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon&#x27;s barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon&#x27;s tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators, and flash hiders.

==Derivatives==
===Vityaz-SN===

The PP-19-01 Vityaz-SN is a further evolution of the PP-19 Bizon. The Vityaz-SN is chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, it entered Russian service in 2005, and continues to be the country&#x27;s standard issue submachine gun for all military and police forces.

===PPK-20===
The PPK-20 is a subcompact, further modernisation of the PP-19-01 Vityaz-SN. It features the AK-19 folding telescopic buttstock, ambidextrous fire selector controls, an optional quick-detachable sound and flash suppressor, a Picatinny rail mounted on the dust cover for various optical sights, an improved handguard design with an M-LOK interface on the sides and slots for Picatinny rails on the top and bottom, and a lighter weight design.

==Users==
*: A domestically produced clone of the PP-19, known by the industrial name SN9P, manufactured by the Z11 Factory of the Vietnam General Department of Defense Industry. It features modifications such as a Galil-style stock to suit local conditions, with limited use by Special Forces units. Chambered in 9×19mm.

<text>Carlos Anibal Vignali had his federal prison sentence commuted by President of the United States Bill Clinton just prior to leaving office, as a part of a group of commutations and pardons. At the time, he was serving the sixth of 15 years in prison for organized cocaine trafficking. Carlos Vignali&#x27;s attorney during his trial and sentencing was prominent Minnesota attorney, Ronald I. Meshbesher.

The sentence commutation, while not a &quot;pardon&quot;, was controversial because there are claims that it was a consequence of Carlos&#x27;s father, Horacio Carlos Vignali&#x27;s, monetary contributions to politicians such as United States Congressman Xavier Becerra and California State Assembly Speakers Antonio Villaraigosa and Robert Hertzberg, who in turn petitioned Clinton for the younger Vignali&#x27;s release. However, Clinton&#x27;s sentence commutation was ostensibly motivated by the harsh minimum sentencing for drug related offenses as part of the War on Drugs, but it is claimed that Carlos A. Vignali was a relatively big offender who was probably less deserving of a pardon than many other convicted persons who are not as well connected. Vignali&#x27;s father possesses large holdings of commercial real estate in Downtown Los Angeles, and Vignali today is active in his father&#x27;s real estate businesses.

Villaraigosa&#x27;s petitioning Clinton for Vignali&#x27;s release was used against him successfully by James K. Hahn as an issue in the 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election. Hahn attempted to use the issue again in the 2005 mayoral election against both Villaraigosa and Hertzberg in the primaries, and against Villaraigosa in the runoff, but was unable to use this issue for political gain again and lost the election.

<text>The Aero A.26 was a Czechoslovakian military reconnaissance biplane aircraft built by Aero Vodochody in the 1920s. It was Aero&#x27;s last design to be based on the Hansa-Brandenburg B.I aircraft that the company had been building under licence during World War I as the Ae.10.

It first flew in 1923 and a small series was built. They were later used in the Czechoslovak civilian aviation.

<text>Edith Joy Scovell (9 April 1907 – 19 October 1999) was an English poet and translator. Among those who admired her work were the fellow-writers Vita Sackville-West and Philip Larkin.

==Life==
Edith Joy Scovell was born in Eccleshall Bierlow, near Sheffield. Her father, F. G. Scovell, was Anglican rector of the village. Joy was one of eight children. She studied at Casterton School, Westmorland, and at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating in English literature.

Despite her background, Scovell ceased to be a religious believer: &quot;I lost religion fairly early on,&quot; she told interviewer Jem Poster. &quot;I mean religious faith – if indeed I ever had it.&quot;

After a period spent working as a secretary and journalist, Scovell married in 1937 the ecologist Charles Sutherland Elton, who had established the Bureau of Animal Population in Oxford. They had a daughter, Catherine Ingrid Buffonge MBE, in 1940 and a son, Robert Elton, in 1943. In general, Scovell remained reticent about private matters: &quot;I have had a fairly ordinary life I think, with normal experiences.&quot; She died in Oxford in October 1999.

==Writings==
E. J. Scovell published three volumes of poetry: &quot;Shadows of Chrysanthemums&quot; (1944), &quot;The Midsummer Meadow&quot; (1946), and &quot;The River Steamer&quot; (1956). Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1988, Cholmondeley Award) and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1991) were published by Carcanet Press.

Geoffrey Grigson, an admirer of Scovell&#x27;s work, included eight of her poems in his 1949 collection &quot;Poetry of the Present: An Anthology of the Thirties and After&quot;. He praised her observation, as &quot;a poet less concerned with celebrity and self-importance than with being alive and in love... The purest woman poet of our time.&quot; Philip Larkin included two, &quot;The Swan&#x27;s Feet&quot; and &quot;After Midsummer&quot;, in &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; (1973). Her poem &quot;Child Waking&quot; was included in the &quot;Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse&quot; (Harmondsworth, UK, 1950 and later editions). Her poem &quot;Deaths of Flowers&quot; is included, with reflective comment, in Janet Morley&#x27;s collection &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Time&quot; (SPCK 2011).

Another enthusiast was Vita Sackville-West, who &quot;came across some verses of E. J. Scovell and was so much struck by them that I cut them out to stick in a private anthology.&quot;

Scovell&#x27;s many poems about children include &quot;An Early Death&quot;, inspired by a grandchild who died at the age of three: &quot;To have stood in the doorway in your shift of grace/With hands half lifted, so to have looked in/On mortal life, it is not nothing – is/A hammer stroke that rings and rings.&quot;

Scovell translated some work by the late 19th-century Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli.

<text>Ponte de Lima () is the oldest &quot;vila&quot; (chartered town, head of a municipality) in Portugal, in the district of Viana do Castelo. Situated on the southern bank of the Lima River, it takes its name from the medieval bridge (ponte) that crosses the waterway. In 2021, the municipality had a population of 41,164 within an area of . The town itself has approximately 2,800 inhabitants.

The current mayor is Vasco Ferraz, elected by the People&#x27;s Party (CDS–PP). As of 2024, Ponte de Lima is one of the six municipalities in Portugal administered by this party. The municipal holiday is celebrated on the Tuesday following the &quot;Feiras Novas&quot; (New Fairs), a festivity held annually during the second weekend of September.

==History==

The area of Ponte de Lima has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with archaeological evidence of settlements dating back over 3,000 years. During the Iron Age, numerous &quot;castros&quot; (hillforts) were established across the modern municipality, with larger examples located at Monte das Santas (now Santa Maria Madalena) near the town center and Monte de Santo Ovídio on the opposite bank of the Lima River.

During the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Ponte de Lima gained prominence due to its location along the Via XIX of the Antonine Itinerary, connecting Braga to Santiago de Compostela, Lugo and Astorga. This road, which traversed the region from south to north, was later used during the medieval period and partially coincided with the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route. Roman infrastructure in the area included a stone bridge over the Lima River, along with two additional bridges in nearby parishes.

Ponte de Lima received its first &quot;foral&quot; (charter) on March 4, 1125, granted by Theresa, Countess of Portugal and her son, Afonso Henriques. The charter defined the territory, smaller than today&#x27;s municipality, and provided protection for market participants. It also contains the earliest documented reference to a market in the area. This charter was confirmed by King Afonso II in 1217 and later revised by King Manuel I in 1511.

The Middle Ages marked a period of military significance for Ponte de Lima. Defensive structures, including walls, towers, and the bridge over the Lima River, were constructed. An inscription on the foundation of the Torre de Santo António in 1359 records the beginning of these fortifications under King Pedro I. By 1370, the town’s walls were completed. During the 1383–1385 interregnum, Ponte de Lima supported King John I of Portugal, overcoming local opposition from Lopo Gomes de Lira, who sided with Castile.

In the 15th century, the town transitioned from royal to noble governance. Leonel de Lima, was granted the hereditary title of &quot;Alcaide-Mor&quot; (chief magistrate) in recognition of his family&#x27;s support for King John I. His contributions included the construction of the Convent of Santo António dos Capuchos and renovations to the Paço do Marquês. However, his tenure was controversial, with complaints about his conduct and that of his descendants. He was rumored to protect wrongdoers and was accused of unjustly imprisoning and mistreating people in the castle’s prison.In the 16th century, King Manuel I ordered improvements to the town’s infrastructure, including paving the bridge, adding merlons, and establishing the town jail in one of the defensive towers. This period also saw the founding of the Misericórdia of Ponte de Lima, which provided social assistance, operating a hospital in the town square and managing the former leprosy hospital outside the walls, now the site of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Guia.

Urban development continued in the 17th century with the construction of notable structures such as the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Penha de França, designed for prisoners to attend mass, and the Hospital of São João de Deus, built for soldiers injured during the Portuguese Restoration War. The Chafariz Nobre, a fountain for potable water, was also completed and later relocated to Largo de Camões in the 20th century.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the town’s medieval walls and towers fell into disuse and were dismantled, with the stone repurposed for new constructions. This period saw the emergence of Baroque manor houses, reflecting the liberal ideals of the era. Cultural institutions such as the Diogo Bernardes Theater and the Limarense Society, inaugurated in 1868, were established, enriching the town’s cultural life.

The administrative reforms of 1836 expanded the municipality&#x27;s territory, but the local economy remained rooted in agriculture until well into the 20th century.

The Feiras Novas (New Fairs) are the municipal festivities of Ponte de Lima, established on May 5, 1826, by King Peter IV of Portugal, who authorized three days of annual fairs in honor of Nossa Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows). Held during the second weekend of September, the event has grown steadily over time, attracting thousands of visitors annually. The Feiras Novas have contributed to preserving local heritage and have become a cornerstone of the town&#x27;s identity.

Every second Monday, Ponte de Lima holds one of the largest country markets in Portugal.

Today, Ponte de Lima is a significant stop on the Central Portuguese branch of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route.

The attractive rural area surrounding the town has the largest concentration of baroque manors in Portugal (Aurora, Bertiandos, Brandara, Calheiros, and Pomarchão are among the best known); Some provide tourism accommodation. Ponte de Lima is also known in the region and all across Portugal for its red Vinho Verde wines and its sarrabulho rice.

<text>Pamporovo (, &quot;pronunciation&quot;: /pam&#x27;porovo/) is a popular ski resort in Smolyan Province, southern Bulgaria. It is set amongst Norway spruce forests and is primarily visited during the winter for skiing and snowboarding. It is also a popular tourist place in summer. The hub of Pamporovo comprises a number of hotels and bars. It is a family-friendly resort and suited for complete beginners and intermediates.

==Location==
The resort is set in the southern Rhodope Mountains at an altitude of 1620 meters above sea level. The highest peak in the area, Snezhanka Peak (Bulgarian: Снежанка) at 1928 m, is several hundred meters above the resort and hosts Snezhanka Tower. Pamporovo is around 260 km away from Sofia, 85 km south of Plovdiv, 15 km north of Smolyan, and 10 km south of Chepelare.

==Skiing==
The resort has 55 km of ski-runs and 38 km of cross-country skiing tracks served by 18 lifts with a total capacity of 13,000 persons per hour. Seven snow-levelling machines and 90% covered with snow cannons guarantee skiers comfortable and enjoyable downhill rides. More than 100 highly qualified ski instructors, fluent in various languages, are available to aid both beginners and intermediate skiers as well as snowboarders. Some new runs have been created and there is now another chairlift in operation Servicing the new Stoykite ski runs and a T-bar replaced with a fixed grip 4 Man chairlift.

==Climate==

The winters in Pamporovo tend to be only moderately cold. The average January temperature is −3 degrees Celsius (or 26.6 F).

==Development==
Much of the older development of the Pamporovo resort lies to the northeast of Snezhanka. Now, to the south there is an up-market residential development called the Pine Lodge, adjacent to the Smolyan Lakes ski lift. There are plans afoot to build two golf courses and to extend the whole skiing area to the Perelik mountain. The Pine Lodge faces the south towards the land of Spartacus, within neighbouring Greece; and a new EU-funded highway will make the Greek coast accessible by car.

In January 2010 an additional border crossing point was opened between Bulgaria and Greece which is just half an hour drive from Pamporovo by car. This brought considerable attention by tourists and media to the resort as being the only one in Europe to allow for such a short time to switch from skiing to swimming.

<doc id="968511" wikidata="Q3666606" url="?curid=968511" title="Charles Tomlinson">
<text>Alfred Charles Tomlinson, CBE (8 January 1927 – 22 August 2015) was an English poet, translator, academic, and illustrator. 
He was born in Penkhull, and grew up in Basford, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

==Life==
After attending Longton High School, Tomlinson read English at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he studied with Donald Davie. After leaving university he taught for several years in Camden Town, London, followed by a brief period as secretary to Percy Lubbock in Italy, before returning to London as an M.A. student at Royal Holloway, University of London. He subsequently taught for thirty-six years in the English Department of Bristol University, where he became Emeritus Professor. He was also a graphic artist, and &quot;In Black and White: The Graphics of Charles Tomlinson&quot;, with an introduction by Nobel prize-winner Octavio Paz, was published in 1975 and was the focus of a December 1975 edition of the BBC television series &quot;Arena&quot;.

==Poetry==
Tomlinson&#x27;s first book of poetry was published in 1951, and his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published by the Oxford University Press in 1985, followed by the &quot;Selected Poems: 1955–1997&quot; in 1997. His poetry won international recognition and received many prizes in Europe and the United States, including the 1993 Bennett Award from Hudson Review; the New Criterion Poetry Prize, 2002; the Premio Internazionale di Poesie Ennio Flaiano, 2001; and the Premio Internazionale di Poesia Attilio Bertolucci, 2004. He was an Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences and of the Modern Language Association. Tomlinson was made a CBE in 2001 for his contribution to literature. His &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, his collections &quot;Skywriting&quot;, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, and &quot;The Vineyard Above the Sea&quot;, among others, are published by Carcanet Press. His last collection, &quot;Cracks in the Universe&quot;, was published in May 2006 in Carcanet Press&#x27; Oxford Poets series.

In his book &quot;Some Americans&quot; Tomlinson acknowledges his poetic debts to modern American poetry, in particular William Carlos Williams, George Oppen, Marianne Moore, and Louis Zukofsky, as well as artists like Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Arshile Gorky. In his critical study &quot;Lives of Poets&quot;, Michael Schmidt observes that &#x27;Wallace Stevens was the guiding star [Tomlinson] initially steered by&#x27;. Schmidt goes on to define the two characteristic voices of Tomlinson: &quot;one is intellectual, meditative, feeling its way through ideas&quot; while the other engages with &quot;landscapes and images from the natural world&quot;. Tomlinson&#x27;s poetry often circles around these themes of place and return, exploring his native landscape of Stoke and the shifting cityscape of modern Bristol. In his poem &quot;Against Extremity&quot;, Tomlinson expresses distrust of confessional verse and rejects the &quot;willed extremism of poets like Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton&quot;.
The inspired poem is dedicated to the Argentine philosopher and poet Eduardo Sanguinetti, which he calls &quot;Dialectic&quot;.

From 1985 to 2000, Tomlinson recorded all of his published poetry for Keele University as well as his translations (with Henry Gifford) of poetry by Antonio Machado and Fyodor Tyutchev. He also recorded &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot. All these recordings, apart from &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; but including Tomlinson&#x27;s interviews with Octavio Paz, Hugh Kenner and Sean Street, can be heard online at the Charles Tomlinson page of PennSound, University of Pennsylvania.

==Translations and editions==
Tomlinson was an authoritative translator of poetry from Russian, Spanish and Italian, including work by Antonio Machado, Fyodor Tyutchev, César Vallejo, and Attilio Bertolucci. He collaborated with Octavio Paz, Jacques Roubaud and Edoardo Sanguinetti in the writing of &quot;Renga,&quot; and with Paz alone in the writing of &quot;Airborn/Hijos del Aire.&quot; He edited &quot;The Oxford Book of Verse in English Translation&quot; and the &quot;Selected Poems&quot; of William Carlos Williams. Other edited works include &quot;Marianne Moore: A Collection of Critical Essays&quot;, &quot;William Carlos Williams: A Critical Anthology&quot;, &quot;George Oppen: Selected Poems&quot;, &quot;Eros English&#x27;d: Classical Erotic Poetry in Translation from Golding to Hardy&quot;, and &quot;John Dryden: Poems&quot;. His poetry has been translated into Spanish by Jordi Doce and Octavio Paz, into Italian by Silvano Sabbadini, Edoardo Zuccato, and others, and into French by Michele Duclos.

<doc id="968514" wikidata="Q2585002" url="?curid=968514" title="Brockham">
<text>Brockham is a village and civil parish in the Mole Valley district of Surrey, England. It is approximately east of Dorking and west of Reigate. The village lies south of Box Hill, with the River Mole flowing west through the village. At the time of the 2021 census, it had a population of 2,198 .

==Name==
Brockham, originally &#x27;Brook-ham&#x27; (bend in a brook) is so called from the Anglo Saxon meaning &#x27;river meadow by the brook&#x27; and is first recorded in 1241. It is often mistakenly believed that there is an association with badgers but this is a modern affectation from the 1950s when Cecily M Rutley created Brock the Badger in a children&#x27;s story .

==Landmarks==
On a spur of land to the north west of the village stands Betchworth Castle, originally built by Richard FitzGilbert on land granted to him by William the Conqueror soon after the Norman invasion in 1066, but later replaced by a medieval house which was probably built in the mid-to-late 14th century. Only a few ruins survive today.

Christ Church, the parish church is relatively recent in origin, having been commissioned in 1847 by Sir Henry Goulburn, who served as both Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary.

==Village green==
The village green is a focal point for the village. Once popular for its cricket matches – WG Grace is said to have played there – it is a focal point of a Guy Fawkes Night bonfire every year on the closest Saturday to 5 November. It has been at times, the UK&#x27;s largest bonfire and firework display, and was first recorded in 1886. Around 20,000 people gather round the village green, over 4 tonnes of fireworks typically light up the sky and the event is widely regarded by local residents as the highlight of the Mole Valley&#x27;s calendar. Dorking Rugby Club on Kiln Lane, opens for the event, as the Club House is near to the bonfire. In the 20 years to 2023, almost £450,000 has been raised by the event in aid of local organisations and charities.
There is also an annual Victorian fair weekend in mid-July, with a village picnic and live music performances on the Saturday evening, also showcasing local talent.

==Industry==
Agriculture previously provided most of the employment for villagers, although further work was to be found in the nearby Brockham Hills from the mid-19th century, when they were quarried for chalk and hearthstone – an operation run by the Brockham Brick Company Limited until 1911 and by the Brockham Lime and Hearthstone Company until 1936 when the works closed.

From 1945, Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd (which merged with SmithKline in 1989, then with Glaxo, to become GlaxoSmithKline in 2000) operated from Brockham Park at the southern end of the village.
In 1959, Brockham Park became famous when Beecham scientists there discovered the penicillin nucleus, 6-APA (6-aminopenicillanic acid); this discovery allowed the synthesis of a number of new semisynthetic penicillins. 
In 1959, Beecham marketed pheneticillin, followed shortly by methicillin (or meticillin), which is active against the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (&#x27;golden staph&#x27;). In time some bacterial strains developed resistance to these antibiotics, such as the MRSA (for methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;). The site became Beecham&#x27;s Chemotherapeutic Research Centre. The site is now a housing estate.

In August 2018, retrospective planning permission was granted by Surrey County Council for a secondary oil wellbore in Brockham.

==Education==
Brockham Primary School merged with The Acorns Infant School in nearby Betchworth in 2010 to create a new combined primary school now named The North Downs Primary School.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Brockham, at parish, district, and county level: Brockham Parish Council, Mole Valley District Council, and Surrey County Council.

Until 1933, Brockham formed part of the civil parish of Betchworth, which was administered as part of the Reigate Rural District. A civil parish of Brockham was created on 1 April 1933 and transferred to the Dorking Urban District. This parish was classed as an urban parish and so did not have its own parish council, but was directly administered by Dorking Urban District Council. Dorking Urban District was abolished to become part of Mole Valley district on 1 April 1974, and the urban parishes it had contained, including Brockham, became unparished areas. A new parish of Brockham, this time with its own parish council, was created on 1 April 1982.

Surrey County Council elected every four years, has one representative, from Buckland for Dorking Rural: 
*Helyn Clack, conservative who participates in these committees:
**Cabinet Member for Community Services and the 2012 Games decisions
**People, Performance and Development
**The Mole Valley local committee (obligatory)
The second party forming the main local opposition in the 2013 election, was the Liberal Democrats gaining 1,527 votes versus the winning candidate&#x27;s 1,810.

2 councillors sit on Mole Valley borough council, who are:
==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<doc id="968518" wikidata="Q461448" url="?curid=968518" title="Seether">
<text>Seether are a South African rock band founded in 1999 in Pretoria, Gauteng. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas. Lead vocalist and guitarist Shaun Morgan is the band&#x27;s longest serving member, bassist Dale Stewart joined shortly after formation while drummer John Humphrey joined them for the band&#x27;s second album. Since 2018, the band has been employing second guitarist Corey Lowery. Several notable guitarists like Corey&#x27;s brother Clint and Troy McLawhorn have toured or recorded with the band, however, Morgan has recorded most guitar parts for the band&#x27;s records.

Seether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single &quot;Fine Again&quot;. Their success was sustained in 2004 with the single &quot;Broken&quot;, which peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. They have experienced continued success with many number one hits on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, such as &quot;Remedy&quot;, &quot;Fake It&quot;, &quot;Country Song&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Words as Weapons&quot;, &quot;Let You Down&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Bruised and Bloodied&quot;, and &quot;Wasteland&quot;. The band has released nine studio albums; their most recent, &quot;The Surface Seems So Far&quot;, was released in 2024.

==History==
===Formation as Saron Gas (1999–2001)===
The band formed in South Africa in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas. Consisting of frontman, vocalist, and guitarist Shaun Morgan, bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, &quot;Fragile&quot;, in October 2000 under Johannesburg-based independent record label Musketeer Records. Despite the region&#x27;s focus primarily on pop and indigenous music, the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label Wind-up Records, who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in North America. Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to sarin gas, and switched to calling themselves Seether, after the Veruca Salt song.

===&quot;Disclaimer&quot; releases (2002–2004)===
In August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, which earned the band three singles: &quot;Fine Again&quot;, &quot;Driven Under&quot;, and &quot;Gasoline&quot;, in which only the first managed significant success. &quot;Fine Again&quot; was also included in the video games &quot;Madden NFL 2003&quot; in 2002 and &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot; in 2003.

Following the release of &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an Evanescence worldwide tour. Seether reworked their acoustic ballad &quot;Broken&quot; into an electric ballad with guest vocals by Amy Lee of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled &quot;Sold Me&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film &quot;The Punisher&quot;, and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.

Morgan has stated that the reworking of &quot;Broken&quot; was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band. An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs remixed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled &quot;Disclaimer II&quot;. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks.

===&quot;Karma and Effect&quot; (2005–2006)===
Seether&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Karma and Effect&quot;, was released in May 2005. Originally titled &quot;Catering to Cowards&quot;, the name was changed due to the record label&#x27;s demand. &quot;Karma and Effect&quot; debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, &quot;Remedy&quot;, &quot;Truth&quot;, and &quot;The Gift&quot;. &quot;Remedy&quot; reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether&#x27;s first number 1 hit.

Seether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled &quot;One Cold Night&quot;, recorded at the Grape Street Club in Philadelphia, on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of &quot;Needles&quot; and &quot;Burrito&quot; from the album is due to the label&#x27;s desire that it contain no obscenities.

Guitarist Patrick Callahan&#x27;s departure from the band was announced on 15 June 2006. His last performance with them was on 3 June. Pat was later interviewed on a radio show in Philadelphia where he said his departure was not anything musical, but he and the singer Shaun had a &quot;personality&quot; clash and were not seeing eye to eye, and just couldn&#x27;t work things out, but was still very friendly with the other two members. Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. Shaun Morgan himself later commented on Pat&#x27;s departure:
:&quot;Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason &#x27;cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.&quot;

Morgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was &quot;dependence on a combination of substances&quot; in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with Staind and Three Days Grace.

===&quot;Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces&quot; (2007–2009)===

Shaun Morgan, prior to the next album&#x27;s release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. &quot;Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces&quot; was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the suicide of Morgan&#x27;s brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured &quot;Candice the Ghost&quot;, and was illustrated by David Ho. The first single, &quot;Fake It&quot;, reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for WWE&#x27;s No Way Out (2008). &quot;Rise Above This&quot;, written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No. 1 spot on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 2 on its mainstream counterpart, Mainstream Rock Songs. The final single from the album was &quot;Breakdown&quot;, the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of 23 October. &quot;Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces&quot; won Seether&#x27;s first South African Music Award in the category &quot;Best Rock: English&quot;, as well as their first MTV Africa Music Award for &quot;Best Alternative Artist&quot;.

A tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. Troy McLawhorn of Dark New Day, Evanescence, and doubleDrive was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008. Bands Seether shared the stage with on the tour included Three Days Grace, Finger Eleven, Breaking Benjamin, 3 Doors Down, Skillet, Red, Papa Roach, Flyleaf, Econoline Crush, and Staind. McLawhorn was afterwards made an official member of the band.

&quot;No Shelter&quot; appeared on the NCIS Official TV Soundtrack, released on 10 February 2009, and a version of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; was made available for purchase as a digital or mobile download. The song was reportedly covered as a joke, in which the band turned an &quot;80s pop ballad&quot; into a hard rock/metal song in response to Wind-up&#x27;s request that they record a Valentine&#x27;s Day song. The music video for &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; premiered on 15 June 2009, and the song is included as an additional track on the reissue of &quot;Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces&quot;.

Seether supported Nickelback on their Dark Horse tour in March and April 2009. Shaun and Dale confirmed in an interview on 2 March 2009 that, after the Nickelback tour, Seether would take the rest of year off to write and record the follow-up to &quot;Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces&quot;. The band nevertheless gave performances through the remainder of the year, which included a date in Okinawa to play for American troops as part of a USO tour on 23 and 24 May at Camp Schwab, and then in MCAS Iwakuni on 26 May for the US Marines. Seether also made appearances at a number of festivals during the summer, including sets at the Chippewa Valley Music Festival and the Quebec City Festival, before the tour&#x27;s conclusion at The Big E Festival, West Springfield, Massachusetts, on 4 October.

Seether covered the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; on the Frank Sinatra tribute album &quot;His Way, Our Way&quot;, which came out on 7 July 2009.

===&quot;Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray &quot; (2010–2013)===
The band spent several months recording in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, then resumed touring in April 2010 with the intention of returning to the studio &quot;in the first week of June&quot; to complete the new record. Drummer John Humphrey confirmed in August that recording was completed, and the album was in the mixing process. He said that the band believed this album to be their best work, and that the songs are &quot;very strong, melodic, and heavy at times&quot;. Morgan confirmed the album&#x27;s completion in September, and gave the expected release date as early 2011. A new song, &quot;No Resolution&quot;, was debuted on 4 September 2010, during a live show at the DuQuoin, IL State Fair. McLawhorn and Humphrey, in a radio interview, announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray&quot;, and that it would be released in May. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Country Song&quot;, was released on 8 March in the US and on 4 April in the United Kingdom, and the new album was released on 17 May 2011. Seether reached their highest position on the US Billboard 200 Charts when &quot;Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray&quot; rose to the Number 2 position. It also reached number one on the US Rock Albums, US Alternative Albums, and US Hard Rock Album Charts. Their single-week sales of 61,000 records was their best since &quot;Karma and Effect&quot; sold 82,000 copies in 2005. &quot;Billboard&quot; named Seether the No. 1 Active and No. 1 Heritage Rock Artist of 2011. A remix EP of the &quot;Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray&quot; album, titled &quot;Remix EP&quot;, was released on 7 February 2012.

Troy McLawhorn&#x27;s departure from the band and return to Evanescence was announced on 8 March. Seether performed live in Cincinnati, Ohio on 10 May, and in South Bend, Indiana on 11 May. Both concerts were recorded, and released as a limited edition CD set for each individual city. The band played main stage at the Uproar Festival alongside Avenged Sevenfold, Three Days Grace, Bullet For My Valentine, and Escape The Fate, and supported 3 Doors Down on their European tour from November to March.

On 3 September 2013, Seether announced the name of a compilation album, titled &quot;&quot;. It was released on 29 October 2013 as a 2-disc album featuring some of the band&#x27;s greatest hits, unreleased demos, soundtrack songs, and 3 all-new tracks, including a cover of Veruca Salt&#x27;s &quot;Seether&quot; (the song that the band is named after). &quot;Seether: 2002-2013&quot; also contains two new recorded songs (&quot;Safe to Say I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; and &quot;Weak&quot;) and was produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The band released a 15-second demo clip for the song &quot;Safe to Say I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; on loudwire.com. They also carried out a small, semi-acoustic tour of Europe and South Africa.

On 30 November 2013, Seether released a 3-track single titled &quot;Goodbye Tonight&quot;, featuring Van Coke Kartel &amp; Jon Savage. The song is also featured on the deluxe edition of their follow-up album &quot;Isolate and Medicate&quot;.

===&quot;Isolate and Medicate&quot; (2014–2016)===

In a 2013 Twitter interview, bassist Dale Stewart confirmed that the band was writing songs for their next album. During an AmA (askmeanything) interview on Reddit.com, Shaun Morgan stated that the band was &quot;In the studio getting ready for our new album...&quot;

On 24 April 2014, it was revealed that the album &quot;Isolate and Medicate&quot; would be released on 1 July 2014, with the lead single &quot;Words as Weapons&quot; slated for release on 1 May 2014.

On 29 April 2014, Bryan Wickmann was announced as the new touring guitarist. Wickmann was the band&#x27;s long-time guitar tech, as well as &quot;Isolate and Medicate&quot;&#x27;s cover art creator, and a former art director of Schecter Guitar Research.

On 17 May 2014, Seether performed their first single, &quot;Words as Weapons,&quot; from the album &quot;Isolate and Medicate&quot;, live at the Orbit Room in front of 1,700 fans.

In late May and early June, Seether announced European tour dates in September, along with several stops in the UK. On 7 July, Seether kicked off their summer tour with 3 Doors Down.

===&quot;Poison the Parish&quot; (2016–2018)===
On 13 September 2016, Seether shared pictures of them recording a new album on social media. They announced in November that they were to release their seventh album in May 2017. A countdown timer later started on Seether&#x27;s website, counting down to 23 February 2017.

Morgan appeared on &quot;Octane&quot; on 22 February to discuss the new record, entitled &quot;Poison the Parish&quot;. Jose Mangin stated that the new material is looking to be &quot;harder than anything they&#x27;ve done&quot;. The album was released through Morgan&#x27;s label Canine Riot Records. Three singles, &quot;Let You Down&quot;, &quot;Betray and Degrade&quot;, and &quot;Against the Wall&quot;, were released in support of the album, all charting significantly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock songs chart.

In May, July, and August 2017, the band toured throughout the United States with American hard rock band Letters from the Fire, adding guitarist Clint Lowery (Sevendust, Dark New Day) to the touring lineup. They then recorded a cover of &quot;Black Honey&quot; by American post-hardcore band Thrice during a live session for SiriusXM in June 2017. In February 2018, Clint Lowery returned to Sevendust to begin touring and promoting their album &quot;All I See Is War&quot;. His brother (and former Dark New Day bassist), Corey, took over his duties as Seether&#x27;s touring guitarist. The band then supported Nickelback on their eight-week &quot;Feed the Machine&quot; European and UK tour. Before the tour ended, Corey Lowery was initiated as a full-time member of the band. On 20 May 2018, Seether played in their hometown of Johannesburg for the first time in six years. On 6 June 2018, they released an acoustic version of &quot;Against the Wall,&quot; along with an accompanying music video.

On 17 July, the band released the second single, &quot;Bruised and Bloodied&quot;. On 14 August, two weeks before the album release, the band released their third single &quot;Beg&quot;.

In July 2021, the band released an EP titled &quot;Wasteland – The Purgatory&quot;. On 1 July 2022, the band released the deluxe edition of &quot;Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Seether&#x27;s musical style has been described as post-grunge, alternative metal, hard rock, and nu metal. The band is heavily influenced by American grunge groups such as Nirvana and Alice in Chains. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote &quot;Seether&#x27;s lead singer/songwriter, Shaun Morgan, is an unabashed, unapologetic worshiper of Kurt Cobain, using Nirvana&#x27;s sound as a template for Seether.&quot; Seether have also been influenced by Deftones and Nine Inch Nails. &quot;Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum&quot; in particular takes heavy influence from the bands A Perfect Circle and Deftones.

<text>The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (, shortened to MPI EVA) is a research institute based in Leipzig, Germany, that was founded in 1997. It is part of the Max Planck Society network.

Well-known scientists currently based at the institute include founding director Svante Pääbo and Johannes Krause (genetics), Christophe Boesch (primatology), Jean-Jacques Hublin (human evolution), Richard McElreath (evolutionary ecology), and Russell Gray (linguistic and cultural evolution).

== Departments ==
The institute comprises six departments, several Research Groups, and The Leipzig School of Human Origins. Currently, approximately 375 people are employed at the institute. The former department of Linguistics, which existed from 1998 to 2015, was closed in May 2015, upon the retirement of its director, Bernard Comrie. The former department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology operated from 1998 to 2018 under director Michael Tomasello.

== Neanderthal genome ==

In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences announced that they would be sequencing the Neanderthal genome. Results of the study were published in the May 2010 journal &quot;Science&quot; detailing an initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. It was thought that a comparison of the Neanderthal genome and human genome would expand our understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains. The study determined that some mixture of genes occurred between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans and presented evidence that elements of their genome remain in that of non-African modern humans.

DNA researcher Svante Pääbo tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one that had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a femur found in 1980 at Vindija Cave in Croatia shows that Neanderthals and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; share about 99.5% of their DNA. It is believed that the two species shared a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. The authors of the &quot;Nature&quot; article have calculated that the two species diverged about 516,000 years ago, whereas fossil records show a time of about 400,000 years ago. From DNA records, scientists hope to confirm or deny the theory that there was interbreeding between the species.

== Early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; ==

Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the Jebel Irhoud site and its &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth, and limb bones that had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old.
The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a skull dating to 260,000 years ago that was found at the other end of the continent, in Florisbad, South Africa, which has been attributed to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds.
The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring. Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use thermoluminescence dating to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy, the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to approximately 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools, at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. As of 2017, this would make the remains the earliest known examples of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

This suggests that, rather than modern humans arising in East Africa approximately 200,000 years ago, it appears that humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to Jean-Jacques Hublin, &quot;The idea is that early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.&quot; Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a &quot;green Sahara&quot;, approximately 300,000 to 330,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale, rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.

== World Atlas of Language Structures ==

In 2005, the World Atlas of Language Structures, a project of the institute&#x27;s former department of Linguistics, was published. The atlas consists of more than 140 maps, each displaying a particular language feature – for example order of adjective and noun – for between 120 and 1370 languages of the world. In 2008 the atlas was also published online and the underlying database made freely available.

They also used to maintain the Glottolog until 2015, when it was taken over by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena.

== Early childhood language acquisition ==

Researchers at the institute have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots into which they could put certain kinds of words. The rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.

<doc id="968523" wikidata="Q5950051" url="?curid=968523" title="Huston Smith">
<text>Huston Cummings Smith (May 31, 1919 – December 30, 2016) was a scholar of religious studies in the United States, He authored at least thirteen books on world&#x27;s religions and philosophy, and his book about comparative religion, &quot;The World&#x27;s Religions&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Religions of Man&quot;) sold over three million copies as of 2017.

Born and raised in Suzhou, China, in an American Methodist missionary family, Smith moved back to the United States at the age of 17 and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1945 with a PhD in philosophy. He spent the majority of his academic career as a professor at Washington University in St. Louis (1947–1958), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1958–1973) and Syracuse University (1973–1983). In 1983, he retired from Syracuse and moved to Berkeley, California, where he was a visiting professor of religious studies at the University of California, Berkeley, until his death.

== Early life ==
On May 31, 1919, Huston Cummings Smith was born in Dzang Zok, Suzhou, China, to Methodist missionaries and spent his first 17 years there. His first language was Mandarin Chinese, spoken in the Suzhou dialect.

Upon emigrating to the United States to complete his education, he received a BA from Central Methodist University in 1940 and a PhD in philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1945.

While at Chicago, he married Eleanor Wieman, the daughter of Henry Nelson Wieman, a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School. She later changed her name to Kendra. They had three daughters, Karen, Gael, and Kimberly Smith.

== Academic career ==
Smith taught at the University of Denver from 1945 to 1947, and then at Washington University, for the next 10 years.

In 1958, Smith was appointed professor of philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he remained until 1973. While there, he participated in experiments with psychedelics that professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert conducted at Harvard University. In 1964, during a trip to India, Smith stayed in a Gyuto Tibetan Buddhist monastery. During his visit he heard the monks chanting and realized that each individual was producing a chord, composed of a fundamental note and overtones. He returned to record the chanting in 1967 and asked acoustic engineers at MIT to analyze the sound. They confirmed the finding, which is an example of overtone singing. Smith has called this the singular empirical discovery of his career. The recording was released as &quot;Music of Tibet&quot; (1967). Royalties from the album continue to support the Gyuto Tantric University. Because of his belief in religion, however, Smith was mistrusted by his colleagues, leading MIT to prohibit him from teaching graduate students.

In 1973, Smith moved to Syracuse University, where he was Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion and Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Philosophy until he took emeritus status in 1983. That year, Smith moved to Berkeley, California, where he remained a visiting professor of religious studies at the University of California, Berkeley until his death.
In 1997, Smith entered into an agreement with the Syracuse University Archives to donate his papers, resulting in a large collection of published books, articles, reviews, or endorsements.

==Religious practice==
During his career, Smith studied Vedanta under Swami Satprakashananda, founder of the Vedanta Society of St. Louis, Zen Buddhism, studying under Goto Zuigan, and Sufism of Islam for more than ten years each.

As a young man, Smith suddenly turned from traditional Methodist Christianity to mysticism, influenced by the writings of Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard. In 1947, before moving from Denver to St. Louis, Smith set out to meet with Heard. Heard invited him to his Trabuco College (later donated as the Ramakrishna Monastery of the Vedanta Society of Southern California) in Trabuco Canyon, Southern California. Heard made arrangements to have Smith meet Huxley. Smith recounts in the 2010 documentary &quot;Huxley on Huxley&quot; meeting Huxley at his desert home. Smith was told to look up Swami Satprakashananda of the Vedanta Society of St. Louis once he settled in St. Louis. So began Smith&#x27;s experimentation with meditation and association with the Vedanta Societies of the Ramakrishna Order. Smith developed an interest in the Traditionalist School formulated by René Guénon, Frithjof Schuon and Ananda Coomaraswamy.

Due to his connection with Heard and Huxley, Smith went on to meet Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), and others at the Center for Personality Research, where Leary was research professor. The group began experimenting with psychedelics and what Smith later called &quot;empirical metaphysics&quot;. The experience and history of the group are described in Smith&#x27;s book &quot;Cleansing the Doors of Perception&quot;. During this period, Smith was also part of the Harvard Psilocybin Project, an attempt to raise spiritual awareness through entheogenic plants. However, he gave voice to the contrast between himself and Leary when he reminisced about encountering the exile Tim Leary in Switzerland, years later (early 1970s): “he was still a fugitive from lawful society—kicked out of it as he had been kicked out of West Point, Harvard University, and Zihuatanejo.”

During his tenure at Syracuse University, he was informed by leaders of the Onondaga tribe about the Native American religious traditions and practices, which resulted in an additional chapter in his book on the world&#x27;s religions. In 1990 the Supreme Court ruled that the use of peyote as a religious sacrament by Native Americans was not protected under the US Constitution. Smith took up the cause as a religion scholar. With his help in 1994, Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act amendment, providing legislative protection to a religious practice that the Supreme Court had decided lacks constitutional protection.

Smith was a practicing Christian, with a Vedantic understanding, who credited his faith to his missionary parents who had &quot;instilled in me a Christianity that was able to withstand the dominating secular culture of modernity&quot;.

== Public activities ==

===Television and film===
While at Washington University, Smith was the host of two National Educational Television series (NET – the forerunner of PBS): &quot;The Religions of Man&quot; and &quot;Search for America&quot;.

In 1996, Bill Moyers devoted a 5-part PBS special to Smith&#x27;s life and work, &quot;The Wisdom of Faith with Huston Smith&quot;. Smith produced three series for public television: &quot;The Religions of Man&quot;, &quot;The Search for America&quot;, and (with Arthur Compton) &quot;Science and Human Responsibility&quot;. His films on Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism have all won awards at international film festivals.

*The Official Huston Smith Archive includes both complete NET television series episodes of &quot;The Religions of Man&quot; and &quot;Search for America&quot;

===Community engagement===
Throughout his career, Smith made himself available to the communities where he resided. Toward the end of his life, while living in Berkeley, California, he participated in the Pacific Coast Theological Society at the Graduate Theological Union. He also attended local churches, including Trinity United Methodist, First Congregational Church, and Epworth United Methodist. On the occasion of publishing &quot;Tales of Wonder&quot;, in 2009 he co-convened &quot;community conversations&quot; at Epworth, during which he responded to questions about his life and work.

==Awards and honors==
For his lifelong commitment to bringing the world&#x27;s religions together to promote understanding, social justice and peace, Smith received the Courage of Conscience Award from the Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts.

Smith was named to be one of the first recipients of the Order of Universal Interfaith and Universal Order of Sannyasa&#x27;s Interfaith-Interspiritual Sage Award in January 2010. He received the award at his home on February 23, 2010.

The Pacific Coast Theological Society celebrated &quot;the lifetime of achievements of Professor Emeritus Huston Smith by considering the relationship between theology, mythology, and science&quot; in a special session in 2012. In 2015, the society presented Smith with their Codron Prize for &quot;The World&#x27;s Religions&quot;.

<text>Tarentola mauritanica, known as the common wall gecko, is a species of gecko (Gekkota) native to the western Mediterranean area of North Africa and Europe. It has been introduced to Madeira and Balearic Islands, and the Americas (in Montevideo, Buenos Aires and California). A nocturnal animal with a predominantly insectivorous diet, it is commonly observed on walls in urban environments in warm coastal areas; it can be found further inland, especially in Spain where it has a tradition of cohabitation with humans as an insect hunter. A robust species, up to long, its tubercules are enlarged and give the species a spiny armoured appearance.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is also known as Moorish gecko, crocodile gecko, European common gecko, and, regionally, as osga (in Portuguese), salamanquesa (in Spanish) and dragó (in Catalan).

==Description==
Adults can measure up to , tail included. Robust body and flat head. Back, legs and tail with prominent conic tubercles. Its regenerated tail is smoother and doesn&#x27;t have tubercles. Obtuse mouth, big eyes with no eyelids and vertical pupil. Fingers with big lateral growths and adherent division less laminae in the bottom face. Only the third and fourth fingers end in union. Brownish grey or brown coloration with darker or lighter spots. These colours change in intensity according to the light. When they are active by day their colour is darker than during the night. It can be found on many construction sites, ruins, rock fields, tree trunks, etc.

==Distribution==
In Europe it can be found through most of the Iberian Peninsula (except northwestern Portugal and most of northern Spain), southern France, coastal Italy, southern Slovenia, northern coastal Croatia and southwestern parts of Greece. In North Africa it ranges from northern Egypt, through northern Libya, northern and central Tunisia, and northern Algeria to most of Morocco. There is an isolated introduced population in southern Western Sahara. It can live up to in altitude.

== Biology ==
Mainly nocturnal or crepuscular. Also active during the day, on sunny days at the end of the winter especially. They like to receive sunlight near their refuge. They hunt insects and in the warmer months of the year it can be found hunting nocturnal insects near light sources, street lamps, etc. They lay 2 almost-spherical eggs twice a year around April and June. After 4 months, little salamanquesas of less than in length are born. Moorish geckos are slow to mature, taking 4 to 5 years in captivity.

The introduction of the species may impact on native fauna, by preying on frogs and smaller lizards. The adoption of this species as a pet has led to populations becoming established in Florida and elsewhere.
It is the host of &quot;Haemoproteus tarentolae&quot;, a protozoan species in the genus &quot;Haemoproteus&quot;, and Esther&#x27;s gecko mite (&quot;Geckobia estherae&quot;), endemic to Malta.

<text>Channel 103 is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the island of Jersey on 103.7 FM and DAB+ digital radio.

The station launched on 25 October 1992. Channel 103 is part of Tindle Radio, which also owns Island FM in Guernsey and Midlands 103 in Ireland.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 48,000 and a 26.2% market share as of September 2024 - the highest percentage reach of any radio station in the British Isles.

In late 2020, Channel 103 became a part of Bauer&#x27;s Hits Radio Network for commercial sales. It remains owned by Tindle with no shared programming.

==Programming==

Channel 103&#x27;s core audience is the 25-44 age group, playing contemporary hits - predominantly from the early 1990s to the present day.

News bulletins are presented locally from 6:30am until 6pm, Monday to Friday.

The station&#x27;s weekend news service broadcasts local content, presented either from Jersey or Guernsey from 8am until noon. Sky News provides the service outside these times.

==Transmission==
From its launch in 1992 until 16 March 2021, Channel 103 broadcast from studios on Tunnell Street in St Helier.

In 2021, the station vacated its original building and moved to a new studio complex in Britannia Place, St Helier. It continues to transmit on FM from the Arqiva mast at Frémont Point, on the north coast of the island. In September 2024 the 103.7FM signal was increased to 6kW ERP, improving reception in St Helier as well as the east coast of Jersey.

Channel 103 began digital radio transmissions, alongside those of Island FM, on 1 August 2021 with the launch of the local Ofcom-licensed DAB multiplex for the Channel Islands. This service is radiated from transmitters at Les Platons (Jersey) and Les Touillets (Guernsey) and Fort Albert in Alderney.

<text>The Rover 75 is a car which was manufactured from 1998 to 2005 and sold under the British Rover marquee. It is a large family car and came in four-door saloon and five-door estate body styles. Initially built only with front-wheel drive, a rear-wheel drive variant with a V8 engine was later sold. There was also an extended-wheelbase model. In 2001, MG Rover launched a badge engineered variant, the MG ZT. A coupé concept was built, but did not receive further development.

Rover 75s were manufactured by the Rover Group at Cowley, Oxfordshire for one year. After owner BMW sold Rover, the 75 was manufactured by the new MG Rover Group at their Longbridge site in Birmingham. The Rover 75 debuted at the Birmingham Motor Show, with deliveries commencing in February 1999. As the last large Rover saloon, production of all models ended in 2005 when MG Rover Group entered receivership.

==History==
The Rover 75 started life as part of a group of three new designs for the company under the guidance of Richard Woolley; a large saloon codenamed &quot;Flagship&quot;, a smaller vehicle (with the codename of &quot;Eric&quot;), and the 75. Of these only the 75 concept progressed. The initial aim was to reskin the Rover 600 (launched in April 1993) but following the BMW takeover in 1994, it was quickly decided that this platform would not be reused but replaced by an entirely new model, scheduled for launch in the late 1990s.

Work on the new model, codenamed &quot;R40&quot;, progressed with little operational interference from BMW; the styling received an enthusiastic response from the management and both companies believed the classical look would be the ideal direction for Rover. Advanced design processes included 3D virtual reality assembly simulations.

The Rover 75 debuted at the Birmingham Motor Show on 20 October 1998 and went on sale until 17 June 1999 having been extensively tested by the motoring press.

The 75 featured a range of petrol and diesel engines from 1.8- to 2.5-litre sizes. Petrol engines provided were Rover&#x27;s four-cylinder K series in 1.8-litre guise and the quad cam KV6, offered in either short-stroke 2.0 or revised 2.5-litre formats. The 2.0-litre was later dropped on introduction of the 1.8-litre turbo for emissions purposes. A diesel engine was provided through BMW Group channels. Engineered by Rover Group and Steyr engineers for transverse mounting, the 4-cylinder M47R (M47 Rail) differed from M47D20 engines found in the E46 3 Series and E39 5 Series by featuring a direct injection common-rail system, different turbocharger and more sophisticated systems for temperature management.

Transmissions on all models were either the Getrag 283 5-speed manual, supplied from the company&#x27;s new facility in Bari, Italy, or the JATCO 5-speed automatic unit — one of the first transverse engine deployments made with this feature.

Disc brakes at all four wheels were augmented by a Bosch 5.7 4-channel ABS system and electronic brake force distribution. The parking brake was a cable operated drum integral within the rear discs.

Suspension was via front MacPherson struts, anchored by alloy lower L-arms and widely spaced mounting points. The rear suspension was a version of BMW&#x27;s Z-Axle arrangement used on the 1988 Z1 sports car.

The 75 won a series of international awards.

Assembly originally took place at Cowley but in 2000, following the sale of the company by BMW to Phoenix Venture Holdings, production was moved to Longbridge in Birmingham, England. 2001 saw the introduction of the Rover 75 Tourer (developed alongside the saloon but never authorised for production by BMW), swiftly followed by the MG ZT and MG ZT-T, more sporting interpretations of the model, differentiated by modified, sporting chassis settings and colour and trim derivatives. Between 2000 and 2003, there were few changes to the range: the most significant was the replacement of the 2-litre V6 engine by a low-pressure-turbocharged version of the 1.8-litre, four-cylinder engine. The introduction of the &#x27;greener&#x27; 1.8-litre turbo greatly benefited British company car drivers who are taxed on carbon dioxide emissions. A customisation programme, &quot;Monogram&quot;, was launched, allowing buyers to order their car in a wider range of exterior paint colours and finishes, different interior trims and with optional extras installed during production. Rather surprisingly, the 75 was offered for sale in Mexico, making it the first Rover to be sold in the Americas since the Sterling.

From June 2002 a factory-approved dual-fuel petrol/liquid petroleum gas conversion was available in the UK on 1.8 and 2.5-litre models. The LPG conversion was an after-market undertaking approved by MG Rover. Developed by EcoGas Systems Ltd and Landi Renzo S.R.L. in conjunction with MG Rover Powertrain Limited, the conversion was ordered from Rover dealerships, the cars retaining the three-year factory warranty. The retail price of the conversion was £2,195, but in an effort to encourage LPG use for transport, for ecological reasons, the UK Government offered a Powershift Rebate of some 60% of the conversion cost. When running on LPG the Rover 75 suffers only a slight reduction in performance compared to running on petrol; LPG fuel consumption is also slightly higher than when running on petrol but this is more than offset by the greatly reduced cost of the fuel.

===Tourer===
Rover released the station wagon/estate bodystyle of the 75, called Tourer, in July 2001. The tailgate featured an optional opening rear glass section. The load space was up to 1,480 mm wide and 2,060 mm long. With the seats up there is 400 to 680 litres of cargo space, and with the seats folded down (in a 60:40 ratio complete with centre load-through hatch) there is 1,222 litres available.

Self-levelling rear suspension and an integral load restraint system were optional for the Tourer. Up to 100 kg can be loaded onto the roof, and the rear sill has a height of 544 mm. Four hinged chrome lashing eyes are fitted to the floor, and oddment stowage compartments and two recessed hooks are located in the side walls.

===Long Wheelbase===

A stretched version of the Rover 75 — initially called Vanden Plas (later simply &quot;Limousine&quot;) was introduced in 2002. Developed in conjunction with vehicle builder S. MacNeillie &amp; Son Limited in Walsall, England, the model was stretched by 200 mm in the rear floor pan and altering the rear doors. Available only in Connoisseur specification, its production moved to Longbridge after an initial short run by MacNeillie. The 75 was a ministerial car in the British Government, Tony Blair having official use of one while he was Prime Minister. Alistair Darling was seen in a long wheelbase Rover 75.

===Rover 75 V8===

Rover announced a V8 model at the Geneva Motor Show in 2004. This was the second iteration of the rear-wheel-drive platform developed from the front-wheel-drive Rover 75 platform by MG Rover, following the MG ZT 260, introduced in 2003. It was the first V8-engined Rover since the demise of the Rover SD1 in 1986. The platform was extensively re-engineered for Ford&#x27;s 4.6 litre Modular V8 and rear-wheel-drive, including a stiffened tunnel and bespoke rear suspension. 

As with the ZT 260, the 75 V8 was built on the standard production line, removed to allow the necessary structural modifications and installation of the V8 drivetrain, then returned to the line for final trim. Instead of the MG ZT 260&#x27;s Tremec TR-3650 manual gearbox, the Rover 75 V8 featured Ford&#x27;s 4R75W 4-speed automatic transmission. Other features included non-standard heating and ventilation, revised brakes and suspension, quad exhaust pipes, special badging, and a &quot;premium&quot; front bumper featuring a deeper grille. 166 were produced in both saloon and tourer body styles, compared with 717 MG ZT 260s, for a total of 883 V8 cars.

A heavily modified MG ZT-T V8, known as the X-15 broke the speed record for a non-production estate car on Bonneville Salt Flats, USA, in September 2003, achieving . The engine was bored out to 6 litres, producing , but remained normally aspirated.

===Facelift===

====Exterior====
In the northern hemisphere spring of 2004, Rover introduced a facelifted 75 featuring an entirely new front grille and bumper, with one-piece headlights with halogen projectors. The rear also featured a new bumper with a revised chrome boot handle. The &quot;premium&quot; grille usually reserved for V8 and long-wheelbase models, was also applied to the limited edition CDTi Sport model in Portugal. This version, with blacked-out trim and 17-inch alloy wheels, was otherwise in Connoisseur SE spec, celebrating Rover&#x27;s centenary in Portugal.

====Interior====

Classic SE, Club and Club SE trim levels were dropped, and on Connoisseur trim light oak wood took the place of the original walnut, which remained standard fitment on the entry-level Classic trim. Rover also added a new trim to the range called Contemporary which featured revised fittings such as larger alloy wheels, body colour exterior accents, black oak wood trim and sports seats as well as an altered equipment. The instrumentation and its back-lighting were revised, the console texture finish was revised and the seat bolsters revised. Access to the rear seats was improved and leg-room increased.

====Technical====
Steering received revised ratios from the MG ZT. Suspension was reworked.

==Engine specifications==
The Rover 75 (and MG ZT derivative) were powered by a combination of Rover&#x27;s own petrol and LPG K-Series and KV6 engines as well as Ford&#x27;s Modular V8 and BMW&#x27;s M47 diesel engine. The latter was designated M47&quot;R&quot; to identify the unit as a Rover special.

==Environmental impact==
Each engine fitted to the Rover and MG flagships were analysed and given a score between 0 (cleanest) to 100 (dirtiest) by Next Green Car.

==Safety==
The Rover 75 was designed with reinforced footwells, underfloor box beams, side impact bars and a &quot;ring of steel&quot; around each door opening to prevent jamming in case of an impact. Driver and front passenger head and side airbags are fitted as standard, with side head &quot;windowbags&quot; available as an option until 2005 when they became standard equipment. If the window airbags had been standard equipment at the time of its Euro NCAP crash test in 2001, it would have scored the full five stars for the adult occupant impact rating. Also fitted are disc brakes all round, anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) with a traction control system (TCS) available as an option on 2.0 engines and above. On models fitted with Rover&#x27;s Hi-Line infotainment system, a speed warning indicator was also included. Additionally, electronic stability control (ESC) was due to be made standard fitment on the 75 from the 2006 model year onwards.

The 75 underwent Euro NCAP and ANCAP car safety tests in 2001.

The Rover 75 achieved the following ratings:


All seats have anti-submarine ramps and three-point inertia reel seat belts with pre-tensioners, while the front seats get additional load limiters and automatic belt height adjustment as standard. In certain markets a seat belt reminder for the driver was fitted. Each seat has an adjustable head restraint with the front ones pivoting on SE models. Thatcham&#x27;s NCWR organisation (New Car Whiplash Ratings) tested the Rover 75 and awarded it the following scores:

G = Good
A = Acceptable
M = Marginal
P = Poor

==Security==
A perimetric (and optional volumetric) alarm, engine immobiliser and remote-control central locking with deadbolts are standard equipment on the 75. Alloy wheels are fitted with locking wheel nuts. Automatic locking when driving off is standard, but can be disabled by a dealer. On the inside is a master locking switch and the boot can only be opened by remote control or an interior button. A battery back-up sounder and tracking device called Trackstar were available as options.

The 75 was tested by Thatcham&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) organisation and achieved the following ratings:


==Popularity==
Initial sales of the Rover 75 failed to match the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4 in the British car sales charts during 1999. The public unveiling of the car at the Birmingham Motor Show drew favourable reactions, but was unfortunately overshadowed by a press conference afterwards by BMW chairman, Bernd Pischetsrieder, containing criticism of the UK Government&#x27;s attitude to financial assistance in the redevelopment of the Rover Longbridge factory (where the new Mini and R30 were to have been produced), and effectively suggesting that Rover was in crisis. Press reaction interpreted this as saying that BMW were unhappy with continuing financial losses and were intending to close Rover down. This undoubtedly scared off many prospective buyers, despite the very positive reaction to the car itself. Indeed, it did (and still does) hold up very well with the Jaguar S-Type that was unveiled at the same show. Rover&#x27;s brand image also hurt the 75 against competitors despite its positive reception.

Sales picked up substantially during 2000, and it was Britain&#x27;s fifth-most popular new car in the month of April of that year. It was still selling reasonably well at the time of MG Rover&#x27;s bankruptcy in April 2005, and a small number of unsold 75s were still in stock as of early-2007, as Nanjing Automobile was preparing to reopen Longbridge.

Based on the combination of safety, performance and maintainability, the Rover 75 was found in 2011 to be the cheapest car to insure in the United Kingdom across all age groups.

==Reviews==
*Auto Trader &#x27;The 75&#x27;s biggest problem was its image; potential buyers just assumed it was hopelessly outclassed by rivals. Nothing could be further from the truth though, as the car could compete on equal terms with some prestigious adversaries&#x27;
*Honest John Positives: A fine looking car from all angles. Destined to become a classicNegatives: Let down by cooling system problems on all K-Series engines, particularly the 1.8
*Parker&#x27;s Pros: Rover refinement and heritage. Handsome looks and a charming, comfortable interior.Cons: Mid-range Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz [rivals].
*RAC &#x27;The Rover 75 Tourer is one of those rare ... cars that retains a genuine sense of occasion whenever you get behind the wheel. The retro clocks and the buttoned down rectitude of the detailing all contributes to a huge feel good factor.&#x27;
*Verdict On Cars &#x27;Recommended. The standard 75 has an elegance missing from German executive car rivals, with wood and leather harking back to a bygone age. The Tourer estate models are, surprisingly, even prettier and very practical indeed.&#x27;
*What Car? For - It&#x27;s excellent over long distances and smooths out bumps like a luxury car. It&#x27;s cheap, well equipped and practical, and comes with olde-worlde charm.Against - The rear seats are cramped and you get a much sharper drive from its German rivals.
*Which? For: rock-bottom prices | strong diesel engine | lots of equipment | comfortableAgainst: patchy reliability | hefty depreciation | no dealer network | limited warranty
*Wise Buyer&#x27;s &#x27;The elegant 75 showed that Rover ... could build a quality executive car that&#x27;s refined, reliable, good to drive [with] real presence.&#x27;

==Chinese production==

Production of the Rover 75 and MG ZT ended when MG Rover Group went into administration in April 2005. The Rover 75 design was purchased by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) in early 2005, although the new MG Rover Group owner, Nanjing Automobile Corporation (NAC) acquired the tooling for the car. Both companies launched revised versions of the 75/ZT in China. SAIC&#x27;s model was named the Roewe 750 (following the purchase of the Rover brand by Ford, the Roewe marque was created by SAIC for use worldwide) and NAC&#x27;s the MG 7.

The Roewe brand and Roewe 750 were launched at the Beijing Motor Show in November 2006. The 750 is based on the long-wheelbase 75 platform, and engineering was completed by Ricardo 2010.

The MG 7 was launched in March 2007.
NAC also introduced a long-wheelbase version of the MG 7, called the MG 7L.

==Brilliance B8==
Shortly before the collapse of Rover, Brilliance who had a deal with BMW like Rover was looking to expand their product line with a big saloon so they went to Rover to use the 75. As a demo, Rover exported 24 Brilliance B8s to China that were sold through dealerships although the cars were only meant to be prototypes. Because the deal never happened, they are still the only 24 Brilliance B8s.

<text>Grace is a free WYSIWYG 2D graph plotting tool, for Unix-like operating systems. The package name stands for &quot;GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of data.&quot; Grace uses the X Window System and Motif for its GUI. It has been ported to VMS, OS/2, and Windows 9*/NT/2000/XP (on Cygwin). In 1996, Linux Journal described Xmgr (an early name for Grace) as one of the two most prominent graphing packages for Linux.

==History==
Grace is a descendant of the ACE/gr plotting tool (also known as Xvgr), based on Xview libraries from OpenWindows. Xvgr was originally written by Paul Turner of Portland, Oregon, who continued development until version 4.00. In 1996, development was taken over by the ACE/gr development team, led by Evgeny Stambulchik at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. Development of Xmgr was frozen at version 4.1.2 in 1998 and the Grace project was started as a fork, released under the GPL. The name stands for &quot;GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of data&quot; or &quot;Grace Revamps ACE/gr&quot; Turner still maintains a non-public version of Xmgr for internal use. The first version of Grace was numbered 5.0.0 and the latest stable version, 5.1.25 (released February 2015). Whether the development of the next major release 6.0.0 is still in progress is unclear. The latest preview versions numbered 5.99.* were released in 2007.

==Currently maintained versions==

Noteworthy alternate versions of Grace include GraceGTK, forked from Grace 5.1.22 in 2009 by Patrick Vincent, and QtGrace, released in 2011 by Andreas Winter.

Both of these versions of Grace work natively on Windows operating systems and had releases in 2022.

==Features==
Grace can be used from a point-and-click interface or scripted (using either the built-in programming language or a number of language bindings). It performs both linear and nonlinear least-squares fitting to arbitrarily complex user-defined functions, with or without constraints. Other analysis tools include FFT, integration and differentiation, splines, interpolation, and smoothing.

<doc id="968553" wikidata="Q195996" url="?curid=968553" title="Cosworth DFV">
<text>The DFV is an internal combustion engine that was originally produced by Cosworth for Formula One motor racing. The name is an abbreviation of Double Four Valve, the engine being a V8 development of the earlier four-cylinder FVA, which had four valves per cylinder.

Its development in 1967 for Colin Chapman&#x27;s Team Lotus was sponsored and funded by major American automotive manufacturer Ford. For many years it was the dominant engine in Formula One, with the whole engine program funded by Ford&#x27;s European division, Ford Europe and engines badged as &quot;Ford&quot; for Formula One championship races. DFVs were widely available from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s and were used by every specialist team in F1 during this period with the exception of Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Renault, BRM and Matra, who all designed, produced and ran their own engines. Variants of this engine were also used in other categories of racing, including CART, Formula 3000 and sports car racing.

The engine is a 90°, 2,993 cc V8 with a bore and stroke of 85.67 × 64.90 mm (3.373 × 2.555 in). It reliably produced over 400 bhp, specifically reaching 408 bhp at 9,000 rpm, and of torque at 7,000 rpm. By the end of its Formula 1 career, it achieved over 500 bhp, with a peak of 510 bhp at 11,200 rpm.

The 1983 DFY variant had an updated bore and stroke of 90.00 × 58.83 mm (3.543 × 2.316 in), maintaining a displacement of 2,993 cc. It produced 520–530 bhp at 11,000 rpm and of torque at 8,500 rpm.

==Background==
In 1965, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, that administered Formula One racing, agreed to raise the series&#x27; maximum engine capacity from to from 1966. Up until that point, Colin Chapman&#x27;s successful Team Lotus cars had relied on power from fast revving Coventry Climax engines, but with the change in regulations Coventry Climax decided for business reasons not to develop a large capacity engine.

Chapman approached Keith Duckworth, previously a gearbox engineer at Lotus but now running his fledgling Cosworth company with Mike Costin, who commented that he could produce a competitive three-litre engine, given a development budget of £100,000.

Chapman approached the Ford Motor Company and David Brown of Aston Martin for funding, each without initial success. Chapman then approached Ford of Britain&#x27;s public relations chief, former journalist Walter Hayes, with whom he had developed a close working relationship from the early 1960s. Since Hayes had joined Ford in 1962 the pair had previously collaborated in the production of the successful Lotus Cortina, introduced in 1963. Hayes arranged dinner for Chapman with Ford employee Harley Copp, a British-based American engineer who had backed and engineered Ford&#x27;s successful entry into NASCAR in the 1950s. Hayes and Copp developed a business plan, which was backed by Ford UK&#x27;s new chairman Stanley Gillen, and approved by Ford&#x27;s Detroit head office as a two-part plan:

*Stage one would produce a four-cylinder FVA twin-cam engine for Formula Two
*Stage two would produce a V8 engine for Formula One, by May 1967

==Formula One==
The project was revealed by Hayes in a PR launch in Detroit at the end of 1965, but the engine was not ready until the third race of the 1967 season, on the 4 June at Zandvoort. Its debut proved successful. Graham Hill, who was in the team at the specific request of Ford and Hayes, put his DFV-powered Lotus 49 on pole position by half a second and led for the first 10 laps but was then sidelined by a broken gear in the camshaft drive. Team-mate Jim Clark moved up through the field in his identical car and came home to win. However, this dominant performance belied a serious fault in the timing gear. Clark took three more wins that season, but reliability problems left him third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 10 points behind champion Denny Hulme. The progress of the engine was documented in a film produced by the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s film section, entitled &quot;9 Days in Summer&quot;.

Initially, the agreement between Ford, Cosworth and Lotus was binding on all parties, and Ford as the funder had no plans to sell or hire the DFV to any other teams. However, it occurred to Hayes that there was no competition: the Ferrari engine was initially underpowered; the BRM complex and too heavy; the Maserati unreliable; the Honda overweight; while Dan Gurney&#x27;s Weslake motor was powerful but unreliable. Only Brabham&#x27;s Repco V8 engine provided a usable combination of power, lightness and reliability, but its age and design left little room for further improvement. Hayes concluded that Ford&#x27;s name could become tarnished if the Lotus were to continue winning against only lesser opposition, and that they should agree to use the unit in other teams, and hence potentially dominate Formula One.

At the end of 1967, Copp and Hayes gently explained to Chapman that he would no longer have monopoly use of the DFV and in August 1967 it was announced that the power unit would be available for sale, via Cosworth Engineering, to racing teams throughout the world. Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams big or small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, easy to work with and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 prices or about £90,000 in 2005 money). The DFV effectively replaced the Coventry Climax as the standard F1 powerplant for the private (mostly British) teams.

Lotus, McLaren, Matra, Brabham, March, Surtees, Tyrrell, Hesketh, Lola, Williams, Penske, Wolf and Ligier are just some of the teams to have used the DFV. In 1969 and 1973 every World Championship race was won by DFV-powered cars, with the engine taking a total of 155 wins from 262 races between 1967 and 1985.

The DFV-powered cars won also the Constructor championship, fighting with the Ferrari who won from 1975 to 1977 and in 1979.

The advent of ground effect aerodynamics on the F1 scene in 1977 provided a new lease of life for the now decade-old engine. The principle relied on Venturi tunnels on the underside of the car to create low pressure regions and thus additional downforce. Previously, teams running Ferrari and Alfa-Romeo flat-12 engines had enjoyed a handling advantage due to the low centre of gravity in such a configuration. However, for ground effect, the wide engine was completely the opposite of what was required as the cylinder heads protruded into the area where the Venturi tunnels should have been.

In contrast, the V-configuration of the Cosworth engine angled the cylinders upwards and left ample space under the car for the necessary under-body profile which massively increased downforce and gave more efficient aero balance, thus increasing cornering potential and straight line speed. Ground effect British cars and DFV engines effectively killed off the V12/flat 12 engines of Ferrari and Alfa Romeo which many pundits had believed in the mid-1970s would dominate F1 well into the mid-1980s. Drivers Mario Andretti in , Alan Jones in , Nelson Piquet in and Keke Rosberg in used a combination of British ground effect chassis and a DFV engine to claim the Drivers&#x27; Championship while DFV-powered cars took the Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship in 1978, 1980 and 1981.

The onset of the turbo era in the early 1980s put an end to the DFV&#x27;s F1 activities, as even with modifications the 15-year-old engine could not hope to compete with the vast power being put out by the new 1.5-litre turbocharged engines. However, in the early days of turbo F1 cars (1979–1982) the Renault, Ferrari and Toleman were unable to offer consistent opposition to the Cosworth DFV British teams. The early turbo Renault, though powerful (particularly so on high altitude tracks such as Interlagos, Kyalami, Jarama, Dijon-Prenois and the Österreichring) were much heavier, cumbersome, complicated and significantly, much more unreliable than the British Cosworth DFV teams.

The extra power and torque of a turbo engine put much more strain on the gearbox, driveshafts and brakes on the Renaults and Ferraris, and during the early 1980s the sight of a Renault or Ferrari wilting under the strain of its extra power was a common sight. The turbo engine was also hampered by &quot;throttle lag&quot;, a delay in throttle response which made the turbo cars very slow on tight, twisty circuits such as Monaco, Long Beach, Zolder, Montreal, Brands Hatch and Detroit, whereas the normally-aspirated Cosworth DFV enjoyed pin-sharp response and accuracy. Also, the light and agile British cars exploited ground-effect technology so well that even on fast tracks such as Buenos Aires, Silverstone, Hockenheim the DFV engine was able to win. For a few years, between 1977 when Renault debuted the powerful but unreliable turbo engine and 1982 when the DFV-powered teams began to negotiate deals for turbo engines of their own, a competitive equilibrium was established. Michele Alboreto took the DFV&#x27;s last F1 win in a Tyrrell at the in 1983, and Martin Brundle was the last person to race in F1 with a DFV, also in a Tyrrell at the in 1985.

Some Cosworth-using constructors developed their engines in house during a Grand Prix season, such as John Nicholson&#x27;s Nicholson McLaren operation or Williams F1 using John Judd&#x27;s workshops to uprate the standard 480 BHP that the DFV was producing in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Uprated pistons, camshafts and valves meant Williams and McLaren&#x27;s DFVs were producing over 510BHP at around 11,000RPM by the early 1980s, which meant the power deficit to the turbocharged Renaults and Ferraris was only around 30–40BHP in race trim. Since a DFV only needed a 190-litre fuel tank, compared to the 220+ litre sized fuel tank required by a turbo engine, it meant the power to weight ratio of a McLaren MP4 or Williams FW07/08 with their specialist DFV engines were comparable to their turbocharged opponents, albeit with better fuel consumption and much less strain on the rear tyres, gearboxes and rear axle, meaning softer compounds could be used and last longer by both Williams and McLaren, which gave a significant benefit to both grip and tyre durability.

As of mid-1982, 375 engines had been built. The cost of a complete engine at that time, purchased directly from Cosworth, was £27,296, approximately .

==Other formulae==

===Sportscar racing===
The DFV was used in sportscar racing with some modest success. The design of the crankshaft caused vibrations that resulted in reliability problems in endurance racing. In 1968, new rules for the Sports Prototype class limited engine displacement to 3 litres and Ford (UK) sponsored the DFV-powered Ford P68 as their entry under the new rules. However, this car, and its derived sister the P69, failed to finish a single race during the two seasons that they competed. In 1971 a DFV-powered Ligier JS3 was able to finish first and second in two short-distance events, the best DFV-powered Sports Prototype showings to date, but was only able to achieve a non-classified finish at Le Mans after mechanical troubles. The next years would show that even that unsatisfactory result was beating the odds. The DFV came into wider use in 1972, when all purpose-built racers fell under the 3-litre engine limit. Eric Broadley&#x27;s Lola, having previously focused on the 2-litre smaller class, designed their T280 model fitted with a Cosworth engine, which was very fast though it often failed to finish. Thirteen starts of DFV-powered vehicles at the Le Mans 24 Hours during 1972–74 yielded three finishes, two of which failed to complete 300 laps. The best result for DFV-powered vehicles at Le Mans was in 1975, when fuel consumption rules had the field using low power tuning and slower engine speeds, which slowed the race pace and mitigated the DFV&#x27;s vibration problem. The top three finishers were powered by DFVs, with the Gulf-sponsored Mirage driven by Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell finishing first.

1976 saw a slightly faster pace for the Mirage and the DFV-powered De Cadenet Lola, but they were eclipsed by the new turbocharged Porsche 936, driven by Ickx and Gijs van Lennep, in first place. After two years with DFV-powered vehicles failing to run competitive distances, a DFV-powered Rondeau was the surprise winner in the 1980 race. Jean Rondeau and Jean-Pierre Jaussaud nursed a two lap lead over the Jacky Ickx / Reinhold Joest Porsche 908/80 charging back from earlier mechanical setbacks. Another Rondeau occupied the third spot, nine laps behind the winner. In 1981 Rondeau slightly improved on the pace of the previous year but, as in 1976, DFV-powered vehicles were again outclassed by a Porsche 936, driven this time by the old Mirage winning team of Ickx and Bell. The 1981 distance result, 340 laps, was the best ever achieved with the DFV. The DFV faded from relevance over 1982–1984, showing just two finishes of over 300 laps from fourteen starts at Le Mans.

Australian race driver Bap Romano used an ex-F1 Cosworth DFV engine (formerly used by McLaren) in his Australian designed and built Kaditcha Group A Sports Car through 1983 and 1984 in the Australian Sports Car Championships. After finishing 6th in the 1983 ASCC, winning the final round of the series, he would go on to dominate the 1984 championship. The renamed Romano WE84 won four of the five rounds and in all bar heat two of the opening round when the car was a non-starter due to an accident in the first heat, scored fastest lap while also sitting on pole for every round. The DFV in the Romano was later replaced in late 1984 by the Cosworth DFL engine.

====Use of post-DFV variants====
1982 saw the introduction of 3.3 and 3.9 litre DFLs, endurance racing versions of the DFV, in the World Endurance Championship. That year, the 3.3 litre variant powered the new Rondeau M382 to three podium finishes with a win in the 1000 km Monza event and a strong second place standing behind Porsche in season points. The DFLs proved insufficiently reliable for C1 class racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, achieving only three finishes in 34 starts during 1982–1984, with none achieving 300 laps. After 1982 the DFLs were never reliable or competitive in the C1 class and finished consistently behind C2 cars at Le Mans. The 3.9 litre version was completely rejected by 1985. The last start for a DFL in the C1 class at Le Mans was in 1988. 1984 saw success for the 3.3 litre version in the fuel-restricted C2 class, where low power tuning mitigated its reliability issues, with two class wins on the World Championship circuit. The 3.3 litre DFL became the most used engine of the C2 class, achieving four class championships, five class wins at Le Mans between 1985 and 1990 and the best distance of any Cosworth engine at Le Mans, at 351 laps, in 1988. Reliability of the C2 class was still considered unsatisfactory, however, and as the 1980s ended, the issue led the FIA to seek a new formula to replace the C2 class. 1989 saw the introduction of the 3.5 litre DFZ variant as a C1 class engine. It had the honor of being the first Cosworth engine to finish ahead of the C2 winner at Le Mans, but it was an inconsistent finisher and not competitive within the C1 class. It proved a consistent finisher and winner in the FIA Cup class, the low powered replacement of the C2 class, in 1992. The 3.5 litre DFR variant yielded more consistent results as a C1 engine for the Spice team in 1990 and the Euro Racing team in 1991, with two third-place finishes for the former, but they were never able to challenge the Peugeots, Jaguars and Sauber Mercedes for the top spot.

===Formula 3000===
The DFV was also the engine for which the Formula 3000 series was created in 1985, and thus it won every race that year. The DFV and its variants continued racing in F3000 for a decade, Pedro Lamy taking the last win for a DFV in top-class motorsport, at Pau in 1993, its 65th F3000 win in 123 races.

==Variants==

===DFW===
The first variant produced from the DFV was a reduced-capacity unit for the Australia and New Zealand-based Tasman Series races of 1968–69. The changes between the DFV and DFW specification were limited to a reduced stroke, taking capacity to 2491 cc and reducing power output to ~360 bhp. This was the smallest capacity variant of the DFV that was officially produced by Cosworth. The engine was a direct replacement for its DFV parent in Lotus&#x27;s 49s. The small engine proved just as competitive as the larger version; and Jim Clark took four race victories in 1968, followed by one win for Piers Courage and two victories for Jochen Rindt in 1969. Derek Bell drove a DFW version of the Brabham BT26 to second place in the 1970 New Zealand Grand Prix, and for the 1971 Tasman Series previous champion Chris Amon drove a DFW-powered version of his current Formula One chassis, the March 701, to another podium finish, but in both years the Formula One-derived engine was largely outmatched by Formula 5000 entrants. After the demise of the 2.5L component of the Tasman Formula following the 1971 season, the four DFW engines were converted to DFV specification.

===Formula One===
The DFV had three major upgrades over its life in the top formula, with the development of first the DFY and then the DFZ, followed by a major redesign to produce the final DFR type.

====DFY====

With the introduction of turbocharged engines towards the end of the 1970s, Cosworth&#x27;s naturally aspirated DFV began to lose its predominance. In an attempt to recover some of the performance deficit Cosworth designer Mario Illien reconfigured the cylinder aspect ratio to allow the engine to rev more freely, and combined this with a narrow-angle valve set-up and Nikasil Aluminium liners. The changes upped power output to ~520 bhp, and between 11000-12000 RPM but this was not sufficient to keep pace with the turbo cars at most tracks, and it was only through a modicum of luck that Michele Alboreto was able to take what would prove to be the DFV-family&#x27;s final F1 victory, at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix. The DFY lived on with back-marker teams until the end of the season, when Cosworth switched their efforts to supporting the new turbocharged Ford GBA V6.

====DFZ====

The announcement at end of the season that turbocharged cars would be banned from , and the introduction of the Jim Clark Cup and Colin Chapman Trophy championships for naturally aspirated cars for , prompted Cosworth to revive their elderly engine design. This resulted in the DFZ, essentially an updated version of the final DFY design. However, the capacity increase for the new 3.5L naturally aspirated formula running alongside the 1.5L turbos in 1987 allowed Cosworth to increase the power output of the unit to . The engine was intended as a temporary measure to tide smaller teams over until the turbos were banned at the end of the season. Tyrrell, AGS, March, Lola and Coloni chassis were all powered by Cosworth in 1987. Jonathan Palmer of Tyrrell eventually won the drivers&#x27; Jim Clark Cup, and his team took the constructors&#x27; laurels in the Colin Chapman Trophy. The engine remained in service with minor teams until the end of 1988 and development saw a slight power increase to . The DFZ did not race in Formula One beyond 1988 as the general release of the DFR engine made it obsolete.

The engine did however have a second brief lease of life in sportscar racing, when the FIA announced plans to transition towards using 3.5 L F1-style engines in Group C in the early 1990s. In 1990 Spice Engineering adapted its existing Group C design to take a 3.5L DFZ instead of the previously used 3.3 L DFL engine. However the new engine caused significant problems due to vibration, which resulted in the breakage of components and a significant increase in running costs - Gordon Spice estimated that the DFZ-powered car was about four times more expensive to run than the DFL-engined one. The DFZ was successfully used in FIA Cup class racing in 1992, with that low-powered class being the last appearance of the DFV family in sportscar racing.

====DFR====

From Benetton had been operating as the works Ford team, essentially taking over the role from the now defunct Haas Lola team. With the abandonment of turbocharging it was clear that the venerable DFV/Y/Z design was nowhere near being competitive with far newer offerings from Honda and Renault who were building V10 engines for 1989 and beyond, and Ferrari who were building what they knew, a V12 (Lamborghini entered F1 in 1989 and like Ferrari, also went down the V12 path). To counter this, drastic changes were made for the DFR of 1988. Although superficially a DFV-design, almost the only feature carried over from previous versions into the DFR was the basic 90° V8 engine architecture. The DFR became available to all customers in 1989, with the Benetton team also using this engine until the 1989 British Grand Prix. The DFR struggled on until the 1991 season finally being eclipsed by the higher revving abilities of new pneumatic valve gear engines such as the HB, and was last used in that year&#x27;s Australian Grand Prix by the Footwork, Fondmetal, Larrousse and Coloni teams, nearly a quarter of a century after the DFV&#x27;s first race. By the time of its demise, continued improvement had pushed the DFR power output to nearly , 60% higher than the original 1967 DFV.

The DFR enjoyed success in 1988 with Benetton. The team was the best performed non-turbo team of the season finishing third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship behind Ferrari (turbo) and the all-conquering McLaren-Honda. Thierry Boutsen recorded five podium finishes and Alessandro Nannini scored two podiums. The DFR was also the most powerful non-turbo of the season with a reported . This compared to the 590 of the DFZ and the new Judd V8 with a reported . This still lagged behind the Honda and Ferrari turbos which were producing over each.

The 3.5 L DFR engine was later used in the Allard J2X-C Group C sports car, in 1992.

===North American series===


====DFX====

A 2.65 L turbocharged version of the DFV was developed privately by the Vels Parnelli Jones team for the 1976 USAC IndyCar season, in the face of opposition from Duckworth. The Parnelli-Cosworth car took its first victory at the 1976 Pocono 500, the fifth race of the season, driven by Al Unser. Unser and his Cosworth-powered Parnelli took two further victories before the end of the year, in Wisconsin and Phoenix, and finished the championship in fourth position.

Duckworth had been a guest of the Vels Parnelli team during the Pocono victory, as Parnelli Jones and Vel Miletich wanted to establish the team as the North American distributor for the turbocharged, Indycar-specification engine. However, shortly after the maiden race victory Cosworth poached two key engineers from the Parnelli team and set up facilities in Torrance, California, to develop and market the engine themselves. Henceforth it became known as the DFX. It went on to dominate American Indy car racing in much the same way the DFV had dominated Formula One. The engine won the Indianapolis 500 ten consecutive years from 1978 until 1987, as well as winning all USAC and CART championships between 1977 and 1987 except for one. For a brief time in the early 1980s, some of the DFX engines were badged as Fords. The DFX powered 81 consecutive Indy car victories from 1981 to 1986, and 153 victories total. By the time it was replaced, the DFX was developing over .

====DFS====
In 1986 GM financed the British Ilmor firm to build a competitor to the DFX in American Indy car racing. Mario Illien&#x27;s Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V-8, which owed not a little to the DFY of five years earlier, quickly took over dominance of the sport.

Ford responded by commissioning Cosworth to redesign the DFX to include a number of DFR improvements. In 1989, they introduced an updated &quot;short stroke&quot; version of the Indy car engine which would be referred to as the &quot;DFS&quot; (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;short stroke&quot;)., and the Nikasil Aluminium liners, adopted on DFY in 1983.

The engine was fielded by two teams in its first season: Kraco Racing (Bobby Rahal) and Dick Simon Racing (Arie Luyendyk), and its development was an effort to regain dominance of the sport. At Indy, neither car qualified in the front two rows, but both started in the top ten. On race day, both drivers dropped out with engine failures. Rahal won one race in 1989 at the Meadowlands. However, the Kraco team merged with Galles at season&#x27;s end, dropped the program, and switched to Chevrolets.

In 1990, the factory development was continued by Scott Brayton and Dominic Dobson, but neither won any races. The engine was utilized by other CART teams in 1991–1992, and was retired after the introduction of the Ford Cosworth XB with only one victory, that being Rahal&#x27;s in 1989.

===DFL===

In 1981 a variant of the DFV named the DFL (for &quot;long-distance&quot;) was produced specifically for use in the new Group C sports car racing class. The engine was modified to larger capacity and versions, both with wider bore and longer stroke dimensions than the standard DFV. Both versions were plagued by reliability issues worse than with the DFV they were supposed to replace. The 3.3 L version powered Rondeau to the second points standing in the World Sportscar Championship season of 1982, but it was insufficiently reliable to be competitive in the longer events. Thereafter, the 3.3 L DFL in the C1 class was unsuccessful, with those who managed to actually finish invariably ending up behind C2 cars. The new fuel-restricted C Junior (C2) class in 1983 opened a niche for successful use of the 3.3 L version, where low power tuning brought its reliability to a level where it could succeed. In the C2 category it powered many privateer cars, mostly Spices and Tigas, to class victories around the world, including five at the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1985 and 1990. The 3.9 L version never achieved the same success as its smaller sibling, with most users finding incurable engine vibrations and it was out of competition use by 1985. It was used to power the famous Ford Supervan and Supervan 2 promotional projects, as well as the Australian designed and built Romano WE84 in the Australian Sports Car Championship, which ran the 3.0 L DFV in the championship before upgrading to the 3.9 L DFL for the 1984 World Endurance Championship round at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne, where it finished 100 laps behind the class winner.

In August 1982, a turbocharged version of this engine was tested briefly on the Brands Hatch Circuit mounted on a Ford C100.

===P86 750cc motorcycle engine===

In 1973 Norton approached Cosworth to help build a new engine that could be used for both street and racing motorcycles. The idea was to create a 750-cc parallel-twin version of the DFV, with liquid-cooling, 4-valve head, dual overhead cams and flat combustion chambers. Expected power was to be 65–75hp for road bikes, and at least 100hp for the racing bikes.

The P86 had a bore of 85.6mm and a stroke of 64.8mm, giving a capacity of 746cc. A timing belt was used to drive the cams, rather than the gear train used on the DFV. The P86 shared the same combustion chamber, head designs, pistons and rods from the DFV.

Norton specified that the P86 must run through a single carburettor source, which led to a 360° firing interval, with both pistons rising and falling as a pair. As this led to increased vibration, a dual counterbalancing system was developed, in conjunction with a heavy flywheel. In an engine weighing 195lb, 75lb of that was a rotating mass inside, which was a lot of inertia to be driven.

The P86 had downdraught ports like the DFV, but used two Amal carburettors, rather than the fuel injection of the DFV. The carburettors and angle in relation hampered fuel delivery and power output.

Dyno testing showed that the P86 developed 90hp, down on the projected 100hp, while the massive amount of rotating weight inside the engine (counter balancers and flywheel) hindered throttle response. The overall weight of the engine meant that it was never going to be as light as equivalent engines from Japanese manufacturers. The belt driven timing system was inaccurate, while the belts themselves were fragile and prone to breaking.

The P86 was fitted in a Norton &#x27;frameless&#x27; chassis that made its racing debut in 1975, but results were poor, due to the lack of power. When Norton Villiers Triumph was split up in 1976, an offshoot company called NVT Engineering disbanded the testing and racing departments, and the existing bikes and spare engines (30 in total) were sold off.

The P86 made a brief comeback 10 years later at the 1986 Battle of the Twins, held at the Daytona International Speedway. The Quantel entry featured one of the surviving P86 engines – reworked, fitted with fuel injection and bored out to 823cc. Ridden by Paul Lewis, the Quantel finished 2nd, and would win the event in 1988 ridden by Roger Marshall.

<text>Amos Tutuola (; 20 June 1920 – 8 June 1997) was a Nigerian writer who wrote books based in part on Yoruba folk-tales.

== Early history ==
Amos Olatubosun Tutuola Odegbami was born on 20 June 1920, in Wasinmi, a village just a few miles outside of Abeokuta, Nigeria, where his parents, Charles Tutuola Odegbami and Esther Aina Odegbami, who were Yoruba Christian cocoa farmers, lived. Wasinmi was a small farming village founded between the years 1845 and 1880 by constituents of the Egba subethnic group from Abeokuta. Tutuola&#x27;s father and grandfather belonged to this subethnic group.

Amos was the youngest son of his father; his mother was his father&#x27;s third wife. His grandfather the Odafin of Egbaland, Chief Odegbami (c. 1842–1936), patriarch of the Odegbami clan, was a chieftain of the Egba people and a traditional worshipper of the Yoruba religion. His title, &quot;Odafin&quot; (literally &quot;the establisher of laws&quot; or &quot;lawgiver&quot; in Yoruba), signified that he had an administrative position within the traditional administration of Egbaland, and that he was one of the Iwarefa of the Ogboni.

When Amos was seven years old, in 1927, he became a servant to F. O. Monu, an Igbo man, who sent him to the Salvation Army primary school in lieu of wages. At age 12, he attended the Anglican Central School in Abeokuta. His brief education was limited to six years (from 1934 to 1939). After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1936, most members of the chief&#x27;s family decided to adopt the European style of naming and take his name, Odegbami, as their last name. However, several other family members, including Amos, decided to take their father&#x27;s name, Tutuola, instead. When his father died in 1939, Tutuola left school to train as a blacksmith, the trade he practised from 1942 to 1945 for the Royal Air Force in Nigeria during WWII. He subsequently tried a number of other vocations, including selling bread and acting as messenger for the Nigerian Department of Labour. In 1946, Tutuola completed his first full-length book, &quot;The Palm-Wine Drinkard&quot;, within two days. In 1947, he married Victoria Alake, with whom he had four sons and four daughters; he would also marry 3 other wives. He is the uncle of the Nigerian footballers Segun Odegbami and Wole Odegbami.

== Writing ==
Despite his short formal education, Tutuola wrote his novels in English. In 1956, after he had written his first three books and become internationally famous, he joined the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation in Ibadan, Western Nigeria as a storekeeper. Tutuola also became one of the founders of the Mbari Club, the writers&#x27; and publishers&#x27; organization. In 1979, he held a visiting research fellowship at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) at Ile-Ife, Nigeria, and in 1983 he was an associate of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. In retirement he divided his time between residences Ibadan and Ago-Odo.

Tutuola died at the age of 76 on 8 June 1997 from hypertension and diabetes.

Many of his papers, letters, and holographic manuscripts have been collected at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin.

Tutuola&#x27;s works have been translated into 11 languages, including French, German, Russian, and Polish. Some translators, notably Raymond Queneau (French) and Ernestyna Skurjat (Polish), deliberately adjusted the grammar and syntax of the translations to reflect the occasionally atypical language of Tutuola&#x27;s original prose.

===&quot;The Palm Wine Drinkard&quot;===
Tutuola&#x27;s most famous novel, &quot;The Palm-Wine Drinkard and his Dead Palm-Wine Tapster in the Deads&#x27; Town&quot;, was written in 1946, first published in 1952 in London by Faber and Faber, then translated and published in Paris as &quot;L&#x27;Ivrogne dans la brousse&quot; by Raymond Queneau in 1953. Poet Dylan Thomas brought it to wide attention, calling it &quot;brief, thronged, grisly and bewitching&quot;. Although the book was praised in England and the United States, it faced severe criticism in Tutuola&#x27;s native Nigeria. Part of this criticism was due to his use of &quot;broken English&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; style, which supposedly promoted the Western stereotype of &quot;African backwardness&quot;. This line of criticism has, however, lost steam. In the opinion of Taban Lo Liyong:

Omolara Ogundipe-Leslie in her own reassessment wrote in &quot;The Journal of Commonwealth Studies&quot;:
O. R. Dathorne additionally said:
Wole Soyinka wrote in 1963:
&quot;The Palm-Wine Drinkard&quot; was followed by &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot; in 1954 and then several other books in which Tutuola continued to explore Yoruba traditions and folklore, although none of the subsequent works managed to match the success of &quot;The Palm Wine Drinkard&quot;. His 1958 work, &quot;The Brave African Huntress&quot;, was illustrated by Ben Enwonwu.

==Tributes==
Brian Eno and David Byrne named their 1981 album &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot; after Tutuola&#x27;s second novel.

In 2015, the Society of Young Nigerian Writers, under the leadership of Wole Adedoyin, founded the Amos Tutuola Literary Society, aimed at promoting and reading Tutuola&#x27;s works.

In 2021, Will Alexander published a long poem – &#x27;Based on the Bush of Ghosts&#x27; – in honour of Tutuola &quot;Refractive Africa&quot;, the collection of which this was part, was subsequently listed as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.

In 2021, Aderemi Adegbite, the Nigerian contemporary artist-curator and poet, inaugurated the Tutuola Institute - The Yoruba Cultural Institute, an artistic and cultural intervention legally recognized in Nigeria as a Limited by Guarantee Charity.

<doc id="968556" wikidata="Q5317995" url="?curid=968556" title="Dwayne Hickman">
<text>Dwayne Bernard Hickman (May 18, 1934 – January 9, 2022) was an American actor and television executive, producer and director, who worked as an executive at CBS and had also briefly recorded as a vocalist. Hickman portrayed Chuck MacDonald, Bob Collins&#x27; girl-crazy teenaged nephew, in the 1950s &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; and the title character in the 1960s sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;. He was the younger brother of actor Darryl Hickman, with whom he appeared on screen. After retirement, he devoted his time to creating personalized paintings.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, on May 18, 1934, Hickman was the younger brother of child actor Darryl Hickman and the older brother of Deidre Hickman. His father, Milton, sold insurance and his mother, Katherine Louise (née Ostertag), was a housewife. His maternal grandfather, Louis Henry Ostertag, was a U.S. Navy seaman on Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s flagship, the cruiser USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (C-6), and present at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, for which he was awarded the Dewey Medal by Act of Congress. 

Hickman graduated from Cathedral High School in 1952 and intended to become a Passionist priest, but ultimately chose not to become a priest and attended Loyola Marymount University.

==Acting career==
Hickman&#x27;s first screen appearances were as an extra in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940) and &quot;Men of Boys Town&quot; (1941), in which his brother Darryl was featured. Other early screen appearances were in the 1942 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy &quot;Melodies Old and New&quot;, &quot;Captain Eddie&quot; (1945), &quot;The Hoodlum Saint&quot; (1946), and &quot;Faithful in My Fashion&quot; (1946).

In 1946, Hickman played young Chase in the movie &quot;The Secret Heart&quot; which starred Claudette Colbert, Walter Pidgeon, Lionel Barrymore, and June Allyson.

Hickman played different small roles in some of Columbia Pictures&#x27; eight-film &quot;Rusty&quot; series, about a boy and his valiant German Shepherd: &quot;The Return of Rusty&quot; (1946), &quot;For the Love of Rusty&quot; (1947), &quot;The Son of Rusty&quot; (1947), &quot;My Dog Rusty&quot; (1948), &quot;Rusty Leads the Way&quot; (1948), &quot;Rusty&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1949), and &quot;Rusty Saves a Life&quot; (1949).

&quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; (1947), in which he appeared, starred Bob Cummings, who would play a major role in Hickman&#x27;s career. Hickman also appeared in &quot;Her Husband&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1948), &quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot; (1948), &quot;The Sun Comes Up&quot; (1949), &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Happy Years&quot; (1950), which starred Darryl. As a teen, Dwayne and Darryl guest-starred in a 1950 episode of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; titled &quot;Two Gold Lockets&quot;.

Hickman focused on his studies for a few more years, then returned to acting with appearances in &quot;Public Defender&quot;, &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Waterfront&quot;. In 1955, Dwayne appeared in another &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; episode, titled &quot;Sunstroke Mesa&quot;.

===&quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;===
Hickman gained wide notice as Chuck on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; from 1955 to 1959. At the time, he was studying at Loyola Marymount. Hickman was one of the early stars to have a breakout character in the series.

Hickman considered Cummings a childhood television hero and had said that Cummings taught him everything he knew about acting. He worked with and was friends with Cummings throughout five seasons.

While still on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, Hickman guest-starred on other shows, such as &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot; (alongside his brother). He also had a sizable film role in &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; (1958).

===&quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;===

In 1958, Hickman was cast as the lead of &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, which aired from 1959 to 1963. At the show&#x27;s debut, the Dobie character was a teenager in high school, and Hickman was then 25 years old.

He played Dobie for four years (with fellow former Loyola student Bob Denver as his sidekick Maynard G. Krebs).

During the series&#x27; run, Hickman did the voice for Aladdin in &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot; (1959). On June 23, 1960, Hickman appeared on &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;.

===Post–&quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;===
When &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; ended, Hickman found himself stereotyped as a &quot;youngster&quot; when he was too old for such roles.

He and Annette Funicello appeared together in an episode of the drama &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, starring Jack Palance. He also guest-starred on &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

In 1965, Hickman appeared in the comedy film &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; with Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin.

===American International Pictures===
Hickman signed a multi-picture deal with American International Pictures. For that studio he starred in &quot;Ski Party&quot; (1965) opposite Frankie Avalon; &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965) with Funicello; and &quot;Dr Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; (1965) with Avalon and Vincent Price. He also made a cameo in &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot; (1965).

===Television guest appearances===
Hickman appeared in the episode &quot;Run Sheep Run&quot; on &quot;Combat!&quot; as a soldier who froze during an attack by a German machine gun nest.

He had a supporting part in the 1967 comedy &quot;Doctor, You&#x27;ve Got to Be Kidding!&quot;. He starred in the 1967 pilot for &quot;We&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; and the 1968 pilot for &quot;Missy&#x27;s Men&quot;, but neither was picked up for broadcast.

Hickman also appeared as a guest panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1975. 

He guest-starred on &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot;; &quot;Ironside&quot;; &quot;Insight&quot;; &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;; &quot;My Friend Tony&quot;; &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; (&quot;My Dog, the Thief&quot;); &quot;Mod Squad&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Karen&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;. He reprised his most famous role in &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot;, a one-shot pilot, and appeared in the TV movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Push, I&#x27;ll Charge When I&#x27;m Ready&quot; (1977).

==Later career==
Hickman found his future in entertainment behind the scenes, becoming involved in production roles. From 1977 to 1988, Hickman served as a programming executive at CBS. He took time out for a cameo in the TV movie &quot;High School U.S.A.&quot; (1983).

Hickman reprised his role of Dobie in the TV movie &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1988). His autobiography is titled &quot;Forever Dobie&quot;. That year, he guest-starred on &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Hickman turned to directing episodic TV, doing episodes of &quot;Duet&quot;; &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;; &quot;Open House&quot;; &quot;Designing Women&quot;; &quot;Get a Life&quot;; &quot;Head of the Class&quot;; &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;; and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;.

He still occasionally acted, appearing in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998). He had a semi-regular role on the TV series &quot;Clueless&quot;.

He could be seen in &quot;Surviving Gilligan&#x27;s Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History&quot; and &quot;Angels with Angles&quot; (2005).

==Personal life and death==
Hickman was married three times. His first two marriages, to Carol Christensen and Joanne Papile, ended in divorce. He and his third wife, Joan Roberts, were married for 39 years until his death. He had two sons, one from his first marriage and one from his third.

<text>Right Said Fred are an English pop band formed by brothers Fred and Richard Fairbrass in 1989. They are best known for the hit 1991 song &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;. 

== History ==

===1989–1991: Formation===
Prior to forming Right Said Fred, the Fairbrass brothers had been playing music since the mid-1970s: as part of a band called the Actors, the brothers had toured with Suicide and supported Joy Division at the Factory club in Manchester.

The Fairbrass brothers formed the group in 1989, with Richard on lead vocals and bass and Fred on guitar. Prior to forming the group, Richard was employed as a session bassist for artists including Boy George, Mick Jagger and David Bowie, and appears as the bass guitarist in Bowie&#x27;s short film &quot;Jazzin&#x27; for Blue Jean&quot;. In 1987, Fred appeared as a guitarist in the Bob Dylan vehicle &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;.

The group was named after the novelty song &quot;Right Said Fred&quot;, which was a hit single for singer and actor Bernard Cribbins in 1962. The Fairbrass brothers were originally accompanied by drummer Ray Weston and guitarist Dan Kruse. Weston left in 1990 to join the progressive rock group Wishbone Ash and Kruse left the next year. Guitarist Rob Manzoli joined in 1990 and remained with the group until 1997.

===1991–1992: &quot;I’m Too Sexy&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;===
In July 1991, the group released its debut single and best-known song, &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;, on the independent London-based record label Tug Records. The Fairbrass brothers have stated that the song&#x27;s lyrics are centred on certain users of the gym they owned in London, who they claimed had no shame. &quot;A lot of models used our gym, so we thought it was time to start poking [fun] at them,&quot; Fred stated.

The song was a considerable hit in the United Kingdom, spending six weeks at number two in the charts behind Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, and three months in the Top 10. The song also went to number one in 32 countries, including the United States, where it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song earned the band a nomination for an Ivor Novello award. &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot; has subsequently been used in over 40 television shows and movies, including &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

Their second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk Just Kiss&quot;, with background vocals by soul singer Jocelyn Brown, was released in October 1991. It made number 3 in the United Kingdom Christmas charts, entered the top five in many countries, and reached number eight in the United States dance chart.

In February 1992, the band released its third single, &quot;Deeply Dippy&quot;. This was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks, and peaked at number nine in the United States dance chart.

The success of the singles resulted in the band&#x27;s multi-platinum debut album, &quot;Up&quot;, reaching number one in the United Kingdom album charts as well as charting worldwide. The album remained in the Top 40 for almost a year. In Germany a fifth single &quot;Love For All Seasons&quot; charted at # 65 in 1993.

In 1992, Heavenly Records released an EP that featured the label&#x27;s acts covering Right Said Fred songs for charity. &quot;The Fred EP&quot; contains Saint Etienne (performing &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;), The Rockingbirds (&quot;Deeply Dippy&quot;) and Flowered Up (&quot;Don&#x27;t Talk Just Kiss&quot;).

=== Remainder of the 1990s ===

==== 1993–1994: &quot;Sex and Travel&quot; ====
Early in 1993 Fred, Richard and Rob wrote and recorded the Comic Relief single &quot;Stick It Out&quot;, which was a top-five hit in the United Kingdom and in many European countries. In September 1993, Right Said Fred released its second album, &quot;Sex and Travel&quot;. &quot;Sex and Travel&quot; included the singles &quot;Bumped&quot; and &quot;Hands Up (for Lovers)&quot;. The band received its second Ivor Novello award for &quot;Deeply Dippy&quot; in 1993.

==== 1995–1996: &quot;Smashing!&quot; ====
Right Said Fred parted company with Tug Records and then released its third album, &quot;Smashing!&quot;, in 1996 on the band&#x27;s own label Happy Valley Records, including the singles &quot;Living on a Dream&quot;, &quot;Big Time&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves Me&quot;.

==== 1997–2001: Manzoli leaves, &quot;You’re My Mate&quot; and &quot;Fredhead&quot; ====
Rob Manzoli left the band on friendly terms in 1997. In 1998, Fred and Richard set up their own recording studio in London and started writing and recording what became the album &quot;Fredhead&quot;.

In 2000, Right Said Fred signed to Kingsize/BMG Berlin in Germany. The first single from &quot;Fredhead&quot; was &quot;You&#x27;re My Mate&quot; (co-written with hard rock guitarist Myke Gray. Other singles from &quot;Fredhead&quot; were &quot;Mojive&quot; (Ward) and &quot;Love Song&quot; (Agostino Carollo).

=== 21st century ===

==== 2002–2003: &quot;Stand Up&quot; ====
The second Kingsize/BMG album &quot;Stand Up&quot; was released in 2002. The lead single was &quot;Stand Up (For the Champions)&quot;, composed by Clyde Ward and the Fairbrass brothers.

==== 2004–2006: &quot;For Sale&quot; ====
Due to family ill-health, Fred and Richard took some time out from travelling to write and record the single &quot;We Are the Freds&quot; and the album &quot;For Sale&quot; for the Ministry of Sound. In late 2004, Right Said Fred toured extensively in Europe.

==== 2007–2010: &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot; ====

During 2007 and 2008, Fred and Richard collaborated with Clyde Ward to write and record their sixth album &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot;. The album was produced by Ward, and for the United States release, Right Said Fred worked with David Levine at Promark Music. In late July 2009, Right Said Fred released &quot;Sexy Bum&quot; in Germany, the first single from the band&#x27;s &quot;HITS!&quot; album. The band toured in support of the album in the United Kingdom and continental Europe.

==== 2011–2012: &quot;Sexaholic&quot; ====
Right Said Fred collaborated with Norwegian writers/producers Dsign Music to record &quot;Sexaholic&quot;, released in 2011. 

==== 2013–present: &quot;Raise Your Hands&quot; ====
Richard spoke at an Oxford Union debate. TV appearances included an acoustic performance on the UK’s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; TV show.

RSF began writing and recording new tracks with Paul Statham (Who had previously worked with artists such as: Dido, Jim Kerr, Kylie Minogue, The Saturdays). The band released the single &quot;Sweet Treats&quot; in January 2017 from the album &quot;Exactly!&quot; In August 2017, Right Said Fred&#x27;s members Richard Fairbrass and Fred Fairbrass, were credited as songwriters on the Taylor Swift single &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; alongside Jack Antonoff and Swift herself. The song&#x27;s chorus is an interpolation of the famous chorus from &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;.

In May 2022, Phoenix Music International released the band&#x27;s single &quot;Godsend&quot;, dubbing the duo the &#x27;UK’s most controversial band&#x27; after a number of anti-COVID-19 vaccine-themed Twitter posts and appearances in the press during the UK pandemic lockdowns. In 2022, they were involved in leafleting for British anti-climate change activist group, Not Our Future, in Oxford.

<text>Turramurra is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. It shares the postcode of 2074 with the adjacent suburbs of North Turramurra, South Turramurra and Warrawee.

==History==

Turramurra is an Aboriginal word which is thought to mean either &quot;high hill&quot;, &quot;big hill&quot;, &quot;high place&quot;, or &quot;small watercourse&quot;. The Aboriginal reference of high hill covered the range from Pymble to Turramurra. Early European settlers referred to the area as Eastern Road. 

The district was originally known as Big Island, Vanceville and Claraville (after names of estates or grants), and further north as Tulip Scrub from the large number of tulips or waratahs there. Turramurra means &quot;high hill&quot; or &quot;big hill&quot;. It was also known as Irish Town. More than 100 years ago remnants of a tribe of aboriginal people periodically travelled from the Lane Cove River to Cowan Creek and always broke their journey at what came to be called Wright&#x27;s Hill, near Pymble Reservoir, or just north of it.

The traditional owners called this place Turramurra or Turraburra (not to be confused with Turramburra, the native name for the Lane Cove River). As no railway station was made there, it was applied to the station in the vicinity.

The name Turramurra was adopted when the railway station was built in 1890.

One of the early local landmarks was &quot;Ingleholme&quot;, a two-storey Federation Queen Anne home in Boomerang Street. It was designed by John Sulman (1849–1934) as his own home and built . The house was part of the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College (now the Pymble Ladies&#x27; College) until 1977 and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999; and is on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate as a notable example of Sulman&#x27;s style. The Indian born diplomat Sir Henry Braddon&#x27;s home was &quot;Rohini&quot;, previously situated at the end of Rohini Street.

Turramurra Post Office opened on 16 August 1890.

After World War I, Turramurra underwent significant changes of suburban development. The construction of homes, particularly with the rise of the middle class, grew steadily. Large blocks of land were subdivided and new homes were built in a mixed style of California bungalow and Federation architecture, contributing to the area&#x27;s suburbanisation.

St Andrew&#x27;s in Kissing Point Road is an example of the Federation Carpenter Gothic style. In 1932, Lewy Pattinson, founder of Washington H. Soul Pattinson, gave the Presbyterian Church in NSW the land for Mission Hall, at what is now 106 Kissing Point Road. In 1936, ownership was transferred by Pattinson to St Margaret&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Turramurra.

A Turramurra East Post Office opened on 1 May 1959 and closed in 1993. The Turramurra North Post Office opened on 1 September 1953.

North Turramurra and South Turramurra became separate suburbs on 5 August 1994.

===Hillview===
The &quot;Hillview&quot; estate, situated on the Pacific Highway, started circa 1890 with a modest Federation cottage facing the highway. Later, the owner realised the commercial potential of the site, with its sweeping views, and built a grand, two-storey Federation home at the rear, to be used as a guesthouse, circa 1913. A large, six-car garage with a dwelling above it was added at the western end of the site in 1915. The estate was later leased out to Ku Ring Gai Hospital, Hornsby, to be used as the Hillview Community Health Centre. The entire estate is heritage-listed.

===Cooinoo===
The world-famous guest house, &quot;Cooinoo&quot; was situated on Kissing Point Road, only 300m from the Turramurra train station. It was built for William James Adams, heir to the Tattersalls fortune, and was used as a private residence until it became a genteel boarding house - described in 1931 as &quot;the most notable guest house on the picturesque north shore line&quot; by The Home magazine. It was 6 acres with a two story Edwardian-style brick house and exterior cottages to accommodate about 60 guests and a large live-in staff. It was at one point run by Miss Jean Murray, who at the time was already running the nearby &quot;Hillview&quot; estate. She sold it in 1929 for £30,000 to George Thompson. It was later sold to Stan Delaney around 1947. Cooinoo Guest house was demolished in the 1970s to build units.

<text>William S. Stallings was an American soccer forward who played professionally in the Major Indoor Soccer League and American Indoor Soccer Association. After leaving professional soccer, he worked as a real estate developer in St. Louis, Missouri.

Stallings graduated from Rosary High School in St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Southern Illinois University Edwardsville where he played on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1981 to 1984. He was a 1984 Third Team All American and led the team in scoring in 1983 and 1984.

In June 1985, the St. Louis Steamers selected Stallings in the first round of the Major Indoor Soccer League draft. He played one season for the Steamers before being released. He then played ten games with the Fort Wayne Flames of the American Indoor Soccer Association during the 1986–1987 season before retiring from professional soccer.

==Retirement==
Stallings became an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). After two years working drug and firearms cases, Stallings left the ATF.

He returned to St. Louis in 1989 and became a real estate developer in partnership with his father. He was instrumental in the renovation of the Chase Park Plaza in 1999 but was also convicted twice for financial misconduct; on the second occasion he served two months in federal prison. In November 2002 an unidentified person fired three bullets at Stallings&#x27; home in St. Louis. Stallings died in his sleep on August 12, 2010.

<text>North Station is a commuter rail and intercity rail terminal station in Boston, Massachusetts. It is served by four MBTA Commuter Rail lines – the Fitchburg Line, Haverhill Line, Lowell Line, and Newburyport/Rockport Line – and the Amtrak intercity service. The concourse is located under the TD Garden arena, with the platforms extending north towards drawbridges over the Charles River. The eponymous subway station, served by the Green Line and Orange Line, is connected to the concourse with an underground passageway.

== Description ==

The concourse of the station, named for longtime Boston Celtics coach and executive Red Auerbach, is located under the TD Garden arena, with two entrances from Causeway Street, as well as entrances from Nashua Street to the west. Five island platforms serving ten tracks run north from the concourse. Just north of the platforms, a pair of two-track drawbridges cross the Charles River. Eight commuter rail lines and three Amtrak services terminate at South Station about to the south, with no direct rail link between the two stations. The proposed North–South Rail Link would link the two halves of the commuter rail system, with new underground platforms at both stations.

North Station is accessible on all modes. MBTA bus route runs on Causeway Street, with stops near Canal Street. The EZRide Shuttle loops on Red Auerbach Way with a stop near the secondary entrance to North Station.

Lovejoy Wharf, located off Beverly Street northeast of North Station, is the head of navigation of the Charles River due to the adjacent Charles River Dam. It is served by water taxi services to Logan Airport and the Boston waterfront by two private companies, and a Lovejoy Wharf – Fan Pier ferry route.
== History ==
=== Previous stations ===

The four major northside railroads originally built separate terminal stations in Boston. The Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&amp;L) was the first to open, with service beginning on June 24, 1835. The first station was built later in 1835 along Lowell Street (now Lomasney Way) and was several blocks north of Causeway Street. A new station was built at Causeway Street east of Nashua Street in 1857, with the original depot converted to a freight house. An even larger third station on the Causeway Street site, constructed of brick with towers at the front corners, was opened on November 24, 1873.

The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) opened in July 1845, with a temporary station at Canal and Traverse streets. The permanent station, opened on October 20, was between Canal and Haverhill streets and fronted on Haymarket Square. Trains had to cross busy Causeway Street to reach the station; at first, a city ordinance required the railroad to pull cars across the street with oxen rather than locomotives. In 1867, the station was extended northwards from Market Street to Traverse Street.

The 1843-opened Fitchburg Railroad originally terminated in Charlestown, near the north end of the Warren Bridge. On August 9, 1848, the railroad opened a new station with large Norman style towers at Causeway Street, just east of the B&amp;M tracks. The second floor was the largest auditorium in New England at the time; it was the site of two performances by Jenny Lind in October 1850 during her tour of the United States.

The Eastern Railroad opened in 1838 with an East Boston terminal; ferries carried passengers between there and Lewis Wharf in Boston. On April 10, 1854, the railroad opened its Boston terminal on Causeway Street opposite Friend Street – west of the B&amp;M tracks and east of the soon-to-be-built B&amp;L station. This &quot;temporary&quot; station was destroyed by fire on June 21, 1862. The brick replacement station, completed the next year, &quot;had a reputation of being dirty, unattractive, and uninviting.&quot;

=== North Union Station ===

The B&amp;M leased the Eastern in 1884, though it continued to use its own terminal. As a condition of the B&amp;M&#x27;s 1887 lease of the B&amp;L, the state required the B&amp;M to construct a union station for use by the combined B&amp;M system plus the Fitchburg. After years of resistance by the B&amp;M, construction on North Union Station began in 1893. The station was built as an eastward expansion of the B&amp;L station, with a total frontage of on Causeway Street. The center of the new facade was an -high granite triumphal arch flanked by four massive columns. The east side was formed by a five-story baggage and express building. The station was designed by the firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, which designed South Station several years later.

The new station was opened in stages from August 1893 to June 1894. The Eastern depot had been demolished in 1893 to allow construction to proceed. The B&amp;M depot was demolished in 1897, with the site used for the Canal Street incline of the Tremont Street subway. The Fitchburg was leased by the B&amp;M in 1900, after which the former Fitchburg depot was used as the B&amp;M offices. By that time, the station was popularly known as &quot;North Station&quot;. The former Fitchburg depot burned on January 17, 1925; it was demolished in 1926–28.
=== North Station ===

In 1926, the B&amp;M began work on an expansion and modernization of the freight yards north of North Station in Somerville. The next November, the railroad announced plans for a new North Station complex. Demolition of the old station began the next month. The partially-complete station was opened on August 19, 1928; it was formally opened on November 14, 1928 – one year after the original announcement.

The new station had 22 tracks paired around island platforms, largely similar to its previous configuration. The concourse was topped with the Boston Garden arena, with a 14-story office building to the east and a hotel to the west. (Early plans had called for these to be integrated into the station like the arena.) The complex fronted on Causeway Street for from Nashua Street to Beverly Street. A project lasting from August 26, 1930 to mid-1931 rebuilt the approach to the station, with four new drawbridges crossing a relocated Charles River channel.
Until the 1960s, the station was the hub for long-distance B&amp;M service to multiple locales north and west of Boston, usually in conjunction with other railroads. Service cutbacks began in the 1950s, and service soon dwindled down to commuter rail operations. The last intercity service to Portland, Maine and to north of Concord, New Hampshire ended on January 4, 1965. By this point, the intercity train itineraries consisted of self-propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars, often just one or two cars for the trip. Single commuter-oriented daily round trips on these routes to Concord and Dover, New Hampshire lasted until June 30, 1967. (Limited MBTA Commuter Rail service to Concord was run from January 28, 1980 to March 1, 1981 as part of a federally funded experiment.) In the 1960s, the B&amp;M removed two drawbridges and cut the station to ten tracks. The south end of the platforms were removed to make room for a parking lot.

=== MBTA era ===
==== New station ====

On January 20, 1984, a fire destroyed the wooden trestles leading to the North Station drawbridges. Temporary terminals were soon established: Haverhill/Reading trains terminated at , Rockport/Ipswich trains at a temporary platform at , and Lowell and Gardner trains at a temporary station near . On June 28, 1984, the MBTA awarded a $11.3 million contract for construction of replacement trestles plus new tracks and platforms. The rebuilt station opened on April 20, 1985. On March 29, 1989, the MBTA awarded a $13.7 million construction contract to raise the five commuter rail platforms for accessibility. (Until then, a modified forklift was used as a mobile lift.) Groundbreaking was held for the underground garage on June 25, 1990, followed by the platform project on July 12. However, the nearest accessible subway transfer was State station over half a mile away; not until 2001 were the North Station and Haymarket subway stations made accessible.

In February 1993, the state reached a deal with a developer for the replacement of the aging Boston Garden. In exchange for the land and easements to construct the FleetCenter, the developer would construct a new train shed and waiting area on the ground floor of the new arena. The MBTA would also be granted easements for a Green Line tunnel under the arena to replace the Causeway Street Elevated, for a combined underground &quot;superstation&quot; for the Green and Orange lines, and for pedestrian access to North Station. The FleetCenter, North Station concourse, and garage opened in 1995.

Two MBTA Boat routes – the F3 Lovejoy Wharf – Boston Navy Yard and F5 Lovejoy Wharf – World Trade Center via Moakley Courthouse – began operation in 1997 during Big Dig construction. They were discontinued on January 21, 2005 due to low ridership. The F5X Lovejoy Wharf – World Trade Center Express route, which did not rely on MBTA funding, was run until February 24, 2006. A one-year pilot of the privately funded Fan Pier route, intended mostly as a private employee shuttle, began in January 2019.

In 2001, intercity service returned to North Station with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot; to Portland, Maine (later extended to Brunswick). In April 2006, the MBTA announced plans for an enlargement of the waiting area at North Station. The project covered over the southern of the platforms, adding of waiting and retail space. The $5 million project was completed in February 2007. Two large train information displays, with electronic noises to imitate Solari boards, were added in November 2007.

Beginning in early 2016, Boston Properties built &#x27;The Hub On Causeway&#x27;, a mixed-use development including two towers, on the former Boston Garden site. The development included a new entrance to the rail station from Causeway Street opposite Canal Street, plus an underground passageway from the rail station to the subway station. The passageway opened on January 6, 2019. Installation of fare gates on the North Station concourse began on March 24, 2022. The gates were activated on October 1, 2022.

==== Drawbridge replacement ====
The two aging two-track drawbridges at North Station are planned to be replaced by three new two-track spans, which will be more reliable and have higher capacity. The unfinished sixth platform will be completed to serve long out-of-service tracks 11 and 12, the Fitchburg mainline will be slightly relocated to provide more layover space near the maintenance facility, and FX interlocking will be reconfigured. The signals contract associated with the new drawbridges was awarded in May 2019. By November 2022, signal work was expected to be completed in August 2023. Design of the new vertical lift bridges began in 2019 and was 75% complete by May 2023, with design completion expected in 2024. In September 2024, the MBTA was awarded a $472 million federal grant for the bridge replacement. The draft environmental assessment was released in December 2024, with bridge construction expected to last from 2026 to 2034. Platform F construction is expected to take place from 2025 to 2027, and track and interlocking work from 2025 to 2028. The MBTA began procurement of a design-build contractor in early 2025. Award of the approximately-$1-billion contract is expected by December 2025.

<doc id="968591" wikidata="Q778947" url="?curid=968591" title="Writhe">
<text>In knot theory, there are several competing notions of the quantity writhe, or formula_1. In one sense, it is purely a property of an oriented link diagram and assumes integer values. In another sense, it is a quantity that describes the amount of &quot;coiling&quot; of a mathematical knot (or any closed simple curve) in three-dimensional space and assumes real numbers as values. In both cases, writhe is a geometric quantity, meaning that while deforming a curve (or diagram) in such a way that does not change its topology, one may still change its writhe.

== Writhe of link diagrams ==
In knot theory, the writhe is a property of an oriented link diagram. The writhe is the total number of positive crossings minus the total number of negative crossings.

A direction is assigned to the link at a point in each component and this direction is followed all the way around each component. For each crossing one comes across while traveling in this direction, if the strand underneath goes from right to left, the crossing is positive; if the lower strand goes from left to right, the crossing is negative. One way of remembering this is to use a variation of the right-hand rule.
For a knot diagram, using the right-hand rule with either orientation gives the same result, so the writhe is well-defined on unoriented knot diagrams.
The writhe of a knot is unaffected by two of the three Reidemeister moves: moves of Type II and Type III do not affect the writhe. Reidemeister move Type I, however, increases or decreases the writhe by 1. This implies that the writhe of a knot is &quot;not&quot; an isotopy invariant of the knot itself — only the diagram. By a series of Type I moves one can set the writhe of a diagram for a given knot to be any integer at all.

== Writhe of a closed curve ==
Writhe is also a property of a knot represented as a curve in three-dimensional space. Strictly speaking, a knot is such a curve, defined mathematically as an embedding of a circle in three-dimensional Euclidean space, formula_2. By viewing the curve from different vantage points, one can obtain different projections and draw the corresponding knot diagrams. Its writhe formula_1 (in the space curve sense) is equal to the average of the integral writhe values obtained from the projections from all vantage points. Hence, writhe in this situation can take on any real number as a possible value.

In a paper from 1961, Gheorghe Călugăreanu proved the following theorem: take a ribbon in formula_2, let formula_5 be the linking number of its border components, and let formula_6 be its total twist. Then the difference formula_7 depends only on the core curve of the ribbon, and
:formula_8.

In a paper from 1959, Călugăreanu also showed how to calculate the writhe Wr with an integral. Let formula_9 be a smooth, simple, closed curve and let formula_10 and formula_11 be points on formula_9. Then the writhe is equal to the Gauss integral

:formula_13.

== Numerically approximating the Gauss integral for writhe of a curve in space ==
Since writhe for a curve in space is defined as a double integral, we can approximate its value numerically by first representing our curve as a finite chain of formula_14 line segments. A procedure that was first derived by Michael Levitt for the description of protein folding and later used for supercoiled DNA by Konstantin Klenin and Jörg Langowski is to compute

:formula_15 is the exact evaluation of the double integral over line segments formula_16 and formula_17; note that formula_18 and formula_19.

To evaluate formula_20 for given segments numbered formula_16 and formula_17, number the endpoints of the two segments 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let formula_23 be the vector that begins at endpoint formula_24 and ends at endpoint formula_25. Define the following quantities:

:formula_26

Then we calculate

:formula_27

Finally, we compensate for the possible sign difference and divide by formula_28 to obtain

:formula_29

In addition, other methods to calculate writhe can be fully described mathematically and algorithmically, some of them outperform method above (which has quadratic computational complexity, by having linear complexity).

== Applications in DNA topology ==
DNA will coil when twisted, just like a rubber hose or a rope will, and that is why biomathematicians use the quantity of &quot;writhe&quot; to describe the amount a piece of DNA is deformed as a result of this torsional stress. In general, this phenomenon of forming coils due to writhe is referred to as DNA supercoiling and is quite commonplace, and in fact in most organisms DNA is negatively supercoiled.

Any elastic rod, not just DNA, relieves torsional stress by coiling, an action which simultaneously untwists and bends the rod. F. Brock Fuller shows mathematically how the “elastic energy due to local twisting of the rod may be reduced if the central curve of the rod forms coils that increase its writhing number”.

<doc id="968596" wikidata="Q4454524" url="?curid=968596" title="Rail stressing">
<text>Stressing is a rail engineering process. It is used to prevent heat and cold tension after installation of continuous welded rail (CWR). Environmental heat causes CWR to expand and therefore can cause the fixed track to buckle. Environmental cold can lead to the contraction of the fixed railway track causing brittleness and cracks. Before it is installed, the rail is altered by stretching with hydraulic tensors or heated to its stress-free temperature to make these dangerous problems less likely.

==Background==
Railway steel contracts at low temperatures and expands at high temperatures. In extreme cold, a length of CWR suffers tensile stress. This stress can cause railway steel to fracture. In extreme heat, a length of CWR suffers compressive stress. This type of stress can cause sun kink where a length of a railway buckles laterally (sideways). Other factors that affect CWR condition include the state of the track ballast and its shoulders; the type and placement of the sleepers; places of increased shadow such as tunnels and bridges; track consolidation; and, to a lesser degree, the vertical curvature of the tracks.

In the design and installation of CWR, a figure known as the &quot;rail neutral temperature&quot; (RNT) is calculated. The tensile and compressive longitudinal forces on the CWR are added. The RNT is the notional temperature when the total equals zero. A similar figure is the &quot;stress free temperature&quot; (SFT). It is the rail temperature at which the rail is the same length as in its unrestrained state.

==Engineering solutions==

Before laying new track, repairing track, or changing the sleepers, the rail is mechanically or thermally altered (stressed) so that its length equals the same at a chosen stress-free temperature; the rail can then be fixed in place with no thermal forces in effect. The stress-free temperature that is used is dependent on environmental extremes and thus varies with location. In the United Kingdom, CWR is stressed to , the mean summer rail temperature. In the US, standard stress free temperatures vary from . Despite stressing the CWR before installation, a rail may still reach its &quot;Critical Rail Temperature&quot; (CRT). This is the temperature of the rail above which buckling may occur.

The CRT may be reached due to disturbance of the ballast, track components or track geometry. For example, the CRT may be reached due to a removal of a rail section or an Insulated Block Joint (IBJ). A stressing engineer measures the rail section to be removed and places indicators with marks on the foot of the rails. After the rail section is cut out, its first stress free temperature is determined. The new rail section is cut and replaced and then welded at one end. A &quot;stressing kit&quot; (hydraulic rail tensor), such as the Permaquip HSM70 Stressor, or other method is used to adjust the other end and make the join ready for welding. If a section of rail must be replaced urgently, a stress check is performed later on.

A more recent engineering solution is &quot;VERSE&quot; testing equipment produced by the company, Vortok in 1998. It allows rail engineers to measure stress-free temperature without removing a section of rail. Vortok is Pandrol Vortok now.

<doc id="968599" wikidata="Q2240072" url="?curid=968599" title="Johnstone">
<text>Johnstone (, ) is a town in the administrative area of Renfrewshire and larger historic county of the same name, in the west central Lowlands of Scotland.

The town lies west of neighbouring Paisley, west of the centre of the city of Glasgow and north east of Kilwinning. Part of the biggest conurbation in Scotland, Johnstone is at the western edge of the Greater Glasgow Urban Area.

==History==

Johnstone was largely a planned community which grew up around the house of Easter Cochrane, later known as Johnstone Castle, seat of the Houston or Houstoun family who gained their name from the nearby village of Houston. In 1782, the Laird, George Houstoun, commissioned designs for a series of regular residential streets, which now form the town centre. At this early stage of development, the town&#x27;s population including the local estate and rural hinterland was around 1,500. Two mirroring civic squares were also constructed in the town: Houstoun Square and Ludovic Square, the latter named for the Laird&#x27;s son, and by 1794 the town had gained its current parish church. Johnstone was raised to the status of a police burgh with significant local powers, a status which is now defunct. The former court building continues to stand in Collier Street.

Industrial development brought both prosperity and poverty to the community. Coal mining occurred in Johnstone, although its main industry was related to the thread and cotton industries, with mills powered by the Black Cart Water which runs to the north of Johnstone. A six-storey cotton mill, one of the largest in Scotland, was built in 1782, and was rescued from failure by Robert Burns of Paisley sometime before 1812. Burns introduced Richard Arkwright&#x27;s methods for spinning cotton. As the community expanded, slum conditions formed in part of the town: the population by 1831 had increased to a sizeable 5,600. Unfortunately, the owners of Johnstone mill did not make much philanthropic progress among their worker population, and the situation was not addressed until the 1930s by a significant expansion of the size of Johnstone to include a number of purpose-built residential estates.

Much of Johnstone&#x27;s feudal heritage has disappeared. With the death of the last Laird in 1931, Johnstone Castle fell into disrepair before being largely demolished in 1950. The remaining tower was purchased in 2001 and is now a private residence. On the site of the former grounds now lies two housing estates, Johnstone Castle and Cochrane Castle. Embedded within Cochrane Castle is the Cochrane Castle Golf Club, which once held the world record for the longest hole.

More recently, Johnstone History Museum opened in 2008 – notably becoming the world&#x27;s first museum located inside a supermarket.

In 2015, the new Town Hall was completed at a cost of £14.5m.

The town is home to Johnstone Pipe Band who compete in the highest level of pipe band competitions, Grade 1. The band was founded in 1943 and wears the Blue Mackay tartan.

==Education==
Thorn Public School, as it was originally called, opened in 1904. A new Thorn primary school opened in 1988, the same year that the former building was demolished. The old site is now occupied by a housing estate, although parts of the original walls are still standing. In 1950 St. David&#x27;s Primary School was built along with its sister school Cochrane Castle Primary School. In 2007 the two schools were housed in a new shared building nearby, &#x27;West Johnstone Shared Campus&#x27;, just outside Thomas Shanks Public Park, the locations of the original schools (between Dundonald Avenue and Craigview Avenue) remain overgrown &#x27;gap sites&#x27; awaiting redevelopment.

Johnstone High School opened on its current site off Beith Road in March 1965, the previous building in Ludovic Square having burnt down in 1960 (there is now a modern health centre on its site). Its redeveloped campus opened in late 2009.

The original St Cuthberts High School was built adjacent to Johnstone High School and shared the same driveway and car parks. The school closed in 1972 and moved to a new site in Hallhill Road, Spateston that year. The original school was demolished and replaced by a housing development to the left of the driveway of Johnstone High School. The school at Spateston closed at the end of the summer term of 2006 along with St Brendan&#x27;s High School in Linwood due to falling rolls and the buildings&#x27; poor state of repair. These were replaced by a new build St Benedict&#x27;s High School at Linwood (named in honour of St Benedict of Nursia, the patron saint of Europe and of students). The old St Cuthbert&#x27;s building was used to house several schools while their own premises were being refurbished (including Johnstone High School from 2008 to 2009). It was also subsequently demolished in 2010 and has since been replaced by new housing.

==Religion== 
The town contains churches of several Christian denominations: three Church of Scotland, two Roman Catholic, one Scottish Episcopal Church, one Evangelical and one Baptist. 

==Sports==
The town is home to the Johnstone Burgh and Thorn Athletic football teams, which currently play in the Premier and Third Divisions of the West of Scotland Football League respectively.

==Politics==

The town is split between the Johnstone South and Elderslie and Johnstone North, Kilbarchan, Howwood and Lochwinnoch wards for elections to Renfrewshire Council, which elect four councillors each using the Single Transferable Vote. The 2022 Renfrewshire Council election saw councillors elected across the two wards being four Labour Party, three Scottish National Party (SNP) and one Independent.

For elections to the Scottish Parliament, Johnstone is included in the constituency of Renfrewshire South, currently held by SNP politician Tom Arthur since 2016. Johnstone is also included in the West Scotland region which elects seven additional members. In the UK Parliament the town is contained within the seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire South, represented by the Labour Party&#x27;s Johanna Baxter since the 2024 general election.

==Transport==
===Air===
Johnstone is served by Glasgow International Airport, which is located northeast of the town. Moreover, Prestwick International Airport is a 30-to-40-minute train journey from Johnstone railway station.

===Road===
A dual carriageway, the A737, connects Johnstone to the M8 motorway to provide car transport links to central Scotland.

===Bus services===
McGill&#x27;s Bus Service Limited operate the majority of local services from their depot in the west end of Johnstone, running the following routes serving the town
* 1/1A: Johnstone – Kilmacolm
* 2/2A: Johnstone – Bridge of Weir
* 20: Johnstone – Paisley (via Cochrane Castle, Johnstone Castle, Elderslie and the Royal Alexandria Hospital)
* 30: Johnstone - Spateston
* 32: Johnstone - Kilbarchan
* 38: Glasgow – Paisley – Johnstone - Spateston/Kilbarchan
* 307: Johnstone - Lochwinnoch
* 904: Largs – Kilbirnie – Beith – Howwood – Johnstone – Paisley

Shuttle Buses, based in Kilwinning, Ayrshire runs the following services:
* 1: Johnstone – Johnstone Castle
* 4: Johnstone – Lochwinnoch
* 5: Johnstone – Spateston

===Rail===
Johnstone is linked to Glasgow Central, Paisley and the Ayrshire coast by the Johnstone railway station which is located at the east of the town on Thorn Brae. A second unmanned station Milliken Park railway station lies at the west end of the town, just off the Cochranemill road.
The railway line runs through the cutting of the old Glasgow–Ardrossan Canal, although the route of the canal runs under the original bridge, Dick&#x27;s Bridge, at the bottom of the Thorn Brae, where the canal basin was situated and in winter, the rim of the canal basin sometimes becomes visible.

It may be noted that a second railway line ran through the town serving the villages of Kilbarchan, Bridge of Weir, and Kilmacolm; the line now forms part of the Clyde to Forth cycle route (National Cycle Route 75). It had a station serving the Northern, more industrial areas of town, Johnstone North railway station.

<text>Andong (; ) is a city in South Korea, and the capital of North Gyeongsang Province. It is the largest city in the northern part of the province with a population of 167,821 as of October 2010. The Nakdong River flows through the city. Andong is a market centre for the surrounding agricultural areas.

Since the 1970s Andong has developed rapidly, although the population has fallen by nearly seventy thousand as people have moved away to Seoul, Busan, Daegu and other urban centres. In the late 1990s and early 2000s it became a tourism and cultural center.

Andong is known as a centre of culture and folk traditions. The surrounding area maintains many types of traditions and the Andong Folk Festival is held in mid October every year. One of the most famous aspects of these cultural festivities are the Andong masks.

Andong National University, specialising in education and Korean folklore, has grown rapidly since the 1970s. Other tertiary institutions include Andong Science College and Catholic Sangji College.

==History==

Around 1 BC, Andong was founded by the Jinhan people, and it was known as Gochang. During the Three Kingdoms period, the area was controlled by the Silla kingdom. The Battle of Gochang in 930 was fought here between Hubaekje forces and the Goryeo army led by Wanggeon, who won control of the city and renamed it Andong.

After the ascent of the Joseon dynasty to the throne of Korea, Andong became a centre of Confucianism. The area was extremely conservative for a long time and produced many leading confucian scholars. Toe-gye Yi Hwang (1501–1570), one of the most prominent of all Korean scholars, came from Andong. Yi Hwang retired back to his homeland late in life and started the establishment of the great Confucian academy Dosan Seowon there, which was finished after his death. During this period Andong and its principal families were influential within Korean political circles, of which the three notable families were the Andong Kim, Andong Jang and Andong Kwon clans.

After the 16th century Andong became less influential until the early 19th century, when a marriage of the local Kim family resulted in strong influence on the royal family.

Andong was the site of intense fighting during the Korean War in the early 1950s, the Battle of Andong. Although the city was almost destroyed, it was quickly rebuilt. In 1976 the Andong Dam was built, providing the city with a reliable source of electricity.

In 1999, Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom celebrated her 73rd birthday in the city. There is an exhibit dedicated to this historic visit at Hahoe folk village museum. Andong soju is made using traditional methods that are centuries old unlike its popular modern counterparts. It is protected by government regulation to preserve authenticity and commands a steep premium in the marketplace.

== Administrative divisions ==
Andong is divided into 1 eup, 13 myeon and 10 dong. The following is a list of eup, myeon and dong:
==Local specialty foods==

Andong has famous local foods that originated in the city such as &quot;heotjesabap&quot;, &quot;Andong jjimdak&quot;, &quot;Andong soju&quot; (a rice wine), &quot;Andong sikhye&quot; (a punch), &quot;Geonjin guksu&quot; (a noodle dish), and salted mackerel.

&quot;Heotjesabap&quot; () is a variety of &quot;bibimbap&quot;, served with soy sauce (&quot;ganjang&quot;) instead of the &quot;gochujang&quot; (hot pepper paste) that is more commonly used. &quot;Heotjesa bab&quot; consists mainly of several types of &quot;namul&quot; (young sprouted vegetables) over white rice. It is also served with grilled fish, shark, and &quot;jeon&quot; (Korean pancake). The dish originated in Andong. The term, &quot;Heotjesa bap&quot; literally means &quot;dishes for fake &quot;jesa&quot;&quot; that are ceremonies for death anniversary and ancestor veneration held in Korea. The reason it is considered fake is that it is not covered in incense ash, as would happen to any food sacrificed in a jesa ritual.

&quot;Andong jjimdak&quot; is a variety of &quot;jjim&quot; (a Korean steamed or braised dish), made with chicken, cellophane noodles, and various vegetables marinated in a &quot;ganjang&quot; (Korean soy sauce) based sauce. The name literally means &quot;steamed chicken of Andong.&quot; There are many speculations on the origins of the dish. One is that the it is a specialty food of the inner rich village of Andong during the Joseon period, prepared and eaten for special occasions. The more likely explanation is that during the 1980s in the &quot;Dak golmok&quot; () of the &quot;Andong Old Market,&quot; restaurant owners there made a dish including ingredients that regulars demanded, which became the current &quot;Andong jjimdak&quot;. Restaurateurs in the area claim it was invented by five local old women who had limited chicken supplies and wanted to stretch it out. The most plausible speculation among existing assumptions is that merchants of the &quot;Dak golmok&quot; at the market created the dish to keep their position against the rapid expansion of Western fried chicken shops.

&quot;Andong Soju&quot; is a specialty of the region. It is made with natural ingredients, unlike mass-produced brands, it was historically used for medicinal purposes, and was developed during the Silla period. The traditions of Andong Soju were almost lost during the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s due to government legislation, but they were brought back by Cho Ok-hwa, the current skillholder. Andong soju was traditionally made by the wife of a household, and she passed down the secrets to her daughters-in-law.

&quot;Mackerel&quot; is another popular local delicacy. Caught downstream where the Nakdong River meets the sea, in ancient times the fish would spoil before being brought further inland. Using special salting techniques, Andong was the furthest inland the fish could be brought, so aristocrats would travel to Andong specially for the salted fish.

&quot;Sikhye&quot; is a fermented rice punch served across Korea. The Andong variety, however, is particularly spicy, made with powdered red pepper, ginger, and radish. Sikhye contains lactobacillus, a benign strain of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract, and often used as a digestive aid in dishes including kimchi, yogurt, and sauerkraut, among others.

<doc id="968607" wikidata="Q611627" url="?curid=968607" title="Breather switch">
<text>A breather switch, expansion joint, or adjustment switch is an intentional gap in railway tracks to allow for thermal expansion in long sections of otherwise unbroken rail. They are placed between very long sections of continuous welded rail or at the transition from continuous welded rail to jointed track, and commonly in the vicinity of bridges, viaducts and tunnels where the infrastructure and track may expand at different rates.

The mating sections are tapered diagonally (unlike a butt joint between two lengths of rail), allowing smoother transitions and higher speeds across the gap.

Breather switches have two advantages over jointed track: they greatly reduce the small gap between the rails, eliminating or significantly reducing the noise and vibration caused by passing trains, and, where continuous welded rail is particularly prone to expansion, they act as relief points to ensure that track does not warp out of shape or result in a sun kink.

<doc id="968608" wikidata="Q42078" url="?curid=968608" title="Gimcheon">
<text>Gimcheon (; ) is a city in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is situated on the major land transportation routes between Seoul and Busan, namely the Gyeongbu Expressway and Gyeongbu Line railway.

In ancient times, Gimcheon was famous for its three mountains (Geumo, Daedeok, Hwangak) and two rivers (Gamcheon, Jikjicheon). During the Chosun Dynasty, Gimcheon had one of the five largest markets in the region. The town has also served as the gateway and traffic hub of the Yeongnam region and is particularly proud of its patriots, history and conservative lifestyle.

The slogan of Gimcheon is &#x27;Central Gimcheon&#x27;, a recognition of the fact that it is situated almost at the center of South Korea.

* 1998 : arrangement of 13-dongs in Gimcheon city into 9-dongs (1-eup, 14-myeons, 9-dongs), arrangement of 9-dongs in Gimcheon city into 8-dongs (1-eup, 14-myeons, 8-dongs).

==Culture and sightseeing==
===Sights===

Gimcheon&#x27;s claim to fame is the temple Jikjisa (), located at the foot of the mountain Hwangaksan. The temple was constructed in 418 (the 2nd year of King Nulji&#x27;s reign, Silla Dynasty). Jikjisa is an important head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. This temple is in perfect harmony with the nearby valley and pine forest. The foliage in fall is particularly breathtaking. It features Birojeon Hall (also known as &#x27;Cheonbuljeon Hall&#x27;), in which approximately 1,000 Buddha statues are enshrined, along with a thousand year old arrowroot. Iljumun Gate, Daeungjeon Hall (one of the most famous architectural structures of the Joseon Dynasty) and a 1.63m-tall Seated Stone Buddhist Statue (Treasures No. 319) from the Unified Silla Period, can also be found on the temple grounds.

Jikjisa is believed to have been first constructed by the Goguryeo monk Ado in the year 418, long before Buddhism gained general acceptance in Silla. Jikjisa was largely destroyed during the Seven Year War in the 1590s. The reconstruction of the temple spanned from 1610 to about 1670.

Jikjisa is possibly one of the oldest temples in South Korea and it is relatively well-connected to a convenient train and bus service. Jikjisa Station is located at the foot of the mountain, along the Gyeongbu Line railroad. It is served only by local commuter trains, which run twice daily in each direction. Overnight or weekend temple stay programs are available at the main complex.

Temple admission fees:
Adults: 2,500 won
Youth: 1,500 won
Children: 1,000 won
＊Free: ages under 6 and over 65

Directions to Jikjisa:
- Dong Seoul Terminal to Gimcheon (Departure 3 times a day (10:10, 14:10, 18:10), 3 hour ride).
- Get on the bus (No. 11, No. 111) to Jikjisa Temple at Gimcheon Station or Gimcheon Bus Terminal(25 minute ride).

===Hiking &amp; mountains===

Mt. Hwangaksan (1,111m in elevation), home of Jikjisa, is located in the Sobaeksan Mountains. The area is a habitat for many cranes that reside on this mountain. This location is also known for its pine forests, streams, fall foliage and snowscapes.

From the KTX station to Gimcheon Train Station (the main downtown shopping center) via taxi, it is roughly a 15,000 to 20,000₩ expense.

==Community and expat information==

In 2004, it was reported that the population was 144,587, including 143,527 Koreans and 1,060 non-Koreans.

While Gimcheon is much smaller compared to its nearby counterparts, there is a sizeable expat community scattered amongst the seven district neighborhoods. As of 2013, there are an estimated 40 to 60 expats residing within the city limits, most employed as English teachers through the government run EPIK (English Program in Korea) and TaLK programs.

<doc id="968609" wikidata="Q694685" url="?curid=968609" title="Company sergeant major">
<text>The company sergeant major (CSM) is the senior non-commissioned soldier of a company in the armies of many Commonwealth countries, responsible for administration, standards and discipline. In combat, their prime responsibility is the supply of ammunition to the company. They also oversee the distribution of other supplies, such as water or food, although that responsibility is mainly that of the company quartermaster sergeant (CQMS), and evacuating the wounded and collecting prisoners of war.

For military units of the same level as a company, the equivalent may be squadron sergeant major (SSM) or battery sergeant major (BSM). In the Household Cavalry, squadron corporal major (SCM) is the equivalent. First sergeant and &quot;Kompaniefeldwebel&quot; (formerly &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot; in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot;) are the United States Army and German Heer equivalents respectively.

==Australia==
In the Australian Army, the CSM appointment is the senior warrant officer of a sub-unit (company, squadron or battery) and is normally held by a warrant officer class 2. The CSM is a senior management role focusing on the training, welfare and discipline of a sub-unit of up to 200 soldiers. They also act as senior adviser to the sub-unit commander. The appointment is known as the Company Sergeant-Major (CSM) in all sub-units except for the following:
*Squadron Sergeant-Major (SSM) in Armoured, Aviation, Engineer and Signal sub-units
*Artificer Sergeant-Major (ASM) in RAEME sub-units
*Battery Sergeant-Major (BSM) in Artillery sub-units

==Canada==
In the Canadian Forces, the CSM appointment is normally held by a master warrant officer. The appointment is sometimes held by a warrant officer, responsible for a smaller number of personnel.

In the Canadian Forces, the SSM/BSM/CSM is referred to as &quot;Sir/Ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates, or as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;. Superiors refer to him/her generally as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; or &quot;CSM&quot;. If the position is held by a warrant officer, subordinates will usually still address the individual as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;.

==Singapore==
In the Singapore Armed Forces, the CSM appointment is usually held by a staff sergeant, master sergeant (the usual rank for a CSM of a non-HQ company) or second warrant officer (the usual rank for a CSM of a battalion or brigade HQ company). He may be addressed as &quot;CSM&quot; by superiors, and as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; (for a staff sergeant or master sergeant) or &quot;encik&quot; (for a second warrant officer) by subordinates. The CSM is often respectfully addressed by all as &quot;Encik&quot;, Malay for &quot;Mister&quot;, but the permission for junior enlisted men to do so should not be taken for granted.

Training schools sometimes refer to companies as &quot;wings&quot;; instead of a CSM, the wing has a wing sergeant major. In the case of the Officer Cadet School, WSMs are second or first warrant officers, likely due to the greater experience required for the appointment.

The CSM is the senior specialist in the company. He is in charge of the welfare and discipline of the specialists and enlisted men within, and usually has the company commander&#x27;s ear. Drill and ceremonies is the CSM&#x27;s responsibility. He supervises the instruction of drill by the platoon sergeants, and will conduct company rehearsals for parades prior to actual parade rehearsals. On the parade square, the CSM carries a black pace stick.

As an experienced senior specialist, the CSM is expected to be an expert in the weapons and equipment employed by the company, and will assist in instruction where necessary. During exercises or operations, the CSM, aided by the company quartermaster sergeant and company medic, is in charge of organizing the company&#x27;s logistics, manpower, and medical treatment and evacuation. If necessary, he can be tasked to lead a detachment composed of recoilless rifles and machine guns (known in Singapore military doctrine as a &quot;company block force&quot;), to protect the rifle company from flanking attacks by enemy light armoured vehicles along a contested axis.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, CSM is an appointment held by warrant officers class 2 in the British Army and Royal Marines (and previously by quartermaster sergeants in the Royal Marines). The same appointment is referred to in the Cavalry as Squadron Sergeant Major (SSM) and in the Royal Regiment of Artillery as a Battery Sergeant Major (BSM).

By 1913, there were two colour sergeants in each infantry company. On 1 October 1913, they were replaced by the two new ranks of company sergeant major and company quartermaster sergeant, with one of each in each company. Company sergeant major was briefly an actual rank, wearing the colour sergeant&#x27;s old rank badge of a crown over three chevrons, until it became an appointment of the new rank of warrant officer class II in 1915 and adopted the rank badge of a large crown on the lower sleeve.

A CSM, BSM or SSM is generally addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates, or &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;. However, a cavalry SSM is often addressed as &quot;Mr (surname)&quot; by officers, and as &quot;Mr (surname), Sir&quot; by his subordinates, with the salutation &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; being reserved for staff sergeants. Typically for the British Army, protocol can vary widely between units, creating a minefield for outsiders, new recruits, and soldiers serving outside their parent regiments.

The most famous fictional examples are perhaps Battery Sergeant Major Tudor Bryn &#x27;Shut Up&#x27; Williams, portrayed by Windsor Davies in the 1970s&#x27; sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;; and Company Sergeant Major Percival Bullimore and Company Sergeant Major Claude Snudge, played by William Hartnell and Bill Fraser, respectively, in the 1958–63 Granada television comedy series &quot;The Army Game&quot;.

<text>Merrow is a suburb in the north-east of Guildford, in Surrey, England. It is from the town&#x27;s centre, on the edge of the ridge of hills that forms the North Downs. Although now a relatively obscure suburb, the village can trace its origins back many hundreds of years. 
Merrow is separated from Burpham (to the north-west) by the New Guildford Line, the second railway line between Guildford and London.

==Etymology==
According to the Institute for Name-Studies, Merrow means &#x27;fat&#x27;, literally, &quot;probably referring to the high fertility of the land&quot;.

==History==
The village grew up around a crossroads: where what is now the A25, the road between Guildford and Leatherhead, crossed the original road (&quot;Merrow Street&quot;) from Burpham to Dorking.

The oldest houses in the village can still be seen along these two roads, together with St John&#x27;s Church and the Horse and Groom, a Grade II listed 17th-century coaching inn next door. The old Dorking road squeezes between the church and the inn, creating a significant bottleneck for modern motor traffic.

To the north is Clandon Park, a 1000 acre (400 hectare) private Grade II Listed agricultural parkland estate that is the seat of the current Earl of Onslow. At the south east corner of Clandon Park are 9 acres of gardens and grounds where Clandon House is located. The mansion house with 7 acres of gardens was gifted to the nation by the Onslow family and is now a National Trust property. The Onslows provided some of the earliest Speakers of the House of Commons, such as Arthur Onslow who held this post through the reign of George II.

Merrow remained a relatively small settlement right up to the 1950s, when the Bushy Hill estate was built. This development of several hundred houses was originally all council-owned, but since the 1980s, many have passed into private ownership.

Further expansion occurred in the mid-1980s. In the greenfield site bordered by Burpham, adjacent to the Bushy Hill estate and Clandon Park, the &quot;Merrow Park&quot; development was built, completely surrounding the old houses on Merrow Street. Merrow Park is often considered a suburb in its own right and has its own shops, school and doctor&#x27;s surgery.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 1690. On 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Guildford and West Clandon. It is now in the district of Guildford.

==Schools==
* Merrow C of E Infant School &quot;(ages 4 – 7)&quot;
* Merrow Junior School &quot;(ages 7 – 11)&quot;
* Boxgrove Primary School &quot;(ages 4 – 11)&quot;
* St Thomas of Canterbury Catholic Primary School &quot;(ages 4 – 11)&quot;
* St Peter&#x27;s Catholic School &quot;(ages 11 – 18)&quot;

==Churches==
The parish church of St John the Evangelist was built in the mid 12th century and a few early features have survived later additions, such as a Norman arch and a 13th-century chapel. The church is Grade II listed.

The churchyard is the burial place of the Onslow family. There is a war memorial in the churchyard, dedicated to those who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. This was re-dedicated in 2002 following a restoration and research project part-funded by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant. The church hall, The St John&#x27;s Centre, is a focal point for the community and was reopened in 2001 following a major refurbishing and enlargement project.

There are two other churches in Merrow: Merrow Methodist church and St Pius X Roman Catholic church.

==Sport and leisure==
Merrow is situated right on the edge of the North Downs. Guildford Golf Club, the oldest Golf Course in Surrey, is located on Merrow Downs. A short walk from Merrow is Newlands Corner, a popular beauty spot in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Merrow has a non-league football club (Merrow F.C.), a tennis club and a cricket club, as well as a fitness club (which was formerly known as &quot;Dragons&quot;).

Merrow Dramatic Society has been in existence for over 80 years. Each year, the Society produces two plays, performed at the Electric Theatre in Guildford, and a traditional pantomime, put on at Merrow Village Hall (built 1909). They also take part in Drama Festivals (winning recently at both Guildford and Woking) and host their own variety evenings.

===Merrow F.C.===

The non-League football club, Merrow F.C., nicknamed &quot;The Robins&quot;, was established in 1922. Their home ground is The Urnfield, Downside Road, in Merrow (). The club was among the founding members of the Surrey Premier League in 1982.
In the 2012–13 season the club achieved a league-and-cup double when they finished top of the Surrey County Intermediate League (Western) Premier Division, and won the Surrey Intermediate Cup. The club were promoted to the Surrey Elite Intermediate League for the 2013–2014 season.

==Transport==

Merrow is on several bus routes that start or finish in Guildford.

A park and ride facility was built to the east of the village, construction starting in Autumn 2006, which opened on 29 September 2008. This service, operated by Stagecoach South on behalf of Guildford Borough Council and Surrey County Council, was introduced to reduce the traffic levels between Merrow and the town centre.

There have been several proposals to build a railway station on the Guildford to Effingham Junction line, the most probable site being the Surrey County Council depot near Burpham. As yet the funding has not been forthcoming to develop this further, although a feasibility study was carried out. The line serves Clandon railway station, across fields from part of Merrow, and on the same line London Road (Guildford) railway station is a similar distance from western parts of Merrow.

==Literature==

Merrow Downs in prehistory is the setting for two of the &quot;Just So Stories&quot; by Rudyard Kipling: &quot;How the First Letter was Written&quot; and &quot;How the Alphabet was Made&quot;. Merrow features as a location in &quot;Tros of Samothrace&quot; by Talbot Mundy.

<doc id="968613" wikidata="Q1431420" url="?curid=968613" title="Railgrinder">
<text>A railgrinder (or rail grinder) is a maintenance of way vehicle or train used to restore the profile and remove irregularities from worn tracks to extend its life and to improve the ride of trains using the track. Rail grinders were developed to increase the lifespan of the tracks being serviced for rail corrugation. Rail grinding is a process that is done to stop the deformation due to use and friction on railroad tracks by removing deformations and corrosion. Railway tracks that experience continual use are more likely to experience corrugation and overall wear. Rail grinders are used to grind the tracks when rail corrugation is present, or before corrugation begins to form on the tracks. Major freight train tracks use rail grinders for track maintenance based on the interval of tonnage, rather than time. Transit systems and subways in major cities continue to use scheduled rail grinding processes to combat the corrugation common to heavily used tracks. Rail-grinding equipment may be mounted on a single self-propelled vehicle or on a dedicated rail-grinding train which, when used on an extensive network, may include crew quarters. The grinding wheels, of which there may be more than 100, are set at controlled angles to restore the track to its correct profile.
The machines have been in use in North America and Europe since the early 20th century. They are made by specialist rail maintenance companies who may also operate them under contract.

The early 2000s saw several advancements in rail maintenance technology, most notably the introduction of track reprofiling by rail milling trains for which advantages in accuracy of the profile and quality of the processed surface are claimed. A second technology that is gaining widespread acceptance in Europe, Germany in particular, is high-speed grinding. While it cannot reprofile rails like milling or other grinding trains, its working speed of approximately 80 km/h allows defect removal and prevention to be achieved with little or no impact on other scheduled traffic.


== Hand-held rail grinders ==
The ERICO Company manufactures hand-held rail grinders and drills for the railway industry as maintenance of way tools. ERICO uses Honda four-stroke engines to power their railway drill and rail grinder. Rail grinders are used for rail preparation prior to the attachment of bonds, and serve as a multipurpose tool capable of rail preparation, maintenance and repair.

== Grinding quality index ==
The grinding quality index (GQI) is a software-based template used to measure the profile of a rail. This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear of the rail grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allows workers and contractors to take precise measurements of the rail profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.

== Health concerns ==
In the railway industry, there are risks with the prolonged use of maintenance of way vehicles during track maintenance and construction. A common risk is prolonged exposure to excessive whole body vibration and shock exposure to the vertical and horizontal axes of the lumbar spine and vertebral endplate, which can lead to spinal injury and or long-term damage to the vertebral bone structure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has proposed thresholds for whole-body vibration with certain guidelines also being based on ISO-2631 standards, but no exposure thresholds for maintenance of way vehicles have been widely published or enforced. The ACGIH-TLV limits whole-body vibration to no more than 8 hours. In the European Union a risk assessment model (VibRisk model) for structural failure of the lumbar spine in the lower back was proposed as a result of vibration risk research. The VibRisk model provides more specific risk assessments of vertebral endplate failure on individual lumbar levels taking into account driver posture. When compared, risk assessments using the VibRisk Model rate a higher risk of vertebral endplate failure at different lumbar levels than ISO-2631 Part 5 standards suggest. The main contributing factor that VibRisk incorporates that the ISO-2631 Part 5 standards are lacking is the recognition of operator posture as an additional stress factor when exposed to vibration and multiple shocks.

==Rail corrugation==
Rail corrugation or roaring rails is a type of track wear that develops from track and train wheel set contact over time. Once this process has started, it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time, which may or may not develop into rail corrugation, depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail corrugation. Rail corrugation is represented in wavelength. Typically, heavily corrugated rails experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20 mm to 200 mm intervals. Significant rail corrugation can decrease the service life of tracks and make the replacement of the affected track necessary. Rail corrugation is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially. Wear corrugation is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive corrugation can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail. Rail corrugation may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or alloyed rails, as opposed to the traditional carbon composite rail. The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail corrugation through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of high-speed railroad tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop corrugation (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high performance ballasted track) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail corrugation with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.

===Causes===
It is generally accepted that a few distinct causes lie behind different wavelengths of railroad corrugation. One study indicates that the specific short-wave railroad deformity is mainly caused by pinned-pinned resonance, in which the rail vibrates as a fixed beam, as if pinned between periodically placed sleepers. The dynamic train-track interaction that causes fixed frequency vibrations at high speeds, commonly observed in light load metro operations, and the anti-resonance caused by the pinning of the rails on sleepers, causes deformation and the &quot;roaring&quot; corrugation of the rails.

== Rail corrugation prevention ==
Rail corrugation may be prevented by selecting rails with material compositions that are more resistant to corrugation. Heat-treated alloy steel rails with relative hardness are the most resistant, as opposed to Bessemer steels, due to a greater relative hardness. Rails with a Brinell hardness of 320 to 360 are best for corrugation-resistant rails. Trains may vary speed on the tracks in an effort to prevent corrugation from affecting sections or rail on a transit systems. Varying a train&#x27;s speed, direction, and tonnage are beneficial for combating the growth of rail corrugation, as corrugation is caused by continually uniform friction. On subways and major transit systems, it is not possible to vary the direction of trains, making the use of annual and biennial rail grinding processes more applicable.

==Preventive rail grinding ==
Preventive rail grinding is done before any signs of rail corrugation development. Rail corrugation will develop exponentially if the first signs of rail corrugation are not ground or serviced. Preventive grinding removes the deformation from friction and the chemical breakdown of the tracks. Regular rail grinding is the primary maintenance operation used to combat roaring rail or short-pitched rail corrugation. Rail grinding operations occur periodically in order to prevent rail corrugation from occurring. Rail grinding cars can be taken down freight lines that traverse long distances in the same direction if the freight railway is used continually Rail corrugation, the carbon growth of the rail which is increased by friction, grows exponentially.

==Rail corrugation noise treatment ==
Rail corrugation is frequently the subject of community noise complaints. Often, vibrations of the corrugated track will become progressively worse, generating more friction and metal on metal contact. Roaring rail corrugation is a common reason for noise complaints in urban and suburban communities and is most prevalent when trains travel at moderate speed. It is often called short-pitch corrugation and is responsible for the majority of community reaction. The loud and uncomfortable vibration caused by rail corrugation on transit systems affects both transit system passengers and local communities where the railroads intersect. Short-pitch corrugation creates significantly more noise than normal railroad track friction, with a tone of about 500 to 800 hertz. Short-pitch corrugation is most commonly seen on railroads that do not experience regular rail grinding maintenance or that are rarely used. Rail support stiffness directly correlates with short-pitch corrugation.

<text>The hackle is a clipped plume or short spray of coloured feathers that is attached to a military headdress, with different colours being associated with particular regiments.

In the British Army and the armies of some Commonwealth countries, the hackle is worn by some infantry regiments, especially those designated as fusilier regiments and those with Scottish and Northern Irish origins.

The modern hackle has its origins in a much longer plume, originally referred to by its Scots name, &quot;heckle&quot;, which was commonly attached to the feather bonnet worn by Highland regiments (now usually only worn by drummers, pipers and bandsmen). The smaller version originated in a regimental emblem adopted by the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment, to be worn in the sun helmet issued in hot-weather postings from the 1870s.

==British Army==
===Hackle colours in British fusilier regiments===
====Modern fusiliers====
In the modern British Army, there is a single regiment of fusiliers, plus a battalion of a large regiment. Hackle colours are:

* Royal Regiment of Fusiliers: Red over white 
* Royal Highland Fusiliers (a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland): White
Other ranks of the Royal Welsh, the regiment that was formed by the amalgamation of the Royal Welch Fusiliers and Royal Regiment of Wales, continue to wear the white hackle of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

====Historic fusilier regiments====
There were several other fusilier regiments which have been amalgamated and no longer exist. The hackle colours worn were as follows:

* Lancashire Fusiliers: Primrose yellow
* Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment): White
* Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers: Grey
* Royal Irish Fusiliers: Green
* Royal Northumberland Fusiliers: Red over white
* Royal Scots Fusiliers: White
* Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers: Blue over old gold (orange)
* Royal Welch Fusiliers: White
* Royal Munster Fusiliers: White over green
* Royal Dublin Fusiliers: Green over blue

===Non-fusilier regiments===

Non-fusilier regiments which wear the hackle are:

* Coldstream Guards (bearskin only): Red
* Grenadier Guards (bearskin only): White
* Irish Guards (pipers on caubeen only): St Patrick&#x27;s blue [Also worn on bearskin]
* Liverpool Scottish (now a platoon of A (Ladysmith) Company, 4th Bn Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment): Royal blue
* Liverpool Irish (now A Troop of 208 Battery, 103rd Regiment Royal Artillery): Blue over red
* London Irish Rifles (now D (London Irish Rifles) Company, London Regiment): Green [Pipers wear St Patrick&#x27;s blue]
* Royal Irish Regiment (as the direct descendant of two regiments of fusiliers): Green
* Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (on pipers&#x27; feather bonnet in Full Dress, pipers&#x27; / drummers&#x27; glengarry /atholl bonnet in No.1 and No.2 dress): White
* Royal Welsh (Other Ranks only): White
* Scots Guards (pipers on feather bonnet only): Blue over red
* The Queen&#x27;s University Officers&#x27; Training Corps: St Patrick&#x27;s Blue (A Coy Caubeen Only)
* Royal Air Force (pipe band only): Blue
* Welsh Guards (bearskin only): White-green-white

====Royal Regiment of Scotland====
Following the amalgamation of the regiments of the Scottish Division to form The Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006, the following hackles are being worn by the regiment&#x27;s constituent battalions:

* Royal Scots Borderers (1 SCOTS): Black
* Royal Highland Fusiliers (2 SCOTS): White
* Black Watch (3 SCOTS): Red
* The Highlanders (4 SCOTS): Blue
* Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (5 SCOTS): Green
* 52nd Lowland Volunteers (6 SCOTS): Grey
* 51st Highland Volunteers (7 SCOTS): Purple

Whilst the white hackle of 2 SCOTS, red hackle of 3 SCOTS and blue hackle of 4 SCOTS have a known ancestry, the origin of 1 SCOTS black hackle and 5 SCOTS green hackle are not clear and have no apparent precedent. It may be that the black hackle of 1 SCOTS simulates the black-cock tail feathers originally worn in the 1904 pattern Kilmarnock Bonnet and latterly in the regimental Glengarry Cap by the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, who merged in August 2006 to form 1 SCOTS. Alternatively, it may be a sympathetic gesture to a former Lowland regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), who went into &#x27;suspended animation&#x27; in 1968 (and later disbanded), who wore a black hackle in their rifle green dress Balmoral. The adoption of the green hackle now being worn by the Argylls battalion (5 SCOTS) is no doubt a continuation of that regiment&#x27;s association with the colour green, most prominent in the hue of their regimental kilts and stripes on their regimental association ties. (It is, however, worthy of note that in the 19th century, all line regiments of the British Army used to designate their &quot;light company&quot; with a green hackle.) The Regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland does not wear the hackle. However, the Highland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Territorial Army) continues to wear the red hackle with the Tam o&#x27; Shanter. Tradition holds that the black hackle originated as a Scottish tradition of wearing a black feather in your hat to signify you have an ongoing quarrel with someone.

<text>Martin Albert Mulry (2 September 19471 September 2001), known professionally as Ted Mulry, was an English-born Australian singer, songwriter, bass player and guitarist. As a solo artist, his second single, &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (February 1971), reached No. 11 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 60. From September 1972 he led his own band, Ted Mulry Gang, which were also credited as TMG. They had a number-one hit single on the Kent Music Report with &quot;Jump in My Car&quot; (September 1975) and top ten appearances with a cover version of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; (February 1976), and with &quot;Jamaica Rum&quot; (January 1977) and &quot;My Little Girl&quot; (May). Their second album, Struttin&#x27; (May 1976), also reached the top ten. The group disbanded in 1986, although periodically reformed. Mulry announced in February 2001 that he had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. In the next month numerous music artists responded with &quot;Gimme Ted&quot;, a series of benefit concerts, which were recorded for a 2×DVD video tribute album, &quot;Gimme Ted – The Ted Mulry Benefit Concerts&quot; (May 2003). Mulry died of his brain tumour in September 2001.

==Early career==
Martin Albert Mulry was born on 2 September 1947 in Oldham, Lancashire, England. His younger brother, Steve Mulry, was also a musician. Mulry started learning guitar from the age of ten. On 5 April 1966 Mulry arrived in Sydney as a cotton weaver intending to work at Carinya Farm, Bargo. By 1969 he was working for the Department of Main Roads, driving a bulldozer.

He sent a demo tape of his own compositions to Albert Productions in Sydney and intended to gain work as a songwriter. The company persuaded him to release his own recordings. He gained notice as a solo singer-songwriter with his pop ballad, &quot;Julia&quot; (February 1970), which reached the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40 in mid-May. However, the single&#x27;s airplay and charting was adversely affected by the 1970 radio ban, which was a &quot;pay for play&quot; dispute and prevented commercial radio from playing some works (including Mulry&#x27;s). Mulry&#x27;s next single, &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (February 1971), was written by Vanda &amp; Young (ex-the Easybeats), which reached No. 11.

During his solo career Mulry was typically backed by &quot;ad hoc&quot; groups. For the Canberra Day Pop Concert, in March 1971, the line-up was local musicians Russ Corkhill on piano and organ, Bob Martin on guitar, Paul Reynolds on bass guitar, and Tony Simon on drums. In June of that year he supported visiting English pop group, the Kinks at a performance in Canberra. He used the same backing musicians, who &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Michael Foster described as &quot;very good Canberra musicians.&quot; He also felt that &quot;Best of his presentations were probably &#x27;Julia&#x27; and &#x27;Louisa&#x27;, with everyone happy to hear &#x27;Falling in Love Again&#x27;. I would have enjoyed &#x27;Take Me Back&#x27;, if it had finished when the statement had been made.&quot;

Mulry released his debut solo album, &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (September 1971), and returned to England in the following month. While there he issued a single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Nice&quot; (May 1972), as Steve Ryder for the Blue Mountain label. It did not chart and he returned to Sydney by mid-1972. Mulry was a prolific songwriter and provided material for other artists, including John Farnham and Alison MacCallum. Pop band Sherbet had a top 20 hit with a cover version of his song, &quot;You&#x27;re All Woman&quot; (August 1972). He issued his second solo album, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (February 1973). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how &quot;[it] featured a rockier sound than heard on [his] early singles, and augured well for the future.&quot;

==Ted Mulry Gang==

Mulry, on lead vocals and, initially, on rhythm guitar, formed his own backing group in Sydney, which became Ted Mulry Gang (TMG), in September 1972. Other founders were Les Hall on lead guitar, Steve Hart on bass guitar and Herman Kovacs on drums. Hall and Kovacs had been members of a &quot;popular suburban dance band&quot;, the Velvet Underground (not the US band of the same name), which had formed in Newcastle in 1967 and had relocated to Sydney in 1969. They had previously included Malcolm Young (later of AC/DC) on rhythm guitar. One of TMG&#x27;s first performances was in September 1972 at the Mattara Festival, Newcastle. Hall, Hart and Kovacs backed Mulry on ABC-TV&#x27;s popular music series, &quot;GTK&quot;, in 1973 to promote his own version of &quot;You&#x27;re All Woman&quot;.

During a 1974 gig Hart stormed out leaving his bass guitar behind, Mulry picked up the instrument and finished the show on vocals and bass guitar. Ted Mulry Gang signed with Albert Productions in that year and released their first album, &quot;Here We Are&quot; (November 1974). Before the album appeared they recruited Gary Dixon on rhythm guitar (ex-Fat Harry). It reached the Kent Music Report top 100 albums chart. Its first single, &quot;Sunday Evenings&quot; (March 1975), also appeared in the lower reaches of the singles chart top 100. Due to low sales the record company wanted Mulry to go back to his solo career, however, with his band&#x27;s support he adopted a harder rocking style.

Their first major hit, and the biggest of their career, was the next single, &quot;Jump in My Car&quot; (September 1975), which spent six weeks at No. 1. According to McFarlane, &quot;[it] set the tone for subsequent releases with its simplistic, 12-bar boogie guitar riffs, thumping beat, Mulry&#x27;s gravelly, gregarious vocals and tongue-in-cheek lyrics.&quot; Over the next two years they achieved a string of top ten singles including a rocked up version of an old jazz song, &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; (February 1976); followed by &quot;Jamaica Rum&quot; (January 1977) and &quot;My Little Girl&quot; (May).

Many of TMG&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Jump in My Car&quot;, were co-written by Mulry and Hall. By late in 1980 their chart success had ended but they remained popular performers on the Australian pub circuit until they disbanded in 1986. With his music career side-lined he started a business with his mechanic. In 1989 Ted Mulry Gang briefly reformed, with Mulry, Hall and Kovacs joined by sometime Rose Tattoo guitarist Mick Cocks. They released an album, &quot;Re-Union&quot; for Albert, on Sony. This marked their first on compact disc. Other CD reissues followed in the early 1990s. In 1998 Mulry, as a solo artist issued a CD, &quot;This Time&quot;, featuring songs co-written by himself and his brother, Steve.

==Death==

In February 2001, Mulry announced that he had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. &quot;Gimme Ted&quot;, two tribute concerts were organised for the following month, with numerous Australian musicians paying homage. Included was a reunion of the Ted Mulry Gang with Steve as lead vocalist. A double-DVD, &quot;Gimme Ted – The Ted Mulry Benefit Concerts&quot;, was released in 2003. Mulry died of his brain tumour on 1 September 2001 in Sydney, one day away from his 54th birthday. Steve later fronted a rock band, Black Label, which performed in New South Wales and Victoria, including supporting the Angels.

==David Hasselhoff recording==

In January 2006 actor David Hasselhoff recorded a cover version of &quot;Jump in My Car&quot;, whilst in Australia. Hasselhoff&#x27;s version was released in the UK and went to No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in October. It also went No. 24 in Ireland.

<doc id="968625" wikidata="Q42073" url="?curid=968625" title="Gumi, North Gyeongsang">
<text>Gumi (; ) is the second largest and most densely populated city in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is located on the Nakdong River, halfway between Daegu and Gimcheon, also lies on the Gyeongbu Expressway and Gyeongbu Line railway which are the principal traffic routes of the country.

The city is an industrial center of the country with many companies, including Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, LG Display, having a manufacturing presence and R&amp;D Centres there.

The primary industries are electronics and IT Manufacturing such as Smartphone, Tablet computer, 5G and 6G Networking Equipment, Semiconductors, OLED and other Displays, Carbonated fibres, rubber, plastic and metal products. In Gumi, 1,772 companies employ over 80,000 workers. It is the largest scale in Korea. In 2009, the city exported the largest amount in the country and accounted for 96.9% of trade surplus of South Korea in 2000 to 2009.
The birthplace of South Korean president Park Chung Hee is in the city.

==History==
In the Three Kingdoms period, Gumi was part of the territory of the Silla Kingdom. The first Silla temple, Dorisa, was constructed here by Monk Ado who is also the one that made Jikjisa.

The city is the birthplace of the 1962–1979 South Korean president Park Chung Hee. It was during his administration that the South Korean government selected Gumi as a site for major industrial development. Gumi developed rapidly during the 1960s, growing from a small rural town into a large city thanks to huge infusions of development money from the government. It was selected for development for some practical reasons such as its easy access to transportation infrastructure, and its location in the industrialized Yeongnam region.

===Industrial accident===
On September 27, 2012, workers at the Hube Global plant in Gumi were unloading hydrofluoric acid (HF) from a tanker when an explosion occurred causing about 8 tonnes of the acid to leak into the surrounding area. The leak caused 5 deaths initially and prompted more than 3000 people to seek medical attention at local hospitals. Local rice and grape crops were ruined because the acid caused them to wither. Approximately 3,200 livestock were exposed. The acid, which can etch glass and is used in the electronics industry, caused damage to at least 1,000 vehicles. Total damage costs as of October 10, 2012 were about US$16 million.

==Administrative divisions==
The city center of Gumi is divided into 17 &quot;dong&quot;, or neighborhood units. The hinterland is divided into 5 myeon, or rural areas, and 3 eup, or large villages. Sandong was promoted from a myeon to an eup on 1 January 2021.

==Geumo Mountain==
Geumo Mountain (Geumo San) Provincial Park is a hiking destination. The peak at 976 m above sea level is one of the eight famous spots in the Yeongman area and is the location of the start of the nature preservation campaign in Korea. The park has an amusement area called Geumo Land and the Geumo reservoir. There are several interesting sites on the mountain that include:

*Doesan Cave named after the Buddhist monk Doesan who attained a state of nirvana in the cave. He was a master of the theory of &quot;divination based on topography&quot; in the later Shilla dynasty.
*Daehye Waterfall is 27 m high and is especially full during the rainy season. It can be completely dry during periods without rain and is frozen in winter.
*The HaeUn Buddhist Temple is also near the top of the cable car route.
*The YakSa Temple is an active Buddhist temple and is said to have been created to commemorate Saint Ulsang&#x27;s attainment of nirvana. It is sited near the top of the mountain and can be reached both from the peak and by a trail from the bottom. It has a unique bell that sits on a separate spike of rock connected by a suspension bridge.
*The Ma Ae Cliff Buddha (National Treasure #490) is carved into the corner of a cliff face and is thought to have been created during the Goryeo dynasty.

The Doesan Cave, Daehye Waterfall and HaeUn Buddhist Temple are all easily reached by taking the cable car from the entrance of the park and then hiking a short distance.

<doc id="968626" wikidata="Q467067" url="?curid=968626" title="Bülent Ersoy">
<text>Bülent Ersoy (; born Erkoç 9 June 1952) is a Turkish singer and actress. She is known as one of the most popular singers of Turkish music, nicknamed Diva by her fans. Ersoy has many famous hits such as &quot;Ümit Hırsızı&quot; &quot;(Hope Thief)&quot;, &quot;Geceler&quot; &quot;(Nights)&quot;, &quot;Beddua&quot; &quot;(Curse)&quot;, &quot;Maazallah&quot; &quot;(God Forbid)&quot;, &quot;Biz Ayrılamayız&quot; &quot;(We Cannot Break Up)&quot;, and &quot;Sefam olsun&quot; &quot;(I Enjoy Myself)&quot;. Ersoy has published more than thirty albums so far and has made a name for herself in Turkish music history.

== Biography ==

=== 1952–1973: Early life ===
Bülent Ersoy was born in 1952 in Malatya. For the purposes of performance, Bülent changed her surname from Erkoç (brave ram) to Ersoy (brave lineage) following Müjdat Gezen&#x27;s recommendation. Ersoy began her career as a male singer, in the genre of Turkish classical music, and became an actor early on. Her grandparents played classical Turkish music and she first took private lessons and then studied at Istanbul Municipal Conservatory. Already one of Turkey&#x27;s most popular singers and actors, she gained international notoriety in April 1981 after having sex reassignment surgery in London by a British plastic surgeon. She kept the name &quot;Bülent&quot; even though it is a typically masculine name.

=== Stage prohibition and restriction period ===

After the operation, Ersoy found herself in opposition to 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état of Kenan Evren. In a crackdown on &quot;social deviance,&quot; Ersoy&#x27;s public performances were banned along with those of other transgender people. To circumvent the ban, she petitioned the Turkish courts to legally recognize her as a woman. The petition was rejected in January 1982. Days later, she attempted suicide. In 1983, she left Turkey in protest of the Evren regime&#x27;s repressive policies and continued her career in West Germany. Along with her musical career, she made several Turkish movies there. Later on in the decade in 1989 Evren left office and many of his policies were reversed.

=== 2011–12: &quot;Aşktan Sabıkalı&quot; ===

In late 2010, Ersoy announced that she had listened to nearly 1,500 songs in the last 2 years and found it difficult to choose the best songs for the album. Her new album &quot;Aşktan Sabıkalı&quot; (Love Convict), was released on 3 October 2011. The album includes a song written by Can Tanrıyar called &quot;Alışmak İstemiyorum&quot; (I Don&#x27;t Wanna Get Used to It), and a classic by Orhan Gencebay: &quot;Bir Teselli Ver&quot;, (Give Me Solace). There also is a song by Gülşen titled &quot;Aşktan Sabıkalı&quot;, after which the album is named. Another piece in the album is a duet sung with Tarkan, titled &quot;Bir Ben Bir Allah Biliyor&quot; (Only I and Allah know), which was popular as it was performed by two of Turkey&#x27;s leading artists. On 22 December, Ersoy released a music video for the song, nearly three months after it was first played on the radio.

===2013 onwards===
In her appearances on TRT in 2013, Ersoy was keen to stress that her pop-arabesque songs were only a &#x27;vice&#x27; to earn an income and classical music, which she received her University education in, is where her true allegiance and support lies. Although her last album was released in 2011, her last album where she sang classical and Alaturka (Turkish style) songs was in &quot;Alaturka 2000&quot;, after which she hasn&#x27;t produced any material covering Alaturka or Classical material.

In late 2015, Ersoy stated in a press conference how Orhan Gencebay had mentioned to her that no one prominent had been producing Alaturka for the last couple of years. She stated that it was their mutual plan to &#x27;get together&#x27; and think about what to for an album in this area. In early 2016, Ersoy said that she had listened to hundreds of songs and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with what was brought to her (this being songs in the Pop/Arabesque genre). Although it&#x27;s unclear as to when her next production will be, Ersoy seems to have returned from her semi-retired status and is producing new material. She announced that she would publish a new song written by Tarkan, named &quot;Ümit Hırsızı&quot;, which was released in March 2019

==Controversies==
===The case filed by Deniz Baykal===
In a magazine program in 2005, Ersoy talked about her attempts to end her stage ban and added: &quot;During the period after the 1980 coup, a person who is now a party leader asked me for fortune to remove my stage ban.&quot; Following this statement, DYP leader Mehmet Ağar said that he was not the leader in question. As a result, the eyes turned to the CHP leader Deniz Baykal.

Baykal emphasized that at that time he was a lawyer and Bülent Ersoy had telephoned to consult him and later met him in person for only 2 minutes. He also added that nothing related to money and fortunes was discussed between the two. In response, Ersoy held a press conference. She claimed that she had met with Deniz Baykal personally in an office behind Dedeman Hotel in Ankara and added: &quot;Mr. Deniz even had a gray suit on [during the meeting]. If I remember such details, I can remember you wanted 100 million back then, which is equal to 1 trillion today.&quot; She also claimed that the person who mediated the meeting was Mehmet Nabi, the famous mafia figure known as İnci Baba. In addition, she said that she did not know whether the 100 million that Baykal had asked her was a solicitor&#x27;s fee or that it would be used to distribute bribes to various people to lift the stage ban.

Following this press statement, Deniz Baykal filed a lawsuit against Bülent Ersoy for the violation of his personal rights due to implications of both bribery and mafia involvement allegations. At the end of the case, the court fined Ersoy, but when Ersoy objected to the decision, the case was moved to the Court of Cassation. On 25 March 2008, the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the local court and ordered Bülent Ersoy to pay 15,000 along with its interest to Baykal for causing non-pecuniary damages.

===The case opened for her views on military service===
Ersoy sparked controversy in February 2008 when she publicly criticised Turkey&#x27;s incursion into Iraqi Kurdistan and said she &quot;would not send her sons to war&quot; if she were a mother. An Istanbul public prosecutor subsequently filed charges against her for &quot;turning Turks against compulsory military service&quot;, an issue which had also brought prominent Turkish intellectual Perihan Mağden to trial in the past. The Turkish Human Right Foundation (IHD) stood up to Ersoy&#x27;s defence. On 19 December 2008, Ersoy was pronounced not guilty of charges by a Turkish court.

<doc id="968627" wikidata="Q42095" url="?curid=968627" title="Mungyeong">
<text>Mungyeong (; ) is a city in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. The local government, economy, and transportation networks are all centered in Jeomchon, the principal town. Mungyeong has a lengthy history, and is known today for its various historic and scenic tourist attractions. The city&#x27;s name means roughly &quot;hearing good news.&quot; Recently, development has been somewhat stagnant with the decline of the coal industry. Since the 1990s, the proportion of people who rely on the tourism industry through Mungyeong Saejae has gradually increased.

The city of Mungyeong was created after Jeomchon City and rural Mungyeong County were combined in 1995. It is now an urban-rural complex similar to 53 other small and medium-sized cities with a population under 300,000 people in South Korea.

==History==
The Mungyeong area is believed to have been controlled by a mixture of Jinhan and Byeonhan states during the Samhan period in the first centuries of the Common Era. The Jinhan state of Geungi-guk may have been located near Sanyang-myeon. Byeonhan states such as Sabeol-guk and Gosunsi-guk, which probably controlled the Hamchang area of Sangju, may also have extended their control over adjacent areas that are now part of Mungyeong. However, this stage of local history is almost entirely hypothetical, since very little evidence of any kind remains.

At any rate, the rising power of Silla controlled the area by 505. Capitalizing on the territory&#x27;s strategic potential, Silla set up various mountain fortresses in the area to control movement in and out of western Korea. Control of transit through the area would have gained even greater importance after Silla&#x27;s 553 seizure of the Han River valley on the western side of the mountains. At this time the low Haneuljae pass near Poam Mountain was probably the favored crossing, in contrast to the higher Mungyeong Saejae pass which came into favor in the Joseon period.

As Silla reorganized its administrative structure under King Seongdeok in 757, the Mungyeong area was placed under the province of Sangju, and divided among various &quot;hyeon&quot;, or local districts. During this Unified Silla period the temple of Gwaneumsa, of which all but a few traces have vanished, was constructed near Haneuljae in present-day Mungyeong-eup.

In the early Goryeo period, in 983, King Seongjong reorganized local government yet again. Most of Mungyeong remained divided into assorted hyeon, under the central jurisdiction of Sangju. In 1390, Mungyeong-gun (Mungyeong County) begins to appear in the records, although not with its current boundaries.

In the Joseon period, the Eight Provinces were laid out and thus Mungyeong became part of Gyeongsang Province, which it remains. During later Joseon times, the road from Seoul to Busan was established running over Mungyeong Saejae. Beginning in the 18th century, gates were erected on the road to control traffic and protect travelers from brigandage. These gates are still preserved today.

The first railroads were constructed in the area during the period of Japanese occupation. Jeomchon Station was opened on December 25, 1924. However, the pace of resource extraction did not accelerate greatly until the post-war period, under the first South Korean government led by Syngman Rhee. Construction on the Gaeun Line, with the goal of improving access to the coal deposits around Gaeun, began on January 18, 1953, before the official end of the Korean War (the line was completed in 1955).

Local self-governance was established in the early years of the Republic of Korea, but abruptly cancelled following the military coup of 1961. After the end of military dictatorship, local representative government was reinstituted in 1991. At that time, the present-day territory of Mungyeong was divided between Jeomchon City and Mungyeong County. The city acquired its present-day borders on January 1, 1995, when the two former units were merged to form Mungyeong City.

== Geography and climate ==
===Geography===

Mungyeong extends a total of from west to east, and 37 from north to south. Its shape very roughly approximates a right triangle, with the hypotenuse corresponding to the peaks of the Sobaek mountains. The northern tip is in Dongno-myeon, at 36°52&#x27;10&quot; N latitude. The southern extremity lies in Nongam-myeon, at 36°41&#x27;40&quot; N. The easternmost edge of the city can also be found in Dongno-myeon, at 128°22&#x27;42&quot; E longitude. On the west, Mungyeong comes to an end in Gaeun-eup, at 127°52&#x27;48&quot; E.

Mungyeong stands on the border between North Gyeongsang and North Chungcheong Provinces. On its northern and western borders, it adjoins the North Chungcheong districts of Danyang County, Jecheon, and Chungju on the north and Goesan County on the northwest. Within North Gyeongsang province, Mungyeong adjoins Yecheon County to the east and Sangju to the south.

The topography of Mungyeong is dominated by the Sobaek mountains, which form the line between North Gyeongsang and North Chungcheong provinces. The city&#x27;s highest point lies on this line, at 1161-meter Munsu peak of Worak Mountain in Dongno-myeon. The city&#x27;s terrain, cut by numerous valleys, slopes down from the Sobaek peaks toward the valleys of the Nakdong River and its tributary, the Yeong. At their meeting-point in Yeongsun-myeon, the rivers are barely 200 m above sea level. Above the valleys, the soil is thin and outcroppings of igneous or sedimentary bedrock are common. Millions of years of erosion have created spectacular cliffs and escarpments in many areas, some of which have become major attractions for local tourism.

===Climate===
Located in the shadow of the Sobaek mountains and west of the Taebaek Mountains, Mungyeong has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. The number of frost-free days is significantly lower than it is in more coastal areas of South Korea. Annual temperature fluctuates around , and annual rainfall around . There are roughly 90 days of heavy rain per year, of which about 30 fall during the monsoonal rainy season in July and August.

==Government==
The seat of government is located in Jeomchon 4-dong. Local government is ruled by representative democracy in a parliamentary system. However, many aspects of local governance are actually under centralized provincial or national control. For example, educational affairs are overseen by the Mungyeong Office of Education, which reports not to the city government but to the North Gyeongsang provincial Office of Education. A similar situation applies to the local police.

===Executive===
The mayors of Mungyeong have been elected by popular vote since 1995. Under current South Korean law, elections are held every four years. The current mayor of Mungyeong is Shin Hyun-Kook (), who prevailing in the local elections of July 1, 2022. The vice mayor is Baek Seungmo (), who began serving on January 1, 2023.

===Legislative===
The head of the Mungyeong city council is Lee Jeonggeol (), who was elected from Ra constituency (Hogye, Jeomchon 1 and 3 dong). There are a total of thirteen members altogether.

===Judicial===
The city court of Mungyeong is located near the city hall. Along with the Yecheon city court, it is one of two courts overseen by the Sangju circuit, which in turn reports to the Daegu District Court in the provincial capital.

== Administrative Districts ==
It consists of 2 eup, 7 myeon and 5 dong.

* Number of Eup, Myeon, and Dong: 14 (2 Eup, 7 Myeon, 5 Dong)
* Administrative governance: 319 (103 tong, 216 ri)
* Legal governance:130 (119 ri, 11 dong)

==Demographics==
The population of Mungyeong continues to fall, as more people move away to major urban centers such as Daegu and Seoul. Although the city overall is losing population, there continues to be a considerable expansion in construction in the urban center of Jeomchon.

The overwhelming majority of Mungyeong&#x27;s people (approximately 99.7%) are ethnic Korean. Many of them are from families with long and deep roots in the area.

==Economy==
The Mungyeong economy during much of the 20th century was based on coal mining. However, these mines were closed in the 1980s, and since then the municipal government has focused on developing tourism, agriculture and light industry in the region.

Because of its mountainous condition, most of Mungyeong&#x27;s land (roughly 75%) is unsuitable for farming. Nonetheless, the agricultural sector continues to play an important role in the local economy as well. Some local produce is sold directly in the area, but most is exported to major urban centers on South Korea. Orchard farming, particularly apple growing plays an important role, with of land devoted to orcharding.

The local government has set up various institutions to promote agricultural and industrial development, including &quot;agro-industrial complexes&quot; located around the rural districts. These efforts have met with some success, as for example the area under orchard cultivation expanded significantly in the late 1990s.

==Communications and media==
In terms of media it may be considered largely identical with the rest of northern North Gyeongsang. Broadcast is dominated by network outlets in Daegu or Andong, and most available newspapers are printed in Seoul, although provincial newspapers also circulate.

Local journalism, therefore, is primarily limited to local weekly newspapers such as the &quot;Saejae Sinmun&quot;. These weeklies are dominated by classified advertising, but also carry a selection of local news and commentary.

In recent years, cable television and high-speed internet service has become widespread in Mungyeong.

==Divisions==
Mungyeong is divided into 2 eup, 7 myeon and 5 dongs. These are the primary divisions of the city; each is divided in turn into a large number of ri. &quot;(For more information on these terms, see Administrative divisions of South Korea)&quot;. The dongs are all clustered around the town of Jeomchon. The smallest is Jeomchon 1-dong, which covers only 0.98 square kilometers and covers the traditional city center of Jeomchon. The largest is Jeomchon 4-dong northwest of town, which at is bigger than all the others put together. Prior to January 1, 2004, the dongs were known by individual names; for example, Jeomchon 4-dong was known as &quot;Mojeon-dong.&quot;

Six of the myeon, or townships, form an L, with its bottom in the southeast near the confluence of the Yeong and Nakdong rivers: Yeongsun-myeon, Sanyang-myeon, Maseong-myeon, Hogye-myeon, Sanbuk-myeon and Dongno-myeon. Nongam-myeon lies south of Gaeun, at Mungyeong&#x27;s southern limit.

Gaeun-eup was once an important town in its own right, but has now become largely marginalized. Mungyeong-eup, the principal center of the city apart from Jeomchon, is found in the northern area of the county. It was the seat of Mungyeong County before that entity was merged with Jeomchon City to form the modern boundaries of Mungyeong. It still retains a relatively high profile in the county, with its own library and intercity bus terminal.

==People==
In the late 9th century, when Mungyeong was a part of the Sangju district of Silla, a man from Gaeun-eup (then Gaseon-hyeon) named Ajagae fomented a local peasant rebellion which seized the fortress of Sangju. His son, Kyŏn Hwŏn, who was also probably born in Gaeun, ruled the kingdom of Later Baekje during the Later Three Kingdoms period.

Various literary figures of the Joseon period hailed from Mungyeong, as did heroes of the resistance against Japanese attacks in the late 16th century (the local commander Sin Gil-won, 1548–1592) and of the righteous army movement in the early 20th (the leader I Gang-nyeon, 1858–1908).

==Tourism==

Numerous tourist attractions have been promoted throughout the city of Mungyeong. By far the best-known of these around the country is Mungyeong Saejae, the mountain pass where the old road from Busan to Seoul passed over the Sobaek mountains and out of the Gyeongsang region. The three gates which controlled traffic on that road are now maintained as tourist attractions.

Various other places around Mungyeong are renowned for their scenery. Among these is the Jinnam Bridge area, which a regional newspaper called the &quot;Yeongnam Ilbo&quot; once called &quot;one of the eight wonders of Gyeongsangbuk-do.&quot; There are three museums in Mungyeong: the historical museum at Mungyeong Saejae, a ceramics museum nearby, and the Coal Museum in Gaeun-eup. Additional local tourist attractions include spas, a shooting range, a paragliding area, and the Gyeongcheon Lake reservoir in the east.

Parkland takes up a significant portion of Mungyeong&#x27;s total area. The Songnisan National Park covers part of Gaeun-eup in the southwest. Mungyeong Saejae is itself a provincial park, covering a substantial area of Mungyeong-eup. Also covering part of Mungyeong-eup and a considerable chunk of Dongno-myeon is Woraksan National Park.

The municipal government has striven to convert the coal-mining tradition into a tourist attraction as much as possible. For example, a Coal Museum has been set up in Gaeun, which was once the heart of the mining district. Likewise, the former Gaeun Line railroad has been converted into a bicycle path.

In April 2020 a cable-driven people mover - called the &quot;Mungyeong Dansan Tourist Monorail&quot; - opened to take people to the peak of Mount Dan (959 meters above sea level) near Mungyeongsaejae Pass. Ten 8-passenger vehicles take visitors to the summit, with a round trip time of 35 minutes. (Although the system is called a &#x27;monorail&#x27; it runs on two rails). The summit has a number of attractions including camping sites and mountain bike trails.

== Festival ==
2015 Mungyeong Military World Games ()

In October 2015, competitions were held in various parts of North Gyeongsang Province. It was held in Mungyeong, and the match was held in Mungyeong at the stadium of the Korean Armed Forces Athletic Corps.

==Transportation==

The automobile is the preferred means of transportation for most Mungyeong residents. Auto ownership is quite high, with a total of 21,687 cars owned, according to local statistics. However, because of the city&#x27;s low population density, traffic congestion is rare. National highways connect Jeomchon with Sangju, Chungju and Yeongju.

Before the end of 2004, the portion of the Jungbu Naeryuk Expressway running through Mungyeong was completed. Interchanges with the expressway are located at Jeomchon and Mungyeong-eup. This has led to significant changes in local transit patterns and the local economy.

The city&#x27;s public transit needs are primarily served by buses: city buses which operate locally and to neighboring Sangju and Yecheon, and intercity buses which carry passengers to more distant destinations. Bus terminals are located in Mungyeong-eup and Jeomchon. Because of low passenger traffic, most intercity buses which pass through Mungyeong also stop in Sangju.

Mungyeong is also served by passenger rail, through the Gyeongbuk Line, which runs from Yeongju to Gimcheon (where it joins the Gyeongbu Line, and stops at Jeomchon Station. In the past, the Mungyeong Line and Gaeun Line, spurs which run from Jeomchon Station to Mungyeong-eup and Gaeun-eup, also carried passenger traffic. However, this was discontinued by the Korean National Railroad in 1995, as part of a general restructuring. The Gyeongbuk Line carries three to five passenger trains a day in each direction, in addition to significant freight traffic.

No airports are located within Mungyeong, but a small airport with passenger service operates in neighboring Yecheon.

==Culture==
The culture of Mungyeong is generally speaking similar to that of other rural areas in Gyeongsang province. It is marked by a relatively strong persistence of Korean Confucian values.

The city retains ties to traditional arts. Various Korean folksongs, including the Mungyeong Saejae arirang, are distinctive to the district. However, the most intensely promoted art form in the district is Mungyeong&#x27;s traditional ceramic craft, which dates to the Joseon period and is still practiced by many master potters in the area.

The city is also well known for its traditional tea bowl festival since 1999.

Local cuisine, although broadly similar to South Korean cuisine in general, does contain some local flourishes. The North Gyeongsang specialty &quot;jjim dalk&quot;, a spicy chicken and noodle dish, and Chuncheon-style chicken galbi are widely available.

===Religion===
As elsewhere in South Korea, Christianity coexists with Korean Buddhism and shamanism, and a large segment of the population professes no religious belief. Churches can be found in any sizeable community within Mungyeong. The area around Joryeong Mountain contains numerous places of importance for shamanic practitioners, or &quot;musogin&quot;.

===Sports===
Mungyeong is home to the Sangmu Phoenix baseball team and the Mungyeong Sangmu women&#x27;s football team, and athletics remain highly popular in the city. The city stadium in Jeomchon hosts public athletic competitions, and in addition, numerous private establishments such as batting cages can be found in the area.

In 2015, Mungyeong hosted the 6th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games.

==Education==
As elsewhere in South Korea, there is a three-tiered public educational system: 6 years of elementary school, 3 years of middle school, and 3 years of high school. School attendance is compulsory. Within Mungyeong, there are 18 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, and 8 high schools, all overseen by the Mungyeong Office of Education. There is one middle school and one high school exclusively for girls; the others are coeducational. Some high schools, such as Mungyeong Industrial High School and Mungyeong Tourist High School, provide specific vocational training.

Many parents supplement their children&#x27;s public education with private instruction, and thus there are numerous hagwons, or private academies, both in Jeomchon and outlying areas.

There is only one institution of higher education within Mungyeong, namely Mun Kyung College in Hogye-myeon. Many attend universities nearby, such as Sangju National University, or elsewhere in the country.

<doc id="968630" wikidata="Q42163" url="?curid=968630" title="Sangju">
<text>Sangju (; ) is a city in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Although Sangju is rather rural, it is very old and was once a key city. Along with Gyeongju, it gives rise to half of the name of the Gyeongsang Provinces. Sangju is nicknamed &quot;Sam Baek&quot;, or &quot;Three Whites&quot;, referring to three prominent agricultural products rice, silkworm cocoons, and dried persimmons from the area.

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===

Sangju lies on the northwestern border of North Gyeongsang province, touching on North Chungcheong Province. Thus, to its west and north it adjoins the North Chungcheong counties of Boeun, Goesan, Okcheon, and Yeongdong. Within North Gyeongsang province, it touches Mungyeong on the north, Yecheon, Uiseong, and Gumi on the east, and Gimcheon to the south.

The north and west extremes of the city are found in Hwabuk-myeon, at 127°47′55″E and 36°14′6″N, respectively. The southern limit lies in Gongseong-myeon at 36°14′06″N, on the border with Gimcheon. The eastern edge of Sangju is found in Jungdong-myeon at 128°20′28″E. The city thus spans a total distance of about from north to south, and about from east to west.

All of Sangju lies in the valley of the Nakdong River. Various tributaries flow into the Nakdong in Sangju, including the Yeong (which rises in Mungyeong). The land slopes down from the Sobaek Mountains in the east to the river basin. The highest elevation in Sangju is found at the top of Songnisan, 1,058 m above sea level. Like most of South Korea, the terrain is generally hilly, with only a few flat areas along the rivers. Because of this rugged terrain, 67% of the land in Sangju is classified as &quot;vacant,&quot; unused for agricultural or other purposes.

Namsan mountain is located in the city.

===Climate===
Sangju has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. The average annual temperature is between and , fluctuating from an August average of to a chilly January mean of . The temperature in the mountainous northwest is normally substantially lower. The mean annual rainfall is 

==History==

Sangju has played an important role in much of Korean history. It first emerges after the Silla conquest of the area, in which minor states such as Goryeong Gaya (in Hamchang-eup) and Sabeol-guk (in Sabeol-myeon) were subjugated. The dates at which these conquests occurred are open to dispute, but it is apparent that the area was under firm Silla control by 505, and probably for some time before then.

Under Silla, the fortress of Sangju was one of the nine &quot;ju&quot;, or provincial administrative units, into which the portions of the kingdom near Gyeongju were divided. It played a critical role in regulating traffic along the east–west transit route which connected the Han River valley in the west (which Silla acquired in 553) with Gyeongju area. It would have been the first major city that Buddhist missionaries from Goguryeo would have reached when travelling down from Haneuljae Pass in the 6th century.

During the tumultuous decline of Unified Silla in the late 9th century, a number of rebellions occurred in Sangju, as they did throughout the country. Notable among them are the rebellions of Ajagae, who seized the fortress of Sangju and declared himself a general, and the Silla noble Bak Eon-chang, who re-established the kingdom of Sabeol-guk in the Sabeol-myeon area until he was overthrown by the Later Baekje leader Kyŏn Hwŏn. Ajagae surrendered to Wang Kŏn in 918.

In 1895, as part of a general reorganization of local government, Sangju was designated Sangju-gun (Sangju County). In 1914, its boundaries were extended to cover Hamchang County, present-day Hamchang-eup. On January 1, 1986, separate administrative divisions were created for the city center (which was called Sangju City) and the outskirts (which continued to be called Sangju County). On January 1, 1995, the city and county were reunified to create the present-day entity of Sangju City.

Under Japanese occupation, the occupation government made various efforts to modernize local agriculture and resource extraction. The railroad through Sangju was completed in 1924, and around the same time the agricultural-training institution which would become Sangju National University was established.

In 2002, the first Carthusian monastery in Asia was established in the city, the Charterhouse Our Lady of Korea.

==Government==
The legislative and executive branches of Sangju are headed by officials elected by popular vote. This has been the case across South Korea since 1991, when local representative government was resumed after a thirty-year suspension. Under current South Korean law, elections are held once every four years. The most recent elections were held in June 2002.

===Executive===
The mayor of Sangju is Yeong-seok Kang, of the People Power Party (PPP)].

===Legislative===
The city council of Sangju is the chief legislative organ of the district. Like the mayor, the members of the city council are elected every four years. The chairman of the Sangju city council is An Gyeong-suk (). The council which began serving in 2022 is the ninth council to represent the present-day entity of Sangju; the first was formed from the merger of the pre-existing councils of Sangju and Sangju County. There are 17 members. One member is elected from each eup, myeon, and dong, except for Sinheung-dong and Dongseong-dong, which share a single representative.

===Judicial===
The regional court of Sangju oversees local courts in Mungyeong and Yecheon County, in addition to Sangju. It reports to the provincial court in Daegu.

==Economy==

The economy of Sangju is traditionally agricultural. Agriculture remains an important sector, as 40% of the city&#x27;s residents are engaged in farming. Sangju has the largest number of farming households of any district in South Korea, and the most agricultural land of any district in North Gyeongsang.

The area has been famed for sericulture (silk production) since Silla times. Currently of land are engaged in silk production, bringing in about 434 million won annually. In addition, numerous other cash crops are farmed in the area. The most important agricultural product is rice, in the production of which Sangju is 7th in the country, with in production yielding 162.9 billion won. Other important products include grapes, apples, pears, and cucumbers.

Sangju today is an important regional center of industry and commerce as well, exerting a significant economic effect on neighboring areas. This is facilitated by its strong transit connections (see &quot;Transportation, below)&quot;. Also, Sangju tries to keep up agaricultural section with some specialized and traditional produces such as dried persimmon and fruits raised in high altitude.

==Divisions==

Sangju is divided into one eup, seventeen myeon, and six dongs. These 24 primary divisions are made up of 361 ri.

The lone eup is Hamchang, on the city&#x27;s northern border with Mungyeong.

From west to east along the city&#x27;s northern border, the myeon are Hwabuk-myeon, Oeseo-myeon, Euncheok-myeon, and Ian-myeon which adjoins Hamchang-eup. From north to south along the western border are Sabeol-myeon, Jungdong-myeon, and Nakdong-myeon. From east to west along the southern border are Cheongni-myeon, Gongseong-myeon, Modong-myeon, and Moseo-myeon in the southwest corner. Along the central western border lie Hwadong-myeon and Hwanam-myeon. In addition, the interior of the city includes Hwaseo-myeon, Gonggeom-myeon, Naeseo-myeon and Oenam-myeon.

The dongs are clustered around the city center, and from 1986 to 1995 they made up all of Sangju (see &quot;History, above). They are Bukmun-dong in the northern part of town, Gyerim-dong in the northeast, Dongmun-dong to the east, Dongseong-dong to the southeast, Sinheung-dong to the south, and Namwon-dong to the west. Namwon-dong is the most populous, with 13,334 registered residents (2002).
==Transportation==

The Gyeongbuk Line railroad runs through Sangju, connecting to the main Gyeongbu Line in Gimcheon. It is thus possible to take passenger trains from Sangju to major southeastern cities such as Daegu and Busan. The Gyeongbuk Line carries both passenger and freight traffic, and provides an important link for people and businesses in the hinterland of Sangju. Aside from Sangju Station itself, stations are located in Sabeol-myeon (Baegwon Station), Gonggeom-myeon (Yangjeom Station), and Hamchang-eup (Hamchang Station) north of the city, and Cheongni-myeon (Cheongni Station) and Gongseong-myeon (Oksan Station) to the south.

The Jungbu Naeryuk Expressway, number 45, runs from north to south through the city and connects Sangju with the national expressway grid. The Sangju interchange is located near the city center, and the North Sangju interchange near Hamchang. An additional expressway, number 30, which will run from west to east, is under construction.

In addition, national highways connect Sangju with many neighboring cities and towns. For example, National Road 3 has served as the traditional artery connecting Sangju with Mungyeong and Chungju, and National Road 25 continues to play an important role tying Sangju to its neighbor on the western side of the Sobaek mountains, Boeun County.

==Education==

Like the rest of South Korea, Sangju has a three-tiered system of education: elementary, middle, and high. All public schools in the city are overseen by the Sangju Office of Education, which reports to the North Gyeongsang Provincial Office of Education. Most preschools (40 altogether) are also administered by the Office of Education, and are attached to elementary schools; however, five registered private preschools also operate in the city. In addition, the Sanghee School, which provides education for the mentally challenged from preschool to high school ages, is located in Namseong-dong in the city center.

There are 43 elementary schools in Sangju, including eleven branch schools. There are 17 public middle schools in the city, including two branch schools. Of these, one each is reserved exclusively for male and female students. In addition, there are five private middle schools, of which two are female-only, two male-only, and one coeducational. The city also boasts six private and six public high schools: four of the private and two of the public institutions are gender-segregated. Half of the high schools offer technical training, and half maintain a general academic focus.

Sangju is home to Sangju National University, a government-administered institution with a focus on agricultural technology. Many young people of college age leave the area to attend schools in the Seoul National Capital Area or other major cities.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Sangju is twinned with:

* Gochang County, North Jeolla Province (1999)
* Gangseo District, Seoul (2003)
* Davis, California, United States (2004)
* Yichun, Jiangxi, China (2005)
* Keelung, Taiwan (2013)

<doc id="968638" wikidata="Q168587" url="?curid=968638" title="Sol LeWitt">
<text>Solomon &quot;Sol&quot; LeWitt (September 9, 1928 – April 8, 2007) was an American artist linked to various movements, including conceptual art and minimalism.

LeWitt came to fame in the late 1960s with his wall drawings and &quot;structures&quot; (a term he preferred to &quot;sculptures&quot;) but was prolific in a wide range of media including drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, and artist&#x27;s books. He has been the subject of hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world since 1965. The first biography of the artist, &quot;Sol LeWitt: A Life of Ideas&quot;, by Lary Bloom, was published by Wesleyan University Press in the spring of 2019.

==Life==

LeWitt was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father died when he was 6. His mother took him to art classes at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. After earning a BFA from Syracuse University in 1949, LeWitt traveled to Europe where he was exposed to Old Master paintings. Shortly thereafter, he served in the Korean War, first in California, then Japan, and finally Korea. LeWitt moved to New York City in 1953 and set up a studio on the Lower East Side, in the old Ashkenazi Jewish settlement on Hester Street. During this time he studied at the School of Visual Arts while also pursuing his interest in design at &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine, where he did paste-ups, mechanicals, and photostats. In 1955, he was a graphic designer in the office of architect I.M. Pei for a year. Around that time, LeWitt also discovered the work of the late 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, whose studies in sequence and locomotion were an early influence for him. These experiences, combined with an entry-level job as a night receptionist and clerk he took in 1960 at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, would influence LeWitt&#x27;s later work.

At MoMA, LeWitt&#x27;s co-workers included fellow artists Robert Ryman, Dan Flavin, Gene Beery, and Robert Mangold, and the future art critic and writer, Lucy Lippard who worked as a page in the library. Curator Dorothy Canning Miller&#x27;s now famous 1960 &quot;Sixteen Americans&quot; exhibition with work by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Frank Stella created a swell of excitement and discussion among the community of artists with whom LeWitt associated. LeWitt also became friends with Hanne Darboven, Eva Hesse, and Robert Smithson.

LeWitt taught at several New York schools, including New York University and the School of Visual Arts, during the late 1960s. In 1980, LeWitt left New York for Spoleto, Italy. After returning to the United States in the late 1980s, LeWitt made Chester, Connecticut, his primary residence. He died at age 78 in New York from cancer complications.

==Work==
LeWitt is regarded as a founder of both Minimal and Conceptual art. His prolific two and three-dimensional work ranges from wall drawings (over 1200 of which have been executed) to hundreds of works on paper extending to structures in the form of towers, pyramids, geometric forms, and progressions. These works range in size from books and gallery-sized installations to monumental outdoor pieces. LeWitt&#x27;s first serial sculptures were created in the 1960s using the modular form of the square in arrangements of varying visual complexity. In Issue 5 of &quot;0 To 9&quot; magazine, LeWitt&#x27;s work &#x27;Sentences on Conceptual Art&#x27; was published.This piece became one of the most widely cited artists&#x27; writings of the 1960s, exploring the relationship between art, practice and art criticism. In 1979, LeWitt participated in the design for the Lucinda Childs Dance Company&#x27;s piece &quot;Dance&quot;.

===Sculpture===

In the early 1960s, LeWitt first began to create his &quot;structures,&quot; a term he used to describe his three-dimensional work. His frequent use of open, modular structures originates from the cube, a form that influenced the artist&#x27;s thinking from the time that he first became an artist. After creating an early body of work made up of closed-form wooden objects, heavily lacquered by hand, in the mid-1960s he &quot;decided to remove the skin altogether and reveal the structure.&quot; This skeletal form, the radically simplified open cube, became a basic building block of the artist&#x27;s three-dimensional work. In the mid-1960s, LeWitt began to work with the open cube: twelve identical linear elements connected at eight corners to form a skeletal structure. From 1969, he would conceive many of his modular structures on a large scale, to be constructed in aluminum or steel by industrial fabricators. Several of LeWitt&#x27;s cube structures stood at approximate eye level. The artist introduced bodily proportion to his fundamental sculptural unit at this scale.

Following early experimentation LeWitt settled on a standard version for his modular cubes, circa 1965: the negative space between the beams would stand to the positive space of the sculptural material itself in a ratio of 8.5:1, or formula_1. The material would also be painted white instead of black, to avoid the &quot;expressiveness&quot; of the black color of earlier, similar pieces. Both the ratio and the color were arbitrary aesthetic choices, but once taken they were used consistently in several pieces which typify LeWitt&#x27;s &quot;modular cube&quot; works. Museums holding specimens of LeWitt&#x27;s modular cube works have published lesson suggestions for elementary education, meant to encourage children to investigate the mathematical properties of the artworks.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, LeWitt composed some of his sculptures from stacked cinder blocks, still generating variations within self-imposed restrictions. At this time, he began to work with concrete blocks. In 1985, the first cement &quot;Cube&quot; was built in a park in Basel. From 1990 onwards, LeWitt conceived multiple variations on a tower to be constructed using concrete blocks. In a shift away from his well-known geometric vocabulary of forms, the works LeWitt realized in the late 1990s indicate vividly the artist&#x27;s growing interest in somewhat random curvilinear shapes and highly saturated colors.

In 2007, LeWitt conceived &quot;9 Towers&quot;, a cube made from more than 1,000 light-coloured bricks that measure five meters on each side. It was installed at the Kivik Art Centre in Lilla Stenshuvud, Sweden, in 2014.

===Wall drawings===
In 1968, LeWitt began to conceive sets of guidelines or simple diagrams for his two-dimensional works drawn directly on the wall, executed first in graphite, then in crayon, later in colored pencil and finally in chromatically rich washes of India ink, bright acrylic paint, and other materials. Since he created a work of art for Paula Cooper Gallery&#x27;s inaugural show in 1968, an exhibition to benefit the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, thousands of LeWitt&#x27;s drawings have been installed directly on the surfaces of walls. Between 1969 and 1970 he created four &quot;Drawings Series&quot;, which presented different combinations of the basic element that governed many of his early wall drawings. In each series he applied a different system of change to each of twenty-four possible combinations of a square divided into four equal parts, each containing one of the four basic types of lines LeWitt used (vertical, horizontal, diagonal left, and diagonal right). The result is four possible permutations for each of the twenty-four original units. The system used in Drawings Series I is what LeWitt termed &#x27;Rotation,&#x27; Drawings Series II uses a system termed &#x27;Mirror,&#x27; Drawings Series III uses &#x27;Cross &amp; Reverse Mirror,&#x27; and Drawings Series IV uses &#x27;Cross Reverse&#x27;.

In &quot;Wall Drawing #122&quot;, first installed in 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the work contains &quot;all combinations of two lines crossing, placed at random, using arcs from corners and sides, straight, not straight and broken lines&quot; resulting in 150 unique pairings that unfold on the gallery walls. LeWitt further expanded on this theme, creating variations such as &quot;Wall Drawing #260&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which systematically runs through all possible two-part combinations of arcs and lines. Conceived in 1995, &quot;Wall Drawing #792: Black rectangles and squares&quot; underscores LeWitt&#x27;s early interest in the intersections between art and architecture. Spanning the two floors of the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Brussels, this work consists of varying combinations of black rectangles, creating an irregular grid-like pattern.

LeWitt, who had moved to Spoleto, Italy, in the late 1970s credited his transition from graphite pencil or crayon to vivid ink washes, to his encounter with the frescoes of Giotto, Masaccio, and other early Florentine painters. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he created highly saturated colorful acrylic wall drawings. While their forms are curvilinear, playful and seem almost random, they are also drawn according to an exacting set of guidelines. The bands are a standard width, for example, and no colored section may touch another section of the same color.

In 2005 LeWitt began a series of &#x27;scribble&#x27; wall drawings, so termed because they required the draftsmen to fill in areas of the wall by scribbling with graphite. The scribbling occurs at six different densities, which are indicated on the artist&#x27;s diagrams and then mapped out in string on the surface of the wall. The gradations of scribble density produce a continuum of tone that implies three dimensions. The largest scribble wall drawing, &quot;Wall Drawing #1268&quot;, is on view at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery.

According to the principle of his work, LeWitt&#x27;s wall drawings are usually executed by people other than the artist himself. Even after his death, people are still making these drawings. He would therefore eventually use teams of assistants to create such works. Writing about making wall drawings, LeWitt himself observed in 1971 that &quot;each person draws a line differently and each person understands words differently&quot;. Between 1968 and his death in 2007, LeWitt created more than 1,270 wall drawings. The wall drawings, executed on-site, generally exist for the duration of an exhibition; they are then destroyed, giving the work in its physical form an ephemeral quality. They can be installed, removed, and then reinstalled in another location, as many times as required for exhibition purposes. When transferred to another location, the number of walls can change only by ensuring that the proportions of the original diagram are retained.

Permanent murals by LeWitt can be found at, among others, the AXA Center, New York (1984–85); The Swiss Re headquarters Americas in Armonk, New York, the Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta (&quot;Wall Drawing #581&quot;, 1989/90); the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC (&quot;Wall Drawing #1103&quot;, 2003); the Conrad Hotel, New York (&quot;Loopy Doopy (Blue and Purple)&quot;, 1999); the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo (&quot;Wall Drawing #1268: Scribbles: Staircase (AKAG)&quot;, 2006/2010); Akron Art Museum, Akron (2007); the Columbus Circle Subway Station, New York; The Jewish Museum (New York), New York; the Green Center for Physics at MIT, Cambridge (&quot;Bars of Colors Within Squares (MIT)&quot;, 2007); the Embassy of the United States in Berlin; the Wadsworth Atheneum; and John Pearson&#x27;s House, Oberlin, Ohio. The artist&#x27;s last public wall drawing, &quot;Wall Drawing #1259: Loopy Doopy (Springfield)&quot; (2008), is at the United States Courthouse in Springfield, Massachusetts (designed by architect Moshe Safdie). &quot;Wall Drawing #599: Circles 18&quot; (1989) — a bull&#x27;s eye of concentric circles in alternating bands of yellow, blue, red and white — was installed at the lobby of the Jewish Community Center, New York, in 2013.

===Gouaches===
In the 1980s, in particular after a trip to Italy, LeWitt started using gouache, an opaque water-based paint, to produce free-flowing abstract works in contrasting colors. These represented a significant departure from the rest of his practice, as he created these works with his own hands. LeWitt&#x27;s gouaches are often created in series based on a specific motif. Past series have included &quot;Irregular Forms&quot;, &quot;Parallel Curves&quot;, &quot;Squiggly Brushstrokes&quot; and &quot;Web-like Grids&quot;.

Although this loosely rendered composition may have been a departure from his earlier, more geometrically structured works visually, it nevertheless remained in alignment with his original artistic intent. LeWitt painstakingly made his own prints from his gouache compositions. In 2012, art advisor Heidi Lee Komaromi curated, &quot;Sol LeWitt: Works on Paper 1983-2003&quot;, an exhibition revealing the variety of techniques LeWitt employed on paper during the final decades of his life.

===Artist&#x27;s books===
From 1966, LeWitt&#x27;s interest in seriality led to his production of more than 50 artist&#x27;s books throughout his career; he later donated many examples to the Wadsworth Athenaeum&#x27;s library. In 1976 LeWitt helped found Printed Matter, Inc, a for-profit art space in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City with fellow artists and critics Lucy Lippard, Carol Androcchio, Amy Baker (Sandback), Edit DeAk, Mike Glier, Nancy Linn, Walter Robinson, Ingrid Sischy, Pat Steir, Mimi Wheeler, Robin White and Irena von Zahn. LeWitt was a signal innovator of the genre of the &quot;artist&#x27;s book,&quot; a term that was coined for a 1973 exhibition curated by Dianne Perry Vanderlip at Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia.

Printed Matter was one of the first organizations dedicated to creating and distributing artists&#x27; books, incorporating self-publishing, small-press publishing, and artist networks and collectives. For LeWitt and others, Printed Matter also served as a support system for avant-garde artists, balancing its role as publisher, exhibition space, retail space, and community center for the downtown arts scene, in that sense emulating the network of aspiring artists LeWitt knew and enjoyed as a staff member at the Museum of Modern Art.

===Architecture and landscaping===
LeWitt collaborated with architect Stephen Lloyd to design a synagogue for his congregation Beth Shalom Rodfe Zedek; he conceptualized the &quot;airy&quot; synagogue building, with its shallow dome supported by &quot;exuberant wooden roof beams&quot;, an homage to the wooden synagogues of eastern Europe.

In 1981, LeWitt was invited by the Fairmount Park Art Association (currently known as the Association for Public Art) to propose a public artwork for a site in Fairmount Park. He selected the long, rectangular plot of land known as the Reilly Memorial and submitted a drawing with instructions. Installed in 2011, &quot;Lines in Four Directions in Flowers&quot; is made up of more than 7,000 plantings arranged in strategically configured rows. In his original proposal, the artist planned an installation of flower plantings of four different colors (white, yellow, red &amp; blue) in four equal rectangular areas, in rows of four directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal right &amp; left) framed by evergreen hedges of about 2&#x27; height, with each color block comprising four to five species that bloom sequentially.
In 2004, &quot;Six Curved Walls&quot; sculpture was installed on the hillside slope of Crouse College on Syracuse University campus. The concrete block sculpture consists of six undulating walls, each 12 feet high, and spans 140 feet. The sculpture was designed and constructed to mark the inauguration of Nancy Cantor as the 11th Chancellor of Syracuse University.

==Collection==
Since the early 1960s he and his wife, Carol Androccio, gathered nearly 9,000 works of art through purchases, in trades with other artists and dealers, or as gifts. In this way he acquired works by approximately 750 artists, including Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman, Hanne Darboven, Eva Hesse, Donald Judd, On Kawara, Kazuko Miyamoto, Carl Andre, Dan Graham, Hans Haacke, Gerhard Richter, and others. In 2007, the exhibition &quot;Selections from The LeWitt Collection&quot; at the Weatherspoon Art Museum assembled approximately 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, and photographs, among them works by Andre, Alice Aycock, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jan Dibbets, Jackie Ferrara, Gilbert and George, Alex Katz, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, Mario Merz, Shirin Neshat, Pat Steir, and many other artists.

==Exhibitions==

LeWitt&#x27;s work was first publicly exhibited in 1964 in a group show curated by Dan Flavin at the Kaymar Gallery, New York.Dan Graham&#x27;s John Daniels Gallery later gave him his first solo show in 1965. In 1966, he participated in the &quot;Primary Structures&quot; exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York (a seminal show which helped define the minimalist movement), submitting an untitled, open modular cube of 9 units. The same year he was included in the &quot;10&quot; exhibit at Dwan Gallery, New York. He was later invited by Harald Szeemann to participate in &quot;When Attitude Becomes Form,&quot; at the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland, in 1969. Interviewed in 1993 about those years LeWitt remarked, &quot;I decided I would make color or form recede and proceed in a three-dimensional way.&quot;

The Gemeentemuseum in The Hague presented his first retrospective exhibition in 1970, and his work was later shown in a major mid-career retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1978. In 1972/1973, LeWitt&#x27;s first museum shows in Europe were mounted at the Kunsthalle Bern and the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. In 1975, Lewitt created &quot;The Location of a Rectangle for the Hartford Atheneum&quot; for the third MATRIX exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. Later that year, he participated in the Wadsworth Atheneum&#x27;s sixth MATRIX exhibition, providing instructions for a second wall drawing. MoMA gave LeWitt his first retrospective in 1978-79. The exhibition traveled to various American venues. For the 1987 Skulptur Projekte Münster, Germany, he realized &quot;Black Form: Memorial to the Missing Jews&quot;, a rectangular wall of black concrete blocks for the center of a plaza in front of an elegant, white Neoclassical government building; it is now installed at Altona Town Hall, Hamburg. Other major exhibitions since include &quot;Sol LeWitt Drawings 1958-1992&quot;, which was organized by the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Netherlands in 1992 which traveled over the next three years to museums in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the United States; and in 1996, the Museum of Modern Art, New York mounted a traveling survey exhibition: &quot;Sol LeWitt Prints: 1970-1995&quot;. A major LeWitt retrospective was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2000. The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

In 2006, LeWitt&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Series…&quot; was displayed at and was devoted to the 1970s drawings by the conceptual artist. Drafters and assistants drew directly on the walls using graphite, colored pencil, crayon, and chalk. The works were based on LeWitt&#x27;s complex principles, which eliminated the limitations of the canvas for more extensive constructions.
&quot;Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective&quot;, a collaboration between the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG), MASS MoCA (Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art), and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA) opened to the public in 2008 at MASS MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts. The exhibition will be on view for 25 years and is housed in a three-story historic mill building in the heart of MASS MoCA&#x27;s campus fully restored by Bruner/Cott and Associates architects (and outfitted with a sequence of new interior walls constructed to LeWitt&#x27;s specifications.) The exhibition consists of 105 drawings — comprising nearly one acre of wall surface — that LeWitt created over 40 years from 1969 to 2007 and includes several drawings never before seen, some of which LeWitt created for the project shortly before his death.

Furthermore, the artist was the subject of exhibitions at P.S. 1 Contemporary Center, Long Island City (&quot;Concrete Blocks&quot;); the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover (&quot;Twenty-Five Years of Wall Drawings, 1968-1993&quot;); and Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford (&quot;Incomplete Cubes&quot;), which traveled to three art museums in the United States. At the time of his death, LeWitt had just organized a retrospective of his work at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio.
At Naples &quot;Sol LeWitt. L&#x27;artista e i suoi artisti&quot; opened at the Museo Madre on December 15, 2012, running until April 1, 2013.

==Museum collections==
LeWitt&#x27;s works are found in the most important museum collections including: Tate Modern, London, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Hallen für Neue Kunst Schaffhausen, Switzerland, Australian National Gallery, Canberra, Australia, Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, , The Jewish Museum in Manhattan, Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, MASS MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts Institute of Technology List Art Center&#x27;s Public Art Collection, Cambridge, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The erection of Double Negative Pyramid by Sol LeWitt at Europos Parkas in Vilnius, Lithuania was a significant event in the history of art in post Berlin Wall era.

==Influence==

Sol LeWitt was one of the main figures of his time; he transformed the process of art-making by questioning the fundamental relationship between an idea, the subjectivity of the artist, and the artwork a given idea might produce. While many artists were challenging modern conceptions of originality, authorship, and artistic genius in the 1960s, LeWitt denied that approaches such as Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Process Art were merely technical or illustrative of philosophy. In his &quot;Paragraphs on Conceptual Art&quot;, LeWitt asserted that Conceptual art was neither mathematical nor intellectual but intuitive, given that the complexity inherent to transforming an idea into a work of art was fraught with contingencies. LeWitt&#x27;s art is not about the singular hand of the artist; it is the idea behind each work that surpasses the work itself. In the early 21st century, LeWitt&#x27;s work, especially the wall drawings, has been critically acclaimed for its economic perspicacity. Though modest—most exist as simple instructions on a sheet of paper—the drawings can be made again and again and again, anywhere in the world, without the artist needing to be involved in their production.

==Art world==
His auction record of $749,000 was set in 2014 for his gouache on paperboard piece &quot;Wavy Brushstroke&quot; (1995) at Sotheby&#x27;s, New York.

<text>Harold Douglas Harvey (March 13, 1930 – January 13, 2018), nicknamed &quot;God&quot;, was an umpire in Major League Baseball (MLB), who worked in the National League (NL) from 1962 through 1992.

Known for commanding presence and authoritative signals on the field, he earned his tongue-in-cheek nickname from players, and was the last major league umpires hired who never attended an umpiring school. Harvey umpired five World Series and seven All-Star Games. His career total of 4,673 games ranked third in major league history at the time of his retirement. In 2010, he became the ninth umpire to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1999, the Society for American Baseball Research ranked Harvey as the second-greatest umpire in history, behind only Bill Klem. In 2007, &quot;Referee&quot; magazine selected him as one of the 52 most influential figures in the history of sports officiating. Harvey wore uniform number 8 for most of his career.

==Early life==
Harvey was born on March 13, 1930, in South Gate, California, but was raised in San Diego, California.

Harvey began officiating local basketball games at the high school level at age 16, later umpiring softball and baseball. He attended San Diego State College in 1955–56, where he played baseball and football. He then returned to umpiring in the minor leagues while also officiating college basketball and football games. He remained a resident of San Diego throughout his umpiring career.

==Career==
Harvey umpired in the California League from 1958 to 1960, and in the Pacific Coast League in 1961. He married Joy Ann Glascock on September 24, 1960, and the couple had two sons, Scott and Todd. Harvey reached the majors on April 10, 1962, the first regular-season game in Dodger Stadium. His greatest influences were umpires Al Barlick, Jocko Conlan and Shag Crawford, each of whom gave him invaluable advice in developing his skills – Barlick for his renowned mastery of the rules, Conlan for helping him appreciate the fun of umpiring, and Crawford for his tremendous work ethic.

Harvey umpired in five World Series (1968, 1974, 1981, 1984 and 1988), serving as crew chief in 1984 and 1988, and in seven All-Star Games (1963, 1964, 1971, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992), calling balls and strikes for the 1982 and 1992 games.

Harvey set a record by officiating in the National League Championship Series nine times – 1970 (Games 2–3), 1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1984 (Game 5), 1986, 1989 and 1991 – serving as crew chief for the last five; his record was later tied by Paul Runge in 1997, and broken by Bruce Froemming in 2000.

He was the home plate umpire for the Pirates inaugural game (against the Cincinnati Reds) at Three Rivers Stadium on July 16, 1970. Harvey worked second base in the final game of the 1972 season, in which Roberto Clemente collected his 3,000th (and last) base hit off the New York Mets&#x27; Jon Matlack, then retrieved the ball for Clemente. Harvey was the home plate umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the NL&#x27;s Western Division champion in 1980, between the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harvey was the home plate umpire for Game 1 of the 1988 World Series when Kirk Gibson hit a game-winning home run off Dennis Eckersley. 

The Players Association conducted polls of players in both leagues to identify and rank the best umpires in 1974; Harvey was named the top NL umpire, being the only official in the league rated as &quot;excellent.&quot; In 1987, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll of NL catchers ranked him as the third best umpire in the league for calling balls and strikes, with one voter saying he &quot;still cares about doing the best possible job.&quot; In 1990, &quot;Sport&quot; magazine named him the best umpire in the game, citing his unbending application of the rules and noting his campaign to enforce the balk rule two seasons earlier, when he said, &quot;Give me ten high school pitchers, let me spend a week with them, and I&#x27;ll show you 10 pitchers who won&#x27;t balk. It&#x27;s not that difficult. So they better learn it.&quot;

Harvey&#x27;s goal of umpiring until age 65 ended on October 4, 1992, at age 62, when knee problems necessitated his retirement. He nonetheless became the first NL umpire since Bill Klem to work for more than 30 years, finishing with 31 years in the major leagues; his 4,673 games then ranked third in major league history behind Klem (5,374) and Tommy Connolly (4,769).

Harvey noted that when he arrived in the major leagues, the emphasis was on making calls quickly and decisively, and said, &quot;Everything was called too quickly. I&#x27;ve got a photograph of Jocko Conlan working first base. Jocko&#x27;s arm was extended in the out call. But the runner was still short of the bag, and the ball was still in flight. In those days it was common to anticipate the call&quot;. Harvey, however, changed attitudes by insisting that it was better to delay the call and make sure it was correct.

Harvey was easily recognizable due to his thick white hair, which had already gone completely gray when he was in his 30s, leading to the early nickname of &quot;Silver.&quot; In late 1971, he grew a handlebar mustache, at a time when no major league field personnel had worn facial hair since the 1940s; he kept it trimmed to the edges of his mouth, and he wore it during the 1972 season, when Oakland A&#x27;s players began to grow mustaches that season in order to earn bonuses from owner Charlie O. Finley. In the latter part of his career, Harvey was the voice of MLB&#x27;s &quot;You Make the Call&quot; segments.

==Later life==
In August 1997, Harvey was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was attributed to his longtime use of chewing tobacco.

In both 2003 and 2007, Harvey was the leading candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame in voting by Hall members on the Veterans Committee composite ballot for managers, umpires and executives; however, his totals of 48 and 52 votes in the two elections fell short of the 60 and 62 necessary for election. Under new rules established by the Hall in 2007, he was again eligible for election in 2008, but fell one vote short of the required 12 votes. On December 7, 2009, Harvey was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Hall of Fame Veterans&#x27; Committee and was inducted on July 25, 2010. Due to persistent voice issues from his cancer, Harvey&#x27;s speech was pre-recorded and delivered on a video broadcast, though he did say a few words after the speech was played to the estimated 10,000 fans in attendance.

Harvey died at the age of 87 on January 13, 2018, under hospice care in Visalia, California.

<text>Lennart Nilsson (24 August 1922 – 28 January 2017) was a Swedish photographer noted for his photographs of human embryos and other medical subjects once considered unphotographable, and more generally for his extreme macro photography. He was also considered to be among Sweden’s first modern photojournalists.

==Biography==
Lennart Nilsson was born in Strängnäs, Sweden. His father worked at the railway as a repairman and gave Lennart Nilsson a camera when Lennart Nilsson was twelve years old. When he was around fifteen, he saw a documentary about Louis Pasteur that made him interested in microscopy. Within a few years, Nilsson had acquired a microscope and was making microphotographs of insects.

In his late teens and twenties, he began taking a series of environmental portraits with an Icoflex Zeiss camera, and had the opportunity to photograph many famous Swedes.

He began his professional career in the mid-1940s as a freelance photographer, working frequently for the publisher Åhlen &amp; Åkerlund of Stockholm. One of his earliest assignments was covering the liberation of Norway in 1945 during World War II. Some of his early photo essays, notably &quot;A Midwife in Lapland &quot; (1945), &quot;Polar Bear Hunting in Spitzbergen&quot; (1947), and &quot;Fishermen at the Congo River&quot; (1948), brought him international attention after publication in &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Picture Post&quot;, and elsewhere.

In 1954, eighty-seven of his portraits of famous Swedes were published in the book &quot;Sweden in Profile&quot;. His 1955 book, &quot;Reportage&quot;, featured a selection of his early work. In 1963 his photoessay about the Swedish Salvation Army appeared in several magazines and in his book &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

In the mid-1950s he began experimenting with new photographic techniques to make extreme close-up photographs. These advances, combined with very thin endoscopes that became available in the mid-1960s, enabled him to make groundbreaking photographs of living human blood vessels and body cavities. He achieved international fame in 1965, when his photographs of the beginning of human life appeared on the cover and on sixteen pages of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, in an article titled “Drama of Life Before Birth”. They were also published in &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and elsewhere. The photographs made up a part of the book &quot;A Child is Born&quot; (1965); images from the book were reproduced in the April 30, 1965 edition of &quot;Life&quot;, which sold eight million copies in the first four days after publication. Some of the photographs from it were later included on both Voyager spacecraft.

In an interview published by PBS, Nilsson explained how he obtained photographs of living fetuses during medical procedures including laparoscopy and amniocentesis and discussed how he was able to light the inside of the mother&#x27;s womb. Describing a shoot that took place during a surgical procedure in Göteborg, he stated, &quot;The fetus was moving, not really sucking its thumb, but it was moving and you could see everything—heartbeats and umbilical cord and so on. It was extremely beautiful, really beautiful!&quot; Nilsson also acknowledged obtaining human embryos from women&#x27;s clinics in Sweden. The University of Cambridge claims that &quot;Nilsson actually photographed abortus material... working with dead embryos allowed Nilsson to experiment with lighting, background and positions, such as placing the thumb into the fetus&#x27; mouth. But the origin of the pictures was rarely mentioned, even by anti-abortion activists, who in the 1970s appropriated these icons.&quot; However, Nilsson himself has offered additional explanations for the sources of his photographs in other interviews, stating that he at times used embryos that had been miscarried due to extra-uterine or ectopic pregnancies.

In 1969 he began using a scanning electron microscope on a &quot;Life&quot; assignment to depict the body&#x27;s functions. He is generally credited with taking the first images of the human immunodeficiency virus, and in 2003, he took the first image of the SARS virus.

Around 1970 he joined the staff of the Karolinska Institutet. Nilsson was also involved in the creation of documentaries, including: &quot;The Saga of Life&quot; (1982); &quot;The Miracle of Life&quot; (1982); &quot;Odyssey of Life&quot; (1996) and &quot;Life&#x27;s Greatest Miracle&quot; (2001).

Nilsson died on 28 January 2017.

==Awards and honors==
Nilsson became a member of the Swedish Society of Medicine in 1969, received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institute in 1976, an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy from the Technische Universität Braunschweig in Germany in 2002, and an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy from Linköping University in Sweden in 2003. He won the Swedish Academy Nordic Authors&#x27; Prize, the first Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography (in 1980), the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences&#x27; Big Gold Medal in 1989, and in 2002 received the 12th presentation of the Swedish government&#x27;s Illis quorum. His documentaries won Emmy awards in 1983 and 1996. He was awarded the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Progress medal in 1993 &#x27;in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography.&#x27;

Nilsson&#x27;s work is on exhibit in many locations, including the British Museum in London, the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum, and the Modern Museum in Stockholm.

Since 1998, the Lennart Nilsson Award has been presented annually during the Karolinska Institute&#x27;s installation ceremony. It is given in recognition of extraordinary photography of science and is sponsored by the Lennart Nilsson Foundation.

<doc id="968653" wikidata="Q219944" url="?curid=968653" title="Deus (band)">
<text>Deus (styled as dEUS) is a rock band based in Antwerp, Belgium, whose only continuous members up to the present day are Tom Barman (vocals, guitars) and Klaas Janzoons (keyboards, violin). The rest of the band&#x27;s line-up currently consists of drummer Stéphane Misseghers, bassist Alan Gevaert, and guitarist/backing vocalist Mauro Pawlowski.

==History==
===Formation===
Formed in 1991, dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock. They first came to attention in Humo&#x27;s Rock Rally of 1992, and after the release of the four-track EP &quot;Zea&quot;, they were offered a recording contract with Island Records. They became the first Belgian indie act ever to sign to a major international label.

===First era (1994–2000)===

dEUS&#x27;s debut album &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot; drew influences from Frank Zappa, Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart and was released on 16 September 1994 to critical acclaim. Shortly after followed the release of a highly experimental mail-order-only album entitled &quot;My Sister = My Clock&quot;, consisting of thirteen songs contained on one physical track. The follow-up album &quot;In a Bar, Under the Sea&quot; followed two years later, similar in style to its predecessor.

Their next album &quot;The Ideal Crash&quot; (1999) saw the manic eccentricity channelled into a more accessible guitar-driven package. Altogether, the band&#x27;s first three albums (discounting &quot;My Sister = My Clock&quot;) sold over 750,000 copies worldwide and gathered them a cult following.

Meanwhile, dEUS had been subject to various line-up changes. After touring for &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot;, guitarist Rudy Trouvé grew disillusioned with the band and the touring commitments and left to focus on his own projects including Kiss My Jazz, Dead Man Ray and The Love Substitutes. By the time &quot;In a Bar, Under the Sea&quot; came out, bassist Stef Kamil Carlens had also left the band to focus on his own side-project A Beatband (that became Moondog Jr then Zita Swoon). They were replaced by Craig Ward and Danny Mommens respectively. Eventually, the line-up was completed by touring guitarist Tim Vanhamel (Evil Superstars, Millionaire, Eagles of Death Metal).

===Hiatus===
After the tour in support of &quot;The Ideal Crash&quot;, the band took an extended hiatus that allowed the individual members to pursue different interests. Barman directed a film, &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot;, in 2003, and teamed up with techno record producer CJ Bolland to form Magnus in 2004. In June 2002, dEUS did however play six concerts in Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium, supporting the CD and DVD release of their singles collection, &quot;No More Loud Music&quot;.

===Second era (2004–present)===
In mid-2004, with new drummer Stéphane Misseghers, they began recording new material and playing live across Europe, and in August the download-only single &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Get What You Want&quot; was released. During the recording of the album both Craig Ward and Danny Mommens left to be replaced by Alan Gevaert and Mauro Pawlowski (also from Evil Superstars) respectively. On 12 September 2005 the album &quot;Pocket Revolution&quot; was released. The release of the new album was supported by a world tour of over 130 concerts. The final concert of the 2005/2006 &quot;Pocket Revolution&quot; tour took place on 1 October in dEUS&#x27;s hometown of Antwerp, Belgium. dEUS performed that day as part of the 0110 Festival for Tolerance. This free festival, an initiative of lead singer Tom Barman, saw possibly the largest number of Belgian artists ever assembled perform that day in Antwerp, Ghent, Brussels and Charleroi in support of Tolerance and to oppose extremism and violence.

After finishing their Pocket Revolution tour, the band began rehearsals for the writing and recording process of their next album. In 2007 dEUS built their own studio in Antwerp to continue work on their next album, &quot;Vantage Point&quot;, which was released in April 2008.

&quot;Keep You Close&quot; was released in September 2011, featuring Greg Dulli. The title track of the album was premiered on 16 June 2011 on &quot;C&#x27;est Lenoir&quot;, a show on radio France Inter, presented by Bernard Lenoir. The first single off the new record, &quot;Constant Now&quot;, was released on 19 September 2011.&quot;Keep You Close&quot; received rave reviews: &quot;Q&quot; rewarded the record with 4 out of 5 stars, saying &quot;The Belgian Elbow hit new heights on sixth effort&quot;. Sputnikmusic gave the album 5 out of 5, describing the record as &quot;a real grower album&quot; and &quot;Keep you Close may not be the best dEUS album ever, but it&#x27;s still certainly one of the finest albums to have come out this year and one of the finest albums in the band&#x27;s entire career.&quot; In October 2011 the band won the &quot;Best Belgian Act&quot; award at the MTV Europe Music Awards.

In June 2012, they released &quot;Following Sea&quot;. It received glowing reviews from the Belgian and European press.

In October 2016, they announced through Facebook that Mauro Pawlowski would leave the band after a final concert in Antwerp the following February. On 6 February 2018, they announced through Facebook that Bruno De Groote will be the new guitar player of the band.

In August 2021 it was announced that Bruno De Groote had suffered a stroke the year before and was leaving the band to take care of his health. Later the same month the band confirmed that Mauro Pawlowski would rejoin the group to replace De Groote in their upcoming shows, and then on 13 June 2022, during a show at Athens, Tom Barman announced to the audience (and the rest of the band) that Pawlowski would be rejoining full-time. He also commented that they had recorded an eighth album that was subsequently released as &quot;How to Replace It&quot; on 17 February 2023.

<doc id="968668" wikidata="Q50330" url="?curid=968668" title="Cheongdo County">
<text>Cheongdo County (&quot;Cheongdo-gun&quot;) is a county in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is connected to the national transportation grid by the Gyeongbu Line railroad and the Daegu-Busan Expressway. The seat of government is located in the center of the county, in Hwayang-eup.

In the Samhan period, Cheongdo may have been the site of the small polity of Ieso-guk. It was later absorbed into Silla, and gained its current name of &quot;Cheongdo&quot; in 940. The county&#x27;s nine subdivisions were established in 1919. The county government moved to its current location in 1961. In 1966, the New Village Movement began in Sindo 1-ri, Cheongdo-eup.

Every year Cheongdo is host to an international bullfighting festival.

The slogan for Cheongdo is &quot;Singgreen Cheongdo.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==
Cheongdo is divided into two &quot;eup&quot; and seven &quot;myeon&quot;, as below. These in turn are divided into 212 &quot;ri&quot;, and 668 natural villages (&quot;jayeon burak&quot;).

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Cheongdo is twinned with:

* Gangnam-gu, South Korea 
* Jung-gu, South Korea
* Nenjiang, China

== Festivals ==
* Bullfighting Festival 
* Persimmon (Bansi) Festival 
* Lantern Festival

=== Other important spots ===

== Architecture ==

* Songamjeongsa House
* Unmunsa Temple

== Foreigners ==
As Cheongdo is a small town, with a population that is just over 50,000, there is not a high number of foreigners. However, there are a few foreigners that are living there as English teachers through the EPIK Program. Unfortunately, it is very rare to come across a local Cheongdo resident that speaks English. Learning basic Korean is an essential for living in Cheongdo.

== Climate &amp; Weather ==
Much like the rest of Korea, Cheongdo has four distinct seasons. Summers in Cheongdo can be extremely hot as Cheongdo is only 30 minutes away from Daegu by train. Daegu is known to be one of the hottest cities in South Korea, due to the surrounding mountains that trap all the heat.

Winters can be rather cold, reaching -15 degrees Celsius on occasion. Furthermore, the air is extremely dry during the winter time.

Both Autumn and Spring are rather mild, no extreme weather conditions for either. However, during Spring, typically in April, the air quality is very poor. It is very common to see locals protecting themselves with face masks against the &quot;yellow dust.&quot;

<text>Konrad Ernst Ackermann (1 February 1710 – 13 November 1771) was a German actor.

Ackermann first accompanied field marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich on his travels and in battles. Born in Schwerin, he first entered the stage under a certain &quot;Stolle&quot;. In 1740, he entered the troupe of Johann Friedrich Schönemann in Lüneburg, where he first met his future wife Sophie Charlotte Bierreichel, who took the lead of the troupe in 1741 in Hamburg. The troupe dissolved in 1744 and they lived with relatives of Konrad in Mecklenburg. In 1747, he was hired in Danzig, later in St. Petersburg. In 1749, he and Sophie visited Moscow, where they married; they left Russia in 1751 and founded the Ackermann troupe (&quot;Ackermann&#x27;sche Gesellschaft&quot;).

The troupe visited Danzig, Königsberg, Breslau, Warsaw, Leipzig, Halle, then Frankfurt and with the beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War via Strasbourg, France, to Switzerland. After the peace treaty, they returned via Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Mainz, Braunschweig, and Hanover to Hamburg, which became the domicile of the troupe. In 1762, Johann Michael Böck joined the troupe. Friederike Sophie Seyler also joined around this time, and both remained members until the troupe was sold in 1767.

In 1767, the troupe was sold to a consortium of private owners, called the Hamburg National Theatre or the Hamburgische Entreprise, also known as Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Dramaturgie&quot;, with Abel Seyler as its main backer. The &quot;dramaturgie&quot; was home to famous founders of German histrionics such as Friedrich Ludwig Schröder and Konrad Ekhof. In 1769 many of Ackermann&#x27;s actors joined the Seyler theatrical company.

His children with Sophie Charlotte were Dorothea and Marie Ackermann.

<text>Caroline Dorothea Elisabeth Ackermann (12 February 1752 – 21 October 1821) was a German actress and eldest daughter of Konrad Ackermann and Sophie Charlotte Bierreichel. She had one sister, Charlotte Ackermann, and one stepbrother Friedrich Ludwig Schröder via her mother.

Born in Gdańsk (Danzig), Royal Prussia, she entered the stage at the age of four in the role of &quot;Annabella&quot; in Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Miss Sara Sampson&quot;. She was most active between 1769 and 1778 with roles include &quot;Orsina&quot;, &quot;Minna von Barnhelm&quot;, and &quot;Marie&quot; in &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot;, as well as &quot;Ophelia&quot; in &quot;Hamlet&quot; which was very well received.

She left the stage in 1778 and married Johann Christoph Unzer, who was a noted doctor and poet in Altona. After her marriage, she stopped appearing on the stage and chose instead to take part in upper-class urban life, which she could only now do as the wife of a renowned doctor. The marriage ended in 1796 with an ugly divorce. Her stepbrother acquired and destroyed all of the court documents that Unzer had allowed to be created.

From 1797 until her death in 1821, Ackermann lived with her stepbrother at his home in Rellingen.

<text>Sylvia Nasar (born 17 August 1947) is an American journalist. She is best known for her biographical book of John Forbes Nash Jr., &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, for which she won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography. Nasar is Knight Professor Emerita at Columbia University&#x27;s School of Journalism.

==Biography==
Sylvia Nasar was born in Rosenheim, Germany, to a Bavarian mother and an Uzbek father, Rusi Nasar, a former Nazi collaborator who later joined the CIA as an intelligence officer. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1951, then moved to Ankara, Turkey, in 1960. She graduated with a BA in literature from Antioch College in 1970 and earned a Master&#x27;s degree in economics at New York University in 1976. For four years, she did research with Nobel Laureate Wassily Leontief.
She has three children, Clara, Lily and Jack, and lives in Tarrytown, New York. Her husband is Fordham University economist Darryl McLeod.
==Journalism and literary career==
She joined &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as a staff writer in 1983, became a columnist for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 1990, and was an economic correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot; from 1991 to 1999. She was the first John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Business Journalism at Columbia University.

In March 2013, Nasar filed a lawsuit accusing the university of misdirecting $4.5 million in funds over the last decade from endowment that paid her salary. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;In her suit, Ms. Nasar said that after she complained about the misspent funds, [a Columbia University official] &quot;intimidated and harassed&quot; her by telling her that the Knight Foundation &quot;was dissatisfied with her performance as Knight chair because Knight objected to her work on books.&quot;
===&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;===
In 1998, Nasar published &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, a biography of Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. The book describes many aspects of Nash&#x27;s life and personality and examines the stresses of severe mental illness. The book won the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award for biography.

===&quot;Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius&quot;===
Nasar&#x27;s second book, &quot;Grand Pursuit&quot;, was published in 2011. It is a historical narrative which sets forth Nasar&#x27;s view that economics rescued mankind from squalor and deprivation by placing its material circumstances in its own hands rather than in Fate. It won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Science and technology.

===&quot;Manifold Destiny&quot;===
On 28 August 2006 &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published Nasar&#x27;s article Manifold Destiny, which contained the only interview with Grigori Perelman, who solved the Poincaré conjecture and declined the 2006 Fields Medal. The article examined Fields Medalist Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s response to Perelman&#x27;s proof. Some mathematicians wrote letters in defense of Yau over Nasar&#x27;s portrayal, and Yau threatened to file a lawsuit, but no suit was filed.

<text>&quot;Asturias, Homeland Beloved&quot; (; ) is the regional anthem of the autonomous community of Asturias, Spain.

This adaptation of a much slower song from the neighbouring lands of Cantabria () was appointed as official anthem after a contest in Oviedo in the 1890s. It has both a Spanish and an Asturian version. It is also a popular melody for bagpipers.

In the mid-2000s, it was discovered that the first song lyrics were written in Cuba. The father of the author had returned to his beloved Asturias to die, the author—Ignacio Piñeiro—dedicated the song to his father. The music was different; it is believed to be a melody that Upper Silesian miners from the area of Opole Silesia—that worked in Asturian coal mines at the beginning of the 20th century—had brought to Asturias. In fact, the song is still known in Poland, where it used to be taught as a patriotic song (with the lyrics brought back by Polish brigadistas).

A few versions of the anthem were created by the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War, therefore the anthem was seen as a miners song (it is said the miners&#x27; revolt in Asturias in 1934 was a wake-up call to the civil war) and as a left-wing song by right-wing people.

<text>The Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, known simply as Las Ventas , is the largest bullfighting ring in Spain, located in the Guindalera quarter of the Salamanca district of Madrid. It was inaugurated on June 17, 1931. Its seating capacity of 23,798, makes it the third-largest bullfighting run in the world, after bullrings in Mexico and Venezuela. After the federal ban of bulfighting in Plaza México, Las Ventas is the second largest bullring in the world still in operation for its original intention. 

This bullring was designed by the architect José Espeliú in the Neo-Mudéjar (Moorish) style with ceramic incrustations. The seats are situated in ten &quot;tendidos&quot;. The price of the seats depends upon how close they are to the arena and whether they are in the sun or the shade (the latter being more expensive). The bullfighting season starts in March and ends in October; bullfights are held every day during the San Isidro Fiesta, and every Sunday or holiday during the season. Bullfights start at 6 or 7pm and last for two to three hours.

==History==
From 1913 to 1920, bullfighting gained such a momentum that Madrid&#x27;s former main bullring of Fuente del Berro was not big enough. It was José Gómez Ortega &quot;Joselito&quot; who complained about the necessity of a new &quot;monumental&quot; bullring, to open this part of Spain&#x27;s heritage and culture to the whole city of Madrid. Architect José Espeliú (friend of Joselito) began to work on the project.

A family called Jardón donated the land to the Madrid Provincial Council, provided that they could run the arena for fifty years. The deputation accepted the proposal on November 12, 1920. On March 19, 1922, in the exact center of the prospective arena, the first stone was placed. The construction of the bullring would cost 12 million pesetas (4.5 million over budget), and it would replace the old bullring, dating from 1874.

&quot;Las Ventas&quot; was finished in 1929 and two years later, June 17, 1931, a charity bullfight was held with a full-capacity crowd to inaugurate it. Bullfighting stopped during the Spanish Civil War and did not resume until May 1939.

The bullring was used as a Francoist concentration camp.

There is a Pasodoble called &#x27;Plaza de las Ventas&#x27; and the composer Maestro Manuel Lillo dedicated to this arena.

== Structure and facilities ==
&quot;Las Ventas&quot; is divided into a ring or arena, and a group of zones called &quot;patios&quot;. Its architecture is Neo-Mudéjar, with ceramic representations of the arms of the different Spanish provinces. The arena has a diameter of 60 meters. The seating capacity is divided into 10 &quot;tendidos&quot; (group of 27 rows around the arena), some of them in the shade and the rest in the sun.

The president of the &#x27;corrida&#x27; sits in the 10th Tendido. The Royal Box is of outstanding design, with its Mudéjar architecture, a complete bathroom and a lift. Opposite to the Royal Box, in the covered grandstand roof, is the clock. The bullring has five gates, plus three more called &quot;toriles&quot;, from where the bulls enter the arena. The gate of the &quot;cuadrillas&quot;, between &quot;tendidos&quot; 3 and 4, has access to the horse yard. Inside this door, the &quot;paseíllo&quot; starts and the &quot;picadores&quot; (those who pierce the bull with the lance) come out from here to the arena (&quot;suerte de varas&quot;). The dragging gate, that leads to the skinning room, is between &quot;tendidos&quot; 1 and 2. The famous &quot;Puerta Grande&quot; (Big Gate), also called the Gate of Madrid, is between &quot;tendidos&quot; 7 and 8. Going out through this door, especially during the Fiesta of San Isidro, is every bullfighter&#x27;s ambition.

There are also a chapel and a small infirmary with two operating rooms.

<text>Cheongsong County (or Cheongsong-gun; ) is a county in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

== Administrative divisions ==

Cheongsong is divided into 1 eup and 7 myeon.
==Climate==
Cheongsong has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Produce==
Cheongsong is known among Koreans for its apples and for a famous prison situated around Cheongsong. Cheongsong apples took up a large percentage of consumed apples in Korea as well as Seoul. Originally, Cheongsong produced a large variety of apples but now produces mainly Korean &#x27;Sundown&#x27; apples.

Another famous product of Cheongsong is the Cheongyang pepper, a Korean hot chili pepper. It was developed in Chongsong and Youngyang, hence the portmanteau, &quot;CheongYang&quot;

==Attractions==
Daejeonsa Temple is the largest in Cheongsong-gun. The Bogwangjeon building, is Korea&#x27;s treasure no. 1570, and in its procession is the woodblock of a handwritten letter from Lee Yeo-song, a general of the Ming Dynasty, to Samyeong Daisa.

Jusan Pond, located in the county, was the site of filming for Kim Ki-duk&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot;. The floating monastery was built for the purpose of the film, and Kim obtained permission from the authorities to keep it there for a year. Filming took place over the course of that year, numbering 22 days in total, after which the set was removed and destroyed. The pond is part of a national park, so no buildings are permitted.

<doc id="968721" wikidata="Q2537790" url="?curid=968721" title="Abida Parveen">
<text>Abida Parveen (; ; born 20 February 1954) is a Pakistani singer, composer, musician of Sufi music, painter and an entrepreneur. Parveen is one of the highest-paid singers in Pakistan. Her singing and music have earned her many accolades, and she has been dubbed the Queen of Sufi music.

Born and raised in Larkana into a Sindhi Sufi family, she was trained by her father, Ustad Ghulam Haider, who was a famous singer and music teacher. She plays the Pump organ, Keyboard, and Sitar. Parveen started performing in the early 1970s and came into global prominence in the 1990s. Since 1993, Parveen has toured globally, performing her first international concert at Buena Park, California. She has also performed in Churches, several times. Parveen features in Pakistan&#x27;s popular musical show Coke Studio and was a judge on the pan-South Asia contest show Sur Kshetra alongside Runa Laila and Asha Bhosle, hosted by Ayesha Takia. She had appeared in various Indian and Pakistani music reality shows, including Pakistan Idol, Chhote Ustaad, and STAR Voice of India. In the last few years, she has sung in a Pepsi commercial, collaborating with Atif Aslam for this.

Parveen is regularly referred to as one of the world&#x27;s greatest mystic singers. She sings mainly ghazals, thumri, khyal, qawwali, raga (raag), Sufi rock, classical and semi-classical music, and her speciality, kafi, a solo genre accompanied by percussion and harmonium, using a repertoire of songs by Sufi poets. Parveen sings in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Arabic, and Persian. Parveen notably sang a famous song in Nepali language called &quot;Ukali Orali Haruma&quot;, originally by Nepali singer Tara Devi, in a concert in Kathmandu, Nepal, and in 2017, she was designated a &#x27;Peace Ambassador&#x27; by SAARC.

Parveen is best known for singing in an impassioned, loud voice, especially on the songs &quot;Yaar ko Humne&quot; from the album &quot;Raqs-e-Bismil&quot; and &quot;Tere Ishq Nachaya&quot;, which is a rendition of Bulleh Shah&#x27;s poetry. She was bestowed Pakistan&#x27;s second highest civilian award, Hilal-e-Imtiaz, in 2012 and the highest civilian award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in March 2021, by the President of Pakistan.

==Early life==

Parveen was born in Ali Goharabad, Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan. She received her musical training initially from her father, Ustad Ghulam Haider, whom she refers to as Baba Sain and Gawwaya. He had his own musical school, where Parveen got her devotional inspiration . She and her father would often perform at shrines of Sufi saints. Parveen&#x27;s talent compelled her father to choose her as his musical heir over his two sons. Growing up, she attended her father&#x27;s music school, where her foundation in music was laid. Later, Ustad Salamat Ali Khan of the Sham Chaurasia gharana also taught and nurtured her. Parveen always remembers that she was never forced into this occupation, and she sang her first complete kalam when she was only 3 years old.

==Career==

Parveen had already begun performing at Dargahs and Urs in the early 1970s, but it was in 1973, on Radio Pakistan, that she achieved her first real breakthrough with the Sindhi song &quot;Tuhinje zulfan jay band kamand widha.&quot; In 1977, she was introduced as an official singer on Radio Pakistan. Since then, Parveen has risen to prominence and is now considered one of the finest vocal artists in Pakistan. She has imbued Sufi music with a new identity, marking the beginning of this journey at Sultana Siddiqui&#x27;s Awaz-o-Andaz in 1980.

Parveen travels internationally, often performing at sold-out venues. Her 1988 performance in Chicago was recorded by the Hazrat Amir Khusrau Society of Art and Culture, which issued an LP of her songs. Her 1989 performance in London&#x27;s Wembley Conference Centre was broadcast on the BBC. Parveen cites her motivation for international travel as being to spread Sufism, peace, and the divine message. In doing so, she also promotes Pakistani culture.

In the 1990s, Parveen licensed her spiritual ghazals to Bollywood, since her &quot;spiritual brother&quot;, Khan, recorded songs for Bollywood. Recently, Abida also performed at the grand finale of the Sindh Festival, arranged by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Thatta.

* Abida made a special appearance in the super hit Lollywood movie &quot;Zindagi&quot;, starring Sultan Rahi, Arif Lohar and Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi in the lead cast, for which she performed her famous rendition of Sufi Sachal Sarmast&#x27;s &quot;Mahi Yar Di Gharoli Bhar Di&quot;.

===&quot;Coke Studio&quot; appearances===
Parveen began performing on the internationally acclaimed Pakistani show &quot;Coke Studio&quot; in 2010. She sang three songs: &quot;Ramooz-e-Ishq&quot;, &quot;Nigah-e-Darwaishaan&quot;, and &quot;Soz-e-Ishq&quot; in episodes 1 (reason), 3 (conception), and 5 (realisation), respectively of season 3. Parveen said she admired the programme because it offered a Dargahi environment. She commented:
&quot;This project, which Rohail Hyatt has started, is indeed great, and I would like to be a part of it for a long time. The music that comes out of this project reaches both the heart and the soul, and it always complements the lyrics without overriding the true message of the kalams. This platform builds on those messages of our Sufi elders.&quot;

She was invited back to season 7 in 2014. She sang &quot;Mein Sufi Hoon&quot; with Rais Khan and performed &quot;dost&quot; as a solo. She also performed &quot;Chaap Tilak&quot; (a popular Sufi poem by Sufi poet Amir Khusro) in a duet with Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.

Abida was also part of season 9. Her first song, along with other artists in the season, &quot;Ae Rah Haq K Shaheedo&quot;, was dedicated to the war martyrs. After that, she sang a duet with Ali Sethi titled &quot;Aaqa&quot;, then sang a solo titled &quot;Maula-i-Kull&quot;.

She also performed in season 14, singing &quot;Tu Jhoom&quot; with Naseebo Lal.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;Pakistan seems disconnected from the outside. But it is built and runs on the prayers of our Sufi kings, our &quot;pirs&quot;. Poor people, rich people—we are all God&#x27;s servants … I&#x27;m lucky. My audience is my God.&quot;
* &quot;The songs purify the soul of a human being; the human is so involved that he has left God. The songs bring us near to God, near the Almighty, so that the human soul should be purified and satisfied.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Education===
Abida got her master&#x27;s degree from Sindh and also learned Urdu, Sindhi, and Persian specifically.

===Marriage and family===
In 1975, Abida married Ghulam Hussain Sheikh, senior producer at Radio Pakistan, who had retired from his job in the 1980s to manage and mentor Parveen&#x27;s career. After he died of a heart attack on an international flight in the early 2000s, their daughter Maryam took up that role. There is a sense that Parveen&#x27;s career has taken a more commercial route as a result of it. The couple has two daughters, Pereha Ikram and Maryam Hussain, and a son, Sarang Latif, who is a music director. All three children act as her advisors. Her family understands her need for &quot;riyaz&quot; (daily vocal music practice) and the required space to do that practice.

===Abida Parveen Gallery===
Parveen is also interested in the arts. She owns the Abida Parveen Gallery, which features jewellery, paintings, her music CDs, an awards section, and garments and accessories. It is run by her daughters. She also has her own music recording studio there.

===Clothing style===
Parveen has a distinctive clothing style that she has created herself for ease and comfort. She wears long, simple frocks buttoned up to the top with loose arms with or without cuffs and covered with a coat.

==Filmography==
Despite Parveen&#x27;s renown, she has never sung for the cinema industry; her existing work has been repurposed and used in films, however, at the insistence of proponents such as Farooq Mengal. Parveen revealed in interviews that she has received offers from Bollywood filmmakers such as Subhash Ghai and Yash Chopra. Shah Rukh Khan requested that she sing in Ra.One, as did music director A. R. Rahman. Parveen declines these offers on account of her Sufi faith and the commitments that it requires.

=== Second World War ===
Opened as a civilian airfield in 1933, it was requisitioned at the outbreak of the Second World War and named RAF Trebelzue, initially as a satellite of nearby RAF St Eval, but was expanded with twin concrete runways. In February 1943 it was renamed RAF St. Mawgan and in June 1943, the United States Army Air Forces took over and carried out a number of major improvements, including a new control tower and a further extension of the main runway. The airfield was put under care and maintenance on 1 July 1947.

=== Cold War ===
In 1951, it reopened as an RAF Coastal Command air base for the Air-Sea Warfare Development Unit RAF (ASWDU) where trials of new electronic equipment were carried out, to ascertain the suitability of the equipment for general use in Coastal Command, and for maritime reconnaissance, flying mainly Avro Shackleton aircraft, with support from a few Avro Lancaster aircraft. 
In 1956, No 220 and 228 Long Range Reconnaissance Squadrons were renumbered Nos 201 and 206 Squadrons and joined by 42 Squadron in 1958. RAF St Mawgan also became the Headquarters of 22 (Helicopter) Squadron. In 1965, 201 Squadron and 206 Squadron moved to RAF Kinloss and were replaced by the Maritime Operational Training Unit.

In 1956, the last Lancaster in RAF operational service left RAF St Mawgan after a brief ceremony conducted by the then Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Air Marshal Sir Bryan Reynolds. The Lancaster was an MR3 variant from the School of Maritime Reconnaissance.

7 Sqn, flying English Electric Canberras, operated at RAF St Mawgan as target tugs from 1970 until 1982, with 22 Squadron moving out in 1974. 42 Squadron and 236 Operational Conversion Unit moved to RAF Kinloss in 1992, taking away RAF St Mawgan&#x27;s fixed-wing station-based aircraft, the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrods which had been at the station since 1969. In 1976 some scenes in the film &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; were filmed on the camp.
Nuclear depth charges intended for anti-submarine use by the US Navy P-3 Orion, Royal Air Force Nimrod and former Dutch Navy P-3 Orion aircraft, were stored at the United States Navy Atomic Weapons Department, situated at the west end of the airbase.

The &quot;Joint Maritime Facility&quot; (JMF) () at St Mawgan was commissioned 18 August 1995 after equipment from United States Naval Facility, Brawdy, Wales, a Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminal commissioned 5 April 1974, had been transferred and the sea systems had been remoted to the new JMF. The SOSUS fixed bottom surveillance system had been augmented by mobile, towed arrays and the combined system renamed Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) in 1984. The JMF was an IUSS facility jointly operated by the Royal Navy and United States Navy. It was announced in early 2009 that the JMF would close in order to save the US Navy £6.5 million per year, losing 22 jobs in the process. RAF St Mawgan was the last remaining US Navy installation in the U.K. The systems at the JMF were remoted to the Naval Ocean Processing Facility (NOPF), Dam Neck, Virginia with the remaining personnel from JMF at RAF St Mawgan moved to the Virginia facility. The NOPF is a joint United States and United Kingdom, forces operation (the largest such contingent in the U.S.) under Commander, Undersea Surveillance.

=== 21st century ===
In 2005, RAF St Mawgan was one of the airfields shortlisted to house the new Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA) in 2013, but in November 2005 it was announced by Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram, that it would be going to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland.

In November 2006, No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment moved to RAF Honington and No. 2625 (County of Cornwall) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) was disbanded. Helicopter maintenance (HMF) also ceased here in that year. Until May 2008, RAF St Mawgan was primarily used as a Search and Rescue training camp and was home to 203(R) Squadron, equipped with Sea King helicopters. The SAR Force HQ was also located here. Both 203(R) Squadron and the SAR Force HQ moved to RAF Valley.

On 1 December 2008 the airfield part of the camp (including the civilian side) closed but the RAF still remain on a reduced area. This was to allow full control of the airport to be handed to Cornwall County Council, with work including a new ATC tower and runway lights. The airport received a full CAA licence to operate in December 2008.

In February 2013, £11 million was invested in the base to develop a new survival training facility providing key training areas for visiting task groups.

In March 2015 the former airfield of the base became a strong contender to be the first UK spaceport for horizontal take off and landing after being shortlisted by the government. The plans subsequently led to the establishment of Spaceport Cornwall at Newquay Airport. The first orbital launch took place on 9 January 2023 (launch ended in failure, with satellites not reaching orbit) as the result of a partnership with Virgin Orbit.

March 2016, RAF St Mawgan completed a brand new guardroom block, built by Babcock adjacent to the old guardroom but much larger with: car parking, office facilities and accommodation.

==Units==
The following units were also here at some point:
==Role and operations==

=== Defence Survival Training Organisation ===
RAF St Mawgan is currently home to Defence Survival Training Organisation (DSTO), which is a tri-service unit that teaches &#x27;Survive, Evade, Resist, Extract&#x27; (SERE) methods for the Armed Forces in support of operations and training. They also conduct trials and equipment development. It was formerly known as the School of Combat Survival and Rescue and moved to St Mawgan from RAF Mount Batten in 1992.

=== Other operations ===
The Royal Air Force maintains a small workshop on the station, enabling construction of components for the upgrading of aircraft for all three services. Accommodation on the airfield is often used by students of Agusta Westland&#x27;s training facility at Newquay Airport.

Other units located here at St Mawgan are 505 (Wessex) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF). The gate guard was an Avro Shackleton aircraft which was sold and moved in December 2015.

From February 2016, 120 Royal Military Police (RMP) officers of the 1st Military Police Brigade, British Army, were being hosted by the base in a new police investigation unit that will be capable of managing complex police investigations. The main investigation will look at British troops&#x27; conduct in Afghanistan. Their facility, known as major incident room (MIR), will replicate the benefits of major incident rooms used by Home Office police forces when conducting complex investigations. It will use the same Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES) for analysing and linking evidence. The RMP will come under the command of the Provost Marshal (Army). RAF St Mawgan was chosen over other locations for its availability of office and living accommodation. Married personnel and their families will be accommodated in the married quarters sites at Treloggan, St Eval (Officers) and St Columb Minor (Sergeants), which were recently renovated. Single accommodation will be provided on base in spare capacity blocks.

<doc id="968734" wikidata="Q382583" url="?curid=968734" title="Integrability conditions for differential systems">
<text>In mathematics, certain systems of partial differential equations are usefully formulated, from the point of view of their underlying geometric and algebraic structure, in terms of a system of differential forms. The idea is to take advantage of the way a differential form &quot;restricts&quot; to a submanifold, and the fact that this restriction is compatible with the exterior derivative. This is one possible approach to certain over-determined systems, for example, including Lax pairs of integrable systems. A Pfaffian system is specified by 1-forms alone, but the theory includes other types of example of differential system. To elaborate, a Pfaffian system is a set of 1-forms on a smooth manifold (which one sets equal to 0 to find &quot;solutions&quot; to the system).

Given a collection of differential 1-forms formula_1 on an formula_2-dimensional manifold , an integral manifold is an immersed (not necessarily embedded) submanifold whose tangent space at every point formula_3 is annihilated by (the pullback of) each .

A maximal integral manifold is an immersed (not necessarily embedded) submanifold
: formula_4
such that the kernel of the restriction map on forms
: formula_5
is spanned by the formula_6 at every point formula_7 of . If in addition the formula_6 are linearly independent, then formula_9 is ()-dimensional.

A Pfaffian system is said to be completely integrable if formula_10 admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (Note that the foliation need not be regular; i.e. the leaves of the foliation might not be embedded submanifolds.)

An integrability condition is a condition on the formula_11 to guarantee that there will be integral submanifolds of sufficiently high dimension.

== Necessary and sufficient conditions ==
The necessary and sufficient conditions for complete integrability of a Pfaffian system are given by the Frobenius theorem. One version states that if the ideal formula_12 algebraically generated by the collection of &quot;α&quot;&quot;i&quot; inside the ring Ω(&quot;M&quot;) is differentially closed, in other words
: formula_13
then the system admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (The converse is obvious from the definitions.)

== Example of a non-integrable system ==
Not every Pfaffian system is completely integrable in the Frobenius sense. For example, consider the following one-form :
: formula_14

If &quot;dθ&quot; were in the ideal generated by &quot;θ&quot; we would have, by the skewness of the wedge product
: formula_15

But a direct calculation gives
: formula_16
which is a nonzero multiple of the standard volume form on R3. Therefore, there are no two-dimensional leaves, and the system is not completely integrable.

On the other hand, for the curve defined by
: formula_17
then &quot;θ&quot; defined as above is 0, and hence the curve is easily verified to be a solution (i.e. an integral curve) for the above Pfaffian system for any nonzero constant &quot;c&quot;.

== Examples of applications ==
In pseudo-Riemannian geometry, we may consider the problem of finding an orthogonal coframe &quot;θ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, i.e., a collection of 1-forms that form a basis of the cotangent space at every point with formula_18 that are closed (&quot;dθ&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 0, ). By the Poincaré lemma, the &quot;θ&quot;&quot;i&quot; locally will have the form &quot;dxi&quot; for some functions &quot;xi&quot; on the manifold, and thus provide an isometry of an open subset of &quot;M&quot; with an open subset of R&quot;n&quot;. Such a manifold is called locally flat.

This problem reduces to a question on the coframe bundle of &quot;M&quot;. Suppose we had such a closed coframe
: formula_19

If we had another coframe , then the two coframes would be related by an orthogonal transformation
: formula_20

If the connection 1-form is &quot;ω&quot;, then we have
: formula_21

On the other hand,
: formula_22

But formula_23 is the Maurer–Cartan form for the orthogonal group. Therefore, it obeys the structural equation
, and this is just the curvature of &quot;M&quot;: formula_24
After an application of the Frobenius theorem, one concludes that a manifold &quot;M&quot; is locally flat if and only if its curvature vanishes.

== Generalizations ==
Many generalizations exist to integrability conditions on differential systems thar are not necessarily generated by one-forms. The most famous of these are the Cartan–Kähler theorem, which only works for real analytic differential systems, and the Cartan–Kuranishi prolongation theorem. See &quot;&quot; for details. The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem gives integrability conditions for an almost-complex structure.

The site was originally the Melbourne Hospital, built in the 1840s—1860s as series of Tudor style buildings. The hospital was completely rebuilt on a much larger scale between 1910–1916 to a design by architect John James Clark in partnership with his son E.J. Clark. The hospital was composed of several five and six-storey Edwardian pavilions or towers, running north–south, housing the ward blocks, each with open verandahs for patients to convalesce in the open air. Tudor domed cupolas topped the front corners of each tower.

The hospital became the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1935, and moves began to relocate to a former pig market site in Parkville. The new hospital was completed in 1941 but was occupied as a military hospital during the war. The move finally took place in 1944, and the old buildings were then occupied by the Queen Victoria Hospital, established &#x27;by women for women&#x27; in 1896 and renamed the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in 1901 after the queen&#x27;s death.

In 1986, with the pending relocation and amalgamation of the hospital, the site was to be redeveloped to house expansions of the State Library and Museum located on the block next door to the north, and a competition was held, with a condition being the preservation of the three towers. One such design by post-modern architects Edmond &amp; Corrigan included a giant pyramid as the new book stacks on Swanston Street.

The hospital was closed in 1987, and the site was valued at A$63 million. During the financial squeeze of the early 1990s, it was eventually sold for only $15 million to property developer David Marriner in 1992. All but three of the hospital pavilions were demolished in the following years, with the final two that would have been preserved demolished in 1994 with a permit from then Planning Minister Rob Maclellan over-ruling the Historic Buildings Council.

===Sailyards Skatepark===
From 1996, the Swanston and Lonsdale Street corner of the site was home to the YMCA-managed Sailyards Skatepark. It was closed by Melbourne City Council in March 2001 and relocated to Boathouse Drive on the Yarra River in the city&#x27;s Alexandra Gardens. During this time, it also hosted a series of failed ventures, including a craft market and a mini golf course before becoming a simple carpark.

===Sale to Nauru===
Marriner sold-on the site (except for the remaining tower) to the country of Nauru, which owned several other sites in the city, notably Nauru House, for $50.3 million.

===Queen Victoria Women&#x27;s Centre and QV Melbourne===
As the site continued to remain relatively unused and abandoned in the centre of Melbourne&#x27;s business district, it was called a &quot;bloody disgrace&quot; by then Premier Jeff Kennett.

After Nauru struggled to pay for the empty block, it was returned to the Melbourne City Council in 1999, which announced plans to develop the site. Grocon was awarded the tender to develop a $600 million &quot;urban village&quot; on the site, with the remaining building to become the Queen Victoria Women&#x27;s Centre.

==The development==

The &#x27;urban village&#x27; of QV is a high-density, mixed use precinct containing retail, business, and living spaces. It was conceived by Roger Nelson FRAIA of NH Architecture in 1999 went on to coordinate the efforts of all the collaborators and design the podium and ground levels as well as working in Joint venture with John Wardle and McBride Charles Ryan for QV1 and QV2 respectively. Denton Corker Marshall designed the Sensis building and, Lyons the BHP building. KTA (Kerstin Thompson Architects) designed the infill building on Russel Street that includes the Child Care facility on the roof.

The site is split into four main structures, named QV1 through QV4, two of which are skyscrapers, the remainder being low-rise structures along Swanston Street (owing to strict height limits along the Swanston Street axis). The spaces between buildings were specifically designed as shop-filled laneways, pointing to Melbourne&#x27;s historic lanes and arcades, many of which no longer exist due to the amalgamation of plots to build office buildings. These new laneways are named for figures in medicine: Jane Bell Lane, Albert Coates Lane, Artemis Lane, and Red Cape Lane. At the centre of the site is an open-air public square, behind the historic Women&#x27;s Centre.

QV began to open progressively from late 2003, and is now complete.

===Queen Victoria Women&#x27;s Centre===

A Trust was established under the Queen Victoria Women’s Centre Trust Act 1994 to govern the Centre, which acts as a statutory authority consistent with the meaning of ‘public body’ in section 3 of the Financial Management Act 1994. The Queen Victoria Women&#x27;s centre was officially opened in 1997 and refurbished in 2005. The Queen Victoria Women’s Centre offers four venue spaces in the beautiful setting in the heritage building. The venues hold celebratory events, seminars, workshops, exhibitions, board meetings and smaller gatherings. The building is also home to a range of not for profit women’s organisations that offer a range of support and information services to women. Each organisation is independently run.

===Offices===
The skyscraper located at 180 Lonsdale houses offices.

More offices are housed in the 222 Lonsdale Street building at the corner of Lonsdale and Swanston Streets, and the building immediately north of this. These two buildings are linked by two bridges spanning Albert Coates Lane.

===Retail shops===
There is a very diverse mix of retailers at QV. Some of the major retailers at QV include:
* Woolworths - 11 aisle full line supermarket
* Big W - discount department store
* Harvey Norman/Domayne - furniture and electronics retailer
* Officeworks - office products
* Dan Murphy&#x27;s - liquor store
* Fitness First - gym

As well as retail outlets, there are many options for entertainment at QV. There are also many restaurants at the precinct, as well as bars and a bowling venue.

===Apartments===

Apartments are located in two buildings at QV, both of which are located along Little Lonsdale Street. One of the apartment buildings is the slender skyscraper located at the Russell Street corner, whilst the other is a lower-rise structure on the Swanston Street corner. The latter is low-rise to meet height restrictions on Swanston Street, intended to allow greater viewability of the dome of the State Library of Victoria.

<doc id="968740" wikidata="Q1982877" url="?curid=968740" title="Anderson Cooper 360°">
<text>Anderson Cooper 360° (commonly shortened to either AC-360 or 360) is an American television news show on CNN and CNN International, hosted by CNN journalist and news anchor Anderson Cooper. The show currently airs weeknights live from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET.

Since May 20, 2019, &quot;360°&quot; has been broadcast live from CNN&#x27;s set in Studio 21L at CNN&#x27;s offices in 30 Hudson Yards in New York City. It is also sometimes broadcast from CNN&#x27;s studios in Washington, D.C. or from the site of a breaking news event, airing Monday through Friday evenings.

==Beginnings==
&quot;360°&quot; was launched on September 8, 2003, as a laid-back news/talk program running for one hour at 7:00pm ET. During Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, CNN executives noticed an impressive ratings boost of &quot;NewsNight&quot; due to Cooper&#x27;s on-site reporting and growing popularity. The executives decided to cancel &quot;NewsNight&quot; and expand &quot;360°&quot; to two hours on November 7, 2005. In August 2011, the show was moved up to 8:00pm ET while maintaining a replay of the show at its original 10:00pm ET time slot.

In June 2013, however, CNN decided to stop airing regular repeats of the show, with the 10:00pm ET time slot featuring its spin-off show, &quot;AC360° Later&quot;, which featured panel discussions on recent events led by Cooper. After being faced with irregular and inconsistent scheduling (sometimes being replaced by CNN documentaries or re-runs of &quot;AC360°&quot; from earlier in the day), it was finally discontinued in February 2014.

==Format==
The show is simulcast live on both CNN and CNN International.

Cooper often anchors the program from the site of a major news story, such as his extensive coverage from New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill, as well as Port-au-Prince after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and also from the storm zone in Tacloban, Leyte, during the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan.

On September 26, 2007, &quot;360°&quot; began broadcasting in high definition on CNN HD.

Frequent analysts and contributors to the show include CNN&#x27;s Chief National Correspondent John King, Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, Senior Washington Correspondent Joe Johns, David Mattingly, Investigative Reporters Randi Kaye and Gary Tuchman, Special Investigations reporter Drew Griffin, and Legal Analyst Jeff Toobin. Other contributors include Josh Campbell, truTV&#x27;s legal analyst Lisa Bloom, terrorism expert Peter Bergen, Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, and addiction medicine specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky. King, &quot;The Situation Room&quot; host Wolf Blitzer, Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper, Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto, and &quot;New Day&quot; co-anchor John Berman frequently serve as the fill-in presenters when Cooper is not available.

==Segments==
* &quot;360 Bulletin&quot; appeared at the top and bottom of the hour and was most recently presented by Amara Walker, who provided a quick review of other top news stories. The segment is no longer included in most broadcasts. Previous presenters have included Isha Sesay and Erica Hill.
* &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; presented the background and latest developments of high-profile crimes. This segment has been included only minimally since 2011.
* &quot;Keeping Them Honest&quot; exposes possible issues of government corruption, failed promises, and other anomalies from various sectors.
* &quot;The Ridiculist&quot; presented more lighthearted and humorous stories and often aired near the end of the program. (Cooper has dissolved into extended fits of giggles at least twice during this segment: on August 17, 2011, when joking about Gérard Depardieu urinating in a plane, and on April 10, 2012, during a spot about Dyngus Day.) The segment appears sporadically and has not appeared at all since 2019.

==Supplements to the TV show==
The CNN website and its AC360 section provides visitors segments and video clips of previous episodes and interviews. A podcast version of each broadcast was available for download through 2012, in which Cooper recorded a new introduction before playing clips from the main broadcast. That feature was subsequently phased out.

==Recognition==

In 2006, &quot;360°&quot; was nominated twice for a GLAAD Media Award in the category of &quot;Outstanding TV Journalism – News Segment.&quot; The nominated segments were &quot;School Outing&quot; and &quot;Secret Sex Lives.&quot; In 2006, the show has won the following News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards:

<text>Uiseong County (&quot;Uiseong-gun&quot;) is a county in Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, South Korea. Located near the center of the province, it is bounded by Andong on the north, Cheongsong on the east, Gunwi County on the south, and Sangju and Yecheon on the west. As in most parts of Korea, most of the land is vacant and forested; only about 19% of the county&#x27;s area is farmland. The county is largely rural, with an economy dominated by agriculture; the only urbanized area is the county seat, Uiseong-eup.

South Korean national treasure 77, a five-storied stone pagoda, lies in Geumseong-myeon. Also in Geumseong-myeon are a set of more than 300 dinosaur tracks from the early Cretaceous period.

Uiseong is home to Gounsa, one of the 24 head temples of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. This temple is located in Danchon-myeon.

Famous people from Uiseong include Yu Sŏngnyong, prime minister and one of the best loyal contributors during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), and the &quot;Garlic Girls&quot;, women&#x27;s curling silver medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics.

==Administrative divisions==
Uiseong County is divided into 18 primary districts (1 &quot;eup&quot; and 17 &quot;myeon&quot;). These in turn are divided into 178 legal &quot;ri&quot;, which in turn are composed of a total of 399 administrative &quot;ri.&quot; The county&#x27;s primary divisions are as follows:


==Climate==
Uiseong has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
== Festival ==

Astonished by the place where natural enemies had gone beyond their instincts, he stayed here for twelve years.

<text>Ulleung County () is a county in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

Ulleung County has a population of 10,426 making it the least populated county in South Korea. Ulleung County consists mainly of the island of Ulleungdo and 44 smaller islands located in the East Sea, including the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo) in the effective governance of South Korea but claimed by Japan. Ulleung County is administratively divided into one &quot;eup&quot; and two &quot;myeon&quot;: Ulleung-eup, Buk-myeon, and Seo-myeon, which are divided into 10 legal &quot;ri&quot;, those into 25 administrative &quot;ri&quot;, and at the most basic level the county is held to contain 56 &quot;natural villages.&quot;

==History==
At the year of 512, Jijeung of Silla conquered Usan-guk which was the original nation in Ulleung-do. After a downfall of Silla, Goryeo naturally took the title of Ulleung. In 930, 13th year of Taejo of Goryeo, he granted local people bringing a tribute.

Hyeonjong of Goryeo sent his ambassador to islands for recovering ruined farming land in 1012.

==Location==
It is located in the middle of the East Sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. There are two main ports that provide ferries to Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo): Pohang Port and Mukho Port. These two ports offer regular shipping service.

==Administrative divisions==

Ulleung-gun is divided into one &quot;eup&quot; and two &quot;myeon&quot;. Ulleung-eup is then divided into four legal &quot;ri&quot;, but six administrative &quot;ri&quot;. Buk-myeon is divided into three legal &quot;ri&quot;, eight administrative &quot;ri&quot;. Seo-myeon is divided into three legal &quot;ri&quot;, five administrative &quot;ri&quot;.
==Snowflower Festival==
Ulleung County, which has one of the highest snowfalls in all of Korea, hosts the Snowflower Festival. In 2007, Ulleung had lot of snow, up to 42 cm (16.5 in) around coastlines and 105 cm (around 3 ft 5in) in the Nari Basin. But the county did not host its festival before 2006 as there was not enough snow.

==Symbols==
* Tree: &quot;Machilus thunbergii&quot;
* Flower: camelliar flower
* Bird: wood pigeon

==Climate==
Ulleung has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm, rainy, muggy summers and cold, snowy winters.

<text>Messier 91 (also known as NGC 4548 or M91) is a barred spiral galaxy that is found in the south of Coma Berenices. It is in the local supercluster and is part of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It is about 63 million light-years away from our galaxy. It was the last of a group of eight &quot;nebulae&quot; – the term &#x27;galaxy&#x27; only coming into use for these objects once it was realized in the 20th century that they were extragalactic – discovered by Charles Messier in 1781. It is the faintest object in the Messier catalog, with an apparent magnitude of 10.2.

As a result of a bookkeeping error by Messier, M91 was for a long time one of the few missing entries in the Messier catalog, not matching any known object in the sky. It was not until 1969 that amateur astronomer William C. Williams realized that M91 was NGC 4548, which was catalogued by William Herschel in 1784. Some sources contend the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4571 was considered as a candidate for this object by Herschel.

==Observation history==
The object was discovered in 1781 by Messier who described it as nebula without stars, fainter than M90. Messier mistakenly logged its position from Messier 58, where in fact it should have been Messier 89. William Herschel observed the same object in 1784.

In 1969 Williams solved this lost Messier object by measuring its right ascension and declination relative to those of the nearby galaxy M89 (notable reference stars angularly nearby are sparse) – rather than M58, a 9th-magnitude galaxy which Messier recorded in 1778. This amended night sky &quot;star-hopping&quot; reference point matches Messier&#x27;s figures to 0.1 of an arcminute () in right ascension and 1 in declination, a sixtieth of a degree.
==Features==
Inclusion of Messier 91 in the Virgo cluster was confirmed in 1997 from observing Cepheid variables which place it at million light years away.

Its bar is very conspicuous – it is seen with position angle of 65 to 245 degrees when being measured from the North direction to the East.

There is a countering peculiar (local) velocity toward us through the Virgo cluster of about 700 km/s within the cluster&#x27;s recession velocity of about 1100 km/s, which produces its observed recessional velocity of only about 400 km/s. Another source gives the latter figure as 803 km/s.

Messier 91 is also classified as an anemic galaxy, that is: a spiral galaxy with little star formation and gas compared with other galaxies of its type.
