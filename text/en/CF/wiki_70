<text>The French people () are a nation primarily located in Western Europe that share a common French culture, history, and language, identified with the country of France.

The French people, especially the native speakers of langues d&#x27;oïl from northern and central France, are primarily descended from Romans (or Gallo-Romans, western European Celtic and Italic peoples), Gauls (including the Belgae), as well as Germanic peoples such as the Franks, the Visigoths, the Suebi and the Burgundians who settled in Gaul from east of the Rhine after the fall of the Roman Empire, as well as various later waves of lower-level irregular migration that have continued to the present day. The Norsemen also settled in Normandy in the 10th century and contributed significantly to the ancestry of the Normans. Furthermore, regional ethnic minorities also exist within France that have distinct lineages, languages and cultures such as Bretons in Brittany, Occitans in Occitania, Basques in the French Basque Country, Catalans in northern Catalonia, Germans in Alsace, Corsicans in Corsica and Flemings in French Flanders.

France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences, and while most French people still speak the French language as their mother tongue, languages like Picard, Poitevin-Saintongeais, Franco-Provencal, Occitan, Catalan, Auvergnat, Corsican, Basque, French Flemish, Lorraine Franconian, Alsatian, Norman, and Breton remain spoken in their respective regions. Arabic is also widely spoken, arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century (a spot previously held by Breton and Occitan).

Modern French society is a melting pot. From the middle of the 19th century, it experienced a high rate of inward migration, mainly consisting of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Arab-Berbers, Jews, Sub-Saharan Africans, Chinese, and other peoples from Africa, the Middle East and East Asia, and the government, defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values, advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms. Nowadays, while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere integration, French citizens still equate their nationality with citizenship as does French law.

In addition to mainland France, French people and people of French descent can be found internationally, in overseas departments and territories of France such as the French West Indies (&quot;French Caribbean&quot;), and in foreign countries with significant French-speaking population groups or not, such as the United States (&quot;French Americans&quot;), Canada (&quot;French Canadians&quot;), Argentina (&quot;French Argentines&quot;), Brazil (&quot;French Brazilians&quot;), Mexico (&quot;French Mexicans&quot;), Chile (&quot;French Chileans&quot;) and Uruguay (&quot;French Uruguayans&quot;).

==Citizenship and legal residence==
To be French, according to the first article of the French Constitution, is to be a citizen of France, regardless of one&#x27;s origin, race, or religion (&quot;sans distinction d&#x27;origine, de race ou de religion&quot;). According to its principles, France has devoted itself to the destiny of a &quot;proposition nation&quot;, a generic territory where people are bounded only by the French language and the assumed willingness to live together, as defined by Ernest Renan&#x27;s &quot;plébiscite de tous les jours&quot; (&#x27;everyday plebiscite&#x27;) on the willingness to live together, in Renan&#x27;s 1882 essay &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce qu&#x27;une nation?&quot;).

The debate concerning the integration of this view with the principles underlying the European Community remains open.

France has been historically open to immigration, although this has changed in recent years. Referring to this perceived openness, Gertrude Stein, wrote: &quot;America is my country but Paris is my home&quot;. Indeed, the country has long valued its openness, tolerance and the quality of services available. Application for French citizenship is often interpreted as a renunciation of previous state allegiance unless a dual citizenship agreement exists between the two countries (for instance, this is the case with Switzerland: one can be both French and Swiss). The European treaties have formally permitted movement and European citizens enjoy formal rights to employment in the state sector (though not as trainees in reserved branches, e.g., as magistrates).

Seeing itself as an inclusive nation with universal values, France has always valued and strongly advocated assimilation. However, the success of such assimilation has recently been called into question. There is increasing dissatisfaction with, and within, growing ethno-cultural enclaves (&quot;communautarisme&quot;). The 2005 French riots in some troubled and impoverished suburbs (&quot;les quartiers sensibles&quot;) were an example of such tensions. However they should not be interpreted as ethnic conflicts (as appeared before in other countries like the US and the UK) but as social conflicts born out of socioeconomic problems endangering proper integration.

==History==
Historically, the heritage of the French people is mostly of Celtic or Gallic, Latin (Romans) origin, descending from the ancient and medieval populations of Gauls or Celts from the Atlantic to the Rhone Alps, Germanic tribes that settled France from east of the Rhine and Belgium after the fall of the Roman Empire such as the Franks, Burgundians, Allemanni, Visigoths, and Suebi, Latin and Roman tribes such as Ligurians and Gallo-Romans, Basques, and Norse populations largely settling in Normandy at the beginning of the 10th century as well as &quot;Bretons&quot; (Celtic Britons) settling in Brittany in Western France.

The name &quot;France&quot; etymologically derives from the word Francia, the territory of the Franks. The Franks were a Germanic tribe that overran Roman Gaul at the end of the Roman Empire.

===Celtic and Roman Gaul===

In the pre-Roman era, Gaul (an area of Western Europe that encompassed all of what is known today as France, Belgium, part of Germany and Switzerland, and Northern Italy) was inhabited by a variety of peoples who were known collectively as the Gaulish tribes. Their ancestors were Celts who came from Central Europe in the 7th century BCE or earlier, and non-Celtic peoples including the Ligures, Aquitanians and Basques in Aquitaine. The Belgae, who lived in the northern and eastern areas, may have had Germanic admixture; many of these peoples had already spoken Gaulish by the time of the Roman conquest.

Gaul was militarily conquered in 58–51 BCE by the Roman legions under the command of General Julius Caesar, except for the south-east which had already been conquered about one century earlier. Over the next six centuries, the two cultures intermingled, creating a hybridized Gallo-Roman culture. In the late Roman era, in addition to colonists from elsewhere in the Empire and Gaulish natives, Gallia also became home to some immigrant populations of Germanic and Scythian origin, such as the Alans.

The Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French, with effects including loanwords and calques (including &quot;oui&quot;, the word for &quot;yes&quot;), sound changes, and influences in conjugation and word order. Today, the last redoubt of Celtic language in France can be found in the northwestern region of Brittany, although this is not the result of a survival of Gaulish language but of a 5th-century AD migration of Brythonic speaking Celts from Britain.

The Vulgar Latin in the region of Gallia took on a distinctly local character, some of which is attested in graffiti, which evolved into the Gallo-Romance dialects which include French and its closest relatives.

===Frankish Kingdom===
With the decline of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, a federation of Germanic peoples entered the picture: the Franks, from which the word &quot;French&quot; derives. The Franks were Germanic pagans who began to settle in northern Gaul as &quot;laeti&quot; during the Roman era. They continued to filter across the Rhine River from present-day Netherlands and Germany between the 3rd and 7th centuries. Initially, they served in the Roman army and obtained important commands. Their language is still spoken as a kind of Dutch (French Flemish) in northern France (French Flanders). The Alamans, another Germanic people immigrated to Alsace, hence the Alemannic German now spoken there. The Alamans were competitors of the Franks, and their name is the origin of the French word for &quot;German&quot;: &quot;Allemand&quot;.

By the early 6th century, the Franks, led by the Merovingian king Clovis I and his sons, had consolidated their hold on much of modern-day France. The other major Germanic people to arrive in France, after the Burgundians and the Visigoths, were the Norsemen or Northmen. Known by the shortened name &quot;Norman&quot; in France, these were Viking raiders from modern Denmark and Norway. They settled with Anglo-Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons from the Danelaw in the region known today as Normandy in the 9th and 10th centuries. This later became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of France under King Charles III. The Vikings eventually intermarried with the local people, converting to Christianity in the process. The Normans, two centuries later, went on to conquer England and Southern Italy.

Eventually, though, the largely autonomous Duchy of Normandy was incorporated back into the royal domain (i. e. the territory under direct control of the French king) in the Middle Ages. In the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099, at most 120,000 Franks, who were predominantly French-speaking Western Christians, ruled over 350,000 Muslims, Jews, and native Eastern Christians.

===Kingdom of France===
Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the Americas, with the exception of the Huguenots, due to a lower birthrate than in the rest of Europe. However, significant emigration of mainly Roman Catholic French populations led to the settlement of the Province of Acadia, Canada (New France) and Louisiana, all (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the West Indies, Mascarene islands and Africa.

On 30 December 1687, a community of French Huguenots settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but have since been quickly absorbed into the Afrikaner population. After Champlain&#x27;s founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of New France. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000. From 1713 to 1787, 30,000 colonists immigrated from France to the Saint-Domingue. In 1805, when the French were forced out of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), 35,000 French settlers were given lands in Cuba.

By the beginning of the 17th century, some 20% of the total male population of Catalonia was made up of French immigrants.
In the 18th century and early 19th century, a small migration of French emigrated by official invitation of the Habsburgs to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now the nations of Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and Romania. Some of them, coming from French-speaking communes in Lorraine or being French Swiss &quot;Walsers&quot; from the Valais canton in Switzerland, maintained for some generations the French language and a specific ethnic identity, later labelled as Banat (French: &quot;Français du Banat&quot;). By 1788, there were eight villages populated by French colonists.

===French Republic===

The French First Republic appeared following the 1789 French Revolution. It replaced the ancient kingdom of France, ruled by the divine right of kings.

The 1870 Franco-Prussian War, which led to the short-lived Paris Commune of 1871, was instrumental in bolstering patriotic feelings; until World War I (1914–1918), French politicians never completely lost sight of the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region which played a major role in the definition of the French nation and therefore of the French people.

The decrees of 24 October 1870 by Adolphe Crémieux granted automatic and massive French citizenship to all Jewish people of Algeria.

===20th century===
Successive waves of immigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries were rapidly assimilated into French culture. France&#x27;s population dynamics began to change in the middle of the 19th century, as France joined the Industrial Revolution. The pace of industrial growth attracted millions of European immigrants over the next century, with especially large numbers arriving from Poland, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, and Spain.

In the period from 1915 to 1950, many immigrants came from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, Scandinavia and Yugoslavia. Small but significant numbers of Frenchmen in the North and Northeast regions have relatives in Germany and Great Britain.

Between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco also immigrated to France due to the decline of the French empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Jews of North African origin comprised the majority of the Jewish population of France. As these new immigrants were already culturally French they needed little time to adjust to French society.

French law made it easy for thousands of settlers (&quot;colons&quot; in French), national French from former colonies of North and East Africa, India and Indochina to live in mainland France. It is estimated that 20,000 settlers were living in Saigon in 1945, and there were 68,430 European settlers living in Madagascar in 1958. 1.6 million European &quot;pieds noirs&quot; settlers migrated from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 pied noir settlers left Algeria in the most massive relocation of population in Europe since the World War II. In the 1970s, over 30,000 French settlers left Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime as the Pol Pot government confiscated their farms and land properties.

In the 1960s, a second wave of immigration came to France, which was needed for reconstruction purposes and for cheaper labour after the devastation brought on by World War II. French entrepreneurs went to Maghreb countries looking for cheap labour, thus encouraging work-immigration to France. Their settlement was officialized with Jacques Chirac&#x27;s family regrouping act of 1976 (&quot;regroupement familial&quot;). Since then, immigration has become more varied, although France stopped being a major immigration country compared to other European countries. The large impact of North African and Arab immigration is the greatest and has brought racial, socio-cultural and religious questions to a country seen as ly European, French and Christian for thousands of years. Nevertherless, according to Justin Vaïsse, professor at Sciences Po Paris, integration of Muslim immigrants is happening as part of a background evolution and recent studies confirmed the results of their assimilation, showing that &quot;North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy&quot; with rates ranging from 20% to 50%. According to Emmanuel Todd the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.

A small French descent group also subsequently arrived from Latin America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) in the 1970s.

==Languages==

===In France===

Most French people speak the French language as their mother tongue, but certain languages like Norman, Occitan languages, Corsican, Euskara, French Flemish and Breton remain spoken in certain regions (see Language policy in France). There have also been periods of history when a majority of French people had other first languages (local languages such as Occitan, Catalan, Alsatian, West Flemish, Lorraine Franconian, Gallo, Picard or Ch&#x27;timi and Arpitan). Today, many immigrants speak another tongue at home.

According to historian Eric Hobsbawm, &quot;the French language has been essential to the concept of &#x27;France&#x27;,&quot; although in 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak it at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well; even in oïl languages zones, it was not usually used except in cities, and even there not always in the outlying districts.

===Abroad===

Abroad, the French language is spoken in many different countries – in particular the former French colonies. Nevertheless, speaking French is distinct from being a French citizen. Thus, &quot;francophonie&quot;, or the speaking of French, must not be confused with French citizenship or ethnicity. For example, French speakers in Switzerland are not &quot;French citizens&quot;.

Native English-speaking Blacks on the island of Saint-Martin hold French nationality even though they do not speak French as a first language, while their neighbouring French-speaking Haitian immigrants (who also speak a French-creole) remain foreigners. Large numbers of people of French ancestry outside Europe speak other first languages, particularly English, throughout most of North America (with Quebec and Acadians in the Canadian Maritimes being notable, not the only, exceptions), Spanish or Portuguese in southern South America, and Afrikaans in South Africa.

The adjective &quot;French&quot; can be used to mean either &quot;French citizen&quot; or &quot;French-speaker&quot;, and usage varies depending on the context, with the former being common in France. The latter meaning is often used in Canada, when discussing matters internal to Canada.

==Nationality, citizenship, ethnicity==
Generations of settlers have migrated over the centuries to France, creating a variegated grouping of peoples. Thus the historian John F. Drinkwater states, &quot;The French are, paradoxically, strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge.&quot;

The modern French are the descendants of mixtures including Romans, Celts, Iberians, Ligurians and Greeks in southern France, Germanic peoples arriving at the end of the Roman Empire such as the Franks and the Burgundians, and some Vikings who mixed with the Normans and settled mostly in Normandy in the 9th century.

According to Dominique Schnapper, &quot;The classical conception of the nation is that of an entity which, opposed to the ethnic group, affirms itself as an open community, the will to live together expressing itself by the acceptation of the rules of a unified public domain which transcends all particularisms&quot;. This conception of the nation as being composed by a &quot;will to live together,&quot; supported by the classic lecture of Ernest Renan in 1882, has been opposed by the French far-right, in particular the nationalist &quot;Front National&quot; (&quot;National Front&quot; – FN / now &quot;Rassemblement National&quot; - &quot;National Rally&quot; - RN) party which claims that there is such a thing as a &quot;French ethnic group&quot;. The discourse of ethno-nationalist groups such as the Front National (FN), however, advances the concept of &quot;Français de souche&quot; or &quot;indigenous&quot; French.
The conventional conception of French history starts with Ancient Gaul, and French national identity often views the Gauls as national precursors, either as biological ancestors (hence the refrain &quot;nos ancêtres les Gaulois&quot;), as emotional/spiritual ancestors, or both. Vercingetorix, the Gaulish chieftain who tried to unite the various Gallic tribes of the land against Roman encroachment but was ultimately vanquished by Julius Caesar, is often revered as a &quot;first national hero&quot;. In the famously popular French comic &quot;Asterix&quot;, the main characters are patriotic Gauls who fight against Roman invaders while in modern days the term &quot;Gaulois&quot; is used in French to distinguish the &quot;native&quot; French from French of immigrant origins. However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well: notably, Napoleon III, whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix, and declared that &quot;New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person.&quot;

It has been noted that the French view of having Gallic origins has evolved over history. Before the French Revolution, it divided social classes, with the peasants identifying with the native Gauls while the aristocracy identified with the Franks. During the early nineteenth century, intellectuals began using the identification with Gaul instead as a unifying force to bridge divisions within French society with a common national origin myth. Myriam Krepps of the University of Nebraska-Omaha argues that the view of &quot;a unified territory (one land since the beginning of civilization) and a unified people&quot; which de-emphasized &quot;all disparities and the succession of waves of invaders&quot; was first imprinted on the masses by the unified history curriculum of French textbooks in the late 1870s.

Since the beginning of the Third Republic (1871–1940), the state has not categorized people according to their alleged ethnic origins. Hence, in contrast to the United States Census, French people are not asked to define their ethnic appartenance, whichever it may be. The usage of ethnic and racial categorization is avoided to prevent any case of discrimination; the same regulations apply to religious membership data that cannot be compiled under the French Census. This classic French republican non-essentialist conception of nationality is officialized by the French Constitution, according to which &quot;French&quot; is a nationality, and not a specific ethnicity.

===Genetics===

France sits at the edge of the European peninsula and has seen waves of migration of groups that often settled owing to the presence of physical barriers preventing onward migration. This has led to language and regional cultural variegation, but the extent to which this pattern of migrations showed up in population genetics studies was unclear until the publication of a study in 2019 that used genome wide data. The study identified six different genetic clusters that could be distinguished across populations. The study concluded that the population genetic clusters correlate with linguistic and historical divisions in France and with the presence of geographic barriers such as mountains and major rivers. A population bottleneck was also identified in the fourteenth century, consistent with the timing for the Black Death in Europe.

Pierre (2020) stated that the &quot;French genetic landscape is predominantly of Early European Farmer-related ancestry&quot;, which followed a north–south cline. It varies between 46.5% and 66.2%, with the lowest being found in northwest France (&lt;50%).

===Nationality and citizenship===
French nationality has not meant automatic citizenship. Some categories of French people have been excluded, throughout the years, from full citizenship:
* Women: until the Liberation, they were deprived of the right to vote. The provisional government of General de Gaulle accorded them this right by 21 April 1944 prescription. However, women are still under-represented in the political class. The 6 June 2000 law on parity attempted to address this question by imposing a de facto quota system for women in French politics.
* Military: for a long time, it was called &quot;la grande muette&quot; (&quot;the great mute&quot;) in reference to its prohibition from interfering in political life. During a large part of the Third Republic (1871–1940), the Army was in its majority anti-republican (and thus counterrevolutionary). The Dreyfus Affair and the 16 May 1877 crisis, which almost led to a monarchist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by MacMahon, are examples of this anti-republican spirit. Therefore, they would only gain the right to vote with the 17 August 1945 prescription: the contribution of De Gaulle to the interior French Resistance reconciled the Army with the Republic. Nevertheless, militaries do not benefit from the whole of public liberties, as the 13 July 1972 law on the general statute of militaries specify.
* Young people: the July 1974 law, voted at the instigation of president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, reduced from 21 to 18 the age of majority.
* Naturalized foreigners: since the 9 January 1973 law, foreigners who have acquired French nationality do not have to wait five years after their naturalization to be able to vote anymore.
* Inhabitants of the colonies: the 7 May 1946 law meant that soldiers from the &quot;Empire&quot; (such as the &quot;tirailleurs&quot;) killed during World War I and World War II were not citizens.
* The special case of foreign citizens of an EU member state who, even if not French, are allowed to vote in European and French local elections if living in France, and may turn to any French consular or diplomatic mission if there is no such representations of their own country.
* Some French people convicted by a court may be deprived of their civil rights, up to 10 years.

France was one of the first countries to implement denaturalization laws. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben has pointed out this fact that the 1915 French law which permitted denaturalization with regard to naturalized citizens of &quot;enemy&quot; origins was one of the first example of such legislation, which Nazi Germany later implemented with the 1935 Nuremberg Laws.

Furthermore, some authors who have insisted on the &quot;crisis of the nation-state&quot; allege that nationality and citizenship are becoming separate concepts. They show as example &quot;international&quot;, &quot;supranational citizenship&quot; or &quot;world citizenship&quot; (membership to international nongovernmental organizations such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace). This would indicate a path toward a &quot;postnational citizenship&quot;.

Besides this, modern citizenship is linked to civic participation (also called positive freedom), which implies voting, demonstrations, petitions, activism, etc. Therefore, social exclusion may lead to deprivation of citizenship. This has led various authors (Philippe Van Parijs, Jean-Marc Ferry, Alain Caillé, André Gorz) to theorize a guaranteed minimum income which would impede exclusion from citizenship.

===Multiculturalism versus universalism===

In France, the conception of citizenship teeters between universalism and multiculturalism. French citizenship has been defined for a long time by three factors: integration, individual adherence, and the primacy of the soil (&quot;jus soli&quot;). Political integration (which includes but is not limited to racial integration) is based on voluntary policies which aims at creating a common identity and the interiorization by each individual of a common cultural and historic legacy. Since in France, the state preceded the nation, voluntary policies have taken an important place in the creation of this common cultural identity.

On the other hand, the interiorization of a common legacy is a slow process, which B. Villalba compares to acculturation. According to him, &quot;integration is therefore the result of a double will: the nation&#x27;s will to create a common culture for all members of the nation, and the communities&#x27; will living in the nation to recognize the legitimacy of this common culture&quot;. Villalba warns against confusing recent processes of integration (related to the so-called &quot;second generation immigrants&quot;, who are subject to discrimination), with older processes which have made modern France. Villalba thus shows that any democratic nation characterize itself by its project of transcending all forms of particular memberships (whether biological, ethnic, historic, economic, social, religious or cultural). The citizen thus emancipates himself from the particularisms of identity which characterize himself to attain a more &quot;universal&quot; dimension. He is a citizen, before being a member of a community or of a social class.

Therefore, according to Villalba, &quot;a democratic nation is, by definition, multicultural as it gathers various populations, which differs by their regional origins (Auvergnats, Bretons, Corsicans or Lorrainers...), their national origins (immigrant, son or grandson of an immigrant), or religious origins (Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Agnostics or Atheists...).&quot;

===Ernest Renan&#x27;s &quot;What is a Nation?&quot; (1882)===
Ernest Renan described this republican conception in his famous 11 March 1882 conference at the Sorbonne, &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce qu&#x27;une nation?&quot; (&quot;What is a Nation?&quot;). According to him, to belong to a nation is a subjective act which always has to be repeated, as it is not assured by objective criteria. A nation-state is not composed of a single homogeneous ethnic group (a community), but of a variety of individuals willing to live together.

Renan&#x27;s non-essentialist definition, which forms the basis of the French Republic, is diametrically opposed to the German ethnic conception of a nation, first formulated by Fichte. The German conception is usually qualified in France as an &quot;exclusive&quot; view of nationality, as it includes only the members of the corresponding ethnic group, while the Republican conception thinks itself as universalist, following the Enlightenment&#x27;s ideals officialized by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. While Ernest Renan&#x27;s arguments were also concerned by the debate about the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region, he said that not only one referendum had to be made in order to ask the opinions of the Alsatian people, but also a &quot;daily referendum&quot; should be made concerning all those citizens wanting to live in the French nation-state. This &quot;plébiscite de tous les jours&quot; (&#x27;everyday plebiscite&#x27;) might be compared to a social contract or even to the classic definition of consciousness as an act which repeats itself endlessly.

Henceforth, contrary to the German definition of a nation based on objective criteria, such as race or ethnic group, which may be defined by the existence of a common language, among other criteria, the people of France is defined as all the people living in the French nation-state and willing to do so, i.e. by its citizenship. This definition of the French nation-state contradicts the common opinion, which holds that the concept of the French people identifies with one particular ethnic group. This contradiction explains the seeming paradox encountered when attempting to identify a &quot;French ethnic group&quot;: the French conception of the nation is radically opposed to (and was thought in opposition to) the German conception of the &quot;Volk&quot; (&quot;ethnic group&quot;).

This universalist conception of citizenship and of the nation has influenced the French model of colonization. While the British Empire preferred an indirect rule system, which did not mix the colonized people with the colonists, the French Republic theoretically chose an integration system and considered parts of its colonial empire as France itself and its population as French people. The ruthless conquest of Algeria thus led to the integration of the territory as a Département of the French territory.

This ideal also led to the ironic sentence which opened up history textbooks in France as in its colonies: &quot;Our ancestors the Gauls...&quot;. However, this universal ideal, rooted in the 1789 French Revolution (&quot;bringing liberty to the people&quot;), suffered from the racism that impregnated colonialism. Thus, in Algeria, the Crémieux decrees at the end of the 19th century gave French citizenship to north African Jews, while Muslims were regulated by the 1881 Indigenous Code. Liberal author Tocqueville himself considered that the British model was better adapted than the French one and did not balk before the cruelties of General Bugeaud&#x27;s conquest. He went as far as advocating racial segregation there.

This paradoxical tension between the universalist conception of the French nation and the racist attitudes intermingled into colonization is most obvious in Ernest Renan himself, who went as far as advocating a kind of eugenics. In a 26 June 1856 letter to Arthur de Gobineau, author of &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1853–1855) and one of the first theoreticians of &quot;scientific racism&quot;, he wrote:

 You have written a remarkable book here, full of vigour and originality of mind, only it&#x27;s written to be little understood in France or rather it&#x27;s written to be misunderstood here. The French mind turns little to ethnographic considerations: France has little belief in race, [...] The fact of race is huge originally; but it&#x27;s been continually losing its importance, and sometimes, as in France, it happens to disappear completely. Does that mean total decadence? Yes, certainly from the standpoint of the stability of institutions, the originality of character, a certain nobility that I hold to be the most important factor in the conjunction of human affairs. But also what compensations! No doubt if the noble elements mixed in the blood of a people happened to disappear completely, then there would be a demeaning equality, like that of some Eastern states and in some respects China. But it is in fact a very small amount of noble blood put into the circulation of a people that is enough to ennoble them, at least as to historical effects; this is how France, a nation so completely fallen into commonness, in practice plays on the world stage the role of a gentleman. Setting aside the quite inferior races whose intermingling with the great races would only poison the human species, I see in the future a homogeneous humanity.

===&quot;Jus soli&quot; and &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;===
During the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; (before the 1789 French revolution), &quot;jus soli&quot; (or &quot;right of territory&quot;) was predominant. Feudal law recognized personal allegiance to the sovereign, but the subjects of the sovereign were defined by their birthland. According to the 3 September 1791 Constitution, those who are born in France from a foreign father and have fixed their residency in France, or those who, after being born in a foreign country from a French father, have come to France and have sworn their civil oath, become French citizens. Because of the war, distrust toward foreigners led to the obligation on the part of this last category to swear a civil oath in order to gain French nationality.

However, the Napoleonic Code would insist on &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (&quot;right of blood&quot;). Paternity, against Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s wish, became the principal criterion of nationality, and therefore broke for the first time with the ancient tradition of &quot;jus soli&quot;, by breaking any residency condition toward children born abroad from French parents. However, according to Patrick Weil, it was not &quot;ethnically motivated&quot; but &quot;only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood&quot;.

With the 7 February 1851 law, voted during the Second Republic (1848–1852), &quot;double &quot;jus soli&quot;&quot; was introduced in French legislation, combining birth origin with paternity. Thus, it gave French nationality to the child of a foreigner, if both are born in France, except if the year following his coming of age he reclaims a foreign nationality (thus prohibiting dual nationality). This 1851 law was in part passed because of conscription concerns. This system more or less remained the same until the 1993 reform of the Nationality Code, created by 9 January 1973 law.

The 1993 reform, which defines the Nationality law, is deemed controversial by some. It commits young people born in France to foreign parents to solicit French nationality between the ages of 16 and 21. This has been criticized, some arguing that the principle of equality before the law was not complied with, since French nationality was no longer given automatically at birth, as in the classic &quot;double &quot;jus soli&quot;&quot; law, but was to be requested when approaching adulthood. Henceforth, children born in France from French parents were differentiated from children born in France from foreign parents, creating a hiatus between these two categories.

The 1993 reform was prepared by the Pasqua laws. The first Pasqua law, in 1986, restricts residence conditions in France and facilitates expulsions. With this 1986 law, a child born in France from foreign parents can only acquire French nationality by demonstrating a will to do so, at age 16, by proving haven been schooled in France and has a sufficient command of the French language. This new policy is symbolized by the expulsion of 101 Malians by charter.

The second Pasqua law on &quot;immigration control&quot; makes regularisation of illegal aliens more difficult and, in general, residence conditions for foreigners much harder. Charles Pasqua, who said on 11 May 1987: &quot;Some have reproached me of having used a plane, but, if necessary, I will use trains&quot;, declared to &quot;Le Monde&quot; on 2 June 1993: &quot;France has been a country of immigration, it doesn&#x27;t want to be one anymore. Our aim, taking into account the difficulties of the economic situation, is to tend toward &#x27;zero immigration&#x27; (&quot;immigration zéro&quot;)&quot;.

Therefore, modern French nationality law combines four factors: paternality or &#x27;right of blood&#x27;, birth origin, residency and the will expressed by a foreigner, or a person born in France to foreign parents, to become French.

===European citizenship===

The 1992 Maastricht Treaty introduced the concept of European citizenship, which comes in addition to national citizenships.

===Citizenship of foreigners===
By definition, a &quot;foreigner&quot; is someone who does not have French nationality. Therefore, it is &quot;not&quot; a synonym of &quot;immigrant&quot;, as a foreigner may be born in France. On the other hand, a Frenchman born abroad may be considered an immigrant (e.g. former prime minister Dominique de Villepin who lived the majority of his life abroad). In most of the cases, however, a foreigner is an immigrant, and vice versa. They either benefit from legal sojourn in France, which, after a residency of ten years, makes it possible to ask for naturalisation. If they do not, they are considered &quot;illegal aliens&quot;. Some argue that this privation of nationality and citizenship does not square with their contribution to the national economic efforts, and thus to economic growth.

In any cases, rights of foreigners in France have improved over the last half-century:
* 1946: right to elect trade union representative (but not to be elected as a representative)
* 1968: right to become a trade-union delegate
* 1972: right to sit in works council and to be a delegate of the workers at the condition of &quot;knowing how to read and write French&quot;
* 1975: additional condition: &quot;to be able to express oneself in French&quot;; they may vote at &quot;prud&#x27;hommes elections&quot; (&quot;industrial tribunal elections&quot;) but may not be elected; foreigners may also have administrative or leadership positions in tradeunions but under various conditions
* 1982: those conditions are suppressed, only the function of &quot;conseiller prud&#x27;hommal&quot; is reserved to those who have acquired French nationality. They may be elected in workers&#x27; representation functions (Auroux laws). They also may become administrators in public structures such as Social security banks (&quot;caisses de sécurité sociale&quot;), OPAC (which administers HLMs), Ophlm...
* 1992: for European Union citizens, right to vote at the European elections, first exercised during the 1994 European elections, and at municipal elections (first exercised during the 2001 municipal elections).

===Statistics===

The INSEE does not collect data about language, religion, or ethnicity – on the principle of the secular and unitary nature of the French Republic.

Nevertheless, there are some sources dealing with just such distinctions:

*The CIA World Factbook defines the ethnic groups of France as being &quot;Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Sub-Saharan African, Indochinese, and Basque minorities. Overseas departments: black, white, mulatto, East Indian, Chinese, Amerindian&quot;. Its definition is reproduced on several Web sites collecting or reporting demographic data.
*The U.S. Department of State goes into further detail: &quot;Since prehistoric times, France has been a crossroads of trade, travel, and invasion. Three basic European ethnic stocks – Celtic, Latin, and Teutonic (Frankish) – have blended over the centuries to make up its present population. . . . Traditionally, France has had a high level of immigration. . . . In 2004, there were over 6 million Muslims, largely of North African descent, living in France. France is home to both the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in Europe.&quot;
*The Encyclopædia Britannica says that &quot;the French are strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge&quot;, and it mentions as part of the population of France the Basques, the Celts (called Gauls by Romans), and the Germanic (Teutonic) peoples (including the Norsemen or Vikings). France also became &quot;in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, the prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe. . . .&quot;

It is said by some that France adheres to the ideal of a single, homogeneous national culture, supported by the absence of hyphenated identities and by avoidance of the very term &quot;ethnicity&quot; in French discourse.

===Immigration===

As of 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that 5.3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6.5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in metropolitan France (62.1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5.5 million are of European origin and 4 million of North African origin.

==Populations with French ancestry==

Between 1848 and 1939, 1 million people with French passports emigrated to other countries. The main communities of French ancestry in the New World are found in the United States, Canada and Argentina while sizeable groups are also found in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Australia.

===Canada===
There are nearly seven million French speakers out of nine to ten million people of French and partial French ancestry in Canada. The Canadian province of Quebec (2006 census population of 7,546,131), where more than 95 percent of the people speak French as either their first, second or even third language, is the center of French life on the Western side of the Atlantic; however, French settlement began further east, in Acadia. Quebec is home to vibrant French-language arts, media, and learning. There are sizable French-Canadian communities scattered throughout the other provinces of Canada, particularly in Ontario, which has about 1 million people with French ancestry (400 000 who have French as their mother tongue), Manitoba, and New Brunswick, which is the only fully bilingual province and is 33 percent Acadian.

===United States===
The United States is home to an estimated 13 to 16 million people of French descent, or 4 to 5 percent of the US population, particularly in Louisiana, New England, Northern New York, and parts of the Midwest. The French community in Louisiana consists of the Creoles, the descendants of the French settlers who arrived when Louisiana was a French colony, and the Cajuns, the descendants of Acadian refugees from the Great Upheaval. Very few creoles remain in New Orleans in present times. In New England, the vast majority of French immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries came not from France, but from over the border in Quebec, the Quebec diaspora. These French Canadians arrived to work in the timber mills and textile plants that appeared throughout the region as it industrialized. Today, nearly 25 percent of the population of New Hampshire is of French ancestry, the highest of any state.

English and Dutch colonies of pre-Revolutionary America attracted large numbers of French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution in France. In the Dutch colony of New Netherland that later became New York, northern New Jersey, and western Connecticut, these French Huguenots, nearly identical in religion to the Dutch Reformed Church, assimilated almost completely into the Dutch community. However, large it may have been at one time, it has lost all identity of its French origin, often with the translation of names (examples: &quot;de la Montagne&quot; &gt; &quot;Vandenberg&quot; by translation; &quot;de Vaux&quot; &gt; &quot;DeVos&quot; or &quot;Devoe&quot; by phonetic respelling). Huguenots appeared in all of the English colonies and likewise assimilated. Even though this mass settlement approached the size of the settlement of the French settlement of Quebec, it has assimilated into the English-speaking mainstream to a much greater extent than other French colonial groups and has left few traces of cultural influence. New Rochelle, New York is named after La Rochelle, France, one of the sources of Huguenot emigration to the Dutch colony; and New Paltz, New York, is one of the few non-urban settlements of Huguenots that did not undergo massive recycling of buildings in the usual redevelopment of such older, larger cities as New York City or New Rochelle.

===Argentina===

French Argentines form the third largest ancestry group in Argentina, after Italian and Spanish Argentines. French immigration to Argentina peaked between 1871 and 1890, though considerable immigration continued until the late 1940s. At least half of these immigrants came from Southwestern France, especially from the Basque Country, Béarn (Basses-Pyrénées accounted for more than 20% of immigrants), Bigorre and Rouergue, but significant numbers also from Savoy and the Paris region. Today around 6.8 million Argentines have some degree of French ancestry or are of partial or wholly of French descent (up to 17% of the total population). French Argentines had a considerable influence over the country, particularly on its architectural styles and literary traditions, as well as on the scientific field. Some notable Argentines of French descent include writer Julio Cortázar, physiologist and Nobel Prize winner Bernardo Houssay or activist Alicia Moreau de Justo. With something akin to Hispanic culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Argentine society.

===Uruguay===
French Uruguayans form the third largest ancestry group in Uruguay, after Italian and Spanish Uruguayans. During the first half of the 19th century, Uruguay received the most French immigrants of any South American country. It constituted back then the second receptor of French immigrants in the New World after the United States. While the United States received 195,971 French immigrants between 1820 and 1855, 13,922 Frenchmen, most of them from the Basque Country and Béarn, left for Uruguay between 1833 and 1842.

The majority of immigrants were coming from the Basque Country, Béarn and Bigorre. Today, there are an estimated at 300,000 French descendants in Uruguay.

===United Kingdom===
French migration to the United Kingdom is a phenomenon that has occurred at various points in history. Many British people have French ancestry, and French remains the foreign language most learned by British people. Much of the UK&#x27;s mediaeval aristocracy was descended from Franco-Norman migrants at the time of the Norman Conquest of England, and also during the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenet dynasty.

According to a study by Ancestry.co.uk, 3 million British people are of French descent. Among those are television presenters Davina McCall and Louis Theroux. There are currently an estimated 400,000 French people in the United Kingdom, most of them in London.

===Costa Rica===
The first French emigration in Costa Rica was a very small number to Cartago in the mid-nineteenth century. Due to World War II, a group of exiled French (mostly soldiers and families orphaned) migrated to the country.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, a sizeable population can trace its ancestry to France. After Spain, this makes France the second largest European ethnicity in the country. The bulk of French immigrants arrived in Mexico during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

From 1814 to 1955, inhabitants of Barcelonnette and the surrounding Ubaye Valley emigrated to Mexico by the dozens. Many established textile businesses between Mexico and France. At the turn of the 20th century, there were 5,000 French families from the Barcelonnette region registered with the French Consulate in Mexico. While 90% stayed in Mexico, some returned, and from 1880 to 1930, built grand mansions called &quot;Maisons Mexicaines&quot; and left a mark upon the city. Today the descendants of the Barcelonettes account for 80,000 descendants distributed around Mexico.

In the 1860s, during the Second Mexican Empire ruled by Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico—in collaboration with Mexican conservatives and part of Napoleon III&#x27;s plan to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term of &quot;Amérique latine&quot;, &quot;Latin America&quot; in English)-- many French soldiers, merchants, and families set foot upon Mexican soil. Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s consort, Carlota of Mexico, a princess of Belgium, was a granddaughter of Louis-Philippe of France.

Many Mexicans of French descent live in cities or states such as Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Monterrey, Puebla, Guadalajara, and the capital, Mexico City, where French surnames such as Chairez/Chaires, Renaux, Pierres, Michel, Betancourt, Alaniz, Blanc, Ney, Jurado (Jure), Colo (Coleau), Dumas, or Moussier can be found. Today, Mexico has more than 3 million people of full and partial French descent. mainly living in the capital, Puebla, Guadalajara, Veracruz and Querétaro.

===Chile===
The French came to Chile in the 18th century, arriving at Concepción as merchants, and in the mid-19th century to cultivate vines in the haciendas of the Central Valley, the homebase of world-famous Chilean wine. The Araucanía Region also has an important number of people of French ancestry, as the area hosted settlers arrived by the second half of the 19th century as farmers and shopkeepers. With something akin to Hispanic culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Chilean society.

From 1840 to 1940, around 25,000 Frenchmen immigrated to Chile. 80% of them were coming from Southwestern France, especially from Basses-Pyrénées (Basque country and Béarn), Gironde, Charente-Inférieure and Charente and regions situated between Gers and Dordogne.

Most of French immigrants settled in the country between 1875 and 1895. Between October 1882 and December 1897, 8,413 Frenchmen settled in Chile, making up 23% of immigrants (second only after Spaniards) from this period. In 1863, 1,650 French citizens were registered in Chile. At the end of the century they were almost 30,000. According to the census of 1865, out of 23,220 foreigners established in Chile, 2,483 were French, the third largest European community in the country after Germans and Englishmen. In 1875, the community reached 3,000 members, 12% of the almost 25,000 foreigners established in the country. It was estimated that 10,000 Frenchmen were living in Chile in 1912, 7% of the 149,400 Frenchmen living in Latin America.

Today it is estimated that 500,000 Chileans are of French descent.

Former president of Chile Michelle Bachelet is of French origin, as was Augusto Pinochet. A large percentage of politicians, businessmen, professionals and entertainers in the country are of French ancestry.

===Brazil===

It is estimated that there are 1 million to 2 million or more Brazilians of French descent today. This gives Brazil the second largest French community in South America.

From 1819 to 1940, 40,383 Frenchmen immigrated to Brazil. Most of them settled in the country between 1884 and 1925 (8,008 from 1819 to 1883, 25,727 from 1884 to 1925, 6,648 from 1926 to 1940). Another source estimates that around 100,000 French people immigrated to Brazil between 1850 and 1965.

The French community in Brazil numbered 592 in 1888 and 5,000 in 1915. It was estimated that 14,000 Frenchmen were living in Brazil in 1912, 9% of the 149,400 Frenchmen living in Latin America, the second largest community after Argentina (100,000).

The Brazilian Imperial Family originates from the Portuguese House of Braganza and the last emperor&#x27;s heir and daughter, Isabella, married Prince Gaston d&#x27;Orleans, Comte d&#x27;Eu, a member of the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the Bourbons, the French Royal Family.

===Guatemala===

The first French immigrants were politicians such as Nicolas Raoul and Isidore Saget, Henri Terralonge and officers Aluard, Courbal, Duplessis, Gibourdel and Goudot. Later, when the Central American Federation was divided in 7 countries, Some of them settled to Costa Rica, others to Nicaragua, although the majority still remained in Guatemala. The relationships start to 1827, politicians, scientists, painters, builders, singers and some families emigrated to Guatemala. Later in a Conservative government, annihilated nearly all the relations between France and Guatemala, and most of French immigrants went to Costa Rica, but these relationships were again return to the late of the nineteenth century.

===Latin America===

Elsewhere in the Americas, French settlement took place in the 16th to 20th centuries. They can be found in Haiti, Cuba (refugees from the Haitian Revolution) and Uruguay. The Betancourt political families who influenced Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Bolivia and Panama have some French ancestry.

===Huguenots===
Large numbers of Huguenots are known to have settled in the United Kingdom (from 50,000), Ireland (10,000), in Protestant areas of Germany (especially the city of Berlin) (from 40 000), in the Netherlands (from 50 000), in South Africa and in North America. Many people in these countries still bear French names.

===Asia===

In Asia, a proportion of people with mixed French and Vietnamese descent can be found in Vietnam. Including the number of persons of pure French descent. Many are descendants of French settlers who intermarried with local Vietnamese people. Approximately 5,000 in Vietnam are of pure French descent, however, this number is disputed. A small proportion of people with mixed French and Khmer descent can be found in Cambodia. These people number approximately 16,000 in Cambodia, among this number, approximately 3,000 are of pure French descent. An unknown number with mixed French and Lao ancestry can be found throughout Laos. A few thousand French citizens of Indian, European or creole ethnic origins live in the former French possessions in India (mostly Pondicherry). In addition to these Countries, small minorities can be found elsewhere in Asia; the majority of these living as expatriates.
===Scandinavia===
During the great power era, about 100 French families came to Sweden. They had mainly emigrated to Sweden as a result of religious oppression. These include the Bedoire, De Laval and De Flon families. Several of whom worked as merchants and craftsmen. In Stockholm, the French Lutheran congregation was formed in 1687, later dissolved in 1791, which was not really an actual congregation but rather a series of private gatherings of religious practice.

===Elsewhere===
Apart from Québécois, Acadians, Cajuns, and Métis, other populations with some French ancestry outside metropolitan France include the &quot;Caldoches&quot; of New Caledonia, Louisiana Creole people of the United States, the so-called &quot;Zoreilles&quot; and &quot;Petits-blancs&quot; of various Indian Ocean islands, as well as populations of the former French colonial empire in Africa and the West Indies.

<text>Christopher George Kennedy (born July 4, 1963) is an American businessman who is the chair of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc. A member of the prominent Kennedy family, he is a son of former United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, and a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. From 2000 until 2012, he was also president of Merchandise Mart Properties, a commercial property management firm based in Chicago.

He was a candidate in the Democratic Party primary for Governor of Illinois in the 2018 election. He was appointed by Governor Pat Quinn as Chair of the Board of Trustees for the University of Illinois and served from 2009 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Kennedy was born on July 4, 1963, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy (née Skakel), the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of George Skakel, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade. He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.

Kennedy graduated from Boston College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986. In 1992, he graduated with a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

==Career==
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc. He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc. He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.

Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 1980s, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.

Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.

Kennedy also served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois. His gubernatorial appointment concluded in 2015. In 2015, Kennedy won the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s Spirit of Courage award for his involvement in the controversy.

Kennedy has partnered with CIP (the International Potato Center) and 2Blades in the fight against &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; in Africa, the same blight which brought some of his ancestors to the United States. He is chairing the 2Blades African Potato Initiative which is developing and producing the seed potatoes to be sold in Uganda and Kenya.

===Top Box Foods===
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. Top Box Foods is an anti-hunger not-for-profit community-based social business that sells high-quality groceries at affordable costs throughout the greater Chicagoland area.

Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box &quot;host sites,&quot; range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago&#x27;s largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church. Top Box has locations in Illinois in Chicago, Cook County, and Rockford, in Louisiana in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Personal life==
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native and daughter of Sheila Reynolds and attorney Robert Berner, while both were attending Boston College. Sheila&#x27;s maternal aunt, Anne Reynolds Skakel, had been married to Kennedy&#x27;s maternal uncle, Rushton Skakel, until her death, making Michael Skakel a first cousin to them both. Through another maternal aunt, Sheila is a first cousin to Jenny Sanford. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married Sheila in 1987. The couple has four children, Katherine Berner Kennedy (b. 1990), Christopher George Kennedy Jr. (b. 1992) m. Erin Daigle, Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. 1994) m. Jam Sulahry, and Clare Elizabeth Kennedy (b. 1998), whom they raised in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a J.D. degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley &amp; Austin in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.

==Political career==

Kennedy&#x27;s political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s bid for the 1980 Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joe&#x27;s reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joe and his cousin Mark Kennedy Shriver.

The &quot;National Journal&quot; once quoted Kennedy as saying, &quot;I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold &quot;[Schwarzenegger]&quot;, who is thinking of running for governor.&quot;

Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate. In the Democratic primary of the 2002 Illinois gubernatorial election, Kennedy served as the general chairman of Paul Vallas&#x27; campaign.

In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate, as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run. Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted&#x27;s death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.

Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018, he had never run for any elective office.

Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for &quot;a property tax system that can&#x27;t be abused by the wealthy and insiders&quot; in a fundraising email. Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion. &quot;It&#x27;s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,&quot; Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker&#x27;s property taxes. &quot;The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium,&quot; wrote the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative website. Kennedy has further gone on to state that what Mike Madigan is doing, referring to his conflict of interest from serving as the house speaker while working as a property tax attorney, should be illegal. When Kennedy served as the President of Merchandise Mart Properties Inc, the company used Madigan&#x27;s law firm to win property tax refunds via the appeals process, receiving over $133,000.

In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.

Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race. The Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Pritzker in August 2017. Kennedy was forced to backtrack after he defended the campaign of Republican Bruce Rauner running ads attacking Pritzker during the Democratic primary saying &quot;Rauner is trying to do what he thinks is best for the state of Illinois&quot; and &quot;his willingness to speak truth to power... is something that I think he should be applauded for.&quot;

Kennedy endorsed incumbent Democrat Joe Biden&#x27;s reelection campaign in the 2024 United States presidential election over a third-party/independent challenge by his brother Robert. After Biden dropped out, Kennedy endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s campaign, with the siblings denouncing his brother Robert Jr.&#x27;s decision to endorse former President Donald Trump, calling the move a &quot;betrayal&quot;.

==Business and economic involvement==
He is on the board of trustees and serves as Chair of the Audit Committee for the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments, a Chicago-based investment-management firm. He is currently the Lead Independent Director and Chair of the Nominating &amp; Governance Committee for Interface, a commercial flooring company focused on creating spaces with a positive and ecological impact on both people and planet. He is also Chair of the Nominating &amp; Governance Committee and serves on the Executive Committee for the Marine Biological Laboratory, an affiliate of the University of Chicago and leading international center for research and education in biological and environmental science located in Woods Hole, MA.

Chris previously served on the Board of Directors of the leading international design and furniture manufacturing firm Knoll.

Chris is the former Finance Chair of the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust.

From 1997 to 1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy&#x27;s chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago&#x27;s event-and-convention industry.

Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.

Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city&#x27;s business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.

==Residential development==
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.

Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town. The project has received criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unanimously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which they allege violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.

<doc id="962751" wikidata="Q449000" url="?curid=962751" title="Nest ferch Rhys">
<text>Nest ferch Rhys (c. 1085 – c. 1136) was the daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, last King of Deheubarth in Wales, by his wife, Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of Powys. Her family is of the House of Dinefwr. Nest was the wife of Gerald de Windsor (c. 1075 – 1135), Constable of Pembroke Castle and son of the Constable of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, by whom she was the ancestress of the FitzGerald dynasty.

Nest had two younger brothers, Gruffydd ap Rhys and Hywel, and, possibly, an older sister named Marared, as well as several older illegitimate half-brothers and half-sisters. After their father&#x27;s death in battle in 1093, &quot;the Kingdom of the Britons fell&quot; and was overrun by Normans. Nest&#x27;s younger brother Gruffydd was spirited into Ireland for safety; their brother Hywel may have been captured by Arnulf de Montgomery, along with their mother, unless, as appears likelier, their mother was captured with Nest; their fate is unknown. Two older brothers, illegitimate sons of Rhys, one of them named Goronwy, were captured and executed.

==First marriage and issue==
Nest was brought as a prized hostage to the court of William II of England, where she came to the attention of his younger brother Henry Beauclerc (the future King [[Henry I of England]), to whom she may have borne one of his illegitimate children, [[Henry FitzRoy (d. 1158)|Henry FitzHenry]] (c. 1103–1158).

Some time after the rebellions of Robert of Normandy and [[Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Belesme]], head of the powerful Montgomery family of Normandy and England, the King married Nest to [[Gerald de Windsor|Gerald FitzWalter of Windsor]], [[Arnulf of Montgomery|Arnulf de Montgomery]]&#x27;s former lieutenant and constable for [[Pembroke Castle]]. In 1102, for siding with the Montgomerys against the King, Gerald had been removed from control of Pembroke, and one Saher, a knight loyal to Henry, installed in his place. When Saher proved untenable in his new position, the King restored Gerald to Pembroke in 1105, along with Nest as his wife. By Gerald, Nest is the maternal progenitor of the [[FitzGerald dynasty]], a prominent [[Cambro-Norman]] noble family.

Nest bore Gerald at least five children, three sons and two daughters.

* William FitzGerald, Lord of Carew and Emlyn (died c. 1173). William&#x27;s children included [[Raymond FitzGerald]] le Gros.
* [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan]], [[Naas]] and [[Maynooth]], (died 1 September 1177). His children included [[Gerald FitzMaurice, 1st Lord of Offaly]].
* [[David FitzGerald]], [[Archdeacon of Cardigan]] and [[Bishop of St David&#x27;s]].
* Angharad, who married William Fitz Odo [[De Barry Family|de Barry]], by whom she was the mother of [[Robert de Barry]], [[Philip de Barry]], founder of [[Ballybeg Abbey]] at [[Buttevant]] in Ireland, and of Gerald de Barry, better known as [[Gerald of Wales]].
* Gwladys, mother of Milo de Cogan

==Second marriage and issue==
After Gerald&#x27;s death, Nest&#x27;s sons married her to Stephen, her husband&#x27;s constable of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], by whom she had another son, [[Robert Fitz-Stephen]] (d. 1182), one of the Norman conquerors of Ireland.

==Rape and abduction==

The details of this most famous episode of Nest&#x27;s life, thought to have occurred in 1106 or 1109, are obscure and differ from one account to another. The most common alternative narratives are:
*Nest and Gerald were present at an [[eisteddfod]] given, during a truce, by [[Cadwgan ap Bleddyn]], prince of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]
*Nest and her husband were &quot;visited&quot; by her second cousin [[Owain ap Cadwgan]], one of Cadwgan&#x27;s sons, at [[Carew Castle]], Gerald escaping down the latrine shaft.
*The castle of Cenarth Bychan (possibly modern [[Cilgerran Castle]]), home of Nest and her husband, was attacked by Owain ap Cadwgan and his men

The earliest account, that of Caradoc of Llancarfan, relates that &quot;At the instigation of the Devil, he [Owain] was moved by passion and love for the woman, and with a small company with him...he made for the castle by night.&quot;

The story that takes place at Carew Castle says Nest urged her husband to escape via a lavatory chute, while she stayed to face Owain. Owain took Nest and her children to a hunting lodge by the [[Eglwyseg]] Rocks north of the Vale of [[Llangollen]].

The abduction of Nest, whether or not it was with her consent, aroused the wrath of the Normans, as well as of the Welsh. The Norman lords, the Justiciar of Salop, and at least one bishop, bribed Owain&#x27;s Welsh enemies to attack him and his father, which they promptly did. Owain&#x27;s father tried to persuade him to return Nest, but to no avail. According to Caradoc, Nest told Owain, &quot;If you would have me stay with you and be faithful to you, then send my children home to their father.&quot; She secured the return of the children. Owain and his father were driven to seek exile in Ireland. Nest was returned to her husband.

In recent years, Nest has been given two specious children by her rapist, Llywelyn and Einion. In fact, Owain had a brother, but not a son, named Einion, and Welsh genealogies do not name the mother of Owain&#x27;s son Llywelyn. The omission of the name of a mother with the highborn status of Nest is startling, if it were true.

In the 19th century, this &quot;abduction&quot;, as well as the fighting which followed, earned Nest the nickname &quot;Helen of Wales&quot;. She was depicted at having connived with Owain at her rape and abduction, given more children than she had borne, along with more lovers than she had had.

In 1112, her brother Gruffydd returned from Ireland, spending most of his time with Gerald and Nest. When he was denied his inheritance from his father, and accused by the King of conspiring against him, he allied with the prince of Gwynedd, and war broke out. Owain ap Cadwgan had, by now, been pardoned by the King, and was prince of Powys; in 1111, his father had been assassinated by Owain&#x27;s cousin and former comrade-in-arms, Madog ap Rhiryd, whom Owain captured, castrated, and blinded. Being then on the King&#x27;s good side, Owain was ordered to rendezvous with a Norman force to proceed against Gruffydd. En route, he and his force chanced to run into none other than Gerald FitzWalter. Despite Owain being a royal ally, Gerald chose to avenge his wife&#x27;s rape, and killed Owain.

<text>Charles James Bacon Jr. (January 9, 1885 – November 15, 1968) was an American athlete and a member of the Irish American Athletic Club and the New York City Police Department. He won the 400 metres hurdles at the 1908 Summer Olympics.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York and died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

At the 1904 Summer Olympics he finished ninth in the 1500 metres event.

Two years later at the 1906 Summer Olympics he finished fifth in the 400 metres competition and sixth in the 800 metres event.

Just a month and a half before the 1908 Olympic Games in London, Bacon ran in Philadelphia setting a new unofficial world record of 55.8 in the 400 metre hurdles.

At the Olympic Games in 1908, he and fellow American Harry Hillman went over the last hurdle simultaneously, after which Bacon pulled away on the straight to win in a new world record of 55.0 seconds. This record was recognized by IAAF, thus Bacon became the first world record holder in the 400 metres hurdles. The same year, Bacon set the world record for the 440 yards, 10 hurdles, 3 feet 6 inches at Celtic Park, Queens, New York, the home of the Irish American Athletic Club on October 11, 1908.

<doc id="962768" wikidata="Q745757" url="?curid=962768" title="The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show">
<text>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show (often shortened as Itchy &amp; Scratchy) is a fictional animated series featured on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The cartoon depicts a sadistic mouse named Itchy who repeatedly maims or murders a black cat named Scratchy. It is typically presented as 15- to 60-second sketches that are a part of &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; is filled with graphic violence, unsuitable for children, that almost invariably prompts laughter from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; characters, especially Bart and Lisa.

The Itchy and Scratchy characters are extremely violent and bloody parodies of cat-and-mouse cartoons such as &quot;Tom and Jerry,&quot; &quot;Herman and Katnip&quot;, &quot;Kit &#x27;n&#x27; Kaboodle&quot;, and &quot;Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks&quot;. The Italian comic strip &quot;Squeak the Mouse&quot; is also considered to be an inspiration for the characters.

The cartoon first appeared in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;The Bart Simpson Show&quot;, which aired in 1988. The cartoon&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was in the 1990 episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;. The cartoons became popular among the show&#x27;s writers and animators, and they are often added when an episode needs expanding. Several full episodes were centered on the fictional production of &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;, such as &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
&quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; is a show within a show that appears occasionally in episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. They appear in the form of 15- to 60-second-long cartoons that are filled with graphic violence, almost always initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat, with the former almost always being the victor. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; airs as a segment on &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;, and also aired on its brief replacements, &quot;Sideshow Bob&#x27;s Cavalcade of Whimsy&quot;, and &quot;Gabbo&quot;. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; mostly airs as a standalone show rather than being a segment in some episodes, such as &quot;In Marge We Trust&quot; (season 8, 1997).

&quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent and bloody, with Itchy performing unprovoked acts of graphic violence and homicide unlike most classic cartoons. The most direct and obvious example is &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious, though in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;, the mouse acts as the antagonist. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; also includes shorts such as &quot;Scratchtasia&quot;, a parody of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, and &quot;Pinitchio&quot;, a parody of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Animation-related jokes are prevalent in the show, such as the &quot;Manhattan Madness&quot; cartoon in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;, which is based on very early animated cartoons such as &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;. The cartoons also occasionally serve to play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; (season five, 1994), Homer is recruited by NASA, and later watches an &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;.

===Fictional production history===
Several full episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; were centered on the fictional production history of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot;. It begins with Chester J. Lampwick creating Itchy the mouse for the now-lost silent cartoon &quot;Manhattan Madness&quot;, in which Itchy brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; cartoon). However, the character was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928 titled &quot;That Happy Cat&quot;. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together called &quot;Steamboat Itchy&quot;, a violent parody of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II–era radio series, at least two films (&quot;Pinitchio&quot; and &quot;Scratchtasia,&quot; which are parodies of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, respectively), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.

Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios is run by Roger Meyers Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon&#x27;s supposed creator. The studio was bankrupted after it was sued by Lampwick for $800 million when he was represented by Lionel Hutz, but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of Mr. ZIP. The show underwent a brief, non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by Marge Simpson, but it returned to its original violent format after Marge was later discredited after defending the display of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; in Springfield in the face of public objection. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; has spawned an in-universe Academy Award–winning film adaptation, amusement parks, and a musical; and, like Krusty&#x27;s show, localized versions are produced for other countries, such as Jamaica&#x27;s &quot;The Itchem and Scratchem Blow&quot;.

==Characters==
===Featured in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;===
* Itchy (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a blue mouse and the show&#x27;s villainous antagonist; he almost always succeeds in his relentless attempts in mutilating or killing Scratchy and any other cats around. Itchy is rarely given any motivation for these attacks outside of the thrill of killing, often laughing in an evil fashion whilst murdering other characters.

* Scratchy (voiced by Harry Shearer), the protagonist, is a threadbare, dim-witted black cat and the perpetual victim of Itchy&#x27;s violent acts; as opposed to Tom of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, Scratchy seldom antagonizes the mouse to provoke him in any way and is almost always an ordinary civilian going about an everyday life until Itchy kills him. 

* Poochie (voiced by Dan Castellaneta when voiced by Homer Simpson, Alex Rocco when voiced by Roger Meyers, Jr.), is an orange dog that appeared in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; (season eight, 1997). In the episode, the producers of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. Homer Simpson gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, &quot;The Beagle Has Landed&quot;. A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised due to interfering with the graphic violence, and was permanently killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer&#x27;s objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious because he was so rich, rather than because he was so cool. Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Treehouse of Horror IX&quot;, &quot;Little Big Mom&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare After Krustmas&quot;.

===Production staff===
* Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco in 1990, 1996–1997, Hank Azaria in 1993–1994) is the Chairman of the Board of Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios and son of Roger Meyers. He first appeared in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot; (season two, 1990). He distributes the cartoon and is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for his audience. He has an extremely callous personality; he only cares about people who can help him. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot;. Alex Rocco also voiced Meyers in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot; and &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. He said that he liked voicing Meyers because &quot;I get to be a big-shot.&quot; He professed being nervous when voicing the character for the first time in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot; because he said that he had never done a voice-over before. At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to &quot;just be yourself.&quot; Rocco was one of Bill Oakley&#x27;s and Josh Weinstein&#x27;s favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could &quot;have a little fun with him.&quot; On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by Hank Azaria in &quot;The Front&quot; (season four, 1993), &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot; (season five, 1994) and &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; (season six, 1994). The spelling of Meyers&#x27; name has been inconsistent in the show. His last name was spelled both Myers and Meyers in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;, and Myers the later episode &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;. His name is spelled Meyers in &quot;The Front&quot;, as well as in the book &quot;The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family&quot;.

* Roger Meyers Sr. first appeared in video footage in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; and has never had a speaking role. He was created because the writers felt it would have been &quot;tortured logic&quot; to have the Roger Meyers Jr. be the creator. Roger Meyers Sr. has similarities to Walt Disney. For example, Disney&#x27;s alleged antisemitism is spoofed when it is revealed that Meyers made a cartoon called &quot;Nazi Supermen are Our Superiors&quot;.

* June Bellamy (voiced by Tress MacNeille in her normal voice, Dan Castellaneta in her Itchy voice, Harry Shearer in her Scratchy voice, Julie Kavner in her Disapproving Squirrel voice) is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy. Her only appearance was in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. She is presumably a reference to veteran voice actress June Foray, who also voiced several male characters, notably Rocky the Flying Squirrel. In actuality, Itchy and Scratchy are voiced by two different men rather than one woman.

* Chester J. Lampwick (voiced by Kirk Douglas) is the creator of Itchy and only appeared in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;. The producers&#x27; first choice for the character, William Hickey, declined. Douglas&#x27;s recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the supplied earphones and said the maximum he would do was two takes.

* In several episodes revolving around the production of &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;, caricatures of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; staff are used as the writing staff of &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;. This first occurred in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot; where caricatures of animators David Silverman, Wes Archer, and Rich Moore can be seen. In &quot;The Front&quot; many of the show&#x27;s writers were used, this in-joke was purely an idea of the animators. John Swartzwelder, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Sam Simon, Jon Vitti, and Mike Reiss all appeared in the episode. This joke returned in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. Almost all of the writers shown are caricatures of the actual staff of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. At the production table, David X. Cohen, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein are shown, while Meyer speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is Silverman. Others who appear include Dan McGrath, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Donick Cary, Ron Hauge, Ned Goldreyer, and Mike Scully.

==Background==
===Origins===

&quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;The Bart Simpson Show&quot;, which originally aired on November 20, 1988. They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra-violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that. The names &quot;Itchy&quot; and &quot;Scratchy&quot; were inspired by Pixie and Dixie, which was a segment on the cartoon show &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;. The comic strip &quot;Squeak the Mouse&quot; is also considered an apparent inspiration for the characters. As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, and it was one of the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea of having a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening. From that idea he got the inspiration for &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;. 

David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are &quot;an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it&#x27;s taken to a more realistic level. The kids on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are laughing at it, and we&#x27;re laughing too, but part of what you&#x27;re laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the violence.&quot;

===Development===

The &quot;Itchy and Scratchy show&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;The Bart Simpson Show&quot;, which aired on November 20, 1988; the performance style at the time was like &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and, unusually, featured Scratchy much like his Tom and Jerry counterpart, attacking Itchy. Their first appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;. In the series, it was quickly established early on that Scratchy was a peaceful character that was persecuted by his friend, the Psychopathic mouse, Itchy.

&quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to satirize. In some cases, notably in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, the writers use Itchy &amp; Scratchy as a way to comment on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The shorts are often difficult for the writers, and take much time to develop and devise a title, and in the end they fill little time. Writing the Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy &amp; Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center on them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts. In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy &amp; Scratchy, so the writers decided to do &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;, an episode that dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons. Swartzwelder and Sam Simon collaborated to create the &quot;nice&quot; version of Itchy and Scratchy in that episode. The cartoons are often kept short, because according to David Silverman, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really work as a long cartoon.&quot;

During David Mirkin&#x27;s tenure as showrunner (season five and six), he was asked by the Fox network not to do any more Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons due to the amount of violence in them. In response, the show produced &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot;. The network asked them not to do the episode, and threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy &amp; Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when Mirkin threatened to tell the media. The writers nevertheless promised to try not to overdo the violence and in some scenes the violence was cut.

During their tenure as executive producers, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein tried to fit in one episode relating to &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; every season. They note that as the seasons progressed, it became increasingly difficult for them to create new Itchy &amp; Scratchy episode ideas. Although the episode was difficult to animate, &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; was &quot;a dream come true&quot; for the animators, as they enjoyed animating scenes filled with violence.

==Other appearances==
Itchy and Scratchy have appeared in various products and other media relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

&quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game&quot; was released for Game Gear and Super NES, a version for the Sega Genesis was also developed but was never commercially released. &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness&quot;, was released for Game Boy. Itchy, Scratchy and Poochie play roles in the &quot;Grand Theft Scratchy&quot; section in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;.

Itchy and Scratchy have also appeared in commercials for various products, including a 1999 Butterfinger advert where Bart watches a short called &quot;500 Easy Pieces&quot;.

They appear in the first scene of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. The writers of the film knew from the beginning that they were going to start with an Itchy &amp; Scratchy short and the segment was the first scene that was storyboarded by the animators.

The duo also appear in the pre-show video for The Simpsons Ride. They host a video called &quot;Safety First&quot; that shows riders what can happen to them if they do not follow ride requirements.

Outside of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Itchy &amp; Scratchy also appear in one of the last scenes of &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
In his 2004 book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, author Chris Turner describes &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; as &quot;by far the most gleeful visual riffing on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; [...] each snippet of &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; packs as much frenetically paced action, sight-gaggery, and physical humor into its half-minute of screen time as a half-dozen Road Runner cartoons and a dozen &quot;Tom &amp; Jerrys&quot;.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; the sixth-best episode in the show&#x27;s history, describing it as &quot;a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had declined over the years.&quot;

Todd Gilchrist of &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; a masterpiece, stating it &quot;could easily be packaged and sold by [itself].&quot; Robert Canning of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s always fun to see an &#x27;Itchy and Scratchy&#x27; cartoon&quot; but believes that the shorter and simpler cartoons are better than the longer more complex ones.

===Popularity===
In 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; and &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; the 7th-best and 23rd-best episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, respectively.

In a 2006 article, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Itchy &amp; Scratchy in tenth position on their list of the &quot;Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters&quot;, citing that &quot;the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show shines a nice mirror on cartoons, showing just how funny cartoon violence really is.&quot;

In a 2014 Vulture article, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writers ranked their nine favorite &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; cartoons. Their choices included season 4&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Itchy&quot;, season 14&#x27;s &quot;Bleeder of the Pack&quot;, the opening scene of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; and the safety video &quot;Safety First&quot; that plays before The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios.

<text>Star Song Communications is a Christian record label that was started in 1976 by Wayne Donowho, who recruited his friend Darrell Harris. It gained notoriety when it issued Resurrection Band&#x27;s ground-breaking debut album, Awaiting Your Reply in 1978. Originally, a distribution deal was made with Benson Records. From 1983 until 1986, distribution was done by Word Records. After that, a deal was made with Sparrow Records. Independent distribution was started in 1989, and picked up distribution for ForeFront records and DC Talk in 1991. This distribution was maintained until the sale of the company to EMI, and the launch of Chordant Distribution in 1994.

Pure Metal Records was acquired from Refuge Records in 1990.

In 1998, it was announced that Star Song would only be used to issue reprints, and their artists would be transferred to Sparrow.

<doc id="962771" wikidata="Q1309895" url="?curid=962771" title="L. Mendel Rivers">
<text>Lucius Mendel Rivers (September 28, 1905 – December 28, 1970) was a Democratic U.S. Representative from South Carolina, representing the Charleston-based 1st congressional district for nearly 30 years. As chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Rivers developed a reputation for his unwavering support of American involvement in the Vietnam War. His reputation suffered as the American public at large turned against further escalation in the Vietnam War. In 1968, Rivers condemned American servicemen who attempted to stop the My Lai massacre, labeling them as &quot;traitors&quot;. Rivers served in the House until his death in 1970.

==Early life and education==
Mendel Rivers was born in Gumville, South Carolina, to Lucius Hampton Rivers and Henrietta Marion McCay. The family moved to a farm in St. Stephen in 1907 and lived comfortably until 1915. That year the father Lucius died from pneumonia. Mendel&#x27;s older brother Earle was put in charge of running the farm, but was not interested in agriculture. At the same time, agriculture suffered financial pressures and the family&#x27;s assets declined. Eventually, they moved to North Charleston, where they opened a boarding house on O&#x27;Hear Avenue.

Rivers attended local public schools. He took six years to graduate from Charleston High School in 1926. He attended the College of Charleston for three years and the University of South Carolina School of Law for two years, graduating from neither. The law school dean at the University of South Carolina advised Rivers to take up another profession because, although he knew the assignments, he suffered from stage fright. Rivers was determined to become a lawyer so he returned to College of Charleston, took classes to prepare himself for the bar examination.

==Career==
After passing the bar exam in 1932, he was unable to find work in Charleston law firms during the Great Depression, so he started his own practice.

==Entry into politics==
Rivers first became involved in politics in 1930 when he participated in Ed Pritchard&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the state legislature against Russell McGowan. He was an active member of the Charleston Young Democrats club and shortly after passing the bar, Rivers decided to run for one of the twelve state representative spots from Charleston County. County politics in the 1930s were controlled by the political machine of Charleston mayor Burnet R. Maybank, and gaining his endorsement was crucial to winning an election. Rivers sought the mayor&#x27;s blessing, but was rejected because he was an unknown candidate from North Charleston. He ran as an Independent Democrat and was defeated in his bid for election.

A vacancy on the Charleston County delegation arose in 1933 when Ben Scott Whaley resigned to join the staff of Senator James Francis Byrnes. Rivers won the special election by running against Charleston and campaigning on the slogan &quot;Give the Northern End of the County Representation.&quot; In 1934, Rivers ran for re-election and received the most votes of any state House candidate on the Charleston County ticket, making him chairman of the county delegation. As a state Representative, Rivers served on the Judiciary and Education committees. He became the state president of the Young Democrats in 1935 and was a delegate to the 1936 Democratic National Convention.

The rapid ascendancy of Rivers attracted the attention of 1st district Congressman Thomas S. McMillan who became worried when Rivers requested papers from the state Democratic secretary in 1936 to run for office. McMillan arranged a meeting with Rivers and offered him a position as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States. Rivers accepted and worked throughout the South collecting unpaid criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds.

===1940 election===
On September 29, 1939, McMillan died and Rivers immediately made plans to run for Congress. He quit his federal job in February 1940 and opened a law practice in Charleston to provide a base for his campaign. His opponent in the Democratic primary was Alfred von Kolnitz, who had the backing of the Charleston political establishment and Thomas McMillan&#x27;s widow, Clara. Rivers knew that he was not going to win the vote in Charleston, so he tried to maximize his vote outside of Charleston by making the theme of his campaign about the chicanery of the city. Furthermore, with World War II raging in Europe, Rivers played up von Kolnitz&#x27;s German name to make him appear as if a Nazi sympathizer. He was aided in this effort by the fact that von Kolnitz was outspokenly antisemitic, and was in favor of isolationism (von Kolnitz advocated that the U.S. not help the United Kingdom in the British war effort against the Nazis). On August 27, Rivers won the Democratic primary election by running up a huge margin in the counties outside of Charleston, which offset his loss in Charleston County. In those days, victory in the Democratic primary was tantamount to election in South Carolina, and Rivers took office on January 3, 1941. Making good on his pro-British campaign rhetoric, Rivers voted in favor of the first Lend Lease Act in 1941 to lend material military aid to the British Army and Royal Navy, as well as food aid for British soldiers and civilians. He then voted to extend the lend lease act in 1944.

==Congressional career==

===Domestic legislation===
Once in Congress, Rivers sought a seat on the Agriculture committee, but it was full and he was instead placed on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries committee. In March, he was appointed to the Naval Affairs committee which was later combined with the Military Affairs committee to form the House Armed Services Committee. His first legislative success was in 1942 when he authored a bill to build an oil pipeline from Mississippi to the Southeast coast to reduce the transportation costs of the product. The bill was passed by Congress and signed by President Roosevelt, but Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes refused to construct the pipeline because of the opposition by Big Oil.

Rivers&#x27;s first major success was the repeal of the federal tax on colored oleomargarine. The tax was first implemented because margarine was a much cheaper substitute of butter which threatened the interests of the dairy farmers. When Rivers first introduced the bill in 1944 to repeal the tax, it was vigorously opposed by Midwestern Representatives and the bill died in the agriculture committee. Undeterred, Rivers reintroduced the bill every year and made so many speeches in favor of the repeal of the tax that he was nicknamed &quot;Oleo&quot; Rivers. In 1949, he circulated a petition in the House to force the bill out of the agriculture committee and to the full House for a vote. The bill passed the House and then the Senate and was signed into law by President Truman in 1950. The manufacturers of margarine were forever grateful to Rivers and sent him complimentary boxes of oleo until the day he died.

===Views regarding race===
Like most South Carolinian Democrats from his era, Rivers, who became of member of the Citizens&#x27; Councils, was an ardent segregationist. Rivers and the entire South Carolina delegation signed the Southern Manifesto in 1956. Rivers voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Rivers attempted to have Charleston federal district court judge J. Waties Waring impeached for having ruled that blacks had to be allowed to vote in the Democratic primary and that segregated schools were unconstitutional. In South Carolina in the 1940s the Democratic Party had all-white primary elections, which was contested in the court case &quot;Elmore v. Rice&quot; where George Elmore was represented by Harold Boulware and Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP. Judge Waring ruled in favor of Elmore in 1947, but the ruling was rebuffed by South Carolina outside of Richland County. In a second case &quot;Brown v. Baskin&quot; (1948), Judge Waring once again ruled that the South Carolina Democratic Party must hold primaries that are &quot;freely open to all parties... without discrimination of race, color or creed.&quot; Judge Waring was eventually forced to leave South Carolina after his dissenting opinion in &quot;Briggs v. Elliot&quot; (1951), which challenged segregation in public schools, eventually becoming one of five cases that was seen by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Despite Rivers&#x27; fundraising campaign against him, Judge Waring was not impeached, but he eventually moved to New York to continue his work as a federal judge where he died in 1968. Judge Waring was buried in Magnolia Cemetery on Meeting Street in Charleston and his funeral was attended by more than 200 blacks and less than a dozen whites. When President Truman integrated the U.S. Army in 1948, Rivers called him a &quot;dead chicken&quot; and a &quot;bankrupt politician&quot;. Rivers was so incensed by Truman that he supported Strom Thurmond in the 1948 Presidential election. After Truman&#x27;s victory, he lost his patronage privileges and was lucky to retain his seat on the Armed Services Committee.

Rivers attended the 1952 Democratic National Convention and believed that Adlai Stevenson would reverse the policies of Truman by returning to traditional Democratic principles. However, Rivers became disillusioned with Stevenson and he openly supported Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 Presidential election because he said that he would be sensitive to Southern concerns. Rivers&#x27;s long-held distrust of Republicans was reinforced shortly after Eisenhower became president when he ordered the desegregation of all schools on military bases and did not grant Rivers patronage privileges, despite Rivers being the only Democrat to support Eisenhower in 1952. Eisenhower&#x27;s continual push for integration infuriated Rivers. When asked if he would back Eisenhower again in 1956, Rivers later claimed to have responded &quot;Hell no! Ain&#x27;t no education in the second kick of a mule.&quot;

In the 1960s, Rivers softened his vocal opposition to civil rights legislation. He had risen in the ranks and his power in the House depended upon the continual support of national Democrats. Rivers shifted his approach from defending segregation to the maintenance of law and order. He found a kindred spirit in George Wallace and he attended one of Wallace&#x27;s fundraising dinners in 1968. Wallace asked Rivers in July to be his running mate for the 1968 Presidential election, but Rivers dared not risk losing his chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee and declined the offer.

===House Armed Services Chairman===

Rivers became the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in 1965 following the retirement of Carl Vinson. Upon moving into the Rayburn House Office Building, Rivers placed a plaque of Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution that specified the role of the legislative process with the military. He felt that the Congress should not delegate its powers to the President nor the Secretary of Defense, and that a vigorous Congress would make the President perform his job better. As Rivers inspected the committee room, he became incensed when he discovered there were cloakrooms adjoining the chamber for use by Democratic and Republican Party members to discuss their strategies. Viewing national defense as a non-partisan issue, Rivers had the cloakrooms turned into offices.

By the time Rivers became the chairman, he was well known for being a strong supporter of the American military in general, and of enlisted military service members in particular. In 1963 he established, through the vehicle of the House–Senate Conference Committee, the principle of linking military retired pay to increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), similar to the practice for retired federal civil servants. In 1964 he championed the cause of &quot;hospital rights,&quot; guaranteeing medical care in military hospitals for military retirees and their dependents.

After becoming chairman, in 1965 he helped secure the first military pay raise since 1952, despite opposition from the Secretary of Defense McNamara and President Johnson. Rivers was instrumental in establishing the additional enlisted pay grade of E-9, and he helped secure mobile home allowances and cheap air fares for soldiers returning from Vietnam.

Rivers strongly supported the constant upgrading of US military preparedness, regardless of the cost. He supported making all US Navy ships nuclear powered, and he championed development of the US Air Force&#x27;s C-5A Galaxy military airlift jet, despite huge cost overruns. In his last speech to his colleagues in the US House of Representatives on December 7, 1970, delivered just before he departed for Birmingham, Alabama to have heart surgery, he stated, &quot;While we debate the question of maintaining our military capability, the Soviet Union forges ahead. We seem hell-bent on national suicide...We cannot as a nation afford to spend one penny less on national defense than that amount which is required to insure that you and I, and our children, can convince the Soviets they dare not pull the trigger when a Soviet gun is placed against our heads.&quot;

In that same speech, he delivered the quote for which he is best remembered: &quot;The final measure of our ability to survive as a nation in a hostile world will not be how well we have managed our domestic resources and domestic programs, but whether or not we have avoided and frustrated the forces of evil which would draw us into the crucible of war with the Soviet Union. If we fail in that endeavor, we will have failed in everything.&quot;

===Vietnam War, and cover-up of Mỹ Lai Massacre===
Rivers was initially skeptical of the administration&#x27;s escalation of the Vietnam War and its decision to send combat troops to Vietnam, but later became one of the strongest Congressional supporters of the war. He enjoyed referring to himself as &quot;The Granddaddy of the War Hawks.&quot; He urged the President to use nuclear weapons against the North Vietnamese and to invade and occupy Hanoi, and once said that the United States should &quot;flatten Hanoi and tell world opinion to go fly a kite.&quot;

During a Congressional investigation of the 1968 Mỹ Lai Massacre, Rivers criticized Army helicopter pilot CW2 (later Major) Hugh Thompson, Jr. for giving the order to his men to fire upon American soldiers at Mỹ Lai if they continued to shoot unarmed Vietnamese civilians, calling him a traitor and saying he should be prosecuted. Rivers was unable to believe that American soldiers would do such a thing and denied that any massacre ever happened. He attempted to protect Army 2nd Lt. William Calley, later convicted of 22 killings at Mỹ Lai, by quickly holding hearings of his subcommittee on Mỹ Lai. He called every major witness to the event (including Thompson) before the subcommittee, and then refused to release the transcripts of the testimony. This meant that military prosecutors would be prohibited from calling those persons as witnesses at Calley&#x27;s court martial. For this, Rivers is remembered as a Congressman who tried to cover up a massacre in the Vietnam war and court-martial the man who stopped it.

==Death and burial==

In November 1970, Rivers was elected to his 16th term in Congress. He died of heart failure in Birmingham, Alabama, on December 28, 1970. It was 17 days after he had undergone surgery to replace a leaking mitral valve at the University of Alabama Hospital. He was buried at St. Stephen Episcopal Church Cemetery in St. Stephen, South Carolina.

==Personal life==
Rivers married Margaret Middleton (called Marguerite by Mendel, but Marwee by family and friends) on September 1, 1938. They had first met in 1930 at Camp Kanuga, near Hendersonville, North Carolina. Mendel had impressed Marwee by being elected Best Boy Camper, although he was a 24-year-old law student. The couple had three children: Peggy in 1939, Marion in 1943, and Mendel Jr. in 1947.

Rivers belonged to the Episcopal Church. In fraternal societies, he was a member of the Freemasons (Landmark Lodge No. 76, A.F.M.), the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and the Exchange Club. He was an enthusiast of boxing, and was friends with both Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney. He enjoyed playing baseball and he batted well over .300 in the Congressional Baseball Games.

According to journalists, Rivers struggled with alcoholism for much of his life. He was said to be the &quot;binger&quot; variety of alcoholic, one who is generally sober but relapses periodically. Washington syndicated columnist Drew Pearson called him a &quot;security risk&quot; because of this. He devoted eight pages to Rivers in his book &quot;The Case Against Congress&quot; (1968).

==Honors==
*In 1948, a stretch of highway, from the crossing of U.S. Route 78 over Meeting Street (known as the Five-Mile Viaduct) to where U.S. Route 52 meets the Berkeley County line, was named as Rivers Avenue. Rivers had been key in getting funds from Congress to pave it as the first four-lane road in North Charleston. 
*In 1964 the town of St. Stephen held a day-long celebration for Rivers, naming as Mendel Rivers Road the secondary road that ran from St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church to his childhood home.
*In 1964 a seven-story office building, located across Meeting Street from Marion Square, was informally named the L. Mendel Rivers Federal Building. It was later adapted as a hotel. 
*The L. Mendel Rivers Elementary School in Altus, Oklahoma was named for Rivers because he prevented the Altus Air Force Base from being closed. 
*Charleston Southern University honored Rivers&#x27;s support of the institution by naming its college library as the L. Mendel Rivers Library in October 1970.
*US soldiers referred to a road in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam as called the Mendel Rivers Parkway. Soldiers gave Rivers a captured Viet Cong carbine that he prominently displayed in his office. For obtaining reduced air fares for soldiers on furlough, they gave him a cap with six stars and &quot;The Big Boss&quot; inscribed on it, indicating that Rivers outranked all military officials.
*After his death, in 1971 the Navy honored him by naming a submarine USS &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; (SSN-686). 
*Friends of Rivers raised funds to create a small park in downtown Charleston and commissioned a bust of him to be placed adjacent to the O.T. Wallace County Office Building. 
*Rivers was named as one of the &quot;Magnificent Ten Charlestonians Who Shaped the 20th Century&quot; by &quot;Charleston Magazine&quot; in December 1999 for his success in expanding the military in his congressional district.

<doc id="962772" wikidata="Q1381003" url="?curid=962772" title="Rhys ap Tewdwr">
<text>Rhys ap Tewdwr (c. 1040 – 1093) was a king of Deheubarth in Wales and member of the Dinefwr dynasty, a branch descended from Rhodri the Great. Following the Norman Conquest, he had to pay William the Conqueror to keep his kingdom, which lasted until the end of William&#x27;s reign.

==Family==
Rhys ap Tewdwr was born in the area which is now Carmarthenshire. As a member of the House of Dinefwr, he claimed the throne of Deheubarth following the death of his second cousin Rhys ab Owain, who was beheaded after the battle of Gwdig (modern day Goodwick) against Caradog ap Gruffydd in 1078.

He was a grandson of Cadell ab Einion ab Owain ab Hywel Dda and a great-grandson of Einion ab Owain, thus a descendant of Hywel Dda, king of the Britons.

He married more than once. His first wife was Catrin (or Gwladus) verch Iestyn (b. 1041 in Powys). The name of his last wife was Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon, daughter of Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of the Mathrafal Dynasty of Powys.

Issue by early alliances:
* Goronwy (died 1103)
* Hywel
* Owain

Issue by Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon:

* Gruffydd
* Gwellian
* Nest who married Gerald de Windsor, Constable of Pembroke, progenitors of the FitzGerald and de Barry dynasties of Ireland. These Hiberno-Norman, or Cambro-Norman, families have been Peers of Ireland since at least the 14th century.
* Efa
* Ardden.

==Rule==

In 1081 Caradog ap Gruffydd invaded Deheubarth and drove Rhys to seek sanctuary in the St David&#x27;s Cathedral.

Rhys, however, made an alliance with Gruffudd ap Cynan who was seeking to regain the throne of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and at the Battle of Mynydd Carn in the same year they defeated and killed Caradog ap Gruffydd and his allies Trahaearn ap Caradog of Gwynedd and Meilyr ap Rhiwallon.

The same year William the Conqueror visited Deheubarth, ostensibly on a pilgrimage to St David&#x27;s, but with a major show of power as well, traversing the width of southern Wales, and it seems likely he came to an arrangement with Rhys, whereby Rhys paid him homage and was confirmed in possession of Deheubarth. Rhys paid William £40 a year for his kingdom, ensuring good future relations with William that lasted until the end of William&#x27;s lifetime. Rhys was content with the arrangement as it meant that he had to deal only with the jealousy of his fellow Welsh princes.

In 1088 Cadwgan ap Bleddyn of Powys attacked Deheubarth and forced Rhys to flee to Ireland. However, Rhys returned later the same year with a fleet from Ireland and defeated the men of Powys, in a battle in which two of Cadwgan&#x27;s brothers, Madog and Rhiryd, were killed.

The Chronicle of the Princes claims that Cedifor ap Gollwyn, a man who traced his ancestry to the original kings of Dyfed (since the start of the previous century, the usual rulers of Deheubarth had descended from an invader, Cadell ap Rhodri)), commanded substantial authority in Dyfed. When Cedifor died in 1091, his sons demanded that Rhys surrender the throne to Gruffudd ap Maredudd, the son of a former king of Deheubarth (and the nephew of Rhys&#x27; predecessor). This triggered a revolt, but Rhys was able to defeat the rebels in a battle at St. Dogmaels, killing Gruffudd.

==Death and succession==

Rhys was unable to withstand the increasing Norman pressure. The Welsh &quot;Bruts&quot; (chronicles) state that &quot;Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth, was slain by the Frenchmen who were inhabiting Brycheiniog.&quot; The &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; adds &quot;and with him fell the kingdom of the Britons.&quot; This passage lends evidence to the belief that the conquest of Brycheiniog (Brecon), led by Bernard de Neufmarche, was mostly finished by Eastertide 1093. The battle of Brecon opened the way to the conquest of Deheubarth.

The monastery and village of Penrhys in Rhondda Cynon Taff is said to be named for Rhys, as he was beheaded at the site by Norman forces. The village was originally named, &quot;Pen-Rhys ap Tewdwr&quot; (English: Rhys ap Tewdwr&#x27;s Head). Upon Rhys&#x27;s death, the Normans seized much of south Wales, and there was fighting over the spoils with the chieftains of Powys and Gwynedd. Eventually, Rhys&#x27;s eldest son, Gruffydd, was allowed to inherit a small portion of his father&#x27;s kingdom. Rhys&#x27;s daughter Nest was briefly one of the numerous concubines of Henry I, to whom she bore a son, and thereafter the wife of Gerald FitzWalter of Pembroke; their sons and grandsons, the FitzGerald conquerors of Ireland, were known collectively as the &quot;sons of Nest&quot;. Through his son Gruffydd, Rhys was an ancestor of the Tudor dynasty.

<text>USS &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; (SSN-686), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine in commission from 1975 to 2001, is the only ship of the United States Navy thus far to have been named for L. Mendel Rivers (1905–1970), a U.S. Representative from South Carolina″s 1st Congressional District (1941–1970).

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 1 July 1969 and her keel was laid down there on 26 June 1971. She was launched on 2 June 1973, sponsored by L. Mendel Rivers″ two daughters, Margaret Rivers Eastman and Marion Rivers, and commissioned on 21 December 1974. 

==Service history==

Her first deployment was to the Mediterranean Sea from January through July 1976. Between 1976 and 1995, she mainly patrolled the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. Additionally, she did three tours within the Arctic Circle and one to the North Pole.

During the 1990s, &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; was fitted with a dry-deck shelter which contained a hyperbaric chamber, airlock, and vehicle hangar that allowed her to deploy SEAL Delivery Vehicles.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; was decommissioned on 10 May 2001 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 19 July 2002.

==Commemoration==
&quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot;″ ship″s plaque is on display at the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. the &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot;″ ship″s patch is on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, with the patches of all Sturgeon-class attack submarine.

==In popular culture==
Archive footage of the vessel was used in the TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;&#x27;s Season Six opener &quot;Sharks&quot;.

USS &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot; is one of the playable Sturgeon-class submarines in the 2017 video game &quot;Cold Waters&quot;.

<text>Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born March 24, 1967) is an American journalist. He is the tenth child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, named in honor of W. Averell Harriman, a family friend and former governor of New York.

==Life and career==
Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., a year before his father&#x27;s assassination. He married Molly Elizabeth Stark on August 22, 1998, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. They have five children.

Kennedy graduated from Georgetown Preparatory School and Brown University and began his career as a print journalist with &quot;The Nantucket Beacon&quot; and later &quot;The New York Post&quot;. As an investigative reporter for the Post, Kennedy obtained the first interview with the officer who arrested Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh and broke numerous other health care and metropolitan area stories.

He joined Fox News Channel as a general assignment reporter in August 1996 and hosts a bi-weekly program on the network, &quot;Douglas Kennedy&#x27;s American Stories&quot;. While at Fox News, he covered the Presidential elections of 1996, 2000, and 2004, as well as Hurricane Katrina.

In 2006, while working as a correspondent for the Fox News show &quot;The Big Story&quot;, he commented on the controversy over whether the film of &quot;Crocodile Hunter&quot; Steve Irwin&#x27;s last moments should be shown, noting that he and his siblings &quot;had to grow up with&quot; repeatedly seeing broadcasts and video clips of Kennedy&#x27;s own father&#x27;s death. He said that in Irwin&#x27;s case, it would be really &quot;unnecessary and in very poor taste.&quot;

On November 20, 2012, Kennedy was acquitted of misdemeanor physical harassment and child endangerment charges in connection with a January 7, 2012, altercation with two nurses at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, two days after his son, Anthony Boru, was born there. Kennedy attempted to take his infant off the maternity ward for some fresh air, which two nurses said was against hospital policy, and who claimed that he assaulted them when they tried to stop him from doing so. Kennedy was separately investigated by New York child welfare authorities following the incident, but social workers found no signs of child abuse in his home and declared the allegations unfounded in March 2012.

<text>Frank Farmer Loomis Jr. (August 22, 1896 – April 4, 1971) was an American athlete, winner of 400 m hurdles at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. His brother, Jo Gilbert Loomis, was a substitute sprinter at the same Olympics.

Loomis went to school in Evanston until 1914. Upon meeting his future Oregon High School teammate Sherman Landers, he transferred to Oregon, Illinois, to continue training with him. Together, they began a rise that would take them to the 1920 Olympic Games. Although Loomis was an AAU champion in hurdles in 1917 and 1918 and in hurdles in 1920, the main favorite in Antwerp was John Norton, who had run a new world record of 54.2 just two months before the Olympics. Despite that, Loomis won the 400 m hurdles final easily in a new world record of 54.0, beating Norton to second place by 0.6 seconds.

Landers-Loomis Field in Oregon, Illinois, is named partially in his honor.

<text>Manuel dos Reis Machado, commonly called Mestre Bimba (; November 23, 1900 – February 5, 1974), was a Brazilian capoeira &quot;mestre&quot; and the founder of the &quot;capoeira regional&quot; style. Bimba was one of the best capoeiristas of his time, undefeated in numerous public challenges against fighters from various martial arts.

Bimba came from capoeira Angola, and taught Angola style. He reformed capoeira primarily in response to Burlamaqui and Sinhôzinho&#x27;s attempts to strip it of music and African traditions, and transform it into a mere set of bodily techniques. On the other hand, he was unsatisfied with capoeira Angola of his time, because of its emphasis on rituals and ineffective kicks. 

Bimba encouraged adding new kicks to capoeira, as long as they were effective and incorporated into the basic footwork, &quot;ginga&quot;. In declaration of his style in 1936, Bimba claimed to have subtracted two and added 15 kicks to traditional capoeira. Later, this number rose to 52 techniques from various arts. &quot;Martelo&quot; and &quot;queixada&quot; kicks, introduced by Bimba, became hallmarks of the Regional style.

Sequences of predetermined movements as a teaching method was one of the major innovations of Bimba. Another key innovations was teaching capoeira to a broader audience, which helped spread the art to different social groups and ultimately contributed to its decriminalization.

Bimba was also an excellent singer and berimbau player.

==Early life==

Manoel dos Reis Machado was born on 23 November 1900 (according to Assunção) or 1899 (according to Almeida) in the neighbourhood of Engenho Velho, in Salvador.

The son of Luiz Cândido Machado and Maria Martinha do Bonfim, Machado was born at the Bairro do Engenho Velho, Salvador. The nickname &quot;Bimba&quot;, whose literal meaning was &quot;phallus&quot;, came up as a result of a bet between his mother and the midwife during his birth. His mother bet that he was going to be a girl and the midwife bet he would be a boy; after he was delivered, the midwife revealed that he was a boy by pointing between his legs at his &quot;bimba&quot;. In the context of Brazil, &quot;Bimba&quot; also meant &quot;beating&quot;.

He started learning capoeira when he was 12 years old, with an African boat commander called Bentinho. As a young man, he had the nickname Três Pancadas, meaning &quot;three blows&quot;, because this was said to be the number of his punches necessary to knock down an opponent.

== Birth of the &quot;regional&quot; style ==
At 18, Bimba felt that capoeira had lost all its efficacy as a martial art and an instrument of resistance, becoming a folkloric activity reduced to nine movements. It was then that Bimba started to restore movements from the old capoeira (later known as Angola), added movements from an extinct African fighting style called batuque – a type of martial art that he learned from his father (of which his father was a champion), as well as introducing movements created by himself. Bimba was the first to create a method of teaching to help facilitate learning because, until then, capoeira was only learned by watching and participating in the roda. Bimba first named his style Luta Regional de Bahia (Regional Fight of Bahia), which was later simplified to &quot;capoeira regional&quot;.

It also has been theorized that Bimba received influence by other martial arts when adding and perfecting movements to the capoeira repertoire. He is known to have studied the method of capoeira teachers like Mestre Sinhozinho, Mario Aleixo and Anibal &quot;Zuma&quot; Burlamaqui, who mixed capoeira with martial arts like judo, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling and Portuguese stick-fighting. He also practiced capoeira in boxing matches, and was able to win by doing so. Other sources, among them Mestre Itapoan, believe that Bimba made virtually no additions from other martial arts to capoeira, and that all its movements came from batuque or itself; moreover, there are reports of capoeira techniques similar to those from judo as far back as 1888, before Eastern martial arts came to Brazil. On the other hand, it is known that Bimba&#x27;s student Cisnando Lima was trained in judo under Mitsuyo Maeda and Takeo Yano, and that other students sometimes faced Japanese martial artists in fights.

In 1928, a new chapter in the history of capoeira began, as well as a change in the way black people were looked upon by the Brazilian society. After a performance at the palace of Bahia&#x27;s Governor, Juracy Magalhães, Bimba was finally successful in convincing the authorities of the cultural value of capoeira, thus in the 1930s ending its official ban, which had been in effect since 1890.&quot;

Machado founded the first capoeira school in 1932. This was called the &quot;Academia-escola de Cultura Regional&quot;, at the Engenho de Brotas in Salvador, Bahia. Previously, capoeira was only practiced and played on the streets. However, capoeira was still heavily discriminated against by upper-class Brazilian society. In order to change the pejorative reputation of capoeira and its practitioners as devious, stealthy and malicious, Bimba set new standards to the art.

His students had to wear a clean, white uniform, show proof of grade proficiency from school, exercise discipline, show good posture and many other standards. As a result, doctors, lawyers, politicians, upper-middle-class people, and women (until then excluded) started to join his school, providing Bimba with legitimacy and support. Bimba was not completely against accepting exceptionally poor students, but only when they showed talent or attitude.

It&#x27;s also known that Bimba tested his new students putting them in a strong &quot;gravata&quot; or neck lock for three minutes, only accepting them in his school if they endured said time without tapping out. However, after the entrance of his apprentice Cisnando Lima, he changed the initiation test to a demonstration of flexibility and a written examination.

== &quot;Capoeira regional&quot; is established ==
In 1936, Bimba challenged fighters of any martial art style to test his &quot;regional&quot; style in a fight, which would be hosted under the boxing-like ruleset innovated by fellow capoeirista Anibal Burlamaqui. He had four matches, fighting against Henrique Bahia, Vítor Benedito Lopes, Américo Ciência and fellow capoeira master José Custódio &quot;Zé I&quot; dos Santos. Bimba won all matches, and received the nickname of &quot;Três Pancadas&quot; (&quot;Three Hits&quot;), meaning he only need three strikes at most to finish an opponent.

Related to his challenges, Bimba had a famous rivalry with other mestres about whether it was valid or not to use hand strikes in the roda, especially after he finished an opponent named Vitor with a &quot;asfixiante&quot; or &quot;galopante&quot;. Machado&#x27;s main detractor, Lúcio &quot;Barra Preta&quot; de Tal, a police chief who had lost money with the result of the match, supposedly ambushed him on the Engenho Velho street in August 1936, carrying a gun and accompanied by six policemen armed with sabers. A scuffle broke out, only for Bimba to disarm and knock all the seven men senseless. According to Bimba, however, it wasn&#x27;t properly an ambush: the policemen would be drunk and causing turmoil, and Bimba interfered in order to help a young boy they were attacking, starting the brawl only after receiving himself a saber attack that he had to employ his skill to dodge. The newspaper &quot;A Tarde&quot; covered the incident under the title of &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to catch a capoeirista! He defended himself using &quot;cabeçadas&quot; and &quot;rabos de arraia&quot;&quot; (&quot;Não é fácil pegar um capoeirista... Livrou-se da agressão com cabeçadas e rabos de arraia&quot;).

On June 9, 1937, he earned the state board of education certificate and officially registered the first Capoeira center.

Bimba&#x27;s Capoeira Regional academy was geographically near Mestre Pastinha&#x27;s Capoeira Angola school. While it is known that the two mestres respected each other and never talked bad about the other&#x27;s school, according to mestres Atenilo and Itapoan, Bimba sometimes instructed his students to hit and injure Pastinha&#x27;s in shared &quot;rodas&quot;.

In 1942, Machado opened his second school at the &quot;Terreiro de Jesus&quot; on &quot;Rua das Laranjeiras&quot;. The school is still open today and was supervised by his former student, &quot;Vermelho&quot; until the early 1980s. The school then came under the brief supervision of Mestre Almiro, before being transferred to Mestre Bamba; the man who leads the school today. He also taught capoeira to the army and at the police academy. He was then considered &quot;the father of modern capoeira&quot;.

In 1945, Bimba and his students were challenged by Jayme Ferreira, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitor trained by the Gracie family, who accused regional capoeiristas of avoiding fights. Bimba answered by saying capoeira regional was for self-defense, not for fighting under sport rules.

In 1949, the regional school toured São Paulo in order to show their art. However, their promoter would force them to work full exhibition matches (&quot;marmeladas&quot;, a word also used for professional wrestling), which Mestre Bimba didn&#x27;t approve of. During this tour, they received two challenges to fight for real (&quot;pra valer&quot;), one by Brazilian catch wrestlers led by Piragibe and another one by &quot;capoeira carioca&quot; leader Mestre Sinhozinho. A two day event was held in Rio de Janeiro starting from April 2, pitting a team of capoeiristas regionales against cariocas and catch wrestlers. Bimba&#x27;s school lost all the matches by either submission or knockout, with the main event being with his student Jurandir being defeated by carioca Luiz &quot;Cirandinha&quot; Aguiar. The final part was held on April 7, getting a similar result with carioca Rudolf Hermanny winning over regionalista Fernando Perez. It&#x27;s said Bimba was so impressed that he learned some movements he saw in the fight to absorb them into his own style.

July 23, 1953, he was invited to demonstrate capoeira to the then president of Brazil, Getúlio Dorneles Vargas. Vargas says, &quot;Capoeira is the only sport which was truly Brazilian.&quot;

Important names to Brazilian society at that time such as Dr. Joaquim de Araújo Lima (former governor of Guaporé), Jaime Tavares, Rui Gouveia, Alberto Barreto, Jaime Machado, Delsimar Cavalvanti, César Sá, Decio Seabra, José Sisnando and many others were Bimba&#x27;s students.

== Legacy ==

Unhappy with false promises and lack of support from local authorities in Bahia, he moved to Goiânia in 1973 at the invitation of a former student. He died a year later, on February 5, 1974, at the Hospital das Clínicas de Goiânia because of a stroke.

Bimba managed to recover the original values within capoeira, which were used amongst the black slaves centuries before him. For Bimba, capoeira was a fight but &quot;competition&quot; should be permanently avoided since he believed it was a &quot;cooperation&quot; fight, where the stronger player was always responsible for the weaker player and helped him to excel in his own fighting techniques.

Machado fought all his life for what he strongly believed was best for capoeira and succeeded. Machado was posthumously awarded the title &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; by the Federal University of Bahia.

As of 2023, Bimba&#x27;s son, Mestre Nenel, continues to teach capoeira in his father&#x27;s style in Bahia.

=== Academy rules ===

Bimba strongly believed capoeira had an extraordinary value as a self-defense martial art, hence his efforts to develop its learning in a structured and methodical way.

Bimba developed a capoeira teaching method with commandments, principles and traditions, which are still part of the &quot;capoeira regional&quot; up to this day. Some of his commandments are:

* To stop smoking and drinking since it interferes with the players&#x27; performance
* Avoid demonstrating your progress to your friends outside the capoeira roda. Remember that surprise is your best ally in a fight
* Avoid conversation during training, instead observe and learn from watching
* Always ginga
* Practice daily the basic fundamentals
* Keep your body relaxed
* It is better to get &quot;caught&quot; in the &quot;roda&quot; than on the streets
* Don&#x27;t be afraid to get close to the opponent. The closer you stay, the better you will learn
* Students must maintain good grades in school or be employed

Bimba also established his own capoeira principles as the basis for his capoeira teaching method:

* &quot;Gingar sempre&quot; (to keep oneself in constant movement when fighting); &quot;ginga&quot; is the capoeira basic movement
* &quot;Esquivar sempre&quot; (to dodge away from the opponent&#x27;s attacks)
* All movements must have a purpose (attack and corresponding defense movement)
* Preserve a constant fixed position on the ground (acrobatic jumps makes one vulnerable)
* Play according to the rhythm determined by the &quot;berimbau&quot; (capoeira musical instrument)
* Always play close to your partner
* Respect a player when he/she can no longer defend an attack movement
* Protect the opponent&#x27;s physical and moral integrity (during the practice, the stronger will protect the weaker player)

Consequently, Bimba created several traditions and rituals to support his methodology:

* A chair was used in order to train beginner students/players
* The &quot;charanga&quot; is the capoeira orchestra, composed by a &quot;berimbau&quot; and two &quot;pandeiros&quot;
* The singing (&quot;quadras e corridos&quot;), songs composed by Bimba to accompany the game
* The &quot;batizado&quot; (baptism), the first time the student plays capoeira at the sound of &quot;berimbau&quot;

The aspects that still makes &quot;capoeira regional&quot; unique is its method:

* Admission exam (physical test made with capoeira movements to identify students&#x27; abilities)
* The &quot;sequência&quot; (sequence) of the basic 17 capoeira attack and defence movements
* Practice of the different rhythms of the game
* Specific movements: traumatizing, projection, connected and unbalancing
* Practice of &quot;cintura desprezada&quot; (second sequence practice by advanced students)
* &quot;Formatura&quot; (capoeira teacher graduation)
* &quot;Especialização&quot; and &quot;emboscada&quot; (specific advanced exams)

To celebrate his 119th birthday, Google released a Google Doodle commemorating him.

<text>The glycemic response (or glycaemic response) to a food or meal is the effect that food or meal has on blood sugar (glucose) levels after consumption. It is normal for blood glucose and insulin levels to rise after eating and then return again to fasting levels over a short period of time. This is particularly so after consumption of meals rich in certain carbohydrates. Glycemic management refers to the selection of foods to manage your blood sugar levels.

Several tools have been developed to help quantify and communicate the effect of food on glycemic response. These include glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL) and glycemic glucose equivalents (GGE). A comparative glycemic response can also be determined, which compares the impact on blood glucose of one food to another based upon their total carbohydrate or total quantity.

In 1981, the idea of classifying carbohydrates according to their Glycemic Index was first published. Since then, many studies have been undertaken to determine the impact of altering the blood glucose-raising potential (glycemic challenge) of the diet on a wide range of short- and long-term health outcomes. However, evaluating the impact of a single dietary change on health is notoriously complex, and opinions on the relevance of GI, GL and GGE have been divided. There are many different ways of lowering glycemic response, GI or GL, not all of which have the same effects on health. ILSI Europe published a monograph in November 2011 titled &quot;Food, Glycaemic Response and Health&quot;, which concluded that &quot;it is becoming evident that modifying the glycemic response of the diet should not be seen as a stand-alone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle&quot;.

A low glycemic food will release glucose more slowly and steadily, which leads to lower postprandial (after meal) blood glucose readings. A high glycemic food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose levels after meals. High glycemic foods are ideal for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia.

The glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of starch (amylose versus amylopectin), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal — adding vinegar, for example, will lower the glycemic response. The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the glycemic response. In general, foods with higher amounts of fiber and/or resistant starch have a lower glycemic response. 

While adding fat or protein will lower the glycemic response to a meal, the relative differences remain. That is, with or without additions, there is still a higher blood glucose curve after a high glycemic white bread than after a low glycemic bread such as pumpernickel.

Unrefined wild plant foods like those available to contemporary foragers typically exhibit low glycemic indices.

<doc id="962799" wikidata="Q1275794" url="?curid=962799" title="Isuzu Aska">
<text>The Isuzu Aska was a nameplate used by Isuzu of Japan to denote its mid-size sedans from 1983 to 2002. Originally the Aska was a version of General Motors&#x27; J-car produced by Isuzu, but after Isuzu pulled out of manufacturing passenger cars the nameplate was applied to rebadged versions of the Subaru Legacy (1990 to 1993) and Honda Accord (1994 to 2002) sold through Isuzu&#x27;s Japanese distribution network.

The Aska replaced the Isuzu Florian in Isuzu&#x27;s lineup and was discontinued in 2002 without a replacement.

The name comes from the Japanese word, &quot;Asuka&quot;, which is the old name of the Asuka Village in the Nara Prefecture of Japan. Because the name &quot;Asuka&quot; is likely to be mispronounced in foreign countries, the &quot;u&quot; was taken away from the name, presenting the model as the &quot;Aska&quot;.

==First generation (1983–1989)==
The original Aska was developed as a part of GM&#x27;s &quot;J-car&quot; program and was a replacement for Isuzu&#x27;s dated Florian. In contrast to fellow J-cars from other GM divisions, the Aska only came in one body style, a four-door sedan (the station wagon body style on the Florian was always relatively unpopular). The Isuzu J-car variant differed most notably in the rear styling from other J-car variants. From 1983 to 1984, the Aska was known as the &quot;Florian Aska&quot;, before being renamed simply &quot;Aska&quot; in 1985.
The car was launched in March 1983 with carburetted 1.8 and 2.0 litre gasoline engines and a diesel, going on sale a month later. In August 1983 the Turbodiesel followed, with . In October 1983, a turbocharged and fuel injected version of the 2.0 litre engine, which developed 150 PS, joined the lineup as the LJ Turbo. In November 1985 a version branded by the German tuner Irmscher (specializing in Opels, they cooperated with Isuzu on some other models as well), this version featured a distinctive body kit and became somewhat of a cult object among some car fans in Japan.

In September 1984 the innovative (but ultimately unsuccessful) semi-automatic NAVi5 system became available for the naturally-aspirated Aska 2.0. This was an automated manual transmission with an electronically-operated clutch, long before Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Selespeed. In March 1985 the diesel also became available with the NAVi5 transmission, and from September 1986 the LG Turbodiesel was also available with it. The Aska underwent a very subtle facelift in July 1985, which was also when the &quot;Florian&quot; portion of the car&#x27;s name was dropped.

The first generation Aska was discontinued in March 1989; production totaled 108,512 cars. Isuzu did not have a contender in this segment for about a year&#x27;s time until the second generation Aska was presented.

===Export markets===

From 1984, the Aska was assembled in Arica, Chile from CKD kits and sold as Chevrolet Aska in the Chilean domestic market and in Ecuador. Chilean Askas came in three equipment levels (LT, Limited, and Deluxe), with two engines and either automatic or five-speed manual transmissions. While the two lesser versions both received a 1.8-litre coupled to the five-speed, the Deluxe got the larger 2-litre with , only fitted with the automatic transmission.
The Aska was exported to Southeast Asia, where it was known as the Isuzu JJ, and to New Zealand as the Holden Camira (JJ) between 1984 and 1987, in lieu of the JD Camira, manufactured in Australia because the previous Australian-sourced JB Camira fared badly in the New Zealand market (nonetheless, the JD series wagon was imported concurrently from Australia). General Motors New Zealand switched back to the updated Australian version (JE) in 1987 due to the strengthening of Japanese Yen. In Indonesia, the two-liter version with was briefly sold as the &quot;Holden Aska&quot; alongside the 1.6-liter Camira.

==Second generation (1990–1993)==

With the exception of the American market, the J platform did not continue into the 1990s. Not having the resources to develop a mid-size car on their own, Isuzu forged a short-lived alliance with Subaru. This provided for Isuzu to supply Subaru with Isuzu Bighorns (rebadged as the Subaru Bighorn), while Isuzu rebadged Subaru&#x27;s mid-size Legacy sedan as the Isuzu Aska, beginning in June 1990. Both rebadged models were sold only in the Japanese market. There was also a Subaru Leone Van version briefly available, badged as the Isuzu Geminett II.

The EJ series engine was offered in both 1.8 and 2.0 liter displacements. The engine has either single or double overhead camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers.
The 2.0 liter fuel delivery was managed with sequential multiport fuel injection, and the 1.8 liter engine used a modified fuel delivery system with single point throttle body fuel injection called SPFI. The DOHC 2.0 liter non turbocharged engine had a dual stage intake manifold.

The 2.0 liter vehicle came optional with Subaru&#x27;s AWD system while the 1.8 came with FWD only. As with all other Askas, this was only ever available with four-door saloon bodywork. The Aska was discontinued in May 1993, as the Subaru deal came to an end.


==Third generation (1994–1997)==

Later, Isuzu entered a more substantial model-exchange alliance with Honda. Among other models, it encompassed the rebadging of the Honda Accord sedan as the Isuzu Aska. This model was presented in March 1994, after stock of the Legacy-based, previous generation Aska had been sold out. The only difference to the Accord was the grille and logos.

It was only offered with a two-liter four-cylinder engine, combined with a four-speed automatic transmission. The model code assigned to it by Isuzu was CJ1. Production came to an end in September 1997, with sales from stock continuing for another two months.

==Fourth generation (1998–2002) ==

Introduced in November 1997, this was the second generation of Accord-based Askas - thus the third generation Aska was the fifth generation Accord and the fourth was the sixth generation Accord sedan. The Aska remained a Japanese-only model and was discontinued in 2002. Model codes were CJ2 for the 1.8 and CJ3 for the 2.0. The engines produce respectively and both were available with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. The differences between this and the Accord were limited to the grille, logos, and wheels. One additional change was that the engine head cover had the Honda logo removed, with only &quot;VTEC&quot; remaining.

The fourth generation Aska received a light facelift in June 2000. This change included new bumpers, redesigned taillights, interior updates, and cleaner engines. Production ended in March 2002, with sales from stock continuing until September. This marked the end of Isuzu passenger car sales, 49 years after their first car was presented.

<text>Solid Rock Records is a record label started by Larry Norman. It was established in 1975 to distribute his work after he had been released by Capitol Records. Solid Rock had a distribution deal until 1980 with Word Records.

The label&#x27;s roster also included Randy Stonehill, Tom Howard, Mark Heard, Daniel Amos, Pantano &amp; Salsbury (formerly known as the J.C. Power Outlet), and Salvation Air Force. Norman worked with David Edwards, who released his debut album on Myrrh Records in 1980, as well as Steve Scott. Scott recorded one album, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, produced by Norman and Heard which was unreleased.

==History==
===Origins===
Strongly influenced by Christian philosopher Francis Schaeffer, Schaeffer&#x27;s community at L&#x27;Abri in Switzerland (which Norman had visited with his wife Pamela on his honeymoon in 1972), and &quot;possibly inspired by the Apple imprint of The Beatles&quot; in 1974, Norman founded Solid Rock Records to produce records for Christian artists who like himself, had &quot;no commercial value.&quot; He intended Solid Rock to be &quot;a &quot;musical L&#x27;Abri&quot;, and &quot;more than business though, it was community.&quot; &quot;Solid Rock became an important moment in the history of Christian rock music since it was the first truly artist-driven label&quot;. According to Norman, the purpose of Solid Rock was &quot;to help other artists who didn&#x27;t want to be consumed by the business of making vinyl pancakes but who wanted to make something &#x27;non-commercial&#x27; to the world&quot;. Solid Rock &quot;was a community of shared ideas and discussion. Artists worked on each other&#x27;s projects and even toured together. 

It seems to have been a place where they were trying to create art that would cross over. Larry Norman in particular had a desire to not simply create Christian music but music that was from a Christian worldview that would stand up in the mainstream and that people could accept and be challenged by&quot;. According to Solid Rock alumnus Tom Howard: &quot;We ate together, laughed together, cried together, travelled together. It wasn&#x27;t like a cult or anything; I mean we&#x27;d go off to our own families and our own pockets of friendships but there was definitely a sense of gathering among that small handful of artists&quot;. In addition to his own recordings, Larry Norman produced music for several artists on his Solid Rock label: Randy Stonehill, Mark Heard, Tom Howard, Pantano/Salsbury, and Salvation Air Force. Norman produced artists who were signed to other labels like Malcolm and Alwyn, Bobby Emmons and the Crosstones, and Lyrix. While Norman received production credits for two songs on Sheila Walsh&#x27;s first album &quot;Future Eyes&quot;, he remixed the songs which were already recorded. In 1977 he signed James Sundquist to Solid Rock, which produced some of the songs on Sundquist&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Flight&quot;, an album that blended ragtime and ballads which was later released by Pat Boone&#x27;s Lamb &amp; Lion label. About 1978 Norman produced an album, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, for British poet and musician Steve Scott which was never released.

===Daniel Amos (1978–1980)===
In December 1978 Norman signed Christian rock band Daniel Amos to Street Level Productions and also to his Street Level Artists Agency. Daniel Amos had almost completed &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot;, their third album, co-produced by Mike D. Stone, when under contract to Maranatha! Music. When Maranatha! released them, as it was changing direction to children&#x27;s and praise music, &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; still needed to be mixed. Norman asked the band to replace two songs, had the album mixed and took new photos of the band for the album&#x27;s cover to replace those he deemed too controversial for the Christian market, and in September 1979, Norman released a test pressing. In mid-May 1980 Norman released Daniel Amos from their management contract with Street Level Productions, resulting in an estrangement in their relationship. Just before the finalization of his divorce from Pamela Norman in August 1980, Norman performed at the Kamperland Youth for Christ Music festival (now the Flevo Totaal Festival) in Zeeland the Netherlands with Daniel Amos band backing him. Due to the laryngitis of Terry Scott Taylor, lead singer of Daniel Amos, Norman sang their songs from &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; with the rest of Daniel Amos backing him so that Daniel Amos could be paid.

====Solid Rock implosion (1980)====
At the Greenbelt Festival held a few days later, Daniel Amos refused to back Norman as previously agreed due to their unfolding legal action against Norman, forcing Norman to recruit another group of musicians. During that performance, Norman sang for the first time, &quot;May Your Feet Stay On The Path&quot;, as a beatific benediction to the Solid Rock artists he had released. He explained in 2001: &quot;It&#x27;s a song I wrote for all my artists because I wasn&#x27;t going to work with them any more. So I stayed up one night praying all night and working on this song asking God to help me bless the artists one more time so that they would know that I loved them even if I didn&#x27;t want to work with them&quot;. Despite being advertised as soon available in November 1979, &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; was not finally released by Solid Rock until April 10, 1981, ten days before the band&#x27;s follow-up &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, was released on NewPax Records. In 2000 Norman sang &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; on the Daniel Amos tribute album, &quot;When Worlds Collide: A Tribute to Daniel Amos&quot;.

===The end of Solid Rock===
====June 17, 1980 meeting====

In June 1980 the Solid Rock community imploded due to concerns about delays in releasing albums, royalties and publishing rights, and Norman&#x27;s personal life.
One of the areas of disagreement within Solid Rock was over their philosophy of ministry. The concerns of Stonehill, Taylor, and Howard in addition to other Solid Rock musicians led to an intervention on June 17, 1980 with Norman organized by Philip F. Mangano, the Solid Rock business manager. According to Rimmer, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; claims that &quot;it was at this memorable meeting that Norman, rather than bowing to the concerns of his fellow artists and the Solid Rock family, chose to strike out. With accusations against his co-workers, he began the process of winding up the Solid Rock operation and the dreams of the artistic community came crashing down.&quot;

====Winding down====
Norman and Mangano severed their business association, with Norman selling his interest in Street Level Artists Agency to Mangano, who subsequently resigned in October 1980 to start a new career in working to help the homeless. Mangano became the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness for seven years from March 2002,

By October 1981 Norman was still represented by Word and the only artist signed to Solid Rock. In a 1982 interview with British Christian musician Norman Miller, then Executive Director of Word Europe, Norman discussed both the original purpose for Solid Rock and its future:
I have very few plans for Solid Rock at all. Originally, I started Solid Rock as a way of helping other young artists become established. My plan has always been to provide them with an intense education, support their efforts with concerts and record production, and then graduate them into the mainstream where they can stand on their own feet. I&#x27;ve been able to get Randy Stonehill to the point where Myrrh Records has signed him directly, while others, like Mark Heard, Tom Howard, and Daniel Amos have all signed with different American companies like New Pax. I&#x27;ve helped about fifteen people get contracts so far, and all the old Solid Rock crowd has graduated and I&#x27;m working with new and younger artists now.

===Analysis &amp; Norman&#x27;s comments===
American Christian rock historian John J. Thompson identifies several factors in the collapse of Solid Rock, including possibly an over reliance on Norman&#x27;s celebrity; Norman&#x27;s confrontational lyrics and music, which alienated both the Christian and mainstream music industries; Norman&#x27;s over-commitment, including producing almost all of the Solid Rock albums, contributing songs, and singing backing vocals; and &quot;by releasing high-quality music by the best bands, Norman doomed his label to almost certain failure. He was simply way ahead of the curve&quot;. Additionally, the emergence of several punk-influenced Christian bands in the late 1970s, who &quot;cranked out music that made Larry Norman and Love Song look like antiques. Some of them even considered the members of Daniel Amos to be geezers&quot;.

American professor of religious history Randall Balmer believed that the causes of the demise of Solid Rock were &quot;Idealism, marital difficulties, and financial naivete—as well as changing musical tastes&quot;. Stonehill opined in 1994, &quot;As artistically heady as the days at Solid Rock were... and as good as the ideas were on paper, the business end was always very loose-knit... We were young guys with good ideas but not a whole lot of business sense&quot;. Norman acknowledged in a 1984 interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been really good in the business side of it. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with creativity but I&#x27;ve never had the business side of it together.&quot; In a 1998 letter to Randy Stonehill, Norman indicated: &quot;I DIDN&#x27;T DO IT RIGHT: You know I never cared about money, so it&#x27;s something I never worried about. &quot;Which was probably not helpful to running a record company and keeping track of everything to the artists&#x27; satisfaction&quot;... I couldn&#x27;t run the label without competent assistants. I trusted Philip [Mangano] to keep track of royalties, gave him an open checkbook, and never looked over his shoulder. I thought he was my other half. And Philip just wasn&#x27;t that man. He made a lot of money... and I&#x27;m sorry about your royalties, but I ran the musical side and Philip ran the business side&quot;.

Norman gave his rationale for the winding up of Solid Rock Records in a 1989 interview: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t run Solid Rock Records anymore because of my mental condition due to an accident, I couldn&#x27;t concentrate. I couldn&#x27;t finish anybody&#x27;s album. I couldn&#x27;t get any work done in the office, it was just real hard... I&#x27;d already done the one album for each artist that I&#x27;d promised, and I wanted to liberate them and get them signed up with a real big record company. But they all wanted to stay together because that was what they knew...I hadn&#x27;t intended to produce any second albums for any of the artists. They were all out of contract. My contract wasn&#x27;t really a contract to hold them to me. I had a contract with them because Word required it of Solid Rock. So, I just gave them their contract back as soon as their album was out. There was a lot of personal strife in everybody&#x27;s life. My wife had decided she wanted to marry somebody else and all of the artists at the same time were leaving their wives, and I just thought this was an appropriate time for introspection. I didn&#x27;t want to be up on stage and having kids come back afterwards and ask me why everyone was getting divorced. The tensions of the Solid Rock community resulted in the fracturing of several personal and professional relationships, Norman&#x27;s departure overseas, the dispersal of the Solid Rock artists to other labels, and to the formation of Phydeaux Records. He became &quot;a musical hermit, ceasing relationships with record companies and focusing on selling his music directly to his fans through the mail&quot;.

===Post 1980===
In February 1992, Norman had a heart attack and limited the activities of his record label until his death in 2008, but work continued to release CD versions of archival material from the 1970s.

<text> (literal English translation: &quot;Aino&#x27;s Place&quot;) is a museum in Järvenpää, Finland, which was the home of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, his wife Aino (née Järnefelt), and their six daughters. Situated near Lake Tuusula, north of Helsinki, the two-story wooden home was designed by Finnish architect Lars Sonck. The foundation was laid in the autumn of 1903, and the Sibelius family began occupying the residence in September 1904. The second floor of Ainola was finished in 1911. 

The museum is maintained by Ainola Foundation, which was founded in 1972 by the Ministry of Education and Sibelius Society of Finland.

==Overview== 
The only requests Sibelius had for Sonck in designing Ainola were to include both a lake view and a green fireplace in the dining room. Running water was not installed until after Sibelius&#x27;s death due to his wishes. 

Ainola&#x27;s distance from the hustle and bustle of the nation&#x27;s capital gave the composer the peace that he needed for his creative endeavours. His biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna writes that &quot;when Sibelius first left Helsinki, Järvenpää was to a large extent untouched countryside. Foals and sheep almost nosed their way into the house, and from time to time an elk majestically bestrode the grounds.&quot; There were also other artistic families living in the neighborhood who provided a lively social circle for the Sibelius family.

Daily life in Ainola was documented by Sibelius&#x27;s private secretary Santeri Levas in the 1945 photographic book &quot;Jean Sibelius and His Home&quot;.

Buildings around Ainola include a sauna building and a shed. Sibelius died in Ainola on September 20, 1957. His wife Aino lived in Ainola for the next twelve years until she died on June 8, 1969. They were both buried in Ainola&#x27;s garden surrounded by apple trees.

==Museum==
In 1972, Jean Sibelius&#x27;s daughters Eva Paloheimo, , Katarina Ilves, Margareta Jalas, and Heidi Blomstedt sold Ainola to the Finnish government. The Ministry of Education and the Sibelius Society of Finland opened it as a museum in June 1974. It is currently open during the summer season, from May to September.

<text>In Modern English, they is a third-person pronoun relating to a grammatical subject.

== Morphology ==
In Standard Modern English, &quot;they&quot; has five distinct word forms:

* &quot;they&quot;: the nominative (subjective) form
* &quot;them&quot;: the accusative (objective, called the &#x27;oblique&#x27;.) and a non-standard determinative form.
* &quot;their:&quot; the dependent genitive (possessive) form
* &quot;theirs&quot;: independent genitive form
* &quot;themselves&quot;: prototypical reflexive form 
* &quot;themself&quot;: derivative reflexive form (nonstandard; now chiefly used instead of &quot;himself or herself&quot; as a reflexive epicenity for &quot;they&quot; in pronominal reference to a singular referent)

==History==
Old English had a single third-person pronoun , which had both singular and plural forms, and &quot;they&quot; wasn&#x27;t among them. In or about the start of the 13th century, &quot;they&quot; was imported from a Scandinavian source (Old Norse , Old Danish, Old Swedish , ), in which it was a masculine plural demonstrative pronoun. It comes from Proto-Germanic *&quot;thai&quot;, nominative plural pronoun, from PIE *&quot;to&quot;-, demonstrative pronoun. According to &quot;The Cambridge History of the English Language&quot;:

The development in Middle English is shown in the following table. At the final stage, it had reached its modern form.

==Singular &quot;they&quot;==
Singular &quot;they&quot; is a use of &quot;they&quot; as an epicene (gender-neutral) pronoun for a singular referent. In this usage, &quot;they&quot; follows plural agreement rules (&quot;they are&quot;, not *&quot;they is&quot;), but the semantic reference is singular. Unlike plural &quot;they&quot;, singular &quot;they&quot; is only used for people. For this reason, it could be considered to have personal gender. Some people refuse to use the epicene pronoun &quot;they&quot; when referring to individuals on the basis that it is primarily a plural pronoun instead of a singular pronoun. However, the online edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records usage of &quot;they&quot; &quot;referring to an individual generically or indefinitely&quot;, with examples dating to 2008–2009.

===Word of the year===
In December 2019, Merriam-Webster chose singular &quot;they&quot; as word of the year. The word was chosen because &quot;English famously lacks a gender-neutral singular pronoun to correspond neatly with singular pronouns like everyone or someone, and as a consequence &quot;they&quot; has been used for this purpose for over 600 years.&quot;

== Syntax ==

=== Functions ===
&quot;They&quot; can appear as a subject, object, determiner or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct.

* Subject: &quot;&quot;They&quot;&#x27;re there&quot;; &quot;&quot;them&quot; being there&quot;; &quot;&quot;their&quot; being there&quot;.
* Object: &quot;I saw &quot;them&quot;&quot;; &quot;I directed her to &quot;them&quot;&quot;; &quot;They connect to &quot;themselves&quot;.&quot;
* Predicative complement: &quot;In our attempt to fight evil, we have become &quot;them&quot;&quot;; &quot;They eventually felt they had become &quot;themselves&quot;.&quot;
* Dependent determiner: &quot;I touched &quot;their&quot; car&quot;; &quot;&quot;them&quot; folks are helpful&quot; (non-standard).
* Independent determiner: &quot;This is &quot;theirs&quot;.&quot;
* Adjunct: &quot;They did it &quot;themselves&quot;.&quot;

=== Dependents ===
Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for &quot;they&quot; to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases.

* Relative clause modifier: &quot;they &quot;who arrive late&quot;&quot;.
* Determiner: &quot;Sometimes, when you think, &#x27;I will show them&#x27;, &quot;the&quot; &#x27;them&#x27; you end up showing is yourself.&quot;
* Adjective phrase modifier: &quot;the &quot;real&quot; them&quot;.
* Adverb phrase external modifier: &quot;&quot;not even&quot; them&quot;.

== Semantics ==
Plural &quot;they&quot;&#x27;s referents can be anything, including persons, as long as it does not include the speaker (which would require &quot;we&quot;) or the addressee(s) (which would require &quot;you&quot;). Singular &quot;they&quot; can only refer to individual persons. Until the end of the 20th century, this was limited to those whose gender is unknown (e.g., &quot;Someone&#x27;s here. I wonder what &quot;they&quot; want&quot;; &quot;That person over there seems to be waving &quot;their&quot; hands at us.&quot;).

===Generic===

The pronoun &quot;they&quot; can also be used to refer to an unspecified group of people, as in &quot;In Japan &quot;they&quot; drive on the left&quot;, or &quot;&quot;They&quot;&#x27;re putting in a new restaurant across the street.&quot; It often refers to the authorities, or to some perceived powerful group, sometimes sinister: &quot;&quot;They&quot; don&#x27;t want the public to know the whole truth.&quot;

<text>Lars Eliel Sonck (10 August 1870 – 14 March 1956) was a Finnish architect. He graduated from Helsinki Polytechnic Institute in 1894 and immediately won a major design competition for a church in Turku, St Michael&#x27;s Church, ahead of many established architects. The church was designed in the prevailing neo-Gothic style. However, Sonck&#x27;s style would soon go through a dramatic change, in the direction of Art Nouveau and National Romanticism that was moving through Europe at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, Sonck would also design a number of buildings in the emerging Nordic Classicism style.

==Architecture and town planning==

A prominent figure in Finland&#x27;s search for architectural identity – at a period when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the control of Russia and Finnish politicians, intellectuals and artists were defining a distinct national identity – Sonck played a leading role in the development of National Romanticism, along with such other architects as Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren, and Eliel Saarinen. This style of architecture is often seen as part of the Art Nouveau style or Jugendstil, but shows influences from Romanesque architecture as well as elements borrowed from the historical tradition of Finland&#x27;s medieval stone structures and residential wooden architecture. Among Sonck&#x27;s well-known works in the neo-Romanesque style are Kallio Church, Helsinki (1912) and Kultaranta, the President of Finland&#x27;s official summer residence in Naantali (1916); in the Jugendstil style are Tampere Cathedral, Tampere (1907) the Eira Hospital, Helsinki (1905) and &quot;Ainola&quot; (1903), the family home for the composer Jean Sibelius and his wife Aino (née Järnefelt) in Järvenpää; in the Nordic Classicism style are the housing blocks on Museokatu Street, in Töölö, Helsinki (c. 1920) and the Mikael Agricola Church, Helsinki (1935).

Sonck was also active in city planning theory debate, between the picturesque theories of Austrian theorist Camillo Sitte versus fellow Austrian Otto Wagner. Sonck favoured the former approach. The debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever town planning design competition in 1898–1900 for the Töölö district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nyström, second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertel Jung and Valter Thomé. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck&#x27;s competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments – and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael&#x27;s Church in Helsinki, with numerous &quot;fantastic&quot; spired buildings. In the Töölö competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström&#x27;s spacious street network and elements of Sonck&#x27;s Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in the restrained Nordic Classicism style along a curving street line, designed by Sonck. A still wider new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck.

<doc id="962810" wikidata="Q3544207" url="?curid=962810" title="USS Ling">
<text>USS &quot;Ling&quot; (hull number SS-297) is a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy, named for the ling fish, also known as the cobia. The vessel was built during World War II, but was completed in the final months of the conflict and so saw no action. She was placed in reserve in 1946 until being converted into a training ship in 1960. In 1971, she was struck from the naval register and donated to the Submarine Memorial Association for use as a museum ship. The ship was grounded in the Hackensack River at the former location of the defunct New Jersey Naval Museum in Hackensack, New Jersey. Since 2016, &quot;Ling&quot; has been inaccessible to the public.

==History==
&quot;Ling&quot; was laid down on 2 November 1942 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia. She was launched on 15 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. E. J. Foy, and was moved to the Boston Navy Yard for completion and testing. &quot;Ling&quot; was commissioned on 8 June 1945. (The 3 year 7 month period between keel laying to commissioning was unusually long for a World War II submarine.)

After shakedown and further installations, &quot;Ling&quot; headed out to sea to test her equipment on 15 September 1945, 13 days after Japan had formally surrendered. The submarine was based at Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut until she sailed on 11 February 1946 for the Panama Canal Zone, arriving eight days later. She operated out of Panama until 9 March when she sailed north. She completed inactivation on 23 October at New London and was decommissioned on 26 October 1946. &quot;Ling&quot; entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, after having been in commission for only 1 year, 4 months and 18 days.

In March 1960, &quot;Ling&quot; was towed to Brooklyn, New York, where she was converted into a training ship at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, simulating all aspects of submarine operations. She was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine (with the hull number AGSS-297) in 1962.

&quot;Ling&quot; received the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal for her service. &quot;Ling&quot; was reclassified a Miscellaneous Unclassified Submarine (with the hull number IXSS-297), and struck from the Naval Register, 1 December 1971.

==Museum ship==

Six months later the USS &quot;Ling&quot; was donated to the Submarine Memorial Association, a non-profit organization formed in 1972 with the purpose of saving &quot;Ling&quot; from the scrap yard. They petitioned the Navy to bring the boat to Hackensack, New Jersey to serve as a memorial &quot;to perpetuate the memory of our shipmates who gave their lives in the pursuit of their duties while serving their country.&quot; Many citizens and corporations contributed time, professional services, and funds toward the restoration of &quot;Ling&quot;. She arrived at her present home in New Jersey in January 1973, where she was restored to near-mint condition—scrubbed, painted, and polished for public tours—through the efforts of the association. The compartments were refurbished and outfitted with authentic gear that recreated the bygone era of the World War II battle submarine. She was the centerpiece of the New Jersey Naval Museum at 78 River St., Hackensack, New Jersey.

X-rays showed that the submarine&#x27;s five safes contained documents and metallic objects, but the combinations had long been lost. On 27 January 2006, Jeff Sitar, the eight-time world champion locksmith, opened the safes using only his fingers and an electronic sound amplifier, rather than drills or explosives. In the safes, he found a wide variety of objects, including a dozen pennies, two .45-caliber bullets, a ring of keys, many training and maintenance manuals and parts catalogs from the 1940s and 1950s, and two cans of 190-proof ethanol.

In the American-produced Russian language film &quot;Katya&quot; shot in 2010, the &quot;Ling&quot; was used for a set to depict the Soviet &quot;K-129&quot; diesel-electric powered submarine which sank on 8 March 1968 northwest of Oahu.

==Site==
From 1972 until the closing of the New Jersey Naval Museum, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site for &quot;Ling&quot;. In January 2007, the North Jersey Media Group, owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated. As of September 2013 the museum itself was closed due to damage in 2012 from Hurricane Sandy. The museum closed again for emergency repairs in late July, 2015. The museum was expected to vacate the property in August 2018. 

==Vandalism and repair==
In August 2018, the &quot;Ling&quot; was vandalized. Locks were cut on interior doors, and hatches were opened, allowing up to 14 ft of water to flood the interior of the ship. Memorial plaques were also stolen from a US Submarine Service memorial on the shore, but were later found to be on the property of one of the Museum personnel, who claimed that he had removed the plaques for &#x27;safekeeping.&#x27; 

The USS &quot;Ling&quot; was worked on by a group of volunteers, who pumped out the water and used compressed air to fill the ship&#x27;s ballast tanks, allowing her to be refloated. Her final destination has yet to be determined as the original plans have fallen through. There are no plans to allow the USS &quot;Ling&quot; to be scrapped or to be allowed to deteriorate further and efforts were being made to find a new home for her, potentially in Louisville, Kentucky. The swing bridge south of her on the river is functional and is no longer an obstacle to moving her. 

In September 2020 volunteers associated with the Louisville Naval Museum began to raise concerns on social media about improper accounting of donations made to the Louisville Naval Museum. The volunteers ceased working with the Louisville Naval Museum after one of the volunteers suffered a serious injury while working aboard the USS &quot;Ling&quot; in November 2020. The injured volunteer was subsequently awarded a default judgement of $468,584 in a suit against the Louisville Naval Museum.

==Relocation issues==
Freshwater flow in the Hackensack River has been drastically reduced for use as drinking water by the Oradell Dam. The navigable ship channel on the river has only been maintained as far north as the Riverbend in Hudson County. The accumulation of silt has effectively filled in the formerly navigable channel. The present depth of the Hackensack River is too shallow to allow the Ling to move downstream, and there are no funds or plans to dredge the river, the muds of which are laced with industrial toxins. The &quot;Ling&quot; therefore cannot be moved from her location.

There are four bridges across the Hackensack River, south of the &quot;Ling&quot;, which do not open or move. Two are vehicular bridges. Two are rail bridges, one operated by New Jersey Transit and one operated by both New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. These bridges also make moving the submarine downriver impossible.

<text>Despite is a Swedish death metal band from Gothenburg.

==History==
The band was formed in 1998. Their debut indie album, &quot;In Your Despite&quot; was released in Sweden in March 2009. The album contains a song called ”MindPlague” with guest vocals supplied by Knut Agnred, a renowned Swedish singer and member of the popular comedy group Galenskaparna och After Shave. In October 2010, the band released their second indie album titled &quot;Clenched&quot;. This time the record producer Andreas Kleerup helped them out on the track &quot;Commander of Hate&quot;. Later, the band parted ways with their singer Alex, and Peter Tuthill (ex member of Carnal Forge, Godsic and Construcdead) joined as their new lead singer in December 2012. During the spring of 2013 Despite entered Crehate Studios to record &quot;EPic&quot;, released in the beginning of 2014. The album was well received among the metal community. MusicReviewRadar wrote &quot;EPic is a refreshing, solid and heavy as f**k album that stands out from the crowd (...) Despite seem to be the real deal, ready to leave the underground and dazzle the entire world with their amazing nordic metal for a really long time&quot;. On November 10, 2014 the new standalone single &quot;Chaos Trigger&quot; was released. VH1 featured Despite among &quot;15 MORE Metal Bands You Should Be Listening To In 2015&quot;.

In December 2014, bassist Mathias Dagerhed decided to quit, and a replacement was found in Anthony Cui. At the same time Despite decided to add a third guitarist to the line-up, and Zoran Panovic was recruited. In 2015, they released the single &quot;Praedonum&quot;. This was also the last recording featuring drummer Oscar Nilsson, who left the band to concentrate more on his studio. Drummer Janne Jaloma (ex-Deals Death and Bloodshot Dawn) was recruited shortly after Oscar&#x27;s departure. In late 2015-early 2016, Despite recorded their first album &quot;Synergi&quot; which was released on July 22, 2016 and featured 13 tracks. This is also the first Despite album to be released through Eclipse Records. The first single &quot;As You Bleed&quot; managed to climb to the top three of José Mangin&#x27;s show &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dozen&quot; on America&#x27;s biggest satellite metal music radio station Liquid Metal (Sirius XM) and stayed there for several weeks. &quot;Synergi&quot; has been praised by critics and fans alike all over the globe. In May 2016, guitarist and founding member Timmy Leng decided to leave Despite. Eldor Pettersson replaced Leng in May 2016. In 2017, Despite released a stand-alone single of The Prodigy&#x27;s hit single &quot;Breathe&quot;. On February 15, 2019, Despite released the single, &quot;Echo Chamber&quot;.

<text>Seed Records has been the name of multiple record labels.

== 1970s American label ==
Seed Records was a record label started in 1972 by Paul Clark, a musician involved in the Jesus music movement. The label ran until circa 1981, when he started Minstrel&#x27;s Voyage Music. Seed Records was distributed by Word Records and ABC Records.

== 1990s American label ==
Seed Records was a short-lived American independent record label owned by Atlantic Records. The label has released music by artists such as Tumbleweed, Madder Rose, Inch, Leatherface, The Nightblooms, Ivy, Television Personalities, The Pooh Sticks, The Earthmen, and The Pastels.

== 2000s British label ==
A London based record label also named Seed Records was set up in 2000 by Rich Bevan and Joshu Doherty of electronica duo Posthuman. The original roster of artists who released music on Seed included Cursor Miner, Ardisson, Kansas City Prophets, The Doubtful Guest, Digitonal, and Posthuman.

Posthuman also promoted a series of events called &#x27;Seed Showcases&#x27;, including UnderLondonGround, held in the disused underground Aldwych tube station. Artists that played these events included the label&#x27;s roster, alongside guests such as Aphex Twin, Alison Goldfrapp, Richard X, Plaid, Luke Vibert, T.Rauschmeire, Funkstörung, Mark Moore and many more.

There is no 13th release in the label catalogue.

The 14th release &#x27;1.21 Gigawatts&#x27; by MoQ was removed from the catalogue before physical release, and released instead as digital only SEEDEX04. It was later removed from sale entirely.

In 2006, for the label&#x27;s official fifth birthday a series of limited edition CD releases sealed in bags with promotional items was released

Doherty left Seed in late 2006, turning over control to Bruce McClure, who had been involved with the label and live events for several years.

In 2011, Seed released Sleeps in Oysters second album, &#x27;Lo!&#x27;. The first fifty editions came with animal masks and sewing kits.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2012, Seed distributed the final album of the legendary Japanese games music producer Kazuki Sakata.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2012, &#x27;Hot Doctor&#x27; by The Dagger Brothers was released with remixes by Nightwave and Sleeps in Oysters. The special editions came with a &#x27;Singalong a Dagger Brothers&#x27; song sheet.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2013, The Dagger Brothers&#x27; album &#x27;Bwananapple&#x27; was released as a limited-edition USB, with songs about Bruce Willis and a lyric sheet. It also included the &#x27;Beast Tour 2009&#x27; rockumentary filmed at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2012&lt;br&gt; 
In 2015, Seed put out a limited edition of one hundred 10&quot; vinyl by Rutger Hauser and Eftus Spectun. This was a joint release with The Lumen Lake and Void of Ovals, and was the final release on the label.

Many of the Seed Records releases are highly limited in number and sought after by collectors. 
The main genres covered are electronica, techno, post-rock, and IDM.

<doc id="962832" wikidata="Q6026221" url="?curid=962832" title="Maybe (The Chantels song)">
<text>&quot;Maybe&quot; is a song with words and music originally credited to End Records owner George Goldner and &quot;Casey&quot;. The co-writing credit was later transferred to Richard Barrett. Arlene Smith, lead singer of the Chantels, is believed to be an uncredited co-writer. The song was first recorded by the Chantels on October 16, 1957, in a doo-wop style with Barrett playing piano, and released in December 1957. It climbed the charts in January 1958, reaching No. 15 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. It was subsequently described as &quot;arguably, the first true glimmering of the girl group sound&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 199 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was also included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

&quot;Billboard&quot; named the song No. 60 on its list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.

The song was also covered by The Three Degrees in 1966, Janis Joplin on her I Got Dem Ol&#x27; Kozmic Blues Again Mama! album in 1969, and again by The Three Degrees in 1970.

Miguel Matute Project recorded a version in 2019 with Monica Mayen on vocals, included in the album &quot;Desde Adentro y Otros Asuntos&quot;.

==Album appearances==
The original Chantels recording was included on the 1963 compilation album &quot;Golden Goodies Vol. 3&quot; (Roulette R-25218). The song also appears on the 1973 compilation &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Soul 1958&quot; (ABCX-1958), and on the 1975 compilation &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (MCA2-8007).

<text>When is the musical project of Norwegian artist Lars Pedersen.

==Lars Pedersen==

Lars Pedersen was born in 1961, in Oslo, Norway. His father, Tore Pedersen, was a Norwegian musical composer. At an early age, the younger Pedersen performed with his four older sisters and older brother; they were often compared to the Jackson 5 and The Partridge Family, popular bands of the time. Being in the spotlight at a young age, Pedersen met Chuck Berry and other stars. 

In the late 1970s, Pedersen played in Hærverk, one of the first Norwegian punk bands, and later – as the 1980s arrived – went on to form the band The Last James. The Last James explored The Beatles/Beach Boys sound, releasing three albums, &quot;Grape&quot;, &quot;The Last James&quot; and &quot;Kindergarten&quot;. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Pedersen was also a member of the renowned experimental/industrial/new wave group Holy Toy, together with Andrej D. Nebb. The band became active again in 2011.

==Early releases==

In 1983, Pedersen launched the one-man project Hospital Blimp, which would later become When. The debut album &quot;Drowning but Learning&quot;, was released in 1987, with When&#x27;s trademark collage/cut-up technique already apparent. 

In 1988, When released &quot;Death in the Blue Lake&quot;, inspired by Norwegian author André Bjerke&#x27;s psychological horror novel of the same name. The album had a strong atmosphere of fear and mourning, and was quite popular in Norwegian black metal circles. An excerpt from the album&#x27;s A-side was commissioned as an intro to Satyricon&#x27;s &quot;Dark Medieval Times&quot; &quot;Walk the path of sorrows&quot;. The B-side of the album is an amalgamation of ethnic music, blues harmonica, coughing, psychedelic pop and glissandi effects. Today it is almost impossible to track down a copy of the album. 

&quot;Black, White &amp; Grey&quot;, When&#x27;s third album, conjured up images of war and urban decay. Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears, etc.), who contributed to the album, was also a central inspiration. The album was released on Cutler&#x27;s RéR Megacorp in 1990. 

1992 saw the release of &quot;Svartedauen&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;The Black Death&quot;), a 38-minute musical description of the ravages of the bubonic plague in Norway around 1349. The album borrows elements from Norwegian folk music, and features a host of disturbing sounds: hearses, moans of the dying, rats, flagellants&#x27; whips and a scythe being sharpened, to name but a few. 

On 1994&#x27;s &quot;Prefab Wreckage&quot;, When slowly started moving from the more abstract soundtracks of the earlier albums and towards a more song-oriented sound. The inner sleeve is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, one of the album&#x27;s inspirations. 

In 1997, When released &quot;Gynt&quot;, which according to the liner notes is a &quot;satiric play on Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. Inspired by Henrik Ibsen.&quot; As Pedersen says: &quot;I tried to put irony into the music. There is a lot of humour in When&#x27;s music, it&#x27;s not bloody serious all the time.&quot;

==Jester Records==

After &quot;Gynt&quot;, When was signed by Jester Records, newly set-up by Kristoffer Garm Rygg of Ulver, and the next album would mark another radical change in When&#x27;s musical direction. &quot;Psychedelic Wunderbaum&quot; was indeed a psychedelic mix, with apparent inspirations from rock, noise, and cartoon music, and with lyrics taken from Aleister Crowley and Tom Wolfe. Pedersen remarked: 

:I fetched many grooves from old, obscure psychedelic garage bands. It was something I had wanted to do for a long time, but I thought that it might be too audacious. But as more and more artists seem to be using that method, I figured that I could do it too. I dug up the old Farfisa organ that I had used in Holy Toy and got Bjørn Sorknes, the old Holy Toy guitarist, with me. We worked together on the production as well. It became a sort of crossing between industrial and psychedelic rock.

The next album, &quot;The Lobster Boys&quot;, was Pedersen&#x27;s most pop-oriented effort so far. Many of the songs were reminiscent of The Beach Boys and/or The Beatles, but there&#x27;s always something just a little &quot;off&quot; and odd about When&#x27;s music that sets it apart from more mainstream acts. Some tracks start out as &quot;normal&quot; rock, but often end up in a cacophony of weird samples and madness before reaching an end. &quot;The Lobster Boys&quot; was also heavily inspired by Arabic music. 

Nils Arne Øvergård and Øyvind Borgemoen joined When as full members on this recording. The trio has played several concerts, including the release party for the single &quot;Sunshine Superhead&quot;, where they performed in bear costumes with paper-mâché guitars. The same song also got heavy radio rotation in Norway that summer. 

In 2003, When released &quot;Pearl-Harvest&quot;, more or less &quot;The Lobster Boys&quot; part II, but with lyrical concepts taken from &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. Combine those fables with sampled, shambling Middle Eastern bazaar muzak, jangling exotica and electronics, and you&#x27;ve got When&#x27;s winning formula. 

When&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Whenever&quot; features a characteristic mix of Middle Eastern influences, African tribal rhythms, as well as trademark When collages and cartoon loops. The lyrics, written by Chris Cutler, often deal with grim subject matter such as the apocalypse and death.

In 2007, When released their latest album, &quot;Trippy Happy&quot;. Bringing back a sound that hasn&#x27;t been heard since the late 60s, Trippy Happy explored folky pop ballads, banjo lullabies, baroque psychedelia, and industrial cartoon surrealism.

The album was a return to the sound of The Last James, as it featured appearances by Haakon Ellingsen of the Last James on banjo, voices, and piano and Øyvind Borgemoen on accordion/piano.

On February 17, 2008, When announced the forthcoming release of their twelfth album, &quot;You Are Silent&quot;, for April 28, 2008. The announcement suggests that the sound is darker and closer to &quot;Prefab Wreckage&quot; than to recent releases.

<text>Takfir () is an Arabic and Islamic term which denotes excommunication from Islam of one Muslim by another, i.e. accusing another Muslim of being an apostate. The word is found neither in the Quran nor in the &quot;ḥadīth&quot; literature; instead, &quot;kufr&quot; (&quot;unbelief&quot;) and &quot;kāfir&quot; (&quot;unbeliever&quot;) and other terms employing the same triliteral root &quot;K-F-R&quot; appear.

Since according to the traditional interpretations of Islamic law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;) the punishment for apostasy is the death penalty, and potentially a cause of strife and violence within the Muslim community (&quot;Ummah&quot;), an ill-founded &quot;takfir&quot; accusation was a major forbidden act (&quot;haram&quot;) in Islamic jurisprudence, with one &quot;hadith&quot; declaring that one who wrongly declares a Muslim an unbeliever is himself not an apostate but rather committed minor shirk. In the history of Islam, a sect originating in the 7th century CE known as the Kharijites carried out &quot;takfīr&quot; against both Sunnī and Shīʿa Muslims, and became the main source of insurrection against the early caliphates for centuries. Traditionally, the only group authorized to declare another Muslim a &quot;kāfir&quot; are the scholars of Islam (&quot;Ulama&quot;), which affirm that all the prescribed legal precautions should be taken before declaring &quot;takfīr&quot;, and that those who profess the Islamic faith should be exempt.

Starting in the mid-to-late 20th century, some individuals and organizations in the Muslim world began to apply &quot;takfīr&quot; accusations not only against those that they perceived as stray deviant and lapsed Muslims, but also governments and in some cases, societies as well. In his widely influential book &quot;Milestones&quot;, Egyptian Islamist ideologue Sayyid Qutb preached that governments ruling the Muslim world had fallen into a state of collective apostasy or &quot;jahiliyah&quot; (a state of pre-Islamic ignorance) several centuries ago, having abandoned the use of &quot;sharīʿa&quot; law, without which (Qutb held) Islam cannot exist. Qutb affirmed that since Muslim government leaders (along with being cruel and evil) were actually not Muslims but apostates preventing the revival of Islam, the use of &quot;physical force&quot; should be used to remove them. This radical Islamist ideology, called &quot;takfirism&quot;, has been widely held and applied by numerous Islamic extremists, terrorists, and jihadist organizations in the late 20th and early 21st-centuries, to varying degrees.

Since the latter half of the 20th century, &quot;takfīr&quot; has also been used for &quot;sanctioning violence against leaders of Islamic states&quot; who do not enforce sharia or are otherwise &quot;deemed insufficiently religious&quot;. Politically motivated arbitrary declarations of &quot;takfīr&quot; became a &quot;central ideology&quot; of Egyptian-based Jihadist organizations, which were inspired by the ideas of the medieval Islamic scholars Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Kathir, and those of the modern Islamist ideologues Sayyid Qutb and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi. Some Salafi jihadist insurgent organizations such as Takfir wal-Hijra, GIA, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State, have been engaged in radical Takfiri discourse. Their practice of &quot;takfīr&quot; has been denounced as deviant by the mainstream schools of Islam and various leaders such as Hasan al-Hudaybi (d. 1977) and Yusuf al-Qaradawi.

==Etymology and terminology==
The Arabic terms &quot;kufr&quot; (&quot;unbelief&quot;) and &quot;kāfir&quot; (&quot;unbeliever&quot;), alongside other terms employing the same triliteral root &quot;k-f-r&quot;, are found both in the Quran and the &quot;ḥadīth&quot; literature, but the term &quot;takfīr&quot; used to declare another Muslim as &quot;kāfir&quot; is found in neither. &quot;The word &quot;takfīr&quot; was introduced in the post-Quranic period and was first done by the Khawarij,&quot; according to J. E. Campo.

The act which precipitates &quot;takfīr&quot; is termed &quot;mukaffir&quot;. A Muslim who declares another Muslim to be an unbeliever or apostate is a &quot;takfīri&quot; (&quot;excommunicational&quot;).
It is prohibited to do without court and 12 years of Islamic studies.

== Authority and conditions ==

Legitimate authority and conditions that permit the issuance of &quot;takfīr&quot; are major points of contention among Muslim scholars. The declaration of &quot;takfīr&quot; typically applies to a judgement that an action or statement by the accused Muslim indicates his/her knowing abandonment of Islam. In many cases an Islamic court or a religious leader, an ʿālim must pronounce a &quot;fatwa&quot; (legal judgement) of &quot;takfīr&quot; against an individual or group.

The medieval Islamic scholar al-Ghazali &quot;is often credited with having persuaded theologians, in his &quot;Faysalal-Tafriqa&quot; (&quot;The Criterion of Distinction between Islam and Clandestine Unbelief&quot;) that &quot;takfīr&quot; is not a fruitful path and that utmost caution is to be taken in applying it.&quot; In general, the official Muslim clergy considers that Islam does not sanction excommunication of Muslims who profess their Islamic faith and perform the ritual pillars of Islam. This is due to the fact that takfir that successfully convinces the judges (or Muslim vigilantes) of the accused being an apostate, traditionally leads to punishments of killing, confiscation of their property, and denial of Islamic burial. Ulamas often raise objections by asking rhetorical questions of who holds the right to excommunicate others, on what religious criteria it should be based, and what level of specialized knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) is required for the qualification of authority.

Some Muslims consider &quot;takfīr&quot; to be a prerogative only of either Muhammad — who does that through divine revelation and is no longer alive to do it — or of a state which represents the collectivity of the &quot;Ummah&quot; (the Muslim community).

An example given of the reluctance of Muslims to takfir is the refusal of authorities at Al-Azhar University to takfir ISIL/ISIS/Daesh in 2015 despite that groups notorious takfir atrocities; and the refusal of &quot;many mainstream Muslims&quot; to takfir the Kharijites, despite this sects being &quot;unanimously regarded as the arch-takfiris&quot; by scholars.

;Examples of takfir
Examples of takfir spreading once takfir is accepted in a Muslim community include:
*The Saudi Arabian fatwa website IslamQA.info gave as an example of over-zealous takfir &quot;deviants&quot; a group who &quot;kept away from &quot;Jumu&#x27;ah&quot; (Friday prayer) and Salah al jamaa&#x27;ah (congregational prayer) and regarded the Muslims in that land&quot;—the 19th century community on the Arabian peninsula who followed the teachings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab – &quot;as disbelievers&quot;. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhaab himself was noted for teachings whose &quot;pivotal idea&quot; was that &quot;Muslims who disagreed with his definition of monotheism were not heretics, that is to say, misguided Muslims, but outside the pale of Islam altogether.&quot;
*Islamist youth incarcerated for alleged extremism in Egypt in the mid-1960s agreed with the theory set forth in Sayyid Qutb&#x27;s book Milestones that Islam was extinct since sharia law not being enforced in the &quot;Muslim&quot; world, and that the right response was to withdraw from &quot;Muslim&quot; society in preparation for the overthrow of the secular regime. However they disagreed over whether their detachment should be &quot;total&quot; (i.e. a low profile but not secret existence on the margins of society) or &quot;spiritual&quot; (i.e. kept secret from other Muslims until they were a stronger force). The groups mutually takfired each other and &quot;refused to greet one another, and sometimes even came to blows&quot;.

===Characteristics of apostasy in classical Islam===
Traditionally, Islamic jurists did not formulate general rules for establishing unbelief, instead compiling sometimes lengthy lists of statements and actions which in their view were grounds for a takfir accusation. These could be wide-ranging and seemingly far removed from basic Islamic beliefs.

The manuals Reliance of the Traveller, a 14th-century manual of the Shafi&#x27;i school of jurisprudence (Fiqh), and &quot;Madjma&#x27; al-Anhur&quot; by Hanafi scholar Shaykhzadeh (d. 1667) include

(From Reliance):
:(a) bowing before sun, moon, objects of nature, idols, cross or any images symbolically representing God whether in mere contrariness, sarcastically or with conviction;
:(b) intention to commit unbelief, even if one hesitates to do so;
:(c) speak words that imply unbelief such as &quot;Allah is the third of three&quot; or &quot;I am Allah&quot;;
:(d) revile, question, wonder, doubt, mock or deny the existence of God or Prophet of Islam or that the Prophet was sent by God;
:(e) revile, deny, or mock any verse of the Quran, or the religion of Islam;
:(f) to deny the obligatory character of something considered obligatory by Ijma (consensus of Muslims);
:(g) believe that things in themselves or by their nature have cause independent of the will of God.

(Selected characteristics from &quot;Madjma&#x27; al-anhur&quot;):

:(a) conceive of Allah as a woman or child;
:(b) to declare that the Angel of Death sometimes picks the wrong people;
:(c) to assert the createdness of the Quran, to translate the Quran;
:(d) to ridicule Islamic scholars or address them in a derisive manner, to reject the validity of Shariah courts;
:(e) to pay respect to non-Muslims, to celebrate Nowruz the Iranian New Year.

Other examples from legal treatises devoted exclusively to verbal expressions (but also actions) of disbelief (known as &quot;alfaz al-kufr&quot;) included:
*&quot;Whoever recites the Quran to the sound of a drum is an unbeliever (&quot;yakfuru&quot;)&quot;
*&quot;Whoever says: &#x27;I do not know why God mentioned this or that in the Quran&#x27; is an unbeliever (&quot;karfara&quot;)&quot;
*&quot;Whoever deliberately prays in a direction other than Mecca (&quot;al-qibla&quot;), is an unbeliever&quot;
*&quot;When someone returns from a scholarly gathering (&quot;majlis al-&#x27;il&quot;) and another one says: &#x27;that man came back from church&#x27;, that person is an unbeliever&quot;
*&quot;If a woman curses a scholar husband, she is an unbeliever&quot;

Al-Ghazali held that apostasy occurs when a Muslim denies the essential dogmas: monotheism, Muhammad&#x27;s prophecy, and the Last Judgment. He devoted &quot;chapters to dealing with takfir and the reasons for which one can be accused of unbelief,&quot; in his work &quot;Fayasl al-tafriqa bayn al-Islam wa-l-zandaqa&quot;.

====Exemptions and extenuating circumstances====
On the other hand, there are a number of ways a Muslim may avoid being found guilty of apostasy.

Giving pause to takfir accusations is the principle of fiqh (in Shafiʿi and other madhhabs) that accusing or describing another devout Muslim of being an unbeliever is itself an act of apostasy, based on the hadith where Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot;If a man says to his brother, &#x27;You are an infidel,&#x27; then one of them is right.&quot;

In contrast to the manuals described above, Charles Adams and A. Kevin Reinhart state that some Islamic theologians maintain that Muslims may be guilty of error and wrongdoing without descending all the way to the level of kafir. For example, a Muslim denying a point of creed may be a hypocrite (&quot;munāfiq&quot;) but not a kāfir; merely corrupt (&quot;fasād&quot;) if their disobedience was not excessive; &quot;errant Muslim sectarians ... astray (&quot;ḍāll&quot;),&quot;; those whose Qurʿānic interpretation (&quot;taʿwīl&quot;) are faulty are in error and not unbelievers because their &quot;citation of Qurʿān, however mistaken, established their faith&quot;; and &quot;according to some&quot;, anyone who is &quot;a person of &quot;qiblah&quot;&quot; [prays towards the &quot;qiblah&quot;] cannot be a kāfir.

;Before the accused can be found guilty
Compensating for the numerous and potentially fatal possible transgressions mentioned above that had to be avoided were the requirements (&quot;hurdles to jump through&quot;) for finding a Muslim guilty of apostasy. While not all Islamic scholars or schools of jurisprudence agree, some Shafi&#x27;i fiqh scholars—such as Nawawi and ibn Naqib al-Misri—state that to apply the apostasy code to a Muslim, the accused must: 
:(a) have understood and professed that &quot;there is no God but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God&quot; (shahada), 
:(b) know the shariah necessarily known by all Muslims, 
:(c) be of sound mind at the time of apostasy, 
:(d) have reached or passed puberty, and 
:(e) have consciously and deliberately rejected or consciously and deliberately intend to reject any part or all of Quran or of Islam (Sharia).

Maliki scholars additionally require that the person in question has publicly engaged in the obligatory practices of the religion. In contrast, Hanafi, Hanbali and Ja&#x27;fari fiqh set no such screening requirements; a Muslim&#x27;s history has no bearing on when and on whom to apply the sharia code for apostasy.

Still more requirements for convicting an alleged apostate are listed by other sources, including that the crime must be explained to them, and they must be given a chance to retract it, and that the accused must have been &quot;aware of the &quot;unilaterally and eternally binding nature&quot; of accepting Islam&quot;, and been aware of the punishment for apostasy (or any other hadd crime) at the time of committing the crime of apostasy. (Asmi Wood)

Judgement should be left to knowledgeable Muslims (according to Islam Question and Answer) not lay Muslims.
===Early religious schools===
There are disputes among different early schools of religious thought as to what constitutes sufficient justification for declaring takfir:

==== Sunni Ashari ====
The orthodox Sunni position is that sins generally do not prove that someone is not a Muslim, but denials of fundamental religious principles do. Thus a murderer, for instance, may still be a Muslim, but someone who denies that murder is a sin is a &quot;kafir&quot; if he is aware that murder is considered a sin in Islam. Ash&#x27;ari argued &quot;that it is the belief in the heart that matters the most&quot;. The founder of the Ashari school, Imam Al-Ash&#x27;ari stated that &quot;presumptuously declaring ... mortal sins, such as fornication or theft or the like, ... lawful and not acknowledging that it is forbidden,&quot; made the one declaring &quot;an infidel&quot;.

==== Khawarij ====
Kharijis or Kharijites &quot;are unanimously regarded as the arch-takfiris&quot; in Islamic history,
known for their takfir and assassination of rashidun caliph Ali after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, Muawiyah I, to decide the succession to the Caliphate. (arbitration being a means for people to make decisions, while the victor in a battle was determined by God). Kharijites believed that Muslims had the duty to revolt against any ruler who deviated from their interpretation of Islam or failed to manage Muslim&#x27;s affairs with justice and consultation or committed a major sin.

==== Murjites ====
Murjites (&quot;Murjiʾah&quot;: &quot;Those Who Postpone&quot;) believed that no one who once professed Islam could be takfired, even if they committed mortal sins. Judgment on whether those who committed serious sins were Muslims or kafir should be &quot;postponed&quot; (&quot;irjāʾ&quot;), and left to God alone. This theology promoted tolerance of Umayyads and converts to Islam who appeared half-hearted in their obedience.
It emerged as a theological school that was opposed to the Kharijites on questions related to early controversies regarding sin and definitions of what is a true Muslim.

As opposed to the Kharijites, Murjites believed revolt against a Muslim ruler could not be justified under any circumstances, and advocated passive resistance.

==== Mu&#x27;tazilites ====
The Mu&#x27;tazilites (followed by the Zaidiyyahs) advocated what they saw as a middle way between Murjites and Khawarij, whereby who failed to sufficiently perform their obligations were demoted to sinners (fasiq), but not all the way to infidel. On the other hand, &quot;it has been argued&quot; (according to Alam al-Dīn) that, &quot;the general Mu&#x27;tazilite conception of īmān is the view that the acts of obedience are essential for belief and whoever neglects these acts is not a Believer&quot;.

==Takfir of Christians and Jews==

Non-Muslims can also be takfired, according to Fayiz Salhab and Hussam S Timani, at least. An &quot;example being&quot; a hadith were Muhammad is quoted as saying 
*&quot;May Allah&#x27;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&quot;
Turning the graves of prophets into places of worship is a &quot;major kufr&quot;, and since an act of major &quot;kufr&quot; qualifies someone to be a kaffir, and since this was showing &quot;&quot;iman&quot; outwardly&quot; yet committed (major) &quot;kufr&quot; inwardly, they were guilty of turning their back on their religion for unbelief.

==History==
===Early Islam===
Some Muslims (such as Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of Wahhabism) believe that one of the earliest examples of &quot;takfir&quot; was alleged to have been practised by the first Caliph, Abu Bakr. 
In response to the refusal of certain Arab tribes to pay the alms-tax (zakat), he is reported to have said: &quot;By God, I will fight anyone who differentiates between the prayer and the zakat. ... Revelation has been discontinued, the Shari&#x27;ah has been completed: will the religion be curtailed while I am alive. ... I will fight these tribes even if they refuse to give a halter. Poor-due (zakat) is a levy on wealth and, by God, I will fight him who differentiates between the prayer and poor-due.&quot; Abu Bakr did not use the word &quot;kafir&quot; though.

The group known as Khawarij takfired and killed the Rashidun caliph Ali (601–661 CE), after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, Muawiyah I, to decide the succession to the Caliphate. They believed that &quot;judgement belongs to God alone&quot;, so that for human beings to arbitrate peacefully rather than wage war was making a decision rightfully belonging to God. In contrast, the victor of a battle was determined by God.

In the wars between the Umayyad Caliphate and the Khawarijs, the latter&#x27;s practice of takfir became the justification for their indiscriminate attacks on civilian Muslims; the more moderate Sunni view of takfir developed partly in response to this conflict. 
In the Umayyad and early Abbasid periods (roughly 661–800 CE), authorities &quot;appear&quot; to have defended Islam against apostasy &quot;mostly&quot; with &quot;intellectual debates&quot;.

During the Mihna inquisition in the Abbasid Caliphate which was instituted by the ruling Mu&#x27;tazilites, enemies of the Mu&#x27;tazila were considered heretics and disbelievers and were punished. The Mihna lasted from 833 to 851 CE.

In 922 al-Husayn ibn Mansour al-Hallaj was killed on account of blasphemy.

The celebrated Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī (d. 1111) preached against the excessive takfīr among theologians.

Maliki scholar Qadi Ayyad (d. 1149) is said to have been the first scholar to call for the death penalty for &quot;disseminating improprieties about Muḥammad or questioning his authority in all questions of faith and profane life&quot; (according to Tilman Nagel), setting the pace for later scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Taj al-Din al-Subki (d.1355).

In a study of 60 high-profile takfir cases in Egypt and Syria &quot;tried before the qadis of the four Sunni schools of law&quot; during Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). CE), historian Amalia Levanoni found &quot;more than half&quot; led to the execution of the accused. These individuals included Sufis, Rafidi, Shi&#x27;a, reverts from Islam, &quot;alleged blasphemers and sorcerers, rebels, political rivals and others, with charges often being trumped up.&quot;(Executions became more common and political during times of unrest.)

===Ibn Taymiyyah===
14th century scholar Ibn Taymiyyah takfired a number of Muslims and Islamic groups—the Mu&#x27;tazila, Shi&#x27;a Muslims, Sufis and the Sufi mystic, Ibn Arabi, etc. – he believed to have strayed from true Islam, but he is perhaps best remembered for takfiring the Central Asian Mongols (Tartars) who had invaded the Middle East but also converted to Islam. In a fatwa he declared that Muslims should &quot;combat ... those that place themselves outside the sharia&quot;, which the Mongols had done by continuing to follow their traditional &quot;Yasa&quot; law rather than sharia. 
The fatwa was important because the Mongols continued to attack after their conversion and the fatwa gave legitimacy to the Mamluk Jihad against them by &quot;rendering the Mongols apostate&quot;, not Muslims, and jihad against them obligatory. &quot;It is obligatory to fight them until they comply to all of the Sharia, even though they may utter the &quot;Shahaadataayn&quot;&quot; (i.e. the two declarations of faith – &quot;There is no god except Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger&quot;).

Living in a time when Islamic jurists tended towards docility in the face of injustice, Ibn Taymiyyah urged jihad against tyrants.
His fatwa created a precedent &quot;for the declaration of takfir against a leader&quot;, (according to researcher Trevor Stanley), and his fatwa was cited by at least one insurgent (Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj) as justification for killing Muslim leaders who did not follow sharia.

Ibn Taymiyyah influenced/impressed Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292–1350 AD) and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792 AD), and all three &quot;quoted frequently&quot; by the media of the contemporary Takfiri group ISIS.

===Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab===
18th century revivalist Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab cited Ibn Taymiyyah in his preaching and his followers slew many Muslims for allegedly kufr practices. Wahhab alleged that many Muslim practices that had become mainstream traditions were &quot;bid&#x27;a&quot; (innovation of the religion) and &quot;shirk&quot; (polytheism), and consequently many self-professed Muslims were actually unbelievers.

In the view of ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his followers (aka Wahhabis), 
&quot;shirk took many forms: the attribution to prophets, saints, astrologers, and soothsayers of knowledge of the unseen world, which only God possesses and can grant; the attribution of power to any being except God, including the power of intercession; reverence given in any way to any created thing, even to the tomb of the Prophet; such superstitious customs as belief in omens and in auspicious and inauspicious days; and swearing by the names of the Prophet, ʿAlī, the Shīʿī imams, or the saints. 
Ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s interpretation of Islam (aka Wahhabism) became enormously influential throughout the Muslim world starting in the late 20th century, thanks in large part to the financial power of Saudi Arabia which spent tens of billions of dollars to propagate his movement.

;19th and early 20th century
Some killings or executions of apostates from the 19th century up to 1970 listed by Rudolph Peters and Gert J. J. De Vries include the strangling of a female apostate in Egypt sometime between 1825 and 1835, an Armenian youth beheaded for reverting to Christianity in 1843 in the Ottoman Empire. Moslems in Afghanistan who converted to &quot;Ahmadiyyah&quot; condemned to be stoned in 1903 and 1925.
===After 1950===
According to Hussam S. Timani, both apostasy among Muslims and the number of Muslim groups &quot;adopting the concept of takfir&quot; have increased in recently (as of 2017). Timani states that Muslim scholars blame this on &quot;the decline of Islamic values and the loss of solidarity among the people after centuries of colonialism and foreign domination&quot;.

Takfir has become &quot;a central ideology of militant groups&quot; such as those in Egypt, &quot;which reflect the ideas&quot; of Sayyid Qutb, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi and others, according to the Oxford Islamic Studies Online website. It is rejected by Islamic scholars and leaders such as Hasan al-Hudaybi (d. 1977) and Yusuf al-Qaradawi and by mainstream Muslims and Islamist groups.

==== Sayyid Qutb and Milestones ====
In his highly influential 1964 book &quot;Milestones&quot; (&quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi al-Tariq&quot;), Sayyid Qutb embraced the principle of the fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah that Muslims who do not follow Sharia are not really Muslims, and extended it to argue that Islam was not just in need of revival but had actually fallen back into a state of pagan ignorance&quot; known as &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; and been &quot;extinct&quot; for &quot;a few centuries&quot;. While he did not specifically takfir or call for the execution of those governing non-sharia governments (he wrote &quot;Milestones&quot; in prison), he emphasized that &quot;the organizations and authorities&quot; of the putatively Muslim countries were irredeemably corrupt and evil and would have to be abolished by &quot;physical power and Jihad&quot;, by a &quot;vanguard&quot; movement of true Muslims.

==== In Pakistan ====
&quot;Takfir&quot; has been used against the Ahmadiyya, (a sect of self-described Muslims who believe the mahdi of Islam has arrived in the form of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (died 1908)) who many Muslims and Islamic scholars believe reject the doctrine of &quot;Khatam an-Nabiyyin&quot;, i.e. the belief that Muhammad was the last and final Prophet and Messenger of God, after whom there can be no other Prophet or Messenger. In 1974 Pakistan amended its constitution to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. In 1984, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the then military ruler of Pakistan, issued Ordinance XX, forbidding Ahmadis to call themselves Muslim. As a result, they are not allowed to profess the Islamic creed publicly or to call their places of worship mosques, to worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer-rooms, to perform the Muslim call to prayer, to use the traditional Islamic greeting in public, to publicly quote from the Quran, to preach in public, to seek converts, or to produce, publish, and disseminate their religious materials.

Local ulama (Islamic scholars) have declared takfir on another group in Pakistan, the Zikri of Makran in Balochistan. The Zikri believe that Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri (born in 1443) was the Mahdi (redeemer) of Islam. In 1978 the ulama founded a movement (&quot;Tehrik Khatm-e-Nabuat&quot;) to have the Pakistan state declare the Zikris as non-Muslims, like the Ahmadis.

====Faraj====
In 1981, President Anwar El Sadat was assassinated (along with six diplomats) by Islamists who had infiltrated a military parade he was reviewing. While it was assumed by many (especially in the Western world) that the killers must have been motivated by anger over Sadat&#x27;s making peace with Israel, a document found by police spelled out a different motivation. &quot;Al-Farida al-gha&#x27;iba&quot; (The Neglected Duty) by Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj the theorist of the group (Tanzim al-Jihad movement), proclaimed that jihad would enable Muslims to rule the world and to reestablish the caliphate, but the document explained that the specific reason Sadat had to be killed was that his government (along with all Muslim majority country governments) did not rule according to sharia. Faraj cited as justification the fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah (mentioned above) takfiring Mongols for not ruling by sharia -- &quot;combat ... those that place themselves outside the sharia&quot;; And also verse 5:44 of the Quran: &quot;And whoever did not judge (yahkum) by what Allah revealed, those are the unbelievers&quot; (later copied by Osama bin Laden).

==== Salman Rushdie ====

The case of Salman Rushdie provides an example of &quot;takfir&quot; that featured prominently in Western media. Rushdie went into hiding after Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, officially declaring him a &quot;kafir&quot; who should be executed for his book &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, which is perceived by many Muslims to contain passages that draw into question the basis of Islam. Similar cases have occurred in Egypt: for example, Nasr Abu Zayd was accused of apostasy following his work on Islamic sources, describing the Qur&#x27;an as a historical document.

==== GIA in Algeria ====
During the Algerian Civil War of 1991–2002 the Islamist insurgent group the GIA (Armed Islamic Group of Algeria) under amir Antar Zouabri issued a manifesto in 1996 entitled &quot;The Sharp Sword&quot;, presenting Algerian society as resistant to jihad and lamented that the majority of Algerians had &quot;forsaken religion and renounced the battle against its enemies&quot;. Zouabri at first took care to deny that the GIA had ever declared takfir on Algerian society itself. But during the month of Ramadan (January–February 1997) hundreds of civilians were killed in massacres, some with their throats cut. The massacres continued for months and culminated in August and September when hundreds of men women and children were killed in the villages of Rais, Bentalha and Beni Messous. Pregnant women were sliced open, children were hacked to pieces or dashed against walls, men&#x27;s limbs were hacked off one by one, and, as the attackers retreated, they would kidnap young women to keep as sex slaves. The GIA issued a communiqué signed by Zouabri claiming responsibility for the massacres and justifying them—in contradiction to his manifesto—by declaring impious (takfir) all those Algerians who had not joined its ranks. While the GIA had been the &quot;undisputed principal Islamist force&quot; in Algeria two years earlier, the slaughters drained it of popular support and led to the end of &quot;organized jihad&quot; in Algeria. (The issue became complicated by evidence that security forces cooperated with the killers in preventing civilians from escaping, and may even have controlled the GIA.)

====Osama bin Laden====
Osama bin Laden takfired the government of Saudi Arabia, his home country, in his &quot;Declaration of War&quot; (part I, October 12, 1996), for example, declared the Saudi government apostate based on verse 5:44 of the Qur&#x27;an because in his view the Saudi &#x27;don&#x27;t apply the Shari&#x27;a&#x27;

==== Tunisia ====
The constitution of Tunisia (passed after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011), criminalized takfir by placing a ban on fatwas that promote takfir.

==== Islamic State ====
The Islamic State has been heavily criticized for applying takfir to Muslims who oppose its rule. According to journalist Graeme Wood in mid-2015,

Following takfiri doctrine, the Islamic State is committed to purifying the world by killing vast numbers of people. The lack of objective reporting from its territory makes the true extent of the slaughter unknowable, but social-media posts from the region suggest that individual executions happen more or less continually, and mass executions every few weeks. The tendency of the group to target Shia Muslims with suicide bombings is due to the fact that the group considers them apostates.

====Salafi jihadis====
Shiraz Maher specifies that the major Salafi jihadist theorists like Abu Hamza al-Masri, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Omar Abdel-Rahman, and Abu Basir al-Tartusi ask to exercise caution while doing takfir, as declaring a Muslim unbeliever wrongly makes the one who accuses to himself get out of the religion of Islam and become an apostate himself.

<text>Sacred Records was a religious music record label founded in 1944 by Earle E. Williams.

==History==
Earle E. Williams, a minister of youth and music director in the Los Angeles area, decided to start a religious music record label in 1944 as a solution to the problem of obtaining the records he needed for his work, which included broadcasting a weekly half-hour radio program every Sunday at noon on local station KXLA. In a 1947 interview, Williams described to United Press International (UPI), &quot;I sold my car, ray dog, my wife&#x27;s spinet, a camera and a renovated church organ and borrowed the rest on a note to get the $3,000 I had to have to start production.

Based in Los Angeles, Sacred Records recorded and published religious music. The label merged with Kansas City&#x27;s White Church Records in 1949, and by the following year the company had opened new offices in Kansas City, Philadelphia, and New York. Composer and arranger Ralph Carmichael convinced the label to finance &quot;Rhapsody in Sacred Music&quot; (1958), an instrumental album that featured a full symphony, including four trumpets, four trombones, multiple french horns, woodwinds, a string section of at least 12 violins and four viola, two bass harps, and percussion. &quot;It was the first all-instrumental sacred music recording with that size orchestra&quot;, Carmichael said. &quot;It was a scary experiment and I nearly broke the record company.&quot;

Sacred Records was acquired by Word Records in 1963. Williams remained with Word as a salesman and distributor.

<doc id="962842" wikidata="Q14705797" url="?curid=962842" title="New Jersey Naval Museum">
<text>The New Jersey Naval Museum (NJNM) was a museum located along the Hackensack River in Hackensack in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. Its mission was dedicated to the state&#x27;s naval heritage and naval history in general. The prominent element in the collection was the ex-United States Navy , a long of World War II. The museum land has since been sold for redevelopment, however, the &quot;Ling&quot; remains grounded in the river, with an uncertain future. Efforts have been made since 2007 to find a new home for the &quot;Ling&quot;. In 2019, the Louisville Naval Museum began a campaign to attempt to relocate the ship to the Ohio River. In September 2020 volunteers associated with the Louisville Naval Museum began to raise concerns on social media about improper accounting of donations made to the Louisville Naval Museum. The volunteers ceased working with the Louisville Naval Museum after one of the volunteers suffered a serious injury while working aboard the &quot;Ling&quot; in November 2020. The injured volunteer was subsequently awarded a default judgement of $468,584 in a suit against the Louisville Naval Museum.

From 1972 until closing, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site. In January 2007, the North Jersey Media Group, owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated.

==Collections==
Prior to the closing of the museum, guided tours of the &quot;Ling&quot; were available to take visitors from bow to stern, exploring equipment, quarters, and weaponry. The weaponry on the &quot;Ling&quot; includes twenty-four torpedoes and one deck gun (it originally had two deck guns) for handling military targets too small to warrant the expenditure of a torpedo.

Volunteers maintained Japanese Kaiten IIs, a World War II manned torpedo; a German Seehund, a World War II German two-man coastal defense submarine; and a Vietnam War-era Patrol Boat, River (PBR), all of which the US Navy has since reclaimed, in addition to &quot;Ling&quot; and some torpedoes, missiles, and artillery shells. The onshore museum building contained a number of different and unique items ranging from a United States Navy SEALs delivery vehicle to personal photographs and effects.

==Closing==

After Hurricane Sandy the gangway was destroyed, leading to the closure of the sub and museum. Furthermore, the area was selected for a development project. The Naval History and Heritage Command has taken several artifacts after they were in a state of disrepair; with the remaining artifacts being housed by Harbor Freight Transport.

==Vandalism and burglary==

In September 2018, artifacts from the submarine were stolen, and the &quot;Ling&quot; was also flooded. Several people were identified in connection with the burglary.

<doc id="962855" wikidata="Q4784986" url="?curid=962855" title="ArcIMS">
<text>ArcIMS (standing for Arc Internet Map Server) is a Web Map Server produced by Esri accessible through a web browser. It is a GIS that is designed to serve maps across the Internet. Sometimes these maps are just static images allowing simple panning and zooming, while others are more complex pages. Examples of interactive maps served with ArcIMS include maps with layers that can be turned on and off, or with features containing attributes that can be queried.

== Implementation ==
The core of ArcIMS consists of a spatial server which processes most of the map-related services. On the server side, ArcIMS connector sits on top of a web server and ArcIMS component and Application server works behind the scenes. On the client side, the viewers can be thin clients, custom clients or Esri desktop applications such as ArcMap, ArcExplorer, or ArcPad.

ArcIMS uses Esri&#x27;s ArcXML to receive and respond to requests from the client.
The data behind ArcIMS is usually stored in Shapefile format (an open specification) or in an ArcSDE RDBMS database.

The Data Delivery Extension (DDE), an extension to the ArcIMS product, delivers data to users in a data format and coordinate system of their own choosing, in order to have access to data in a format compatible with their local GIS applications.

Esri no longer supports ArcIMS,
having replaced its functionality with ArcGIS for Server
in 2010 and with ArcGIS Online (AGOL).

== Version history ==
* 2000 June – ArcIMS 3.0 released
* 2001 May – ArcIMS 3.1 released

<doc id="962858" wikidata="Q1850420" url="?curid=962858" title="Responsibility assignment matrix">
<text>In business and project management, a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), also known as RACI matrix (; &quot;responsible&quot;, &quot;accountable&quot;, &quot;consulted&quot;, and &quot;informed&quot;) or linear responsibility chart (LRC), is a model that describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. The four key responsibilities most typically used being: &quot;responsible&quot;, &quot;accountable&quot;, &quot;consulted&quot;, and &quot;informed&quot;. It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes. There are a number of alternatives to the RACI model.

== Key responsibility roles in the RACI model ==

=== Role distinction ===
There is a distinction between a role and individually identified people: a &quot;role&quot; is a descriptor of an associated set of tasks; may be performed by many people; and one person can perform many roles. For example, an organization may have ten people who can perform the role of &quot;project manager&quot;, although traditionally each project only has one project manager at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of &quot;project manager&quot; may also be able to perform the role of &quot;business analyst&quot; and &quot;tester&quot;.

;&quot;R = Responsible&quot; (also &quot;recommender&quot;)
: Those who complete the task. There is at least one role with a participation type of &quot;responsible&quot;, although others can be delegated to assist in the work required. (See also &quot;RASCI&quot; below for separately identifying those who participate in a supporting role.)

;&quot;A = Accountable&quot; (also &quot;approver&quot; or &quot;final approving authority&quot;)
: The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, the one who ensures the prerequisites of the task are met and who delegates the work to those &quot;responsible&quot;. In other words, an &quot;accountable&quot; must sign off (approve) work that &quot;responsible&quot; provides. There must be only one &quot;accountable&quot; specified for each task or deliverable.

;&quot;C = Consulted&quot; (sometimes &quot;consultant&quot; or &quot;counsel&quot;)
: Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject-matter experts, and with whom there is two-way communication.

;&quot;I = Informed&quot; (also &quot;informee&quot;)
: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable, and with whom there is just one-way communication.

Very often the role that is &quot;accountable&quot; for a task or deliverable may also be &quot;responsible&quot; for completing it (indicated on the matrix by the task or deliverable having a role &quot;accountable&quot; for it, but no role &quot;responsible&quot; for its completion, i.e. it is implied). Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types. Where more than one participation type is shown, this generally implies that participation has not yet been fully resolved, which can impede the value of this technique in clarifying the participation of each role on each task.

== Assigning people to facilities ==

The matrix is typically created with a vertical axis (left-hand column) of tasks (from a work breakdown structure) or deliverables (from a product breakdown structure), and a horizontal axis (top row) of roles (from an organizational chart).

Another example from the maintenance and reliability community:

== Alternatives ==
There are a number of alternatives to the RACI participation types:

=== PARIS ===
:This is an early version of a responsibility assignment matrix, with the roles defined as:

:; &quot;Participant&quot;
:; &quot;Accountable&quot;
:; &quot;Review required&quot;
:; &quot;Input required&quot;
:; &quot;Sign-off required&quot;

=== PACSI ===
: This is a version very useful to organizations where the output of activities under the accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture.

:; &quot;Perform&quot;
:: The person/function carrying out the activity.

:; &quot;Accountable&quot;
:: The person/function ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and often the one who delegates the work to the performer.

:; &quot;Control&quot;
:: The person/function reviewing the result of the activity. They have a right of veto; their advice is binding.

:; &quot;Suggest&quot;
:: The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity.

=== RASIC or RASCI ===
:This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, less frequently known as &quot;RASCI&quot;, breaking the &quot;responsible&quot; participation into:

:; &quot;Responsible&quot;
::Those responsible for the task, who ensure that it is done as per the &quot;approver&quot;

:; &quot;Support&quot;
:: Resources allocated to &quot;responsible&quot;. Unlike &quot;consulted&quot;, who may provide input to the task, &quot;support&quot; helps complete the task.

=== RASI ===
:This is an alternative version of the standard RACI, foregoing the &quot;consulted&quot; participation and replacing it with:
:; &quot;Support&quot;
:: Resources which play a supporting role in implementation.

=== RACI + F ===

:This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with an additional participation type: Facilitate. This variation was introduced by Christophe Le Coent in 2012. Coent argued that the facilitator or coach role is important in agile software development environments and should therefore be explicitly included in the RAM. The use of RAM in Agile environments is considered contentious because some practitioners believe that everyone working in an agile team should be jointly responsible and accountable.

:; &quot;Facilitates&quot; 
:: Facilitate activities during a Scrum project.

=== RACIQ ===

:This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with an additional participation type:

:; &quot;Quality review&quot; 
:: Those who check whether the product meets the quality requirements.

=== RACI-VS ===
:This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with two additional participation types:

:; &quot;Verifier&quot;
:: Those who check whether the product breakdown structure product meets the acceptance testing acceptance criteria set forth in the product description.

:; &quot;Signatory&quot;
::Those who approve the &quot;verify&quot; decision and authorize the product hand-off. The &quot;signatory&quot; should be the party being &quot;accountable&quot; for its success.

=== CAIRO ===
:This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, also known as &quot;RACIO&quot; with one additional participation type.

:; &quot;Out of the loop&quot; (or &quot;omitted&quot;)
:: Designating individuals or groups who are specifically not part of the task. Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task&#x27;s completion as specifying those who do participate.

=== DACI ===
:Another version that has been used to centralize decision making, and clarify who can re-open discussions.

:; &quot;Driver&quot;
:: A single &quot;driver&quot; of overall project like the person steering a car.

:; &quot;Approver&quot;
:: One or more &quot;approver&quot;s who make most project decisions, and are responsible if it fails.

:; &quot;Contributors&quot;
:: Are the worker-bees who are responsible for deliverables; and with whom there is two-way communication.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: Those who are impacted by the project and are provided status and informed of decisions; and with whom there is one-way communication.

=== RAPID ===
:Another tool used to clarify decision roles and thereby improve decision making, is RAPID, which was created by and is a registered trademark of Bain &amp; Company.

:; &quot;Recommend&quot;
:: The &quot;recommend&quot; role typically involves 80 percent of the work in a decision. The recommender gathers relevant input and proposes a course of action—sometimes alternative courses, complete with pros and cons so that the decision maker&#x27;s choices are as clear, simple and timely as possible.

:; &quot;Agree&quot;
:: The &quot;agree&quot; role represents a formal approval of a recommendation. The &#x27;A&#x27; and the &#x27;R&#x27; should work together to come to a mutually satisfactory proposal to bring forward to the decider. But not all decisions will need an agree role, as this is typically reserved for those situations where some form of regulatory or compliance sign-off is required.

:; &quot;Perform&quot;
:: The &quot;perform&quot; role defines who is accountable for executing or implementing the decision once it is made. Best-practice companies typically define P&#x27;s and gather input from them early in the process.

:; &quot;Input&quot;
:: The &quot;input&quot; role provides relevant information and facts so that the recommender and decider can assess all the relevant facts to make the right decision. However, the &#x27;I&#x27; role is strictly advisory. Recommenders should consider all input, but they don&#x27;t have to reflect every point of view in the final recommendation.

:; &quot;Decide&quot;
:: The &quot;decide&quot; role is for the single person who ultimately is accountable for making the final decision, committing the group to action and ensuring the decision gets implemented.

=== RATSI ===
:Another tool used in organization design or roles analysis.

:; &quot;Responsibility&quot;
:: Identify who is in charge of making sure the work is done.

:; &quot;Authority&quot;
:: Identify who has final decision power on the work.

:; &quot;Task&quot;
:: Identify who actually does the work.

:; &quot;Support&quot;
:: Identify who is involved to provide support to the work.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: Identify who is informed that the work has been done (or will be started)

=== DRASCI ===
:A variant of RASCI developed by three Whitehall theorists (Kane, Jackson, Gilbert). This scheme is adapted for use in matrix management environments, and differs only from RASCI in having an additional role of &quot;Driver&quot; and a narrower definition of &quot;Support&quot;:

:; &quot;Driver&quot;
:: An individual or party that assists those who are &quot;responsible&quot; for delivering a task by both producing supporting collateral and setting timescales for delivery in line with the overarching aim of the individual or party who is &quot;accountable&quot; for the overall accomplishment of the objective. The distinction between &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;support&quot; lies in that the former reinforces and clarifies the parameters of the task on behalf of those who are &quot;accountable&quot;, while the latter refers to those who help those who are &quot;responsible&quot; in reaching a given goal.

=== PDQA ===
: A version developed at U Tokyo and MIT for model-based project management. The PDQA set of roles corresponds to demand for capabilities of teams. Roles include those for work on scope, handling of dependencies as coordination, and exception handling through error detection and decisions across a project organization. PDQA is used in agent-based modeling to simulate the supply of these capabilities by teams in projects.

:; &quot;Primary&quot;
:: Provides skill-based effort within capacity to complete scope and also manages dependencies through coordination.

:; &quot;Decision&quot;
:: Handles any decision, including scope acceptable and exception handling decisions leading to rework. (Does not generation nominal scope).

:; &quot;Quality&quot;
:: Reviews scope as it progresses to detect poor quality and escalates to decision-maker as so. (Does not general nominal scope).

:; &quot;Assist&quot;
:: Provides skill-based effort with the capacity to complete scope, in assistance to the primary. (Does not manage dependencies through coordination).

=== DCI ===
: A minimal set of decision-making categories used in organisation design or roles analysis.

:; &quot;Decision maker&quot;
:: Individuals who make the decision and is accountable for its impact on the business.

:; &quot;Consulted&quot;
:: Individuals accountable for providing guidance based on functional expertise and experience, highlighting issues and raising alternatives to support the Decision Maker.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: Impacted stakeholders are notified after the decision has been made and who will need to support the execution of the decision.

=== RASCEIO ===

To be used when working on governance, risk, compliance (GRC) and outsourcing matters: 
:; &quot;Responsible&quot;
:; &quot;Accountable&quot;
:; &quot;Support&quot;
:; &quot;Consult&quot;
:; &quot;Execute&quot;
:: Third parties contracted to execute activities in accordance with a service level agreement
:; &quot;Inform&quot;
:; &quot;Overview&quot;
:: Key GRC roles, such as risk owner, policy owner - where accountability is devolved, but a role is needed to oversee whether accountabilities all fit together

=== LACTI ===
Lead, Accountable, Consult, Tasked, Informed

== Variations ==

There are also a number of variations to the meaning of RACI participation types:

=== RACI (alternative scheme) ===

:There is an alternative &quot;coding&quot;, less widely published but used by some practitioners and process mapping software, which modifies the application of the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;A&quot; codes of the original scheme. The overall methodology remains the same but this alternative avoids potential confusion of the terms &quot;accountable&quot; and &quot;responsible&quot;, which may be understood by management professionals but not always so clearly differentiated by others:

:; &quot;Responsible&quot;
:: Those responsible for the performance of the task. There should be exactly one person with this assignment for each task.

:; &quot;Assists&quot;
::Those who assist in the completion of the task

:; &quot;Consulted&quot;
:: Those whose opinions are sought; and with whom there is two-way communication.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress; and with whom there is one-way communication.

=== ARCI (decisions) ===

:This alternative is focused only on documenting who has the authority to make which decisions. This can work across all sized workgroups.

:; &quot;Accountable&quot;
:: Authorized to &quot;approve&quot; an answer to the decision.

:; &quot;Responsible&quot;
:: Responsible to &quot;recommend&quot; an answer to the decision.

:; &quot;Consulted&quot;
:: Those whose opinions are sought, and with whom there is two-way communication.

:; &quot;Informed&quot;
:: Those who are informed after the decision is made, and with whom there is one-way communication.

<text>Hammerwood is a hamlet in the civil parish of Forest Row in East Sussex, England. Its nearest town is East Grinstead, which lies approximately west from the village. The village is situated on the High Weald, on the East Sussex-West Sussex-Kent-Surrey border.

==History==

===Early history===
The village&#x27;s name is derived from connections to the Wealden iron industry, and a reference to the hammer used in the furnace of the iron forge. A Romano-British iron bloomery (now listed as a site of historic interest) was located near the ponds to the south-east of where the modern village – which did not exist at the time – is located, and a blast furnace existed on another site nearby from at least the 1500s. Areas of nearby woodland are similarly named, including Hammer Wood, Cansiron Wood and Cinder Wood. The settlement was, for several centuries, the central part of an estate known as The Bower, and is believed to have comprised part of a medieval deer park.

===Development===
In 1792, a site to the south-east of the nucleus of the current settlement was selected by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and his commissioner, John Sperling, as the location on which they would build Hammerwood Park, a country house which was one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in Great Britain (it was Sperling who originally coined the name &#x27;Hammerwood&#x27;). Many of the buildings which form part of Hammerwood today were constructed in the 19th century as tied cottages to support the Hammerwood estate, which at that time consisted of 2,500 acres; Oswald Augustus Smith provided in 1864 for a Hammerwood Cricket Club; in 1873 for a village school for 100 children; in 1875 for the Vicarage, and in 1880 for St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Hammerwood – to the design of E. P. Loftus Brock – at the cost of £7,431 (the first vicar being Rev. Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge), as well as for a number of other buildings in Holtye and East Grinstead. On 9 July 1880, an ecclesiastical parish of Hammerwood was duly formed from portions of those of East Grinstead and Hartfield. The population of Hammerwood reached a peak of 438 in 1891. St Stephen&#x27;s Church contains a two manual pipe organ, built by the firm of T. C. Lewis.

===20th century===

The Hammerwood estate entered a period of decline after the First World War, and much of the village was sold off. In 1930, the owner of Hammerwood Park at that time (a Lt. Col. Pollen) provided for a Hammerwood and Holtye Village Hall, next to the Vicarage. There was also a Hammerwood and Holtye Women&#x27;s Institute, and a Hammerwood and Holtye Men&#x27;s Club (both ceased to exist in the 1980s). The Hammerwood County Primary School closed in 1959, and the ecclesiastical parish of Hammerwood was united with that of St Mary Magdalene, Cowden in June 1977.

During the Second World War, on 2 March 1944 a Heinkel He 177 of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Kampfgeschwader 100 on a bombing mission to London was shot down over Hammerwood by a Mosquito Mk XIII of No. 151 Squadron RAF at 3:15 am. Six were on board the German aircraft; four survived, and wreckage was scattered widely in nearby woodland. Hammerwood Park was requisitioned for use by the armed forces during that war, becoming home to 200 soldiers (including the cricketer Denis Compton, and a contingent from the Canadian Army). From November 1943, No. 660 Squadron RAF operated from an unpaved airstrip (RAF Hammerwood) to the east of the village, from which the SOE flew Westland Lysanders for a time. Flying ceased by July 1944. 

On 29 August 1944, a V-1 flying bomb which had been shot down by an aircraft came down in the village. After the war, Hammerwood Park was divided into flats and the remnants of the estate were purchased by Led Zeppelin. It subsequently became derelict, before being purchased by the current owner in 1982. A programme of rolling restoration continues.

==Hammerwood today==
The village now sits in the High Weald AONB, and development is thus strictly limited. The structure of the settlement, set along a lane from the A264, has remained unchanged for more than a century. Now more than 150 years old, Hammerwood Cricket Club continues to play friendly games on Sundays throughout the summer. It won the Hartfield Tournament in 1984. Hammerwood Park has been open to the public since 1983; tours take place at least twice weekly in summer, and musical events are held regularly. 

There is a Scout campsite at Hammerwood owned and operated by the Lewisham North District Scouts. St Stephen&#x27;s Church held its last service on 20 March 2016 (Palm Sunday), and the parish (which encompassed the villages of Hammerwood and Holtye) was dissolved later that year. That part of the former parish in Hammerwood were transferred to the parish of Forest Row and Ashurst Wood, whilst parts of the parish in Holtye were transferred to the parish of Hartfield. 

In November 2016, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport decided to upgrade the Listing for St Stephen&#x27;s Church to grade II* due to its architectural merit, preservation and connection to the historic estate. Additionally, the 1879 decorated gothic lych gate and church walls were newly listed at grade II. For a settlement of its size, Hammerwood thus has an unusual number of buildings of historic and architectural interest. The Bower House, a 15th-century timber-framed farmhouse, is listed at grade II*, its cottages at grade II, the Old School House, Brooklands, and Great Cansiron Farm at grade II, and Hammerwood Park at grade I.

==Geography==

==Transport==
Much of the settlement is set along a lane running south from the A264, which links the hamlet to East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and beyond. Gatwick Airport is from the village, whilst Redhill Aerodrome and Biggin Hill Airport are both within half an hour&#x27;s drive. Hammerwood Park has a registered unlicensed helicopter landing site for visiting pilots. The nearest railway stations are:

: Cowden, , with up to two trains per hour to London Bridge (from 45 minutes) via Oxted, and up to two trains per hour to Uckfield

: Dormans, , with two trains per hour to London Victoria (from 52 minutes) via Oxted, two trains per hour to East Grinstead, and peak hour Thameslink services to various London termini, and Bedford.

There is no bus service. Metrobus&#x27;s 291 service stops hourly adjacent to the War Memorial in Ashurst Wood (approximately 45 minutes&#x27; walk south from Hammerwood) with services to Crawley, East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and surrounding villages. Go Coach operates a thrice-daily 234 service from opposite the White Horse Inn in Holtye (approximately 45 minutes&#x27; walk east from Hammerwood) to Cowden, Edenbridge, Tunbridge Wells and surrounding villages as well as a daily 238 service to Cowden, Edenbridge, Chartwell and Sevenoaks.

<text>Robert Zemichiel (born 1 August 1977), known professionally as Afrob, is a German rapper and actor. He was born in Venice, Italy but grew up in Stuttgart, Germany. He began rapping in 1994, and has released nine albums since: &quot;Rolle mit Hip Hop&quot; (1999), &quot;Made in Germany&quot; (2001), &quot;Wer hätte das gedacht?&quot; (2003), &quot;Hammer&quot; (2005), &quot;Der Letzte seiner Art&quot; (2009), &quot;Push&quot; (2014), &quot;Blockbasta&quot; (2015), &quot;Mutterschiff&quot; (2016), and most recently &quot;Abschied von Gestern&quot; (2019). 

In addition to rapping, Afrob has also appeared in two movies as part of the cast: namely &quot;Leroy&quot; (2007) and &quot;&quot; (2009).

== Biography ==
Afrob was born in Venice, Italy to Eritrean parents but moved to Germany at a young age. He grew up in the German city of Stuttgart, which is where he started his rap career. In 1994, Afrob began his rap career as a featured artist for befriended rap crews such as the Massiven Töne, Freundeskreis (FK), and the Spezializtz. Afrob&#x27;s also gained early fame from his collaboration with Stuttgart Posses such as &quot;Die Kolchose&quot; and &quot;FK Allstars&quot; (et al. with Max Herre, Joy Denalane, Gentleman, and Sékou).

It was not until 1999 that he released his first solo album, &quot;Rolle mit Hip Hop&quot;. &quot;Rolle mit Hip Hop&quot; was distributed by Four Music and featured collaborations with the Kolchose, and the album peaked at spot 13 on the German album charts. The same year, Afrob released the single &quot;Reimemonster&quot; (&quot;rhyme monsters&quot;) which featured Hamburg City rapper Ferris MC. For this single, Afrob worked together primarily with musicians from Stuttgart (e.g. Wasi, DJ Friction, and Max Herre). Today, &quot;Reimemonster&quot; is still widely regarded as a German hip hop classic. In May 1999, Afrob arranged a tour with Freundeskreis, and in the fall of 1999, he toured with the Fantastischen Vier throughout Germany. At the end of 1999, together with Flavor Flav from Public Enemy and MC Rene, he rapped the song &quot;1, 2, 3, ... Rhymes Galore&quot; on the single by DJ Tomekk and Grandmaster Flash, which placed sixth in the German charts. 

His second album, &quot;Made in Germany&quot;, was released in 2001 by Four Music. The album was less successful, despite featuring acts like Gentleman, Wasi from Massive Töne, Max Herre, and Joy Denalane, and it peaked at spot 79 on the German album charts. This album was more pensive than the first, however, and was interesting due to its social criticism, epitomized by the release of the anti-racist single &quot;Öffne die Augen&quot; (&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;) with Frankfurt&#x27;s D-Flame. Afrob&#x27;s engagement with German racism continued with his participation in the Brothers Keepers project, collaborating with an all-star cast of Afro-German musicians in the single &quot;Adriano&quot;.

The Brothers Keepers project also marked the first collaboration with Samy Deluxe. They met again when they worked on the single &quot;Four Fists&quot;. They subsequently formed a group called ASD (Afrob und Samy Deluxe) and recorded an entire album together. The product of this cooperation was called &quot;Wer hätte das gedacht?&quot; (&quot;Who Would Have Thought?&quot;), which hit the stores in 2003. Today, &quot;Wer hätte das gedacht?&quot; remains Afrob&#x27;s most successful album, having reached fifth place in the German charts.

After the success of ASD, Afrob released his third solo album in 2005. The album, named &quot;Hammer&quot;, was produced by the American producers Needlz, Waajeed, and B.R. Gunna and released on 28 February 2005 by Four Music. The Album was not as successful as &quot;Wer hätte das gedacht?&quot;, and it peaked at number 38 of the German charts. 

In 2006, Afrob collaborated in the solo album of the German rapper Lisi, &quot;Eine wie keine&quot; (&quot;One of a Kind&quot;). In the following year of 2007, Afrob made his acting debut in the comedy &quot;Leroy&quot;. Later, he appeared in the 2009 gangster film &quot;&quot;.

In 2008, Afrob and rapper Brixx produced the title song for the RTL-Series &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei&quot;. In the same year, Afrob left the label Four Music and founded his own label named &quot;G-Lette Music&quot;. Lastly, Afrob began work on his album &quot;Der Letzte seiner Art&quot; in 2008, which was finally released in the September 2009. &quot;Der Letzte seiner Art&quot; reached a peak at spot 70 on the German album charts.

After a four year creative break, Afrob appeared in the German rapper Sido&#x27;s 2013 song, &quot;30-11-80&quot;. Next, Afrob&#x27;s fifth solo album &quot;Push&quot; debuted on 30 May 2014. &quot;Push&quot; came as a bigger success compared to Afrob&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Hammer&quot; and &quot;Der Letzte seiner Art&quot;. Push peaked at spot 20 of the German album charts.

On 3 July 2015, Afrob and Samy Deluxe released their second ASD album &quot;Blockbasta&quot;, which peaked at number five on the German album charts. On 23 September 2016 Afrob released his sixth solo album &quot;Mutterschiff&quot;, and in 2017, he released his seventh solo album &quot;Beats, Rhymes &amp; Mr. Scardanelli.&quot;

His most recent and potentially final album &quot;Abschied von Gestern&quot; (Goodbye to Yesterday) was released in 2019. In this album, Afrob discusses topics such as his relationship with rap and the hip hop community. Furthermore, the song &quot;Flüchtling4Life&quot; (&quot;Refugee4Life&quot;) addresses the xenophobia and racism Afrob has experienced in Germany.

Afrob is active on social media, maintaining a Facebook page, Instagram account, and a Twitter account among other forms of social media. On 21 April 2020, Afrob streamed a showcase on Facebook Live with DJ Derezon to raise donations for Stuttgart artists who were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Afrob is a long-time fan of football club VfB Stuttgart.

<doc id="962882" wikidata="Q716361" url="?curid=962882" title="Richard Hawley">
<text>Richard Willis Hawley (born 17 January 1967) is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s. He played with Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, as a touring musician for a short time. As a solo musician, Hawley has released eight studio albums. He has been nominated for a Mercury prize twice and once for a Brit Award. He has collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley, Shakespears Sister, Arctic Monkeys, Manic Street Preachers, Elbow, Duane Eddy and Paul Weller.

== Early life ==
Born in Sheffield, Hawley grew up with two sisters in a working-class area of the city. He was born with a cleft palate, which required numerous operations. Both of his parents were musicians; his father Dave Hawley was a guitarist with a number of local bands (on his death, the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; called him a &quot;Sheffield music legend&quot;), and his mother Lynne a singer. They divorced when he was 16 years old. He is a lifelong supporter of local football club Sheffield Wednesday. He noted that &quot;I always wrote songs since childhood&quot; and realising that &quot;you could actually make something up of your own was quite a big one then&quot;. He attended Hucklow Middle School together with future Pulp bassist Steve Mackey, and passed his O-levels. Hawley briefly worked at the local HMV.

While still at school, Hawley formed the Treebound Story and at the age of 19 recorded a Peel Session together with the band. Following the band&#x27;s split, Hawley briefly formed the Lovebirds releasing a single record in 1992 before being recruited to be guitarist in the Longpigs in 1993. Hawley was a member of the Longpigs until the end of the decade receiving critical attention and some, but limited, commercial success during the late 1990s Britpop era. As a member of the Longpigs, Hawley released two albums, &quot;The Sun Is Often Out&quot; and &quot;Mobile Home&quot;. After the demise of the band, he joined Pulp as a touring guitarist while also working as a session musician. During his time with both bands he was able to &quot;quietly hone&quot; his songwriting skills, citing that &quot;I was never really very good about bleating on about being a songwriter&quot;.

==Solo career==
=== Setanta (2001–2004) ===
Impressed by a home demo of songs written through the late 1990s, both Jarvis Cocker and Mackey urged Hawley to record the material. He used some left-over studio time to demo material and to experiment. Pointing out that &quot;I just wanted to make something gentle for myself – I never expected it to be released&quot;. He recorded a song per day, recording most of the instruments himself &quot;with a boom mike in the middle so I could walk between instruments – I mixed it in my head&quot;. His eponymous debut was a mini-album that featured seven songs and released in April 2001 through Setanta Records. It was supported by the single &quot;Coming Home&quot;. While Hawley played &quot;90% of the stuff&quot; he was assisted by former Longpigs drummer Andy Cook and Colin Elliot, who became his long-term producer.

Hawley later commented that &quot;I think with anybody&#x27;s early stuff you can batter it and take things apart. [With] doing those early records I was trying to get back to a way of being creative with recording rather than taking this dogmatic approach to it&quot;. He admitted that he did not get &quot;it right every time but I got what I wanted to achieve. It was to try and find something in the song. And also, with those early records, there was no money&quot;. Clash Magazine described it as &quot;a rather brief burst of seven mid-paced, ’50s-flecked moments of jangle. Listening back now, it’s easy to spot the early signs of the grandeur that was to come, especially on standout &quot;Sunlight&quot; amongst these tentative 22 and a half minutes&quot;. The cover of the album was shot in front of a bingo hall in Cleethorpes.

In 2001, &quot;Late Night Final&quot;, named after the cry of vendors selling the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press. Hawley later explained that prior to going into the sessions &quot;all I&#x27;d got was the riff to &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re My Light&quot; and that the majority of songs were written during the sessions. As an example he cited &quot;The Nights Are Cold&quot; that was done in one take after Cooke asked &quot;look, we&#x27;ve got a gig tonight, are we doing this or what?&quot;. Clash magazine called it &quot;a remarkably assured, often truly gorgeous, collection of warmly evocative lullabies&quot; singling out the songs &quot;Baby, You’re My Light&quot; and &quot;The Nights Are Cold&quot; as &quot;mesmerising&quot;. The album was produced by Alan Smythe.

Two years later Hawley released &quot;Lowedges&quot;, named after a suburb of the city. The &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Lowedges&quot; the &quot;first great album of 2003&quot; and it topped an end-of-the-year poll held by Virgin Radio. Of the two albums, he later stated that &quot;as those three records progressed you can see the band thing taking over more and more. By the time you get to &quot;Lowedges&quot; there&#x27;s less of me playing everything and there&#x27;s more of the guys. I was determined for it to be very ragged-arsed and not to be really polished and produced&quot;.

=== Mute (2005–2011) ===
After leaving Setanta Records in 2004, Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of EMI. Legal wrangling delayed &quot;Coles Corner&quot;, Hawley&#x27;s third album, until September 2005. Again, Hawley mined the theme of his home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. &quot;Coles Corner&quot; eventually gained a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2006. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album won the prize, exclaimed &quot;Someone call 999, Richard Hawley&#x27;s been robbed!&quot;

Hawley&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Lady&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (again named with a Sheffield reference, after a bridge in the centre of the city) was released in the United Kingdom on 20 August 2007. He performed a 16-date tour during September 2007 to promote the album. Merchandising on the tour included T-shirts and posters, but also special edition bottles of Sheffield-made Henderson&#x27;s Relish. The same year, Hawley&#x27;s father died after a long illness. Setanta re-released his self-titled debut in 2007 extending it with five additional tracks. He later commented that the release &quot;altered the flow, there&#x27;s a track on it called &#x27;Troublesome Waters&#x27; which is a cover of a Howard Seratt song and it&#x27;s the only time me and my dad featured together on a published recording. He plays rhythm guitar&quot;.

On 14 January 2008, Hawley was nominated for his first solo Brit Award for Best British Male Performer. Hawley was a headlining act at the 2008 Festival Internacional de Benicàssim in Spain. Hawley produced, with Colin Elliot, and contributed two songs to the album &quot;Made in Sheffield&quot;, a compilation of songs by the Sheffield-based songwriters for Tony Christie.

&quot;Truelove&#x27;s Gutter&quot;, Hawley&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released on Mute Records on 21 September 2009. The album won the &quot;Mojo&quot; record of the year.

His song &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Hung Up in Your Soul&quot; was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for 17 November 2009. and &quot;Open Up Your Door&quot; featured as the soundtrack song to the Häagen-Dazs ice cream TV commercial in the UK.

Hawley&#x27;s track &quot;Tonight The Streets Are Ours&quot; was chosen as the title track for the Oscar nominated 2010 Banksy film &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; which premièred at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010. This song regained popularity in 2022 when it was featured in an ad for Royal Enfield motorcycles. His 2011 song &quot;There&#x27;s a Storm Coming&quot; was used at the end of the film &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;.

&quot;You And I&quot; by Richard Hawley and The Death Ramps (aka Arctic Monkeys), was released as the B-side of the Arctic Monkeys&#x27; single &quot;Black Treacle&quot; on 23 January 2012.

=== Parlophone (2012–2015) ===

&quot;Standing at the Sky&#x27;s Edge&quot;, the sixth solo album, was released in the UK on 7 May 2012 through Parlophone. It was supported by the release of four singles, &quot;Leave Your Body Behind You&quot;, &quot;Down in the Woods&quot;, &quot;Seek It&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stare at the Sun&quot;. The four singles were collected on vinyl for the &quot;Singles Club&quot; box set. During the European tour in support of the album, Hawley broke his leg and had to perform in a wheelchair. In September 2012, &quot;Standing at the Sky&#x27;s Edge&quot; was nominated for the 2012 Mercury Awards. Hawley also featured in a BBC6 Music live broadcast with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, which took place at the Magna Science Park, Rotherham. In October 2013 he joined Cocker and Kami Thompson on the Bright Phoebus Revisited UK Tour. Hawley also provided vocals for the title track of the Manic Street Preachers album, &quot;Rewind The Film&quot;, released in September 2013.

In October 2014, his previous record company, Setanta, re-released the first three albums both on vinyl and CD. He also contributed a number of songs to the soundtrack of the documentary film &quot;Love Is All&quot; in 2014. In September 2015, Hawley released his seventh album &quot;Hollow Meadows&quot;.

=== BMG Rights Management (2019–present) ===
On 31 May 2019, Hawley revealed his eighth studio album &quot;Further&quot;, released by BMG Rights Management. A cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; was released as a download alongside three other singles in promotion of this album.

A musical based on the album &quot;Standing at the Sky’s Edge&quot; premiered at the Sheffield Crucible Theatre in March 2019. It moved to London in February 2023 at the Olivier Theatre and subsequently transferred to the Gillian Lynne Theatre in the West End in February 2024. It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical for 2023 and Hawley won award for best original score alongside collaborator Tom Deering.

In 2023 a compilation album, Hawley&#x27;s first, was announced, titled &quot;Now Then&quot;. The album was both a 22-track double vinyl and 32-track double CD album featuring Hawley&#x27;s own selection of key tracks and singles from throughout his solo career, including some songs re-recorded especially for this album.

Hawley&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;In This City They Call You Love&quot; was released in May 2024, and was preceded by three promotional singles: &quot;Two for His Heels&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, and &quot;Prism in Jeans&quot;.

==Session work==
Hawley has also worked with several musicians, including Hank Marvin, A Girl Called Eddy, and Jarvis Cocker (and his Relaxed Muscle project). He played the guitar solo on All Saints&#x27; cover version of &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;. On working with others, Hawley noted that he has always been asked to and he likes &quot;working with other people because you can get too absorbed in your own little bubble&quot;.

In 2002, Hawley produced the debut single &quot;So Young&quot; by Sheffield band Hoggboy, co-produced the band&#x27;s two albums &quot;Or 8?&quot; and &quot;Seven Miles Of Love&quot;, co-wrote second album track &quot;Hello&quot;, and also played on a cover version of Little Walter&#x27;s &quot;Come Back Baby&quot;, which was released as a B-side to the single &quot;Believe&quot;. Hawley also produced material by lead singer Tom Hogg&#x27;s next band The Hosts.

Praise from R.E.M.&#x27;s Mike Mills led to Hawley being approached to support the group on several concert dates in 2005. After contributing to Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s 2004 self-titled album, Hawley supported her on a European tour in 2005 and duetted with her on several of the tour&#x27;s concerts.

Hawley provided vocals for &quot;Bad Woman&quot;, a B-side to Arctic Monkeys&#x27; single &quot;Teddy Picker&quot;, released on 3 December 2007. He also co-wrote and provided vocals and guitar to the song &quot;The Fix&quot; on Elbow&#x27;s Mercury Prize-winning 2008 album &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot;. Hawley also performed the song with the band at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2008, on &quot;The Culture Show&quot; in June 2008, at Elbow&#x27;s homecoming gigs in Manchester in 2008, Wembley Arena in March 2009, Blackpool&#x27;s Empress Ballroom in March 2009 and at the MEN Arena in September 2009. He reprised his collaboration with Elbow on 17 January 2009 for a special recording of &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot; with the BBC Concert Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, which was subsequently released as a special edition CD and DVD set titled &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid Live at Abbey Road&quot; in March 2009. He appeared with Elbow on 19 March 2011 while the band were in Sheffield to perform &quot;The Fix&quot; during their UK tour.

Hawley&#x27;s song &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re My Light&quot; was included on the CD soundtrack for the 2008 film &quot;Nick and Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot;. Hawley himself made an appearance in the 2007 film &quot;Flick&quot;.

In October 2009, Hawley was joined on stage by Lisa Marie Presley in London for an encore; she sang vocals on a song the pair had been working on called &quot;Weary&quot;. The two embarked on a song writing partnership in which Presley wrote the lyrics and Hawley the music. Her album, &quot;Storm &amp; Grace&quot;, was released in 2012 and included the track &quot;Weary&quot; featuring Hawley.

Hawley worked again with Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys in January 2012, providing vocals for the &quot;Black Treacle&quot;&#x27;s B-side, &quot;You And I&quot;, which was released on 23 January that year. The band usually used the alias of the Death Ramps when working in collaboration with Hawley.

In 2024, Richard Hawley featured on lap steel guitar on the track Woke Up. Which was written by Paul Weller and was on Paul&#x27;s album 66.

== Style ==
Hawley&#x27;s inspiration has largely been found in his local Sheffield and 1960s rockabilly, he also stating that &quot;I&#x27;ve only ever wanted to make music that&#x27;s soulful, that has some depth and heart in it.&quot; From early on in his career he was &quot;really obsessed with things like Chess Records, Sun Records, the Bihari brothers and those records of that time were all done in the blink of an eye and it was about capturing a moment, and there was a degree of musical alchemy in all that.&quot; &quot;Clash&quot; magazine noted the &quot;Orbison and Walker comparisons&quot; attributed to Hawley&#x27;s early work. He described himself as &quot;a jack of all trades&quot; when commenting on his career as both a (session) musician and a songwriter, describing them as &quot;running parallel&quot;. The covers and names of his albums often reference his home-town: &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to live here in Sheffield and therefore it seems perfectly logical to write about it.&quot;

<doc id="962883" wikidata="Q3268963" url="?curid=962883" title="USS Bergall (SS-320)">
<text>USS &quot;Bergall&quot; (SS-320), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in commission from 1944 to 1958, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bergall, a small fish of the New England coast. During World War II she made five war patrols between 8 September 1944 and 17 June 1945, operating in the South China Sea, Java Sea, and Lombok Strait and north of the Malay Barrier. During these patrols she sank two Japanese merchant ships totaling 14,710 gross register tons and one 740-displacement ton Imperial Japanese Navy frigate. She also damaged the Japanese heavy cruiser , which was never repaired.

After World War II, &quot;Bergall&quot; served in the United States Pacific Fleet until 1950 and made a cruise in Alaskan waters and a deployment to the Far East. She transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet in 1950 and made cruises along the east coast of North America and to the West Indies, as well as two deployments to the Mediterranean Sea for service in the United States Sixth Fleet.

When &quot;Bergall&quot;′s U.S. Navy career ended, she was transferred to Turkey in 1958 and was commissioned in the Turkish Naval Forces as TCG &quot;Turgutreis&quot; (S 342). She took part in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. She was decommissioned in 1983 and sold for scrap in April 2000.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bergall&quot;′s keel was laid down on 13 May 1943 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 16 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Isabel M. Elkins, and commissioned on 12 June 1944 with Lieutenant Commander John M. Hyde in command.

==Operational history==
===United States Navy===
====World War II====
=====June–September 1944=====
&quot;Bergall&quot; carried out shakedown operations in the waters off New London, Connecticut, and attack training at the torpedo range near Newport, Rhode Island, until 3 July 1944. After returning to Naval Submarine Base New London at Groton, &quot;Bergall&quot; departed for the war in the Pacific on 16 July 1944. During her voyage to the Panama Canal Zone, she was near Puerto Rico when a United States Army Air Forces training plane crashed into the sea about away. She rescued the plane&#x27;s crewmen, who were uninjured, and took them to the Panama Canal Zone. After transiting the Panama Canal on 24 July 1944, she departed Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 28 July 1944 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 13 August 1944.

After arriving at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Bergall&quot; engaged in two weeks of crew training, firing nine torpedoes and taking part in a convoy exercise. She also entered drydock to replace a squeaky load-bearing strut before preparing for her first war patrol.

=====First war patrol=====
Departing Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1944 to begin her first war patrol, &quot;Bergall&quot; proceeded to the Mariana Islands, mooring alongside the submarine tender in Tanapag Harbor at Saipan on 19 September. On 20 September 1944, she headed west into the Philippine Sea.

On 22 September 1944, &quot;Bergall&quot;′s bridge crew sighted another submarine, which dived shortly thereafter. After clearing the area, &quot;Bergall&quot; radioed a contact report. While endeavoring to send a follow-up message on 23 September, &quot;Bergall&quot; had to submerge quickly when a Japanese Yokosuka P1Y (Allied reporting name &quot;Frances&quot;) twin-engined bomber approached and dropped a depth charge on her wake. As &quot;Bergall&quot; worked toward her assigned patrol station in the South China Sea off Japanese-occupied French Indochina, four more Japanese planes harassed her progress, delaying her arrival off Cap Varella until 29 September 1944.

After allowing five small ships to pass by, &quot;Bergall&quot; battle-surfaced on 3 October 1944 in an attempt to sink a 150-gross register ton Japanese cargo ship with gunfire. She surfaced at long range, about away, and her gunners opened fire with and 40-millimeter guns. The cargo ship took at least one hit and immediately turned for the coast. &quot;Bergall&quot;′s attack was cut short when a Mitsubishi F1M2 (Allied reporting name &quot;Pete&quot;) observation floatplane arrived on the scene and forced &quot;Bergall&quot; to submerge.

For the next five days, &quot;Bergall&quot; unsuccessfully patrolled the offshore shipping lanes before closing Phan Rang Bay on 8 October 1944. On 9 October, she sighted a 700-gross register ton Japanese cargo ship and fired three torpedoes, the first of which hit and completely demolished the ship. A postwar records review did not indicate any Japanese losses in the area, however, and &quot;Bergall&quot; did not receive credit for the sinking.

While operating close inshore on the morning of 13 October 1944, &quot;Bergall&quot; sighted what she identified as two Japanese cargo ships (one she estimated at 2,000 gross register tons and the other at about 1,000 gross register tons) farther offshore and accompanied by two small escorts. After maneuvering to seaward, she fired four torpedoes at the larger ship from a range of about . At that point, one of the escorts began to close &quot;Bergall&quot; rapidly. &quot;Bergall&quot; turned sharply, dived, and headed out to sea. Her crew heard two loud explosions and breaking-up noises, signifying the end of what turned out to be &quot;Shinshu Maru&quot;, a 4,182-gross register ton tanker. Over the next five hours, Japanese forces tried to retaliate, dropping 30 depth charges and four aircraft bombs in an unsuccessful attempt to sink &quot;Bergall&quot;. The patrol vessel &quot;No. 7 Taiwan Maru&quot; picked up ten of &quot;Shinshu Maru&quot;′s survivors

&quot;Bergall&quot; then moved farther south, cruising along a patrol line near Saigon until 24 October 1944. She then received orders to patrol the Balabac Strait near Palawan in the Philippine Islands. On 27 October 1944, while conducting a night patrol on the surface, &quot;Bergall&quot; picked up four ships on her radar. She closed rapidly and at a range of fired six torpedoes at a very large tanker, the 10,528-gross register ton &quot;Nippo Maru&quot;. Shortly thereafter, multiple explosions accompanied by a large sheet of flame indicated four hits. A cargo ship in &quot;Nippo Maru&quot;′s convoy fled into shoal water to avoid attack, and &quot;Bergall&quot; withdrew into Balabac Strait. Twenty minutes later, &quot;Nippo Maru&quot; disappeared from &quot;Bergall&quot;′s radar screen, marking her demise.

On 28 October 1944, &quot;Bergall&quot; cruised south along the coast of Sarawak, and she passed through the Karimata Strait on 1 November 1944. On 2 November, off the southern coast of Borneo, she came across a small sailboat loaded with cargo. After &quot;Bergall&quot; stopped to investigate, the sailboat&#x27;s native crew leapt into the water on the opposite side of the sailboat. &quot;Bergall&quot; opened fire on the sailboat with her 20-millimeter and 40-millimeter guns, destroying it. She then continued south, passed through the Lombok Strait. and concluded her patrol with her arrival at Fremantle, Australia, on 8 November 1944.

=====Second war patrol=====
After a refit and drydocking in the auxiliary repair dock , &quot;Bergall&quot; got underway from Fremantle to begin her second war patrol on 5 December 1944. She passed through Lombok Strait late on 8 December and cleared Karimata Strait on 11 December.

On the evening of 13 December 1944, while patrolling in darkness off the southern tip of French Indochina, &quot;Bergall&quot; sighted two Japanese warships — the heavy cruiser and destroyer — moving away from her at . She pursued them on the surface and, after slowly gaining ground for three hours, closed the range to . Very shallow water forced her to make an attack on the surface. At 20:37 she fired six torpedoes at &quot;Myōkō&quot; and turned away. Three minutes later, a terrific explosion rocked &quot;Myōkō&quot;, producing an immense sheet of flame that reached at least into the air. As &quot;Ushio&quot; stopped to assist &quot;Myōkō&quot;, &quot;Bergall&quot; lurked nearby on the surface, planning to fire a salvo of torpedoes at her if given the opportunity. At 21:00, however, as &quot;Bergall&quot; maneuvered closer, &quot;Myōkō&quot; fired two shells at her. One landed in her wake close astern and the other, an round, pierced &quot;Bergall&quot;′s forward loading hatch, tearing a large hole in her pressure hull but failing to explode. Evading two more salvoes, &quot;Bergall&quot; cleared the area with alacrity.

&quot;Bergall&quot;′s crew, believing they had sunk &quot;Myōkō&quot;, spent the rest of 13 December 1944 extinguishing electrical fires, cleaning up the debris caused by the shell hit, and stuffing the ruined hatch with mattresses to keep out sea spray. With &quot;Bergall&quot; unable to dive, her crew mounted all available guns and stood by to repel air attack on the morning of 14 December. After reporting her predicament, she received orders to rendezvous with the submarine , after which her crew was to transfer to &quot;Angler&quot; and &quot;Angler&quot; was to scuttle &quot;Bergall&quot; with torpedoes. After rendezvousing with &quot;Angler&quot; on 15 December 1944, however, &quot;Bergall&quot;′s commanding officer, Commander John Hyde and Executive Lieutenant Commander, Robert L. Ison, noting an absence of Japanese aircraft and a heavily overcast sky, decided to bring &quot;Bergall&quot; back to port on the surface and set course for Australia. The two submarines traveled nearly without incident, arriving at Exmouth Gulf on the coast of Western Australia safely on 20 December 1944.

&quot;Myōkō&quot;, meanwhile, battled the damage &quot;Bergall&quot;′s torpedoes had inflicted on her. Her crew managed to extinguish persistent fires on 15 December 1944 and rig a towline that same day. Over the next 10 days, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and the eight ships sent to help her fought stormy weather in the South China Sea in a desperate attempt to reach port. On 25 December 1944, despite severe weather that tore her damaged stern away, &quot;Myōkō&quot; limped into Singapore, denying &quot;Bergall&quot; a complete kill. However, &quot;Myōkō&quot; was never repaired, and remained at Singapore until she surrendered to Allied forces at the end of the war. &quot;Bergall&quot; received a Navy Unit Commendation for the night action of 13 December 1944.

=====Third war patrol=====

Repairs to &quot;Bergall&quot;′s pressure hull were completed in early January 1945, after which her crew conducted four days of training with new Mark 27 acoustic homing torpedoes. She got underway for her third war patrol on 19 January 1945 and commenced lifeguard duty in support of Allied airstrikes off Lombok Strait on 26 January. At 03:05 on 27 January, she picked up what she identified as an approaching Japanese patrol boat on her radar and took up a submerged attack position at a depth of . She flooded a forward torpedo tube and, when sound bearings indicated the range had closed to , fired one of her Mark 27 torpedoes at the patrol boat. A few minutes later, the crew heard one explosion, and the patrol boat slowly disappeared from &quot;Bergall&quot;′s radar screen. At daybreak, &quot;Bergall&quot; came across wreckage and a drifting lifeboat. Her crew picked up two prisoners and from them learned that &quot;Bergall&quot; had sunk a 174-displacement ton coastal minesweeper.

&quot;Bergall&quot; continued lifeguard duty in Lombok Strait, dodging ship and aircraft contacts over the next several days. On 29 January 1945 she fired another acoustic homing torpedo at a patrol boat, but this one missed. After several more days of fruitless patrolling, she rendezvoused with the submarine off Borneo, transferred the prisoners-of-war to &quot;Bluegill&quot;, and then continued west to the coast of French Indochina.

On 7 February 1945, while submerged off Hannai Point, &quot;Bergall&quot; sighted the Japanese convoy HI-93 off Vân Phong Bay, identifying it as consisting of two tankers guarded by four large escorts. Despite the twin dangers of a smooth and glassy sea and shallow water, she closed to attack. At about 09:36, she fired six torpedoes and minutes later heard three hits, but did not see the results of the hits because a nearby escort spotted the wakes of her torpedoes and bore down on her at once. The Japanese escorts started dropping depth charges almost immediately, with the seventh salvo coming very close. &quot;Bergall&quot; missed with the lone acoustic homing torpedo she fired in self-defense, and repeated depth-charge attacks pinned her down for the next three hours. Although she scraped bottom several times, the shallow water might actually have saved her, because many of the Japanese depth charges did not explode, presumably because they hit the ocean bottom before reaching their depth settings. Surfacing that evening, &quot;Bergall&quot; learned from the nearby submarine that the Japanese escorts had been driven off by a U.S. Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator patrol bomber. A postwar review of Japanese records indicated that &quot;Bergall&quot; had damaged the transport &quot;Toho Maru&quot; and sunk the 800-displacement ton Type C escort ship &quot;CD-53&quot;.

&quot;Bergall&quot; remained in her patrol area until 12 February 1945, when she received orders to rendezvous with the submarines and to form a coordinated attack group. She rendezvoused with &quot;Guitarro&quot; later that day, and &quot;Blower&quot; joined the pair early on 13 February. After that, the trio took up a patrol station off Cape Batagan, French Indochina. In spite of frequent dives to avoid Japanese aircraft, &quot;Bergall&quot; spotted a Japanese surface force composed of two battleships, a cruiser, and three destroyers just after 12:00 on 13 February. She closed to and fired six torpedoes before diving to escape. Less than ten minutes later, the first of 15 Japanese depth charges dropped near her firing position. She shook violently but suffered only minor damage. While she was submerged, her crew heard three explosions, signs that the other two American submarines were in on the attack. Records reviewed after the war, however, indicated that the Japanese warships suffered no damage. On 14 February, &quot;Bergall&quot; proceeded to Subic Bay on the coast of Luzon in the Philippine Islands for a refit, arriving there on 17 February 1945 and concluding her patrol.

=====Fourth war patrol=====

Following two weeks of repairs alongside the submarine tender , &quot;Bergall&quot; put to sea early in March 1945 for her fourth war patrol. In company with &quot;Blueback&quot; and the submarine , &quot;Bergall&quot; proceeded to the coast of French Indochina and took up a lifeguard station off Cape Varella on 7 March 1945. She stayed there, battling rough seas and dodging packs of fishing boats, until 15 March, when she headed north to rescue four American aviators spotted in a life raft. The Japanese gave &quot;Bergall&quot;′s crew several bad starts during this period, including one during which Japanese escorts randomly dropped depth charges nearby and two others in which Japanese submarines fired torpedoes at her.

&quot;Bergall&quot; moved to a position off Java on 8 April 1945, but more frequent Japanese air patrols forced her to submerge almost every day. Finally, she left the area for Australia on 14 April, arriving at Freemantle on 17 April 1945 to complete her patrol. She then underwent a refit in drydock which included a hull cleaning and repairs to a rudder that vibrated excessively and which brought her a new surface search radar as well as one 40-millimeter and two 20-millimeter guns. After that, she conducted sound survey and training maneuvers.

=====Fifth war patrol=====
&quot;Bergall&quot; got underway on her fifth war patrol on 12 May 1945. She cleared Lombok Strait on the morning of 18 May and turned west, passing south of Kangean Island. At 07:25, lookouts spotted a small Japanese coastal cargo ship creeping out of a nearby bay. Unwilling to waste a torpedo on such a small target or to put the gun crew at the risk of air attack, she closed rapidly on the surface and opened fire with both 40-millimeter guns. A dozen hits started a fire, and the cargo ship&#x27;s crew began abandoning ship. Just then, however, a Japanese plane approached, and &quot;Bergall&quot; submerged to avoid a counterattack. The damaged Japanese cargo ship escaped into Gedah Bay under this protective air cover.

&quot;Bergall&quot; proceeded through the Java Sea and took up a patrol position astride the Japanese convoy routes heading north from Singapore. Joined there by the submarines , , , and , she patrolled in the South China Sea off the coast of French Indochina. She also scouted the South China Sea during the Allied landings at Tarakan on Borneo. After a number of false contacts, she finally spotted a small Japanese convoy of five barges and two tugs in the early morning hours of 30 May 1945. The tugs tried to slip their tows and escape, but their maximum speed of meant that &quot;Bergall&quot; easily closed with them, and her gun crews sank both tugs and all five barges.

&quot;Bergall&quot; then searched the coast of the Malayan Peninsula, spotting a four-ship convoy deep in the Gulf of Thailand on 12 June 1945. Because of the shallow water, she moved ahead of the convoy to find a better attack position but was forced to submerge when a Japanese floatplane appeared overhead. She surfaced that evening and headed north along the coast in search of the convoy. Just after midnight on 13 June 1945, when she was near the Kra Isthmus, a powerful explosion to port — probably either a magnetic influence mine or a remotely controlled mine — severely rocked her. The blast knocked out power to her motors, sheared numerous bolts in the machinery room, and jammed her rudder hard to port. A strange smell briefly led to fears of a chlorine gas leak, but her crew soon traced the smell to a broken vinegar jug in &quot;Bergall&quot;′s galley whose smell had spread via her ventilation system.

Following temporary repairs, &quot;Bergall&quot; got way on, but the shock damage left her reduction gear noisy and full of asymmetrical vibrations. Unable to attack Japanese ships successfully in this condition, she turned north for Subic Bay, arriving there on 17 June 1945, bringing her fifth war patrol to an end.

=====June–August 1945=====
Ordered back to the United States for more extensive repairs, &quot;Bergall&quot; departed Subic Bay on 20 June 1945. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 to 11 July, and passed through the Panama Canal on 27 July 1945. She arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 4 August 1945 to begin a four-month overhaul. World War II ended while she was there with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945.

====Post-World War II====
=====1945–1949=====
Upon completion of her repairs and overhaul, &quot;Bergall&quot; got underway from Kittery on 1 December 1945. She conducted a series of post-overhaul training exercises before passing through the Panama Canal and reporting for duty with the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 18 December 1945. Assigned to Submarine Squadron 1, &quot;Bergall&quot; spent the next year, aside from one cruise to Guam in the Mariana Islands and back, operating locally in Hawaiian waters. In November 1946, she received another overhaul, which included the installation of a new surface search radar.

In light of the growing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union as the Cold War began, emphasized by President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s 12 March 1947 message to the United States Congress articulating American willingness to provide military aid to countries threatened by communism, the U.S. Navy began planning for a possible confrontation with the Soviet Union. One of the training measures devised to give submarine crews experience in case of such a conflict was the &quot;simulated war patrol,&quot; a mission upon which &quot;Bergall&quot; embarked in April 1947. Underway from Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1947, she headed north for a patrol in the Bering Sea. She ran into snow squalls on 8 April before arriving at Adak in the Aleutian Islands on 10 April. After a brief stop at Attu in the Aleutians on 14 April, she practiced maneuvers in the Bering Sea in late April. She conducted target practice against the Arctic ice pack on 20 April 1947 and carried out a reconnaissance exercise near the Pribilof Islands on 23 April. She proceeded to Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island in the Aleutians on 25 April 1947, then moved on to Kodiak on Kodiak Island, arriving there on 28 April. She then took part in antisubmarine warfare training with U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 10 (VP-10) in early May 1947 before turning south to arrive at Seattle, Washington, on 14 May. There, &quot;Bergall&quot; conducted several United States Naval Reserve training dives, a few more antisubmarine warfare exercises with aircraft, this time with planes from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island on Whidbey Island, and opened ship for visitors while in Lake Washington on 23 May 1947. Following another Naval Reserve training cruise on 31 May, she headed back to Pearl Harbor, mooring there on 8 June 1947.

Later in the summer of 1947, &quot;Bergall&quot; put to sea in company with the submarines and for a coordinated attack exercise against the battleship in the Hawaiian Islands. Taking up a position in the Alenuihaha Channel, the submarines attempted to intercept the battleship as she made a high-speed run between Maui and the island of Hawaii. Although &quot;Iowa&quot; enjoyed land-based air cover and tried to throw off her pursuers by several radical course changes, the submarines still achieved four &quot;successful&quot; mock attacks against the battleship, including one by &quot;Bergall&quot; from a range of only .

&quot;Bergall&quot; remained in Hawaiian waters, save for a single voyage to San Diego, California, for the Navy Day celebrations in November 1947, until 14 May 1948. On that day, she proceeded to San Francisco, California, where she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, on 7 June 1948 for a four-month overhaul. She received new batteries, a new sonar suite, and a motor overhaul before leaving California on 21 October 1948 and arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 October 1948.

In preparation for experiments to be conducted during her second simulated war patrol, &quot;Bergall&quot; took on board two scientists from Columbia University and installed gravimetry equipment inside her. Underway from Pearl Harbor on 3 December 1948, &quot;Bergall&quot; slowly proceeded southwest, diving at intervals to take underwater gravity measurements. She crossed the equator on 9 December 1948 near the Gilbert Islands and moored at Brisbane, Australia, on 20 December. On 27 December, she headed north toward Guam, and after taking more measurements every , she arrived in Apra Harbor on Guam on 7 January 1949. After disembarking the scientists and unloading their equipment, &quot;Bergall&quot; commenced two weeks of shore bombardment and antisubmarine exercises, including a mission against the light cruiser and the destroyers and in and around the Mariana Islands.

Departing for Japan on 20 January 1949, &quot;Bergall&quot; conducted more antisubmarine warfare exercises from Sasebo, Japan, and in the waters off Okinawa. She also provided target services to United States Seventh Fleet land-based patrol aircraft. During these exercises, her crew discovered that, at least during calm weather, patrol planes could drop sonobuoys near her and vector in supporting destroyers, who successfully &quot;pinned down&quot; the submarine. In rougher weather, swirling water smothered the passive sonobuoys with white noise and the submarine always escaped.

&quot;Bergall&quot; departed Okinawa on 15 February 1949 and, after a brief refueling stop at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 February 1949. She then conducted local operations in Hawaiian waters until May 1950.

=====1950–1958=====
On 6 May 1950, &quot;Bergall&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor bound foir the United States East Coast. She passed through the Panama Canal on 1 July 1950 and arrived at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, on 11 July. There, she was assigned to the Operational Development Force and soon began doctrinal and experimental exercises with United States Atlantic Fleet forces. In addition to local exercises, she conducted several training cruises up and down the U.S. East Coast. In September 1950, she visited Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Brooklyn, New York. On 6 June 1951, she embarked on a training cruise to the West Indies, visiting Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Havana in Cuba and Port-au-Prince in Haiti before returning to New London on 10 July 1951.

In August 1951, &quot;Bergall&quot; loaded 42 Mark 10 drill mines and, on 15 August, conducted a submerged minelaying exercise in Block Island Sound off Rhode Island. She then remained at New London until 8 November 1951, when she proceeded to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on League Island in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to commence a Fleet Snorkel Program conversion. There, between 9 November 1951 and 9 April 1952, shipyard workers installed a new streamlined sail and the air intake and exhaust tubes of the submarine snorkel system, allowing &quot;Bergall&quot; to operate her diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth.

Over the next two years, &quot;Bergall&quot; operated locally from New London and conducted two training cruises to the West Indies, where she visited the Bahamas, Cuba, and Key West, Florida. She also held three more minelaying exercises in Rhode Island Sound off Rhode Island, demonstrating the advantages of a snorkel-equipped submarine for minelaying operations. In addition, she participated in antisubmarine warfare training with surface ships and planes. During one such exercise, on the evening of 31 October 1954, the destroyer accidentally ran over &quot;Bergall&quot; while &quot;Bergall&quot; was conducting a simulated torpedo attack, smashing in &quot;Bergall&quot;′s sail, crushing her radar mast and snorkel head, and tearing out wiring and piping. As her pressure hull survived intact, she proceeded to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for repairs. After this work was completed, Bergall resumed her familiar routine of development exercises from New London on 16 December 1954.
=====1955–1958=====
As part of her routine operations, &quot;Bergall&quot; conducted a training cruise to Puerto Rico and Jamaica in January 1955, a minelaying exercise off Block Island off the coast of Rhode Island in March 1955, and tests with the Underwater Sound Laboratory at Bermuda in June 1955. Later that summer, the submarine began preparations for an overseas deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea.

Underway from New London on 9 November 1955, &quot;Bergall&quot; crossed the Atlantic Ocean and arrived at Lisbon, Portugal, on 20 November 1955. After a short visit, she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and proceeded to Nice, France, where she arrived on 26 November 1955. Over the next six weeks, in between various antisubmarine warfare exercises with units of the Sixth Fleet, she visited ports in Italy and Spain and familiarized herself with the waters of the western Mediterranean. She returned to New London on 28 January 1956.

In addition to her usual routine from New London, &quot;Bergall&quot; provided target services for the Sound School at Port Everglades, Florida, in May 1956, visited Halifax, Canada, in June 1956, and conducted more development exercises at Bermuda in August 1956. On 21 October 1956, she reported to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for an overhaul. While she was there, shipyard workers installed new sonar and sonar-related equipment.

Underway for her post-overhaul shakedown cruise on 7 June 1957, &quot;Bergall&quot; headed south to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for two weeks of operations and target services before returning to New London. In early July 1957 she turned south again, this time providing services to the Underwater Sound Laboratory at Bermuda. After she returned to New London on 22 July 1957, her crew carried out routine maintenance and other preparations for &quot;Bergall&quot;′s second cruise to the Mediterranean.

Departing New London on 31 August 1957, &quot;Bergall&quot; headed northeast across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in Rothesay, Scotland, on 13 September 1957. On 23 September, she turned south and, after a brief refueling stop at Portland, England, passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 7 October 1957. She spent the next seven weeks in the Mediterranean, conducting operations with units of the Sixth Fleet at sea and visiting Piraeus and Patras in Greece, Valletta in Malta, and Catania and Naples in Italy. She turned for home on 23 November 1957, arriving at New London on 7 December 1957.

After a cruise to Bermuda and back between 1 and 8 February 1958, &quot;Bergall&quot; commenced a longer training cruise to the West Indies on 26 February 1958. She conducted antisubmarine warfare exercises from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands until returning to New London on 28 March 1958. Other than a port visit to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in early May 1958, she remained in port until 14 July 1958, when she headed south to Key West, arriving here on the 20 July. There, her batteries were replaced, and the crew prepared her for transfer to Turkey under the Military Assistance Program.

Departing Key West on 26 September 1958, &quot;Bergall&quot; crossed the Atlantic Ocean, entered the Mediterranean Sea on 9 October 1958, and arrived in İzmir, Turkey, on 15 October 1958. She was decommissioned at İzmir on 17 October 1958.

===Turkish Naval Forces===
The submarine was transferred, on loan, to Turkey on the day of her decommissioning, 17 October 1958. She immediately was commissioned in the Turkish Naval Forces as TCG &quot;Turgutreis&quot; (S342), named for Dragut (1485–1565), known in Turkish as &quot;Turgutreis&quot; or &quot;Turgut Reis,&quot; an Ottoman corsair, governor, and pasha and Ottoman Navy commander. In the United States, she officially lost the name &quot;Bergall&quot; on 22 March 1965, when it was reassigned to the new submarine . After she had served on loan to the Turkish Navy for almost 15 years, she was struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1973, and she was sold to Turkey on 15 February 1973.

In 1974, &quot;Turgutreis&quot; visited the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and took part in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, known to Turkish speakers as the &quot;Cyprus Operation&quot; or &quot;Cyprus Peace Operation.&quot; She was decommissioned on 5 April 1983. She then was renamed TCG &quot;Ceryan Botu-6&quot; and served as a receiving ship, yard craft, and battery-charging hulk for other submarines at Gölcük Navy Yard in Gölcük, Turkey until 1996. She was sold for scrap in April 2000.

<text>USS &quot;Bergall&quot; (SSN-667), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bergall, a small fish found along the Atlantic coast of North America from the Chesapeake Bay to Labrador.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Bergall&quot; was awarded to General Dynamics Electric Boat on 9 March 1965 and her keel was laid down on 16 April 1966. She was launched on 17 February 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Ray C. Needham, and commissioned on 13 June 1969.

==Service history==

===1969-1984===

Ship&#x27;s Motto: &quot;Invisible, Invulnerable, Invincible&quot;

BERGALL is the second submarine to bear the name. The first was built by Electric Boat in 1944. During World War II, SS 320 made five war patrols and sank or damaged over 100,000 tons of enemy shipping. This is the reason for there being five stars on the SSN 667 Ship&#x27;s Crest.

The USS Bergall (SSN 667) was a STURGEON Class, especially designed as an anti-submarine weapon. Her keel was laid on 4 April 1966 and she was launched 17 February 1968. After completion of her sea trials she was commissioned on 13 June 1969. She became the 84th nuclear submarine to enter the Fleet and the 43rd attack type. Her assignment upon commissioning was to Submarine Development Group Two in Groton, Connecticut. This assignment was to fully test the Navy&#x27;s newest all-purpose sonar, the AN/BQS-13.

In 1970 Bergall became the first submarine to undergo the MK-48 torpedo conversion and in 1971 she was the first ship to carry the MK-48 torpedo in its operational warshot configuration. The AN/BQQ-5 digital sonar system was temporarily installed for test and evaluation in 1972. Bergall was awarded her first Navy Unit Commendation that year for her performance in the testing of the sonar systems and outstanding MK-48 torpedo proficiency.
BERGALL has earned the Navy Unit Commendation (twice), Meritorious Unit Commendation (Four times), and numerous Battle Efficiency (&quot;E&quot;), Anti-submarine Warfare (&quot;A&quot;), Weapons Proficiency (&quot;E&quot;), Damage Control (&quot;DC&quot;) and Communications (&quot;C&quot;).

Bergall was twice awarded the Commander, Sixth Fleet &quot;Hook &#x27;Em&quot; award during deployment to the Mediterranean in 1977 and 1982.

Bergall appeared in three movies – &quot;The Submarine&quot;, &quot;Topside Safety&quot; and episode 3 of the British TV series &quot;Sailor&quot; . In Sailor a medical evacuation from BERGALL was undertaken by a helicopter from the British Aircraft Carrier
HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;

Bergall was the first east -coast submarine to carry a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV).

Bergall completed 14 deployments and various exercises and operations vital to the national security of the United States.

1983 Deployed on North Atlantic Patrol for 3 months.

1983 Upon return to Norfolk, VA, SUBRON 6, she immediately resupplied then got underway for a second North Atlantic Patrol taking the billet left vacant by another sub, unable to leave the pier due to engineering difficulties.

Summer 1984 Complement of ships divers is made ready with qualification of crew members Matthew Cronley MM1SSDV, Curt Escher RM2SSDV and David Finch ET2SSDV.

October 1984 CDR Steven V. Mladineo turns over command to CDR Stephen Gibbs.

January 1985 Deployed for the North Atlantic then after refit at Holy Loch, Scotland sailed for the Mediterranean where she performed several patrols in support of 6th fleet operations.

April 1985 Refit Sardinia, Italy then returned to operations in support of the 6th fleet.

June 1985 Bergall returned home to SUBRON 6 Norfolk, VA after 6 months away.

She was inactivated on 4 August 1995 and decommissioned 6 June 1996.

===Collision with USS &quot;Kittiwake&quot; (ASR-13), 1984 ===
On 23 April 1984, the submarine rescue vessel collided with &quot;Bergall&quot; at Norfolk, Virginia, while &quot;Bergall&quot; was moored to the pier aft of &quot;Kittiwake&quot;. &quot;Kittiwake&quot; was getting underway for the first time since she had undergone maintenance, during which her main drive motor was re-wired improperly, causing it and the screw it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s bridge. This was unknown to &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s bridge personnel, who found that &quot;Kittiwake&quot; started to drift aft when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the motor drive speed in order to correct it and get &quot;Kittiwake&quot; moving forward, but unwittingly caused &quot;Kittiwake&quot; to move further aft and at a higher speed. Still not realizing that &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s main drive motor operating in reverse of what they expected, &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s bridge personnel then ordered another increase in &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern. This continued until &quot;Kittiwake&quot;″s stern backed into &quot;Bergall&quot;″s sonar dome.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Bergall&quot; was decommissioned on 6 June 1996 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 June 1997. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 29 September 1997.

<doc id="962893" wikidata="Q5947622" url="?curid=962893" title="Hurricane Frederic">
<text>Hurricane Frederic, known in Latin America as Federico, was an intense and damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of destruction from the Lesser Antilles to Quebec, in particular devastating areas of the United States Gulf Coast. Though only five were killed directly, the US$1.77 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage accrued by Frederic made it the Atlantic basin&#x27;s costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time. Prior to its final landfall, the threat that Frederic imposed on areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past. While the storm primarily impacted the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama, lesser effects were felt throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as inland North America.

Frederic was the thirteenth tropical cyclone, sixth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed from a tropical depression south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 28. Tracking at a steady clip westward, the primitive cyclone reached tropical storm intensity the next day. Favorable conditions in the open Atlantic allowed for Frederic to reach hurricane intensity on September 1. However, outflow from nearby Hurricane David began to inhibit further intensification and would continue to do so for roughly a week, weakening Frederic as it tracked across the Greater Antilles. The tropical cyclone nearly dissipated over Cuba before redeveloping on September 9 near the Isle of Youth. From then on, Frederic moved northwestward, intensifying to its peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico with winds of on September 12, shortly before making landfall at Dauphin Island, Alabama just below the state line between Alabama and Mississippi. Over the United States, Frederic weakened for a final time before becoming extratropical in Pennsylvania on September 14 and dissipating the next day.

Damage estimates vary due to inadequate reporting of private insurance claims as well as lack of hard data on uninsured damage; Frederic is believed to have inflicted $5 million (1979 USD) in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with an additional $1.7 billion in damage on the mainland United States. FEMA, which had been established only three months before Frederic hit, was the focal point for nearly $250 million in federal aid for recovery, $188 million of which went to Alabama (1979 USD). In southern Alabama, the landscape was changed for years, with thousands of tall pine trees tilted and leaning northwest.

==Meteorological history==

The precursor to Hurricane Frederic emerged as a loosely defined tropical wave off the west coast of Africa late on August 27. The following day, satellite images indicated that the tropical wave had become more defined, and was beginning to show signs of cyclonic rotation. At 0600 UTC on August 29, the National Hurricane Center  classified the system as a tropical depression based on observational data from ships nearby in conjunction with satellite images. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone, the depression moved at an unusually rapid pace westward, gradually curving towards the west-northwest and slowly intensifying in ideal conditions. At 1200 UTC on August 30, the tropical depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and thus named &quot;Frederic&quot;. Intensification continued after the storm&#x27;s upgrade, and early on September 1, Frederic developed an eye, prompting the NHC to further upgrade the tropical cyclone to hurricane status at 0600 UTC that day.

Frederic only maintained hurricane intensity for roughly eighteen hours over the open waters of the Atlantic on September 1 before outflow from nearby Hurricane David began to adversely affect the tropical cyclone. At 0000 UTC on September 2, Frederic weakened back to tropical storm strength while it was still well east of the Lesser Antilles. This weakening phase continued as Frederic began to assume a more westerly track and slow in forward motion. On September 4, Frederic tracked over the Virgin Islands before making landfall on Puerto Rico later that day with maximum sustained winds of . Frederic&#x27;s interaction with Puerto Rico greatly disrupted the low-level circulation contained within the tropical cyclone, enhancing the weakening effects of Hurricane David&#x27;s outflow. After passing over the island, the tropical storm briefly took a southwest course before curving into Hispaniola on September 6, inducing additional disruption within Frederic. At 1800 UTC that day, Frederic was downgraded to tropical depression status north of Haiti. Frederic remained a tropical depression for two days as it tracked into and then parallel to the southern coast of Cuba beginning on September 7. During this time, Hurricane David had tracked far into the Northeastern United States, and as a result its inhibiting effects of intensification ceased. At 0000 UTC on September 9, Frederic regained tropical storm intensity while located roughly /h) east of the Isle of Youth. The following day, the cyclone tracked over western Cuba as it gradually curved towards the northwest.

Favorable conditions, marked by very warm sea surface temperatures as high as 86 °F (30 °C) and the presence of a large anticyclone over the system, allowed Frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of Cuba, despite proximity to land. Frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the Gulf of Mexico in early September, intensifying in a highly conducive environment. By 1800 UTC on September 10, the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central Atlantic. At 0000 UTC on September 12, Frederic attained major hurricane status over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg) and sustained winds of , making the cyclone a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Moving gradually faster in the Gulf of Mexico, Frederic eventually made two landfalls – one on Dauphin Island and the other near the border between Alabama and Mississippi – with a virtually unchanged intensity. Tracking rapidly northward, Frederic began to weaken due to land interaction, and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near Meridian, Mississippi on September 13. At around the same time, the cyclone began to curve northeastward, eventually merging with an extratropical cyclone in southwestern Pennsylvania by 1800 UTC on September 14. These extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the Mid-Atlantic states and New England before they were last officially documented by the NHC in New Brunswick on September 15. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre still considered the cyclone active up until the storm entered the Labrador Sea on September 16.

==Preparations==

The first tropical cyclone watches and warnings issued in association with Frederic were on September 3, when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning and gale warning for several islands of the Lesser Antilles stretching from Dominica to the northern Leeward Islands. Residents of Charlotte Amalie in the United States Virgin Islands were urged by governor Juan Francisco Luis to move to 24 emergency shelters. Luis also mobilized a company of the Virgin Islands National Guard to expedite evacuations and protect emptied residences and other buildings from looting. Further south in Dominica, Melville Hall Airport was forced to close due to the presence of gale-force winds, delaying relief efforts following Hurricane David.

Despite having weakened to a tropical storm by the time Frederic moved over the Virgin Islands, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Puerto Rico on September 4. As precautionary measures, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and schools closed for the duration of the storm. Hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate from Toa Baja for the second time in just four days due to the threat of flooding rivers. In Trujillo Alto, a dike was relieved in order to mitigate potential flooding. After its track across Puerto Rico, gale warnings were issued for portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. No watches or warnings were issued by the NHC for any areas while Frederic was classified as a tropical depression over the Greater Antilles. However, small craft warnings were posted for some coastal regions off of Miami, Florida due to strong winds caused by the nearby tropical cyclone.

After Frederic reattained hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, a gale warning were issued for the Dry Tortugas; this was the first NHC warning issued in association with the newly developed tropical cyclone. Not long after, a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from Panama City, Florida to Vermilion Bay in Louisiana. Although forecasts showed that Frederic posed no threat to Sarasota, Florida, the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to Sarasota County&#x27;s 58 emergency shelters. Municipality managers were asked to place their respective emergency personnel on standby. In Key West, Florida, city workers had shortened workdays while the storm moved close by.
Up to 500,000 were evacuated from the U.S. Gulf Coast in anticipation of Frederic&#x27;s arrival.
==Impact==
===Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico===
Effects from Frederic were first felt on the outward facing Leeward Islands. In Antigua, the threat of widespread power outages forced the insular government to shut down power. A peak gust of was documented on the island as a result of the storm. These strong winds also unroofed some buildings. Strong winds and rain were felt in Guadeloupe, Barbuda, and a number of other islands, but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations.

In St. Maarten, these strong winds toppled a radio antenna. Flowing floodwaters washed away plentiful food crops in the island. Some homes were damaged and others destroyed on the adjacent Sint Maarten. Off of the island, seven Japanese people were killed after their fishing boat sank during the storm.

Power outages knocked out electricity to half of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and downed telephone lines. Rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads. Offshore, the yacht &quot;Princess&quot; blew out into sea, prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew.

As a tropical storm, Frederic dropped heavy rain across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Despite having weakened from its prior hurricane intensity, the storm still brought gale-force winds coupled with gusts as strong as to the area. Three apartments in the same apartment complex on St. Thomas were unroofed, displacing roughly 50 families. Electricity was deliberately cut during the late night hours to prevent the spread of power outages. The entirety of the U.S. Virgin Islands reported numerous felled trees and downed utility lines as a result of the strong winds. Wind damage on nearby Puerto Rico was of only minor extent and much less severe than in the Virgin Islands. However, torrential precipitation accounted for most of the damage, as the passage of Hurricane David less than a week earlier saturated soils, priming the area for floods induced by the passage of Frederic. Rainfall peaked at around in 12 hours in Puerto Rico and in 30 hours in St. Croix. 
All rivers in southeastern Puerto Rico swelled and produce significant flooding in adjacent floodplains. The discharge of the Rio Santiago near Naguabo reached 100-year levels. These floods partially inundated several cities, submerged crops, and damaged numerous roads. Major arterial roads to and from Ponce were blocked by floodwater and landslide debris. Some portions of Puerto Rico Highway 3 were submerged by water from both the torrential rain and wave action. Damage from Frederic in Puerto Rico reached at least US$5 million, though western Puerto Rico sustained minimal damage from the storm. In St. Thomas, four small homes were destroyed by flooding, and an additional 50 sustained at least partial damage. One waterspout was reported off the coast, but did no damage. Normally dry coastal guts in St. Croix filled with floodwater from Frederic, damaging homes and other buildings in five communities on St. Croix. Culverts, bridges, and heavy beach erosion resulted from rough surf off the coast of the island. The floods generated various sewage problems. Damage in Virgin Islands also reached at least US$5 million, similar to Puerto Rico.

===Hispaniola and Cuba===
Heavy rains buffeted the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba for several days as Frederic, albeit disorganized, tracked over the Greater Antilles. As with Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, precipitation damage was exacerbated by the recent passage of Hurricane David. In Guantánamo on Cuba&#x27;s eastern Atlantic coast, at least of rainfall was reported. Frederic continued to produce strong winds even as a weak tropical depression south of Cuba, as sustained winds of were clocked in Santa Cruz del Sur on September 7. However, damage from Frederic in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba remained minimal.

Frederic&#x27;s landfall on western Cuba as a redeveloped tropical cyclone was much more significant than its first Cuban landfall. Sustained winds peaked at in Bahía Honda, Cuba on September 10. Despite recent renovations at José Martí International Airport, the lack of a proper drainage system allowed rainfall to inundate the airport, stranding several heads of state that were scheduled to hold a summit and disrupting air traffic to and from the airport for an entire week. Heavy precipitation triggered numerous landslides, causing severe damage to infrastructure and over 250 dwellings. Areas at risk for additional landslide activity were declared inhospitable, resulting in the evacuation of 1,200 people. Rainfall estimates in Cuba peaked at . A lack of damage reports was evident from western Cuba following Frederic&#x27;s landfall, though damage estimates were high.

===United States===

Storm surge damage was reported along 80 miles of coastline from Mississippi to Florida, with tides above the normal level being observed. Five deaths were directly attributed to Frederic in the United States, four of which occurred inland: a person swept from a boat near Pensacola was the only casualty along the coast. In total, Frederic was responsible for $1.7 billion in damages. This made Frederic the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States at the time; the figure was not surpassed until Hurricane Alicia in 1983. Frederic also dumped heavy rainfall across much of the eastern United States. Over a dozen tornadoes were also reported in Frederic&#x27;s wake. However, these had minimal impact.

====Florida====
As Frederic was strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico, strong winds were reported in the Florida Keys. A station on the Dry Tortugas recorded a wind gust on September 10; this was stronger than any other Florida wind gust measurement in association with Frederic. A station in Key West, Florida clocked at wind gust, coupled with sustained winds of . Tides in the Dry Tortugas peaked at , roughly above normal. Rainfall from the extremities of the hurricane reached South Florida, with some rainfall totals exceeding .

====Alabama====
Frederic made landfall at Dauphin Island, Alabama and continued across to a point on the Alabama/Mississippi state line near Bayou La Batre, Alabama.
Near-total property damage occurred along the Alabama coastline between Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores, the latter seeing 80% of its buildings completely destroyed. The causeway linking Dauphin Island to the mainland was swept away in many areas. Alabama&#x27;s second-largest city (at that time), Mobile, Alabama suffered extensive damage as well. Wind damage was also severe, especially across southern Alabama. Hurricane-force gusts were felt as far inland as Choctaw County. Structural failure was widespread in the immediate landfall area with industrial, residential and governmental buildings as well as hospitals suffering heavy damage. Nearly 90% of the Mobile area lost electricity, and the historic City Hall experienced heavy roof damage. Many small beach houses were completely destroyed by high winds before the storm surge could add any effects. Tree damage with broken limbs was extensive, leaving thousands of tall pine trees all tilted, leaning in the direction of the wind. 11 Alabama counties were declared disaster areas.

====Mississippi====
About of rain fell in Jackson County, Mississippi around Biloxi and Pascagoula. 16 Mississippi counties were declared disaster areas; the most in the United States. Hurricane-force winds were felt as far northward as Meridian, Mississippi.

===Canada===
Frederic dropped heavy rain across Canada as an extratropical storm, peaking at near Ottawa, Ontario. Record precipitation was recorded at the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, which documented of rain on September 15. Rainfall spread as far northeast as the eastern coast of Labrador. Flooding occurred in eastern Ontario and portions of the Niagara Peninsula, as noted in Cornwall. In Toronto, the rains led to a seven-car traffic collision and a separate car accident that injured two. Flooding also took place in southern Quebec, with floodwater submerging streets, basements, and underground parking lots in Montreal. Damage from southern Quebec reached C$8.238 million (US$7.095 million).

==Aftermath==

Eleven counties in Alabama, 16 in Mississippi, and five in Florida were declared eligible for disaster aid.

In retrospect, Frederic has been credited with spurring redevelopment in Mobile and the surrounding Gulf Coast region. For example, in testimony before Congress
in 1992, Robert Sheets (then the director of the National Hurricane Center), described the economic aftermath of Frederic:

Prior to Hurricane Frederic, there was one condominium complex on Gulf Shores, Alabama. Most of the homes were single, individual homes built behind the sand dunes. Today, where there used to be one condominium, there are now at least 104 complexes – not units, complexes – on Gulf Shores, Alabama.

===Retirement===

Because of extensive destruction caused by the hurricane, the name &quot;Frederic&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1980, and it will not be used again to name a tropical system in the North Atlantic. It was replaced with &quot;Fabian&quot; for the 1985 season.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The New War,&quot; the first Mack Bolan novel after Don Pendleton turned over Executioner series to Gold Eagle, is set during Hurricane Frederic with the storm&#x27;s devastation having a major effect on the story.

The Abyss, a novel by Orson Scott Card, made into a 1989 film, directed and written by James Cameron features Hurricane Frederick, although those events take place 10 years later.

The Elementals, the 1981 novel by Michael McDowell, references Hurricane Frederic in its conclusion.

<doc id="962894" wikidata="Q319787" url="?curid=962894" title="Považská Bystrica">
<text>Považská Bystrica (; ; ) is a town in northwestern Slovakia. It is located on the Váh river, around 30 km from the city of Žilina. It belongs to Upper Váh region of tourism.

== Profile ==
Považská Bystrica is situated in a fold of mountain ranges Strážovské vrchy (1213 m) and Javorníky (1071 m a.s.l.). Mountains offer an attractive experience to trekkers and mountain-bikers in summer season, cross-country and skiing opportunities in winter season. Veľký Manín mountain (890 m a.s.l.) dominates the town skyline providing views from most places in the town. On the hill next to the town on the opposite side of the river Váh lies the ruins of Považský hrad castle with two manor houses beneath, to which the town&#x27;s history is closely bounded.

Another popular tourist attraction close to the town is a breathtaking canyon Manínska tiesňava. Canyon splits Veľký and Malý Manín mountains. It is an internationally sought-after place-to-die for rock climbers. It is also less known as one of the filming sites for &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; in 1984. Just a few kilometers away lies another highly challenging reef formation: Súľovské skaly. To sum it up one of the most famous Slovak spas Rajecké Teplice lies about 20 km from the town, few kilometres closer are the youngest spas in Slovakia in Nimnica.
Town has mostly postmodern architecture meaning that most of the pre-20th-century buildings were replaced in the 1960s and 1980s.

Považská Bystrica lies on the major traffic route Bratislava - Žilina causing many traffic jams in the recent years. The motorway viaduct was built through the narrowest segment of the town, which was opened on 31 May 2010.

Považská Bystrica has one twin town Rožnov pod Radhoštěm in the Czech Republic.

==History==

The roots of the settlement of the town connect to Baden culture, in addition to Celtic coins were found on the castle cliff supporting the presence of previous settlers. However, the first written reference to the town comes from 1316, in connection with Matthew III Csák. The next known reference about Považská Bystrica is dated 13 July 1330. In 1432, the town was burned by Hussite troops. The history of the town is very closely connected with the nearby Považský hrad castle, built in the 13th century. The most famous owners of the Bystrica castle and the land were knights Ján and Rafael Podmanitzky, known for their robberies. The family of Podmanicki became rulers of the town in 1458 when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary donated the castle, the town, and 16 surrounding villages to Ladislav Podmanitzky. During their reign, which lasted almost 100 years, the town was flourishing. This was supported by an important document, the Articuli Podmanickyani, which stated the statute of the town and established old Slovak language as the only official language among congildones. No other town, except Považská Bystrica and Varín, had a statute with such provision regarding language use.
As an example of the language could be used engraving on the tombstone of Rafael Podmanitzky in the Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Považská Bystrica.

The next one hundred years were hard for the town and the region, because of upheavals of several Hungarian noblemen. The town was plundered by troops of Stephen Bocskai (1604), Emeric Thököly (1679), Bereczényi and Očkay (1707). Despite the hard times, the town obtained more and more privileges from Hungarian kings during the period, and it had a significantly higher status than the surrounding countryside. This ended in 1886, when a new Hungarian legislation canceled all the privileges.

In 1918, the town became part of the Czechoslovak Republic. In 1929, an ammunition plant Roth transferred its production from Bratislava to Považská Bystrica, which significantly improved the employment situation. Starting in 1937 and continuing until 1945 rifles (vz.24 and K98k) and small arms ammunition were manufactured here. After World War II the munitions factory at Považská Bystrica continued to produce weapons and ammunition for both the military and for commercial purposes.

Since World War II, and especially in the 1970s and 1980s, the town grew significantly. New residential areas were built around the tiny town center. The town center itself was re-built completely, therefore you can hardly find any historical buildings there now. The main employer since the second world war was the engineering plant Považské strojárne. The plant mainly manufactured scooters and industrial bearings. Since the end of socialism, the company has not prospered. This has caused increased unemployment.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 42,733 inhabitants. 97.72% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 1.01% Czechs. The religious make-up was 81.10% Roman Catholics, 12.18% people with no religious affiliation, and 2.56% Lutherans.

==Interesting places==

=== Places of history ===

==== Považský hrad ====
&quot;Považský hrad&quot; is a landmark of the town and witness of the history (e.g., Celtic coins were found on the castle cliff). It went through many reconstructions, therefore it represents many different architectural movements. The towers of the town were accepted as the symbols to the coat of arms of the town. Nowadays some minor works are done on the castle by voluntary organization Zdruzenie hradu Bystrica, but castle needs a more complex reconstruction.

==== Burg ====
The Burg was built in the first half of the 17th century, and is representative of Slovak renaissance culture.

==== Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Považská Bystrica ====
The Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in Povazska Bystrica is the main church in the town, situated in the heart of the town gives the cross section between 14th-century architecture and the architecture of the first half of the 20th century in Slovakia. It was built by Ján Podmanitzky, the owner of the castle in gothic style. In 1913-1914 the tower of the church was covered with baroque &quot;onion like&quot; construction. From the original buildings only the presbytery and the northern perimetric wall still stand. Major reconstruction and enlarging began in 1940. Church&#x27;s windows are filled with colourful stained glass filling created by Slovak artist Vincent Hložník and his wife Viera Hložníková in 1951. In front of the church is a sandstone statue of saint Mary to which church is dedicated. Inside are epitaphs of Zigmund Balassa, Alzbeta Zborovska, tombstone of Rafael Podmaintzky remains of caryatids and the depiction of the old town on the Balassa tombstone.

==== Orlové manor house ====

Orlové manor-house was built in 1612 by the Hungarian noble, Žigmund Balassa. Originally, it was a Renaissance single-storey manor-house which was supposed to bring the promise of new, modern and comfortable living for the aristocratic Balassa family, which the cold and uninviting Považský castle could no longer provide. At the time, it was quite common for the nobility to abandon their castles – unconquerable, stone fortresses whose defensive function has lost their meaning – and to build modern, comfortable family seats in the town or countryside. The manor-house was then known as Zsigmond Háza, or Žigmund&#x27;s house.

At the beginning of the 18th century, renovation works turned the manor-house into a two-storey four-wing manor. Another important owner who had a large impact on the manor-house&#x27;s appearance was Pavol Balassa, the great-grandson of its founder. In the first half of the 18th century, he together with his wife, Juliana Batthyány reconstructed the manor-house in a grandiose Baroque style. The park and courtyard with its fountain were also added at the time. We can read about this reconstruction on the commemorative inscription above the manor-house&#x27;s entrance gate. In the entrance gateway, we can see the alliance coat of arms of the Balassa and Bathyány families. Both family coats of arms are joined by the imperial crown expressing thanks to Maria Theresa and the imperial court for confirming the Balassa family&#x27;s title of count.

One of the most precious parts of the manor-house is the late Baroque chapel of St. John of Nepomuk with its Rococo interior, built between 1770 and 1780. The chapel takes up two storeys in the manor-house&#x27;s west wing. The Balassa family owned this grand family seat for a long 250 years. Later, it had several owners, not of all which were of benefit to the manor-house or its surroundings. At the beginning of the 20th century, the manor-house was owned for several years by the world-famous Czech violin virtuoso and composer, Jan Kubelík.

Before the World War II Orlové manor-house became the residence of Ing. Klementin Ružička, the General Director of Zbrojovka Brno, the largest armory in Czecho-Slovakian region. He moved to the palace Orlové together with his family. Opposed to his predecessors, previous owners of the palace Orlove, he resided there permanently. During his tenure he cared a lot to preserve the palace identity and its architecture style.

In Socialistic period of the Slovac history Orlové manor-house became the property of the state and served as an administrative building of the local archive, later, as a dormitory for season workers, after all, as a local museum.

A four-star hotel Gino Park Palace is settled in Orlové manor-house nowadays. It offers a high standard luxury accommodation, restaurant services and events all year around.

==== Kalvária Považská Bystrica ====
Kalvaria in Povazska Bystrica was mostly destroyed during the socialist era. It has 11 stops leading to the main Chapel of Saint Magdalene on the top of the hill. Last reconstruction of the monument was done in 1937. In spite of its present state, it is a part of national heritage. In the chapel of Saint Magdalene there were the statues of Jesus and two men on the hill Golgotha, but because of the situation statues were moved to the main town church.

==== Manor Považské Podhradie ====
Szapáry Castle is a rococo style building with granary and system of outbuildings, below the castle. A chapel was built inside between 1763 and 1764. The chapel was reconstructed in 1960. In the interior of the manor house were rococo paintings, stone coats of arms.

==== Chapel of Saint Helena ====
The Chapel of Saint Helena was built in 1728 by count Peter Szaparay on the hill above the town. It is surrounded by lindens, of which one is more than 250 years old. The chapel was robbed and became a ruin until it was renewed in the 1990s.

==== Kostol Svätého Ladislava ====
Kostol sv. Ladislava v Považskom Podhradí is the last fourth member of the four historical buildings build nearby the castle, creating the panorama of Povazske Podhradie. It was built in the 19th century. In the premises of the church is statue of John of Nepomuk, which was coincidentally brought to Považské Podhradie on abandoned flatboat during floods in 1784. After the floods the statue was placed on the place of its founding with five lindens around. However, after some time lindens grew together forming one massive linden-tree. From this point people started to idolize the linden with the statue as a wonder of nature until the linden was cut down during the building of new manmade basin of the river Vah.

=== Nature ===

==== Manínska tiesňava ====
Manínska tiesňava is the narrowest canyon in Slovakia, lying 6 kilometres from Považská Bystrica. It is place of great tourist interest, because of its wild and rare flora and fauna. It is frequently visited by rock climbers.

=== Modern architecture ===

==== Estakáda ====

The Motorway viaduct, due to its size, conception and short time of building, can be counted between the top structures of civil engineering in Slovakia. On 31 May 2010 the town viaduct was opened for traffic use.
==== Administrative building of executive agencies (ABŠO)====

The Administrative building ABŠO in Považská Bystrica is one of the most important buildings from the remarkably prolific period of the 1960s that united the then typical figure of office buildings and hotels with an original technical design and lightened construction and shell of the building. It surpassed the Slovak context and was in the given period unique at least in the context of Czechoslovakia. It is part of the programme for recovery and protection of modern architecture heritage Docomomo.

==== Building of RVP (Tatra banka building)====
The Building of Tatra banka is one of the few traces left of old town centre which was demolished in seventies. It is the most important example of interwar modern architecture building in town. It is included in the list of monuments of the town.

<text>The Great Seal of the State of Georgia is a device that has historically been used to authenticate government documents executed by the state of Georgia. The first great seal of the state was specified in the State Constitution of 1777, and its current form was adopted in 1799 with alterations in 1914. Its specifications are currently spelled out by statute.

==Description==

The original seal from 1777 was specified as such: &quot;The great seal of this State shall have the following device: on one side of a scroll, whereon shall be engraved “The Constitution of the State of Georgia;” and the motto “Pro bono publico.” On the other side, an elegant house, and other buildings, fields of corn, and meadows covered with sheep and cattle; a river running through the same, with a ship under full sail, and the motto, “Deus nobis haec otia fecit.”

On February 8, 1799 an Act of the Legislature stated the seal as &quot;On the one side a view of the seashore with a ship bearing the flag of the United States, riding near a wharf, receiving aboard hogsheads of tobacco and bales of cotton, emblematic of the exports of this State; at a small distance a boat landing from the interior of the State with hogsheads etc., on board representing her internal traffic; in the back part of the same side, a man in the act of ploughing; and at a small distance a flock of sheep in different postures shaded by a flourishing tree, the motto on this side agriculture and commerce, 1799. That the other side contain three pillars supporting an arch, with the word Constitution, engraven within the same, emblematic of the Constitution supported by three departments of the government, viz.: the legislative, judicial and executive, the first pillar to have engraven on its base, wisdom; the second justice; and the third, moderation; on the right of the last pillar a man standing with a drawn sword, representing the aid of the military in defense of the Constitution; the motto, State of Georgia, 1799&quot;.

===Current design===
The obverse (front) of the seal is centered on the coat of arms of the state: an arch with three columns, the arch symbolizing the state&#x27;s Constitution and the columns representing the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial). The words of the official state motto, &quot;Wisdom, Justice, Moderation,&quot; are inscribed on scrolls that are wrapped around the columns. A member of the Georgia Militia stands between the second and third columns, holding a drawn sword in his right hand, representing the citizen/soldier&#x27;s defense of the state&#x27;s Constitution. A border surrounds the coat of arms, and the motto &quot;State of Georgia, 1776&quot; is inscribed outside the arms.

The reverse (back) of the seal contains an image of Georgia&#x27;s coast, with a ship (bearing the American flag) arriving to take aboard tobacco and cotton, symbolizing Georgia&#x27;s export trade. A second, smaller boat represents the state&#x27;s &quot;internal traffic.&quot; Towards the left of the image, there is a man plowing and a flock of sheep. The motto &quot;Agriculture and Commerce, 1776&quot; is inscribed around the outside of the image.

The dates listed on the obverse and reverse of the seal were originally 1799. The dates were changed by the Georgia state legislature in 1914 to reflect the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

==History and lore==
In 1902, the Georgia General Assembly mandated that the coat of arms (the central portion of the obverse) be included in the state flag of Georgia. Either the coat of arms or the state seal has appeared on every state flag since that date.

By law, the Secretary of State is the official custodian of the Great Seal, which is attached to official papers by executive order of the Governor. This custodianship has led to some controversies:

===Period of the False Seal===
From 1868 to 1871, during Reconstruction, the Great Seal was not used for state business. It had been hidden under the home of wartime Secretary of State Nathan C. Barnett, to prevent its use by Federal forces. The Reconstruction government, having failed to locate the official seal, had a duplicate seal fabricated. The duplicate was a perfect match for the original, except for one small detail: the soldier held his sword in his left hand. Reconstruction in Georgia became known as the &quot;Period of the False Seal&quot;. In 1872, when local rule resumed in Georgia, Barnett (who had been re-elected by that point) unearthed the original seal and returned it to the Capitol.

===Three governors controversy===
In December 1946, Governor-elect Eugene Talmadge died before assuming office. Talmadge&#x27;s son, Herman, was appointed governor by the State Legislature. This was challenged by the Lieutenant Governor-elect Melvin Thompson, who maintained that the state constitution authorized him to assume the office upon the death of the governor. Outgoing governor Ellis Arnall announced that he would not relinquish the office until it was clear who the new governor was. The political turmoil that ensued became known as the &quot;three governors controversy&quot;. In January 1947, while all three governors occupied different portions of the State Capitol, Secretary of State Ben W. Fortson, Jr., took the seal and hid it. This prevented any of the claimants to the governorship from executing any business until the Supreme Court of Georgia could make a ruling on the rightful winner. Thompson was eventually declared &quot;acting governor&quot; until a special election could be held to fill the remainder of the original term. Herman Talmadge won the special election and served out the remaining portion of his father&#x27;s term.

===The Arch===
In 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as &quot;The Arch&quot;. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate. Today, The Arch is an important symbol of the University. According to legend, it is bad luck for freshmen (or, in some versions, any undergraduate student) to walk under the arch. Legend suggests that any student walking through the arch prematurely will never graduate.

<doc id="962903" wikidata="Q5085968" url="?curid=962903" title="Charlotte Green">
<text>Charlotte Green (born 4 May 1956) is a British radio broadcaster and a former continuity announcer and news reader for BBC Radio 4.

After 1988 she specialised in news reading, including reading the news on the Radio 4 breakfast &quot;Today&quot; programme, and reading news items on &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described her as &quot;the supreme Radio 4 announcer whose warm yet slightly formal tones were once voted the nation&#x27;s favourite&quot;. Green left Radio 4 in January 2013. She read the classified football results on BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service Sports Report from 2013 until 2022, succeeding James Alexander Gordon. Her autobiography &quot;The News is Read&quot; was published by The Robson Press in 2014.

==Early life==
Green was educated at the independent Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School for Girls in Elstree, followed by the University of Kent, where she gained a first-class BA in English and American Literature and was involved in university radio, before joining the BBC as a studio manager in 1978 at the World Service. She has said that &quot;I wanted to be an actress, but I decided there were too many actresses around, so I joined the BBC.&quot;

==Broadcasting==
After reading out letters for &quot;PM&quot; and &quot;You and Yours&quot; she became a continuity announcer in 1985, and then a newsreader in 1988. She was a regular newsreader for the &quot;Today&quot; programme and the comedy programme &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, and she has worked on &quot;PM&quot; and the Shipping Forecast. From 29 October 2005, she joined Chris Evans&#x27;s Saturday afternoon show on Radio 2 to read phone numbers and announcements.

She was voted the &quot;Most Attractive Female Voice on National Radio&quot; in a poll by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot; publication in 2002. Green has acknowledged the reliance lonely listeners place in her; her habit of wishing listeners &quot;a peaceful night&quot; led many to send her letters.

In addition to newsreading, Green has been a presenter, including for a programme on church music, a classical music concert series, and a series on World Service news bulletins. She presented &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot; with Clive Anderson on television.

Between 2003 and 2006, Green was unique in her pronunciation of the years between 2001 and 2009. She adopted the &#x27;twenty-oh&#x27; method instead of &#x27;two-thousand-and&#x27;. This was said to have sparked so many complaints that she reverted to &#x27;two-thousand-and&#x27; in 2006.

She played herself in a 2005 radio episode of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and again played herself in 2008 in Simon Brett&#x27;s radio detective drama &quot;Charles Paris&quot;. She has been impersonated by Jan Ravens reading out a double-entendres-filled shipping forecast on the BBC radio comedy show &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. She signed a public letter of protest to the BBC Trust regarding cuts to the radio news service in 2007.

Green has on occasions attracted some attention for inopportune giggling during on-air broadcasts. In March 2008, while announcing the death of American film and television writer Abby Mann, Green laughed after what is believed to be the world&#x27;s earliest recording, played during the preceding item, was described off-air as sounding like &quot;a bee trapped in a bottle&quot;.

In a 2012 interview she named the fall of the Berlin Wall as the &#x27;biggest&#x27; story that she&#x27;d ever read the news for. Green, and her colleague Harriet Cass, left Radio 4, having opted for voluntary redundancy owing to reorganisation. Green&#x27;s final news bulletin was the 6 o&#x27;clock news on Friday 18 January 2013.

Green broadcast on Classic FM between April 2013 and December 2018 presenting &quot;Charlotte Green&#x27;s Great Composers&quot;. A keen supporter of Tottenham Hotspur FC, in August 2013 it was announced that Green will follow James Alexander Gordon as the permanent announcer of &quot;Sports Report&quot;, the Saturday football results programme, on BBC Radio 5 Live. Green&#x27;s new role, the first ever woman appointed to the post, began on 28 September 2013.

From July 2015, Green was a reader on the BBC Radio 4 panel game &quot;Quote... Unquote&quot; and featured on the programme&#x27;s last edition in December 2021.

==Personal life==
Green is an avid reader who enjoys going to the theatre, concerts and art exhibitions. She is also a Trustee of the University of Kent Development Fund.

<text>Within quality management systems (QMS) and information technology (IT) systems, change control is a process—either formal or informal—used to ensure that changes to a product or system are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner. It reduces the possibility that unnecessary changes will be introduced to a system without forethought, introducing faults into the system or undoing changes made by other users of software. The goals of a change control procedure usually include minimal disruption to services, reduction in back-out activities, and cost-effective utilization of resources involved in implementing change. According to the Project Management Institute, change control is a &quot;process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or baselines associated with the project are identified, documented, approved, or rejected.&quot;

Change control is used in various industries, including in IT, software development, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, and other engineering/manufacturing industries. For the IT and software industries, change control is a major aspect of the broader discipline of change management. Typical examples from the computer and network environments are patches to software products, installation of new operating systems, upgrades to network routing tables, or changes to the electrical power systems supporting such infrastructure.

Certain portions of ITIL cover change control.

== The process ==
There is considerable overlap and confusion between change management, configuration management and change control. The definition below is not yet integrated with definitions of the others.

Change control can be described as a set of six steps:

# Plan / scope
# Assess / analyze
# Review / approval
# Build / test
# Implement
# Close

===Plan / scope===
Consider the primary and ancillary detail of the proposed change. This should include aspects such as identifying the change, its owner(s), how it will be communicated and executed, how success will be verified, the change&#x27;s estimate of importance, its added value, its conformity to business and industry standards, and its target date for completion.

===Assess / analyze===
Impact and risk assessment is the next vital step. When executed, will the proposed plan cause something to go wrong? Will related systems be impacted by the proposed change? Even minor details should be considered during this phase. Afterwards, a risk category should ideally be assigned to the proposed change: high-, moderate-, or low-risk. High-risk change requires many additional steps such as management approval and stakeholder notification, whereas low-risk change may only require project manager approval and minimal documentation. If not addressed in the plan/scope, the desire for a backout plan should be expressed, particularly for high-risk changes that have significant worst-case scenarios.

===Review / approval===
Whether it&#x27;s a change controller, change control board, steering committee, or project manager, a review and approval process is typically required. The plan/scope and impact/risk assessments are considered in the context of business goals, requirements, and resources. If, for example, the change request is deemed to address a low severity, low impact issue that requires significant resources to correct, the request may be made low priority or shelved altogether. In cases where a high-impact change is requested but without a strong plan, the review/approval entity may request a full business case may be requested for further analysis.

===Build / test===
If the change control request is approved to move forward, the delivery team will execute the solution through a small-scale development process in test or development environments. This allows the delivery team an opportunity to design and make incremental changes, with unit and/or regression testing. Little in the way of testing and validation may occur for low-risk changes, though major changes will require significant testing before implementation. They will then seek approval and request a time and date to carry out the implementation phase. In rare cases where the solution can&#x27;t be tested, special consideration should be made towards the change/implementation window.

===Implement===
In most cases a special implementation team with the technical expertise to quickly move a change along is used to implement the change. The team should also be implementing the change not only according to the approved plan but also according to organizational standards, industry standards, and quality management standards. The implementation process may also require additional staff responsibilities outside the implementation team, including stakeholders who may be asked to assist with troubleshooting. Following implementation, the team may also carry out a post-implementation review, which would take place at another stakeholder meeting or during project closing procedures.

===Close===
The closing process can be one of the more difficult and important phases of change control. Three primary tasks at this end phase include determining that the project is actually complete, evaluating &quot;the project plan in the context of project completion,&quot; and providing tangible proof of project success. If despite best efforts something went wrong during the change control process, a post-mortem on what happened will need to be run, with the intent of applying lessons learned to future changes.

== Regulatory environment ==
In a good manufacturing practice regulated industry, the topic is frequently encountered by its users. Various industrial guidances and commentaries are available for people to comprehend this concept. As a common practice, the activity is usually directed by one or more SOPs. From the information technology perspective for clinical trials, it has been guided by another U.S. Food and Drug Administration document.

<text>Reunion Records is a contemporary Christian record label based in Brentwood, Tennessee, that operates under the Provident Label Group. It was founded in 1982 by Dan Harrell and Mike Blanton.

== History ==
The label was formed by Amy Grant&#x27;s managers (Harrell being her brother-in-law), with the label&#x27;s original intent to give new artist Kathy Troccoli a home after being rejected by the major labels at the time. Troccoli, Michael W. Smith and Rich Mullins were the label&#x27;s first three artists.

In 1990, they signed a new distribution deal with Geffen Records. In 1992 50% of Reunion Records was sold to BMG and by 1995 the other half was also acquired by BMG. For a time following the BMG acquisition they distributed through RCA Records. From 1995 until 1996, it was part of Arista Records (a BMG company). In October 1996, the label was sold to Zomba Records. Through eventual consolidation, it is now part of Sony Music.

Mike Blanton and Dan Harrell partnered with Steve Thomas to create BHT Entertainment in 2003. The label signed a distribution agreement with Word Records.

<text>Čičmany is a village and municipality in Žilina District in the Žilina Region of northern Slovakia. It contains a folk architecture reserve, which was founded in 1977.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from a Slovak word &quot;čičman&quot; (a lumberjack who makes a noise while working).

==History==
The first preserved reference to the village dates from 1272 (&quot;Cziczman&quot;). After a great fire in 1921, the village was restored to its original appearance with generous contributions by the state. Until the mid-20th century, the village was a centre of sheep raising.

==Geography==
The municipality lies at an altitude of and covers an area of . It has a population of about 204 people.

==Culture==
Timbered houses with ridge roofs, galleries and pointed or linear wall decorations have been preserved in Čičmany. Of particular interest are the very specific white patterns which are painted on the exterior walls of the houses to decorate them. The local folk music, special folk costumes and folk dances of the village have been preserved as well.

==Genealogical resources==

The records for genealogical research are available at the state archive &quot;Statny Archiv in Bytca, Slovakia&quot;

<text>The Fontan procedure or Fontan–Kreutzer procedure is a palliative surgical procedure used in children with univentricular hearts. It involves diverting the venous blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and superior vena cava (SVC) to the pulmonary arteries. The procedure varies for differing congenital heart pathologies. For example, in tricuspid atresia, the procedure can be done where the blood does not pass through the morphologic right ventricle; i.e., the systemic and pulmonary circulations are placed in series with the functional single ventricle. By contrast, in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the heart is more reliant on the more functional right ventricle to provide blood flow to the systemic circulation. The procedure was initially performed in 1968 by Francis Fontan and Eugene Baudet from Bordeaux, France, published in 1971, simultaneously described in July 1971 by Guillermo Kreutzer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, presented at the Argentinean National Cardilogy meeting of that year and finally published in 1973.

==Indications==
The Fontan Kreutzer procedure is used in pediatric patients who possess only a single functional ventricle, either due to lack of a heart valve (e.g. tricuspid or mitral atresia), an abnormality of the pumping ability of the heart (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome or hypoplastic right heart syndrome), or a complex congenital heart disease where a bi-ventricular repair is impossible or inadvisable. The surgery allows blood to be delivered to the lungs via central venous pressure rather than via the right ventricle. Patients typically present as neonates with cyanosis or congestive heart failure. Fontan completion is usually carried out when the patient is 2–5 years of age, but is also performed before 2 years of age.

== Types ==
There are four variations of the Fontan procedure:
* Ventricularization of the Right Atrium (The original Fontan&#x27;s Technique)
* Atriopulmonary connection (the original Kreutzer&#x27;s Technique)
* Intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (lateral tunnel) (described by Marc De Leval and Aldo Castañeda, separately)
* Extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (described by Carlo Marceletti and Francisco Puga for Heterotaxy Syndrome)

==Approach==

The Fontan-Kreutzer procedure is the third procedure in the staged surgical palliation. It is performed in children born with congenital heart disease without two functional ventricles and an effective parallel blood flow circuit.

The first stage is known as the Norwood procedure. This stage generally involves combining the pulmonary artery and aorta to form a larger vessel for blood to get to the body. An artificial tube or shunt can be placed from this larger vessel to the pulmonary arteries so that blood can get from the heart to the lungs. The wall between the left and right atrium can be removed to allow the mixing of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood.

The second stage is called the &quot;hemi-Fontan or the Bidirectional Glenn procedure&quot;. This intermediary stage incorporates the shifting of oxygen-poor blood from the top of the body to the lungs. The superior vena cava (SVC), which carries blood returning from the upper parts of the body, is disconnected from the heart and instead redirects the blood into the pulmonary arteries. The inferior vena cava (IVC), which carries blood returning from the lower body, continues to connect to the right atrium.

The third stage is called the &quot;Fontan-Kreutzer procedure&quot; which involves redirecting the blood from the inferior vena cava to the lungs. At this point, the oxygen-poor blood from upper and lower body flows through the lungs without being pumped (driven only by the pressure that builds up in the veins or central venous pressure). This improves the lower than normal oxygen levels and results in one functional ventricle that is responsible for supplying blood to the rest of the body. There are currently three various modern techniques for the Fontan procedure which include: Atriopulmonary connection, lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection, and extracardiac conduit.

== Contraindications ==
After Fontan Kreutzer completion, blood must flow through the lungs without being pumped by the heart. Therefore, children with high pulmonary vascular resistance may not tolerate a Fontan procedure. Often, cardiac catheterization is performed to check the resistance before proceeding with the surgery. This is also the reason a Fontan procedure cannot be done immediately after birth; the pulmonary vascular resistance is high &quot;in utero&quot; and takes months to drop.
Fontan procedure is also contraindicated in those with pulmonary artery hypoplasia and significant mitral insufficiency.

== Post-operative complications ==
In the short term, children can have trouble with pleural effusions (fluid building up around the lungs). This can require a longer stay in the hospital for drainage with chest tubes. To address this risk, some surgeons make a fenestration from the venous circulation into the atrium. When the pressure in the veins is high, some of the oxygen-poor blood can escape through the fenestration to relieve the pressure. However, this results in hypoxia, so the fenestration may eventually need to be closed by an interventional cardiologist.

In a 2016 review, Dr. Jack Rychik, head of the Single Ventricle Survivorship Program at Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia summarized the long-term consequences of Fontan circulation as an &quot;indolent and progressive state of heart failure&quot; with predictable long-term consequences on several organ systems. Chronic venous hypertension from the stasis and lowered cardiac output are assumed to be at the root of lymphatic complications such as chylothorax, protein losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis. These complications may occur in the immediate post-operative period as well as in the medium and long term. New interventional and surgical strategies have been investigated to relieve the lymphatic complications associated with the Fontan circulation. Concerns about damage to the liver have emerged more recently, as the Fontan circulation produces congestion and lymphedema in this organ. This can lead towards progressive hepatic fibrosis and other complications of Fontan-associated liver disease. Screening protocols and treatment standards are emerging in the light of these discoveries.

Because of structural and electrochemical changes related to scarring after the procedure, arrhythmias are common. Pacemakers are placed in as many as 7% of patients who undergo the Fontan procedure. While the need for pacemakers may be related to the underlying cardiac anomaly, there is sufficient evidence that the surgery itself lead to the need for cardiac pacing.

The Fontan procedure is palliative — not curative — but more than 80% of the cases can result in normal or near-normal growth, development, exercise tolerance, and good quality of life. However, 10% or more of patients may eventually require heart transplantation, and given the long-term consequences of chronic venous hypertension and insidious organ damage, freedom from morbidity is unlikely in the long term. New approaches to the management of failing Fontans or other clinical deterioration have included lymphatic decompression surgical procedures &amp; intervention, Ventricular assist devices or other mechanical support therapies as either bridge to transplantation or destination therapies.

Renal complications may occur. This is attributed to the circulatory changes in blood flow as well as possible exposure to nephrotoxic medications, iodine contrast agents, and long term cyanotic and ischemic nephropathy. Abnormalities including chronic kidney disease and impaired renal function have been shown with measured renal function. Popular markers, such as proteinuria and microalbuminuria, are used in the measurement renal function.

It is estimated in 2018 there was an 85% for a survival rate of thirty years following a Fontan procedure and there are approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people in the world with Fontan circulation. It is approximated that 40% of people with Fontan circulation are ≥18 years of age.

== Fontan circulation ==
A normal heart system has a series circuit with the right ventricle pumping blood into the pulmonary circulation. After exchanging gases, the blood is delivered to the left ventricle (and systemic arteries) through the pulmonary veins. In Fontan circulation, the right ventricle does not exist (or is bypassed), and the venae cavae are attached directly to the pulmonary artery. After oxygenation, the blood is pumped into the aorta by the unique, single ventricle. Because of the missing right ventricle, the force driving blood through the lungs is strongly reduced. This causes engorgement of the venous circulation, the most frequent complication of the Fontan procedure.

== Pregnancy considerations ==
Fontan circulation can influence the peripartum or pregnant physiologic states. Pregnancy has historically been discouraged in Fontan patients due to high rates of miscarriage, cardiovascular compromise, or increased mortality. Many complications have been attributed to flawed placental function. However, improvements of the Fontan operation have resulted in pregnancies with lower incidence of heart and vascular compromise in the mother. Complications that may occur in the fetus may include, but are not limited to: oligohydramnios, preterm birth, low birth weight, small size for gestational age, or still birth. Maternal complications can include, but are not limited to: heart failure, thromboembolism, arrhythmias, and preeclampsia.

== History ==

The Fontan procedure was initially described in 1971 by Dr. Francis Fontan (1929–2018) from Bordeaux, France. Prior to this, the surgical treatment for tricuspid atresia consisted of creating a shunt between a systemic artery and the pulmonary artery (Blalock-Taussig shunt) or the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery (Glenn shunt). These procedures were associated with high mortality rates, commonly leading to death before the age of one year. In an attempt to improve this, Fontan was engaged in research between 1964 and 1966 endeavouring to fully redirect flow from the superior and inferior vena cavae to the pulmonary artery. His initial attempts in dogs were unsuccessful and all experimental animals died within a few hours; however, despite these failures, he successfully performed this operation in a young woman with tricuspid atresia in 1968 with Dr. Eugene Baudet. The operation was completed on a second patient in 1970, and after a third case the series was published in the international journal &quot;Thorax&quot; in 1971. Dr. Guillermo Kreutzer from Buenos Aires, Argentina (b. 1934), without any knowledge of Fontan&#x27;s experience, performed a similar procedure in July, 1971 without placing a valve in the Inferior Vena Cava inlet and introduced the concept of &quot;fenestration&quot; – leaving a small atrial septal defect to serve as a pop-off valve for the circulation. Techniques have been improved to include the lateral tunnel and use of an extracardiac conduit for congenital heart diseases beyond tricuspid atresia (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, etc).

<doc id="962919" wikidata="Q6070929" url="?curid=962919" title="Irish Literary Revival">
<text>The Irish Literary Revival (also called the Irish Literary Renaissance, sometimes nicknamed the Celtic Twilight though this has a broader meaning) was a flowering of Irish literary talent in the late 19th and early 20th century. It includes works of poetry, music, art, and literature.

One of its foremost figures was W. B. Yeats, considered a driving force of the Revival.

Because of English colonial rule, matters of Gaelic heritage were sometimes viewed in a political context.

==Forerunners==
The literary movement was associated with a revival of interest in Ireland&#x27;s Gaelic heritage and the growth of Irish nationalism from the middle of the 19th century. The poetry of James Clarence Mangan and Samuel Ferguson and Standish James O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s &quot;History of Ireland: Heroic Period&quot; were influential in shaping the minds of the following generations. Others who contributed to the build-up of national consciousness during the 19th century included poet and writer George Sigerson; antiquarians and music collectors such as George Petrie, Robert Dwyer Joyce and Patrick Weston Joyce; editors such as Matthew Russell of the &quot;Irish Monthly&quot;; scholars such as John O&#x27;Donovan and Eugene O&#x27;Curry; and nationalists such as Charles Kickham and John O&#x27;Leary. In 1882 the Gaelic Union established the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot; (&quot;Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge&quot;), the first important bilingual Irish periodical with the help of Douglas Hyde, with David Comyn as editor.

==Developments==
The early literary revival had two geographic centres, in Dublin and in London, and William Butler Yeats travelled between the two, writing and organising. In 1888 he published &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot;, a compilation of pieces by various authors of the 18th and 19th centuries. He had been assisted by Douglas Hyde, whose &quot;Beside the Fire&quot;, a collection of folklore in Irish, was published in 1890. In London in 1892, along with T. W. Rolleston, and Charles Gavan Duffy, he set up the Irish Literary Society. Back in Dublin he founded the National Literary Society in the same year, with Douglas Hyde as first President. Meanwhile, the more radical Arthur Griffith and William Rooney were active in the Irish Fireside Club and went on to found the Leinster Literary Society.

In 1893 Yeats published &quot;The Celtic Twilight&quot;, a collection of lore and reminiscences from the West of Ireland. The book closed with the poem &quot;Into the Twilight&quot;. It was this book and poem that gave the revival its nickname. In this year Hyde, Eugene O&#x27;Growney and Eoin MacNeill founded the Gaelic League, with Hyde becoming its first President. It was set up to encourage the preservation of Irish culture, its music, dances and language. Also in that year appeared Hyde&#x27;s &quot;The Love Songs of Connacht&quot;, which inspired Yeats, John Millington Synge and Lady Gregory.

Thomas A. Finlay founded the &quot;New Ireland Review&quot;, a literary magazine, in 1894, which he edited until 1911, when it was replaced by &quot;Studies&quot;. Many of the leading literary lights of the time contributed to it.

In 1897 Hyde became editor, with T. W. Rolleston and Charles Gavan Duffy, of the &quot;New Irish Library&quot;, a series of books on Irish history and literature issued by the London publisher, Fisher Unwin. Two years later Hyde published his &quot;Literary history of Ireland&quot;.

Yeats, Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn published a &quot;Manifesto for Irish Literary Theatre&quot; in 1897, in which they proclaimed their intention of establishing a national theatre for Ireland. The Irish Literary Theatre (ILT) was founded by Yeats, Lady Gregory and Martyn in 1899, with assistance from George Moore. It proposed to give performances in Dublin of Irish plays by Irish authors.

In February 1901, at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, the ILT performed “The Last Feast of the Fianna”, a one-act depiction of an episode in the tale of Oisin. It was the work of the Gaelic League activist, Alice Milligan. Lady Gregory found the lack of action and long soliloquies &quot;intolerable&quot; and the overall effect &quot;tawdry&quot;. But it was a first attempt &quot;to dramatize Celtic Legend for an Irish audience&quot;.

The Fay brothers formed W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent. The company produced works by Seumas O&#x27;Cuisin, Fred Ryan and Yeats.

Around the turn of the century Patrick S. Dinneen published editions of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;, poems by Aogán Ó Rathaille and Piaras Feiritéar, and other works for the Irish Texts Society and the Gaelic League. He then went on to write the first novel in Irish, while continuing to work on his great Irish-English dictionary. On Easter Sunday 1900 Yeats&#x27; friend and muse, Maud Gonne, founded Inghinidhe na hÉireann (English: Daughters of Ireland), a revolutionary women&#x27;s society which included writers Alice Furlong, Annie Egan, Ethna Carbery and Sinéad O&#x27;Flanagan (later wife of Éamon de Valera), and the actors Máire Quinn and Sara Allgood. The Irish-language newspaper &quot;Banba&quot; was founded in 1901 with Tadhg Ó Donnchadha as editor. The following year he also became editor of the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot;.

In 1903 Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Russell (&quot;AE&quot;), Edward Martyn, and Synge founded the Irish National Theatre Society with funding from Annie Horniman; Fred Ryan was secretary. The Abbey Theatre was opened by this society in Abbey Street on 27 December 1904. Máire Nic Shiubhlaigh played the name part in &quot;Cathleen Ni Houlihan&quot;. Yeats&#x27; brother Jack painted portraits of all the leading figures in the society for the foyer, while Sarah Purser designed stained glass for the same space. The new Abbey Theatre found great popular success. It staged many plays by eminent or soon-to-be eminent authors, including Yeats, Lady Gregory, Moore, Martyn, Padraic Colum, George Bernard Shaw, Oliver St John Gogarty, F. R. Higgins, Thomas MacDonagh, Lord Dunsany, T. C. Murray, James Cousins and Lennox Robinson.

In 1904 John Eglinton started the journal &quot;Dana&quot;, to which Fred Ryan and Oliver St John Gogarty contributed.

In 1906 the publishing house of Maunsel and Company was founded by Stephen Gwynn, Joseph Maunsel Hone and George Roberts to publish Irish writers. Its first publication was &quot;Rush-light&quot; by Joseph Campbell. Lady Gregory started publishing her collection of Kiltartan stories, including &quot;A Book of Saints and Wonders&quot; (1906) and &quot;The Kiltartan History Book&quot; (1909).

The &quot;Irish Review&quot; was founded in 1910 by Professor David Houston of the Royal College of Science for Ireland, with his friends poet Thomas MacDonagh, lecturer in English in University College Dublin, poet and writer James Stephens, with David Houston, Thomas MacDonagh, Padraic Colum and Mary Colum and Joseph Mary Plunkett. The magazine was edited by Thomas MacDonagh for its first issues, then Padraic Colum, then, changing its character utterly from a literary and sociological magazine, Joseph Plunkett edited its final issues as literary Ireland became involved with the Irish Volunteers and plans for the Easter Rising. Plunkett published a collection of poems, &quot;The Circle and The Sword&quot;, the same year.

==Fellow travellers==

The movement co-existed with the growth of interest in the Irish language (Gaelic League), the Home Rule movement, the Gaelic Athletic Association, and other cultural organisations. It spawned a number of books and magazines and poetry by lesser-known artists such as Alice Furlong, Ethna Carbery, Dora Sigerson Shorter and Alice Milligan around the turn of the century. These were followed by the likes of George Roberts, Katharine Tynan, Thomas MacDonagh, Seán O&#x27;Casey, Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan and others up to the 1930s. It was complemented by developments in the arts world, which included artists such as Sarah Purser, Grace Gifford, Estella Solomons and Beatrice Elvery, and in music through works by composers such as Arnold Bax, Rutland Boughton, Edward Elgar, Cecil Gray and Peter Warlock, setting poetry and verse drama by Yeats, AE and Fiona Macleod. According to Matthew Buchan, Boughton&#x27;s highly successful opera &quot;The Immortal Hour&quot; (1914), based on a verse drama by Macleod, &quot;blends all the essential elements of Celtic Twilight&quot;.

<text>The Avery Coonley House, also known as the Coonley Estate, is a residential estate of several buildings built on the banks of the Des Plaines River in Riverside, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Constructed in 1908–1912, it was designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. It is a National Historic Landmark and is included in another National Historic Landmark, the Riverside Historic District.

==History==
The Avery Coonley House (built 1908–12) in Riverside, Illinois, is located on a unique small peninsula surrounded by the Des Plaines River. Of the few estates that Frank Lloyd Wright developed, it is one of his largest and most elaborate Prairie School-homes ever built. It is one of just three multi-building prairie complexes built by the famed architect. The other two are the Dana–Thomas House and the Darwin D. Martin House complexes. The Coonley house is also the first example in Wright&#x27;s work of a zoned plan. The raised second floor includes three zones: The public area (living room and dining room), the bedroom wing (with its pendant guest wing) and finally the kitchen and servants areas. The original residence was over-9000-square-feet and built on a ten-acre parcel. The entrance halls, playroom and sewing room are on the ground floor. An entire complex of interrelated buildings with extensive raised and sunken gardens was designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen. The main structure of the Avery Coonley Estate is the public-living room wing, located on Bloomingbank Road and behind that facing Scottswood Road is the bedroom wing of the mansion. The complex also includes a separate stable-coach house and gardener&#x27;s cottage (1911). Along with the Robie House, the Coonley Estate represents the maturation of Wright&#x27;s Prairie Style, typified by wide overhanging eaves, bands of art glass casement windows, free-flowing interior spaces and the harmonious blending of site and structure.

Avery Coonley, a Chicago industrialist and his wife, Queene Ferry of the Detroit-based Ferry Seed Company, were both heirs to industrial fortunes and had an unlimited budget to commission a new residence. The Coonleys had investigated Wright&#x27;s other homes and told him that they saw in his work &quot;the countenances of principle&quot;. Wright stated in his autobiography that &quot;This was to me a great and sincere compliment. So I put my best into the Coonley House.&quot; Wright considered the Coonley House among his finest works and gave the Coonleys a residence that blended indoors and out and felt as much like a little village as a home, given the way the courtyards, buildings, and garden walls interconnected. He designed all the features and furnishings within the home, including rugs and textiles. The designs of the Coonley House were included in his 1907 exhibition at the Chicago Architectural Club. Construction began a year later.

A philanthropic couple, The Coonleys had progressive beliefs which included early education for children. At the age of four years, their only daughter Elizabeth was too young to attend the local school. To educate her child and others, Queene Ferry requested that Wright design a kindergarten, the Avery Coonley School Playhouse, in 1912 on nearby Fairbank Road, a block away from the main residence. The art glass windows of the Coonley Playhouse feature one of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s best known designs. A pattern based on balloons, confetti and American flags, very festive for the intended use of the structure, the design used in these windows was artistically striking and represents Wright&#x27;s first departure from his signature style using only straight lines. Except for a few relatively plain panes, the windows of the Coonley Playhouse are now all replicas, the originals having been removed in the middle of the 20th century at a time when Wright&#x27;s work was either being saved or dissected and sold for large sums of money. Many of the originals can be seen in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and The Art Institute of Chicago which prominently displays one of the windows near its main entrance. The colored side of the art glass windows faced the inside of the house, while the side that faces exterior is white. The kindergarten school moved from the Coonley Playhouse in Riverside to a larger facility in Downers Grove in 1916 and eventually became a full K-8 elementary school and still exists today. The original Coonley Playhouse near the estate in Riverside is currently a private residence.

Alterations to the Coonley Estate have been made through the years, by Wright and others. A year after the house was completed, Wright modified the terrace pavilion, adding bands of art glass doors and windows to allow more light into the second-floor living room and children&#x27;s playroom below. A pergola with noticeable Asian influences was also added. Avery Coonley sold the house in 1921 to Peter Kroehler, a furniture manufacturer from Naperville, Illinois. Several architectural changes were made during this period including a sun-room addition to the south, the lily pond was converted into a swimming pool and a pool house was added - probably designed by Harry Robinson, an apprentice under Wright at both Oak Park and Taliesin. 
In 1952 the property was threatened with demolition to make way for 14 ranch homes. A compromise was reached that allowed developer Arnold Skow to divide the main house into north and south halves by inserting a firewall, build five new houses on the property and convert the gardener&#x27;s cottage and stable into separate residences and addresses. The raised gardens were sold off and a modern house was built on the property. Even with these radical changes, the house retains nearly all of its original exterior and interior design details, including approximately 270 original art glass windows and doors.

A heater for the swimming pool exploded on June 11, 1978, setting a fire that destroyed the living room of the main house and one of the bedrooms. In 2000 salvage and restoration work was performed on light screens and millwork on the north half of the house including stucco and roof repair, restoration of the original gravel driveway and the reconversion of the swimming pool back to the original lily pond. The entire north side of the house has been meticulously restored to its original splendor including the re-creation of the George Mann Niedecken living room mural as well as the decorative tulip designed tile frieze along with many light screens that surround the perimeter of the house.

The Avery Coonley House is the largest privately owned Frank Lloyd Wright residence to be recognized by the United States Secretary of the Interior. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

<doc id="962933" wikidata="Q2524362" url="?curid=962933" title="ColdFusion Markup Language">
<text>ColdFusion Markup Language, more commonly known as CFML, is a scripting language for web development that runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM), the .NET framework, and Google App Engine. Several commercial and free and open-source software implementations of CFML engines are available, including Adobe ColdFusion, Lucee, New Atlanta BlueDragon (Java and .NET versions), Railo, Open BlueDragon, and other CFML server engines.

== Synopsis ==
In its simplest form, like many other web scripting languages, CFML augments standard HTML files with database commands, conditional operators, high-level formatting functions, and other elements to produce web applications. CFML also includes many other constructs including ColdFusion Components (CFCs), CFML&#x27;s version of objects, that allow separating business logic from presentation.

CFML can be written using either tags or CFScript, which resembles JavaScript (ECMAScript).

The pages in a CFML application include the server-side CFML tags and functions in addition to HTML tags. Modern CFML applications also tend to have CFCs that are accessed by the CFML pages for executing business logic. When a web browser requests a page in a ColdFusion application, it is automatically pre-processed by the ColdFusion application server.

CFML can also be used to generate other languages, aside from HTML, such as XML, JavaScript, CSS, and so on.

Despite the name, CFML is &quot;not&quot; a markup language. It is also not SGML, since certain core CFML features prevent it from complying.

The CFML engine is configured in such a way that certain file extensions on the server (.cfm, .cfc) are handed off to the CFML engine for processing. In the case of the Java-based engines this is accomplished via Java servlets. The CFML engine only processes CFML tags and functions; it returns text outside of CFML tags and functions to the web server unchanged.

== History ==
Named Cold Fusion at the outset, the software was created in 1995 by the Allaire Corporation, originally located in Minnesota. It later moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and then finally to Newton, Massachusetts before being acquired by Macromedia in 2001. Allaire Cold Fusion thus became Macromedia Cold Fusion. At the release of version 4, the space in the name was removed to become ColdFusion. Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. , it is still actively developing ColdFusion.

In 1998 Alan Williamson and his Scottish company, &quot;n-ary&quot;, began creating a templating engine for Java to simplify common programming tasks. Williamson was using curly-brace notation instead of tags, but when he saw an example of CFML and how it was solving similar problems (although not in Java) using a tag syntax, he started developing what would eventually become BlueDragon, which was the first Java implementation of the CFML language. (ColdFusion was written in C and C++ until version 6.0, the first Java-based version, was released in 2002.) New Atlanta licensed BlueDragon around 2001 and made it available as a commercial product, eventually creating a .NET implementation of CFML. Open BlueDragon is a fork of the commercial BlueDragon product and was first released in 2008.

The Railo CFML engine began as a student project in 2002 and was first launched as a commercial project in 2005. Railo announced they were making the engine open source in 2008, and the first open source version was released in 2009.

On June 18, 2009, Adobe announced at the CFUnited conference that it had formed a CFML Advisory Committee that would be responsible for guiding and reviewing changes to the CFML language. This effort was disbanded in 2010. The Google Group CFML Conventional Wisdom was created as a forum for open, public discussions about language and engine features; its use has dwindled since 2011.

In 2012, the OpenCFML Foundation was launched. Its function is to push open-source CFML applications and platforms.

Former Railo lead developer Michael Offner launched Lucee, a fork of Railo, in London on January 29, 2015. Backed by community supporters and members of the Lucee Association, the goal of the project is to provide the functionality of CFML using fewer resources, giving better performance and to move CFML past its roots and into a modern and dynamic Web programming platform.

== Syntax ==
CFML tags have a similar format to HTML tags. They are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) and generally have zero or more named attributes, though some tags (e.g. cfset, cfif) contain an expression rather than attributes. Many CFML tags have bodies; that is, they have beginning and end tags with text to be processed between them. For example:

&lt;cfoutput&gt;
 #value# Bob!
&lt;/cfoutput&gt; 
Other tags, such as cfset and cfftp, never have bodies; all the required information goes between the beginning (&lt;) character and the ending (&gt;) character in the form of tag attributes (name/value pairs), as in the example below. If it is legal for tags not to have a body, it is syntactically acceptable to leave them unclosed as in the first example, though many CFML developers choose to self-close tags as in the second example to (arguably) make the code more legible.

&lt;cfset value = &quot;Hello&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset value = &quot;Hello&quot; /&gt;

Even if the tag can have a body, including a body may not be necessary in some instances because the attributes specify all the required information. In these cases, as with the second example above, the end tag (and hence, the tag body) may be omitted and the tag may be self-closing as in the following example:

&lt;cfexecute name=&quot;C:\\winNT\\System32\\netstat.exe&quot; arguments=&quot;-e&quot; outputfile=&quot;C:\\Temp\\out.txt&quot; timeout=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;

Various tags offer the ability to type-check input parameters (e.g. cffunction, cfparam, cfqueryparam) if the programmer declares their type specifically. This functionality is used with cfqueryparam to secure web applications and databases from hackers and malicious web requests such as SQL injection.

== Built-in tags ==
Nearly 100 tags and many more functions make up the heart of the CFML language. The following lists CFML tags by their function or purpose.
*Application framework
*Communications
*Control
**Flow-control
**Database manipulation
**Exception handling
*Data output
*Debugging
*Display management
*Extensibility
*File management
*form
*Internet Protocol
*Page processing
*Security
*Variable manipulation
*Other tags (cfimage, cfregistry etc.)

== Custom tags ==
CFML allows language extensions in the form of custom tags, which are tags created by the developer that are not part of the CFML language itself. Custom tags are regular CFML files which are intended to be invoked as tags, although it is possible to treat a template as both a custom tag and a regular template. Custom tags are written in CFML and are typically invoked by prefixing the custom tag&#x27;s file name with &quot;cf_&quot;, although there are other ways to invoke custom tags.

If a template is invoked as a custom tag, the attributes used to invoke that tag are available within the tag in an &quot;attributes&quot; scope and the variables for the calling page are accessible via the &quot;caller&quot; scope.

For example, if writing a custom tag to perform addition, taking two attributes and adding them together, the tag would be an addition.cfm file which could look like this:

&lt;cfset caller.addition = attributes.first + attributes.second /&gt;
&lt;cfexit method=&quot;exitTag&quot; /&gt;
Assuming the tag is in the same directory as the file (or in a pre-defined customtags directory), it can be invoked thus:

&lt;cf_addition first=&quot;1&quot; second=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
CFX tags are custom tags which are developed using Java or C++, and are prefixed with cfx_ just like cf_. Java and C++ tags are added to the CFML runtime environment using the CFML engine&#x27;s administrator or by editing configuration files.

On some CFML engines JSP tags can also be included in CFML pages using the &lt;cfimport&gt; tag.

== Functions ==
ColdFusion Markup Language includes a set of functions that you use to perform logical and arithmetic operations and manipulate data.
== ColdFusion Components (CFCs) ==
CFCs provide some (not all) of the typical features and functionality that are provided by object-oriented (OOP) languages.
To create a CFC:
:Create a file with a .CFC extension (this distinguishes CFCs from ColdFusion templates, which have a .CFM extension).
:Use four tags to create the components, define their functions and arguments, and return a value.
::&lt;cfcomponent&gt;: Defines a CFC
::&lt;cffunction&gt;: Defines the functions (methods) within a CFC
::&lt;cfargument&gt;: Defines the arguments (parameters) that a function accepts
::&lt;cfreturn&gt;: Returns a value or result from a function
CFCs are plain CFML. Within a CFC any CFML tag, function, custom tag, other components, etc. may be used.

CFCs can be used in various ways. If a method contained in a CFC simply needs to be invoked, the &lt;cfinvoke&gt; tag will create an instance of the CFC, invoke the desired method, and then destroy the instance of the CFC. &lt;cfinvoke&gt; takes the name of the component (minus the .cfc extension) and the method to execute. To access any returned data, the RETURNVARIABLE attribute provides the name of a variable to contain whatever the function returns.
CFCs are created using four tags, saved as .CFC files, and invoked using the &lt;cfinvoke&gt; tag.

In the example below, component temperature.cfc has a method FtoC which converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The test.cfm template invokes the method and converts 212 degrees Fahrenheit and outputs the result.
&lt;!--- temperature.cfc ---&gt;
&lt;cfcomponent&gt;
 &lt;cffunction name=&quot;FtoC&quot; access=&quot;public&quot; returntype=&quot;numeric&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfargument name=&quot;fahrenheit&quot; required=&quot;yes&quot; type=&quot;numeric&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;cfset answer= (fahrenheit - 32)*100/180 /&gt;
 &lt;cfreturn answer /&gt;
 &lt;/cffunction&gt;
&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;
&lt;!--- test.cfm ---&gt;
&lt;cfset fDegrees = 212 /&gt;
&lt;cfinvoke component=&quot;temperature&quot; method=&quot;FtoC&quot; returnvariable=&quot;result&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfinvokeargument name=&quot;fahrenheit&quot; value=&quot;#fDegrees#&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/cfinvoke&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#fDegrees#&amp;deg;F = #result#&amp;deg;C&lt;/cfoutput&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
CFCs may also be instantiated as objects. Assuming a CFC file called Person.cfc, an instance of this CFC would be instantiated as follows:

&lt;cfset person = CreateObject(&quot;component&quot;, &quot;Person&quot;) /&gt;

CFCs also form the basis of the ability to create web services in CFML. A CFC is created in the usual way, and the attribute access=&quot;remote&quot; added to any function within the CFC will make that function available to be called as a SOAP-based web service. The CFML engine auto-generates a WSDL and creates all the necessary stubs for the web service to function.

<doc id="962934" wikidata="Q1007388" url="?curid=962934" title="Gajary">
<text>Gajary (; ) is a village and municipality in western Slovakia close to the town of Malacky in the Bratislava region. It lies around 40 km (25 statute miles) north-west of Slovakia&#x27;s capital Bratislava close to the Austrian border. The village has around 3500 inhabitants.

The village is an important archaeological site: findings from the Neolithic period, Eneolithic period, Bronze Age, early Slavic period (several Slavic settlements) have been excavated there.

==Names and etymology==
The Slovak name &quot;Gajary&quot; (1460 &quot;Gayary&quot;) comes from German personal name Geier (1337 &quot;Gaywar&quot;, later German name was &quot;Gairing&quot;). In the 14th century, the village had also the Hungarian name &quot;Öregház&quot; (&quot;Old House&quot;, 1377 &quot;Eureghaz&quot;), but the name was forgotten and then they used the name of German origin &quot;Gajár&quot;.

==Genealogical resources==

<doc id="962941" wikidata="Q5415763" url="?curid=962941" title="Evangelical Union (Scotland)">
<text>The Evangelical Union was a 19th-century religious denomination which originated in the suspension of the Rev. James Morison, minister of a presbyterian United Secession congregation in Kilmarnock, Scotland, for certain views regarding faith, the work of the Holy Spirit in salvation, and the extent of the atonement, which were regarded by the supreme court of his church as anti-Calvinistic and heretical. It professed a creed which allowed them greater freedom as preachers of the Gospel.

Morison was suspended by the presbytery in 1841 after publishing in the previous year a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Question, &#x27;What must I do to be saved?&#x27; Answered&quot; under the pseudonym Philanthropos, and soon withdrew from the United Secession Church. His father, who was minister at Bathgate, and two other ministers, were deposed not long afterwards for similar opinions. The four met at Kilmarnock on 16 May 1843 (two days before the Disruption of the Free Church), and, on the basis of certain doctrinal principles, formed themselves into an association under the name of the Evangelical Union, for the purpose of countenancing, counselling and otherwise aiding one another, and also for the purpose of training up spiritual and devoted young men to carry forward the work and pleasure of the Lord.

The doctrinal views of the new denomination gradually assumed a more decidedly anti-Calvinistic form, and they began also to find many sympathizers among the Congregationalists of Scotland. Nine students were expelled from the Congregational Academy for holding Morisonian doctrines, and in 1845 eight churches were disjoined from the Congregational Union of Scotland and formed a connection with the Evangelical Union.

The Union exercised no jurisdiction over the individual churches connected with it, and in this respect adhered to the Independent or Congregational form of church government; but those congregations which originally were Presbyterian vested their government in a body of elders. In 1889 the denomination numbered 93 churches; and in 1896, after prolonged negotiation, the Evangelical Union was incorporated with the Congregational Union of Scotland.

Keir Hardie was a lay preacher for the Evangelical Union; he converted to Christianity in 1897 and considered himself to be a Christian Socialist: &quot;I have said, both in writing and from the platform many times, that the impetus which drove me first into the Labour movement, and the inspiration which has carried me on in it, has been derived more from the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth than from all other sources combined.&quot;

Eric Liddell, a famous Olympian and missionary, was involved with this group.

<text>Nikos Xylouris (, 7 July 1936 – 8 February 1980), also known by the Cretan nickname of Psaronikos (), was a Greek singer, Cretan Lyra player, and composer, known for performing both rural traditional and urban orchestral music.

==Origins and background==
Nikos Xylouris was born in Anogeia, Mylopotamos Province, Rethymno Prefecture, a village on the slopes of Mount Ida in Crete,(also known as Psiloritis), the highest mountain on the island of Crete, the largest of the Greek Islands, situated at the southernmost end of the Aegean Sea, and a region known for producing several prominent musicians.

Xylouris was the fourth child and first son of Giorgis Xylouris, born after sisters Elli, Zoumboulia, and Euridice. His brothers, Antonis Xylouris or Psarantonis () and Giannis Xylouris or Psarogiannis () are also celebrated figures of Cretan music, and other members of their extended family continue in this tradition.

Xylouris&#x27; nickname &quot;Psaronikos&quot; (with &quot;Psaro&quot; meaning &quot;Fish/Fish-like&quot;, plus his given name Niko[lao]s) was inherited from his grandfather Antonis. According to Xylouris, and reiterated by his brother Giannis, Antonis displayed great valor during one of the many instances of the Greek Revolution of 1821 and was said to &quot;consume the Turks as if they were fish.&quot; The nickname was passed down along the male line of the family, with each person&#x27;s given name substituting the inaugural one, while the prefix remained.

Another account states that Antonis kept company with a group of Cretans who used guerrilla warfare tactics against the Turks, dispersing and reuniting at predetermined locations after brief engagements. Antonis would &quot;catch up to the rest of them as if they were a school of fish that broke up and then coalesced again; they were as slippery as fish, in waters they knew all too well, and thus impossible to apprehend,&quot; with Antonis himself being the most nimble, frustrating the Turks who could never capture him. Another variation claims he was quick enough to strike at two distant target locations in a single day, disappearing as quickly and efficiently as fish vanish in the sea.

Such nicknames, bestowed for specific traits or actions, are prevalent throughout the Greek countryside, and their familial aspect is often retained to distinguish between clans, branches, or unrelated families with identical surnames. Some nicknames may be unique to specific individuals, reflecting a notable incident in their lives that warrants praise, attention, recognition, or condemnation.

When Xylouris was eight years old, during World War II, the Nazis razed Anogeia to the ground in reprisal for acts of Cretan Resistance against the Axis Occupation, and the casualties the Germans had sustained during the their initial assault on Crete some three years prior. German paratroopers had descended upon the island but were decimated by the locals. The mayor and citizens of Anogeia supported and harbored Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents and Cretan Resistance fighters. Additionally, under Captain William Stanley Moss, Cretans ambushed a detachment German soldiers who had received orders to attack Anogeia. Captain Patrick Leigh Fermor, an SOE operative, had also been in Anogeia during the kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe in May 1944 but escaped with his band of Cretan partisans when the German forces approached. These acts of defiance led the Germans to target specific villages, sometimes regardless of direct villager involvement.

The razing of Kandanos and the Viannos massacres were similar instances of Nazi atrocities committed in Crete. In the aftermath, the Xylouris family, along with the other inhabitants of Anogeia, were forced to flee to other villages of the Mylopotamos region, and some found refuge in major cities of the island until the Liberation of Crete, which came after the Allied Advance and the German Surrender. Nearly a year after the razing, the damage inflicted upon Anogeia was documented by a scientific committee officially appointed by the newly restored Greek government, including writer Nikos Kazantzakis and Professor Ioannis Kakridis, both remembered for their joint translation of the works of Homer, among other literary endeavors.

Upon returning to Anogeia, citizens had to rebuild their homes and town, imbuing them with a sense of purpose, dedication, self-reliance, solidarity, and pride. Due to the destruction of village archives, some ambiguity remains as to the exact birth dates of all persons lacking additional official documentation, including Xylouris. This is why certain sources may offer conflicting birth dates, although the one mentioned herein is considered the most probable and accurate by consensus, based on village elder and relative testimony. In Xylouris&#x27; case, his date of birth coincided with the Greek Orthodox feast of Saint Kyriaki, making the occasion memorable. The unique cultural climate of Crete left lasting impressions on Allied personnel who had served there. In the years following the war, Patrick Leigh Fermor often sang &quot;Filedem,&quot; (Greek: Φιλεντέμ), which would later become one of Xylouris&#x27; most popular songs.

==Early life and career in Crete==
At a young age, Xylouris discovered his artistic inclination. All three brothers learned the basics of playing the mandolin and other folk musical instruments with friends at village feasts. He convinced his father Giorgis to purchase him a Cretan Lyra (a three- or four-stringed Cretan fiddle analogue, played upright, usually supported on the knee), a significant investment. Giorgis initially opposed his son becoming a musician, which he considered a menial and disreputable occupation, preferring that he attain higher education to improve his life and escape poverty. However, between the boy&#x27;s entreaties and the encouragement of local school teacher Menelaos Dramountanis, who recognized Xylouris&#x27; potential and considered his singing voice a decisive asset, Giorgis acquiesced, and Xylouris acquired his first instrument at twelve.

After an apprenticeship under lyra player Leonidas Klados, Xylouris started performing at social functions and local festivities, usually accompanied by his younger brother Giannis on the lute. Gifted musicians were generously rewarded at these events by participants who would present the orchestra with banknotes for each requested song or tune. Musicians&#x27; reputations grew by crowd acclaim and word of mouth, proven able to please, stir, and entertain their audience, sometimes for days. Having earned a reputation as a skilled musician and aspiring to financial independence, at seventeen Xylouris moved from Anogeia to Heraklion, the largest city in Crete, where he performed nightly at the venue &quot;Kastron&quot; (Greek: Κάστρον). Initially, he struggled to make ends meet, as the urban audience had moved away from Cretan traditional music and had become accustomed to European rhythms, looking down upon the &quot;old people&#x27;s music&quot; of rural areas. Folk musicians struggled to adapt and survive financially, lacking familiarity with foreign lyrics.

City musicians distrusted newcomers and were unwilling to yield professional space. Xylouris was reluctant to admit his hardships to his father, assuring him to the contrary. Gradually, he developed a following and carved out a niche for himself. His friends and admirers organized gatherings for him to play music, earn a living, and attract support. In 1967, he helped establish in Heraklion the first exclusively Cretan folk music hall, named &quot;Erotokritos&quot; after the Erotokritos, catering to rural Cretans visiting the city for business or social reasons. These visitors would bring their families and convince their urban acquaintances to join, reviving Cretan folk music in the city. Over time, Xylouris found acceptance as a musician in Heraklion and caused his urban audience to rediscover, appreciate, and preserve Cretan folk music. His second goal was to make that music known beyond Crete, and with his move to Athens, he captivated the Greek national audience and introduced Cretan traditional music to every Greek household. Therefore, he is partially credited with achieving both.

Xylouris&#x27; first studio recording was in 1958 with a 7-inch 45rpm vinyl single featuring &quot;Mia mavrofora otan perna&quot; (When a woman clad in all black passes by | Greek: Μια μαυροφόρα όταν περνά) and &quot;Den klaine oi dynates kardies&quot; (Strong hearts don&#x27;t cry | Greek: Δεν κλαίνε οι δυνατές καρδιές). Although Odeon Records granted them an audition, executives were worried that Cretan music lacked commercial potential and initially rejected the release. Greek MP from Crete Pavlos Vardinogiannis, who provided Xylouris lodging and was fond of Cretan musical tradition, intervened, vouching for Xylouris and promising to reimburse Odeon for every unsold unit. Odeon relented, and the recording took place with Xylouris&#x27; wife Ourania providing supporting vocals. The single was a major success, vindicating Vardinogiannis. Other singles followed with Odeon, but executives remained ambivalent about Xylouris and Cretan music. Later, when Columbia signed Xylouris and his popularity exploded, Odeon tried to lure him back with a lucrative counteroffer. However, Xylouris, placed honor and loyalty before profits and self-advancement, politely turned them down. When Columbia found out about the bid, they improved the financial terms of Xylouris&#x27; contract without him requesting a renegotiation.

The turning point in his career came in 1969 with another 7-inch 45rpm vinyl single under the Columbia label, featuring &quot;Anyfantou&quot; (Weaver | Greek: Ανυφαντού) and &quot;Kavgades me to giasemi&quot; (Quarrels with the jasmine | Greek: Καβγάδες με το γιασεμί). The single was a success, and the public&#x27;s response suggested that prior reservations concerning the appeal of Cretan folk music were unfounded. Xylouris caught the eye of company executives, and his future looked promising. Shortly after, he began making appearances in Athens, which would become his new home. Nevertheless, when Xylouris met with the musicologist and Director for Folk Music Programming at the Greek National Radio Simon Karas, the latter derided Anyfantou and questioned Xylouris&#x27; ability to render traditional songs, an opinion which none of the major composers and conductors Xylouris would later work with shared. Ultimately, the Greek National Radio embraced Anyfantou, featuring the song in a special broadcast.

==Later life and career in Athens==
Regarding his artistic discovery by the musical establishment of Athens, two views have been put forward. According to one narrative, his career progressed from early appearances in Athens at the Konaki Cretan Folk Music Hall. Musicians who distinguished themselves in Crete were invited to perform for Cretans residing in the Capital. During such a stint, Xylouris met film director and screenwriter Errikos Thalassinos, who introduced him to composer Yannis Markopoulos, who had previously written film score for some of Thalassinos&#x27; projects. Markopoulos and Xylouris began a collaboration that spanned the better part of a decade. However, according to Xylouris&#x27; wife Ourania, Takis Lambropoulos, the head of Columbia Records Greece, first spotted Xylouris singing at a wedding reception in Crete, was moved by his voice, and made a live recording of him. Lambropoulos then sent the tape to composer Stavros Xarchakos, who was living in Paris, to make him aware of his find. Xarchakos would become a close friend to Xylouris and his family. This version is supported by reports in the Athenian Press that Lambropoulos had found &quot;a major new vocal talent&quot; in Crete, as well as the bond formed between him and Xylouris. Xarchakos and Xylouris also had a prolific collaboration, which extended into the theater.

Eventually, Xylouris would work with additional composers and conductors, such as Christodoulos Chalaris, Christos Leontis, and Linos Kokotos, performing poetry by Nikos Gatsos, Yannis Ritsos, Giorgos Seferis, Kostas Varnalis, Dionysios Solomos, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Kostas Karyotakis, Rigas Feraios, Kostas Kindynis, and Kostas Georgousopoulos (a.k.a. Kostas Myris).

Xylouris relocated to Athens during the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, which had come to power after the coup d&#x27;état of April 21, 1967. Entertainment not commissioned by the regime offered a respite from its oppressive nature. Youthful audiences flocked to establishments operating around the Acropolis, where Xylouris and other singers performed. Cretan traditional songs, especially Rizitika, previously meant to foster revolution against the Ottomans and sustain hope for Cretan liberation, were repurposed to voice opposition against the Junta and express longing for its demise. Xylouris realized how empowering these songs were for students rebelling against the dictatorship and stood by their side during the Athens Polytechnic School Uprising of 1973, entering the premises and singing songs banned by the Junta, alongside Stavros Xarchakos. Thus, Xylouris became a symbol of hope to the Greek people. His songs were banned from radio and television, and he was summoned to the Greek Military Police Headquarters. Venues that he appeared in were surveilled by operatives of the regime. As a result, his voice became identified not only with Cretan traditional and modern Athenian music but with the movement to restore Democracy.

Composers of the era attempted to blend traditional sounds and instruments with orchestral arrangements and novel poetic works. This genre of music was uplifting to Greeks, who needed a different cultural environment than the one the Junta offered. At the same time, around 1971, Greek intellectuals sought to convey anti-dictatorial messages with the opportunity of the 150th Anniversary of the Greek Revolution of 1821, while the Junta aimed to exploit the same occasion for pro-regime propaganda. The theater company of Tzeni Karezi and Kostas Kazakos commissioned playwright Iakovos Kambanellis, a survivor of the Mauthausen concentration camp and later member of the Academy of Athens, to write a retrospective of modern Greek history, scored by Xarchakos, who offered Xylouris the part of the main singer. The result was the play &quot;To Megalo Mas Tsirko&quot; (Our Great Circus | Greek: Το Μεγάλο μας Τσίρκο), staged at the Athinaion Theater, which enjoyed success. Slogans used in the play, such as Psomi - Paideia - Eleftheria (Bread - Education - Freedom | Greek: Ψωμί - Παιδεία - Ελευθερία) and Foni Laou - Orgi Theou (Voice of the People - Wrath of God | Greek: Φωνή Λαού - Οργή Θεού) were adopted by protesting university students, became linked with their uprising, and found their way into the Greek Nation&#x27;s collective consciousness after the restoration of Democratic rule in 1974.

Following the restoration of Democracy, Xylouris released additional albums with Markopoulos and Xarchakos and continued to make live appearances and concerts. In the days after the fall of the Junta, he participated in the liberation concert immortalized as Tragoudia tis Fotias (Songs of Fire | Greek: Τραγούδια της Φωτιάς) by director Nikos Koundouros, before the Athenian audience.

==Public and critical acclaim==
In 1966, Xylouris represented Greece at the San Remo Music Festival and won First Prize in its Folk Music Section. In 1971, he was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque by the Académie Charles-Cros in France for his performance of the Cretan &quot;Rizitika&quot; album with Yannis Markopoulos.

==Personal life and family==
Xylouris met his wife Ourania Melampianakis at a festival in her native village of Venerato, where he was performing. The pair only exchanged glances, due to local courtship customs. Ourania came from an affluent family, while Xylouris was seen as an itinerant musician. Although Cretan society did not enforce strict class segregation, pairings viewed as socially unequal were frowned upon. In the following months, Xylouris would serenade Ourania regularly a custom shared by many medievally Italian-occupied areas of Greece and which many male youths of Crete would often perform to woo the young ladies they admired.

Eventually, Xylouris proposed to Ourania, and the pair eloped heading for Anogeia where the wedding would occur. Although her father did assent to the marriage, Ourania was ostracized by her family for the elopement, creating a lifelong psychological wound. Eventually, Ourania and her family reconciled after her husband&#x27;s career took off.

The couple had two children, a son named Giorgis (George) and a daughter named Rinio (Irene), and remained married until Xylouris&#x27; passing. Ourania has maintained her mourning (Greek: πένθος) ever since and never remarried.

The couple&#x27;s love story echoes the Erotokritos by Vitsentzos Kornaros, select verses of which were sung by Xylouris in one of his albums.

==Illness and death==
Nikos Xylouris died of lung cancer and metastasis to the brain on 8 February 1980, in Piraeus, Greece, and was interred at the First Cemetery of Athens.

<text>&quot;Maher-shalal-hash-baz&quot; was the second prophetic name mentioned in Isaiah chapter 8–9.

==Biblical accounts==
The name is mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible, both times in the Book of Isaiah chapter 8:

Isaiah 8:1
:Moreover the said unto me, Take thee a great roll and write in it with a man&#x27;s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

Isaiah 8:3
:And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and bore a son. Then said the to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.

==Analysis==
The child Maher-shalal-hash-baz is the second prophetic-name child after the birth of Immanuel – traditionally understood as the son of Abi the bride of king Ahaz, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the future king Hezekiah, by many Jewish commentators, or of another woman. The phrases &quot;maher-shalal&quot; and &quot;hash-baz&quot; are synonymous, both meaning approximately &quot;quickly to the plunder&quot;. The name Maher-shalal-hash-baz is a reference to the impending plunder of Samaria and Damascus by the king of Assyria, Tiglath-Pileser III (734–732 BCE).

This is often counted the longest name (and word) used in the Bible, though a possible longer name-phrase in Isaiah is found in &quot;called Pele-joez-el-gibbor-abi-ad-sar-shalom&quot;.

The section is also quoted in the Book of Mormon.

<text>XFA (also known as XFA forms) stands for XML Forms Architecture, a family of proprietary XML specifications that was suggested and developed by JetForm to enhance the processing of web forms. It can be also used in PDF files starting with the PDF 1.5 specification. The XFA specification is referenced as an external specification necessary for full application of the ISO 32000-1 specification (PDF 1.7). The XML Forms Architecture was not standardized as an ISO standard, and has been deprecated in PDF 2.0.

==Overview==
XFA&#x27;s main extension to XML are computationally active tags. In addition, all instances created from a given XFA form template keep the specification of data capture, rendering, and manipulation rules from the original. Another major advantage of XFA is that its data format allows compatibility with other systems, and with changes to other technology, applications and technology standards.

According to JetForm&#x27;s submission to the World Wide Web Consortium, &quot;XFA addresses the needs of organizations to securely capture, present, move, process, output and print information associated with electronic forms.&quot; The XFA proposal was submitted to the W3C in May 1999.

In 2002, the JetForm Corporation was acquired by Adobe Systems, and the latter introduced XFA forms with PDF 1.5 and the subsequent Acrobat releases (6 and 7) in 2003.

XFA forms are saved internally in PDF files or as XDP (XML Data Package) files which can be opened in Adobe&#x27;s LiveCycle Designer software. 
An XDP can package a PDF file, along with XML form and template data. XDP provides a mechanism for packaging form components within a surrounding XML container.

Although XFA can make use of PDF, XFA is not tied to a particular page description language.

The XFA specification includes an appendix that discusses details of the Adobe-specific XFA implementation and behaviors of Adobe products that deviate from the XFA specification.

Data filled in an XFA form may be submitted to a host using an HTTP POST operation in XDP format, PDF format, XFDF format, XML 1.0 format or as an URL-encoded format.

XFA supports the use of XSLT to transform the XML data before it is loaded to XFA Data DOM or after it is unloaded from XFA Data DOM.

One of XFA approaches to pagination duplicates the pagination logic and much of the syntax of XSL-FO.

XFA forms are synonymous with SmartForms in the Australian government.

===Static and dynamic forms===
XFA defines static forms (since XFA 2.0 and before) and dynamic forms (since XFA 2.1 or 2.2).

In a static form the form’s appearance and layout is fixed, regardless of the field content. Any unfilled fields are present in the form. By default, static forms do not require re-rendering. XFA recognises two types of static forms: &quot;old-style static forms&quot; (using &quot;full XFA&quot;) and XFAF (a subset of full XFA, defined since XFA 2.5).

Dynamic forms (defined since XFA 2.1 or 2.2) can change in appearance in several ways in response to changes in the data. Dynamic form requires rendering of its content on file opening. Dynamic forms may also be designed to change structure to accommodate changes in the structure of the data supplied to the form. For example, a page of a form may be omitted if there is no data for it. Another example is a field that may occupy a variable amount of space on the page, resizing itself to efficiently hold its content. Dynamic form cannot rely on a PDF representation of its boilerplate, because the positioning and layout of the boilerplate change as the fields grow and shrink or as subforms are omitted and included.

== Usage with Portable Document Format ==

PDF 1.7 supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. 
* AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms), introduced and included in the PDF 1.2 format specification.
* Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification as an optional feature (The XFA specification is not included in the PDF specification, it is only referenced.)

Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms. When an XFA is packaged inside a PDF file, it is placed in the AcroForm document resources dictionary (&quot;Shell PDF&quot;) or referenced from the AcroForm entry in the document catalog.

Creating XFA Forms for use in Adobe Reader requires Adobe LiveCycle Designer. Adobe Reader contains &quot;disabled features&quot; for use of XFA Forms, that will activate only when opening a PDF document that was created using enabling technology available only from Adobe. The XFA Forms are not compatible with Adobe Reader prior to version 6.

===Profiles===
Starting with XFA 2.5 forms can use a subset of the full XFA capability. Currently the only specified is the XFAF profile.

XFA can be used as: 
* &quot;full&quot; XFA - which express all of the form, including boilerplate, directly in XFA (without any PDF or without a complete PDF background). It can be packaged inside a &quot;shell PDF&quot; with minimal PDF markup or as a standalone XDP. It is used for dynamic XFA forms (since XFA 2.1) and also for so called &quot;traditional&quot; (old-style) static XFA forms. Optionally it may include a pre-rendered depiction of the XFA form as PDF pages - but it is useful only for traditional static forms. Dynamic XFA must be rendered on file opening. 
* XFAF (XFA Foreground) subset - (introduced in XFA 2.5) - a form in which each page of the XFA form overlays a PDF background. It can be used only for static XFA forms. This architecture uses only a subset of XFA. It can be packaged inside a regular PDF document or as a standalone XDP file with embedded PDF. In XFAF each XFA field corresponds to a PDF interactive field (AcroForm field).

===Packaging===
XFA forms can be created and used as PDF 1.5 - 1.7 files or as XDP (XML Data Package). The format of an XFA resource in PDF is described by the XML Data Package Specification. PDF may contain XFA in XDP format, but XFA may also contain PDF.

When the XFA (XML Forms Architecture) grammars used for an XFA form are moved from one application to another, they must be packaged as an XML Data Package. The XDP may be a standalone document or it may in turn be carried inside a PDF document.

XFA Form packaging variants (using XDP): 
* as a standalone XML Data Package (XDP) (.xdp file) which can optionally also include a PDF file 
* inside a regular PDF Document - used for static forms - XFAF. 
* inside a &quot;Shell PDF&quot; - used for the &quot;full XFA&quot; form (dynamic or traditional static) - A Shell PDF file contains only a minimal skeleton of PDF markup plus the complete XFA content, any fonts and images needed for rendering of the form. It minimizes the file size and the rendering overhead is moved from the server to the client.

Packaging an XDP within PDF has the advantage that it is more compact, because PDF is compressed. XDP in PDF can be digitally signed in ways that a standalone XDP cannot.

In contrast, packaging form components within an XML container (XDP) makes it easy for standard XML applications to work with XFA forms. The XML components are human readable and easy editable (in contrast with PDF source code). When in XDP form, an XFA document may be validated using schemas attached to XFA specification.

===Compatibility===
Most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. When generating a shell PDF it is recommended to include in the PDF markup a simple one-page PDF image displaying a warning message (e.g. &quot;To view the full contents of this document, you need a later version of the PDF viewer.&quot;, &quot;The full content of this file cannot be displayed with your current PDF viewer.&quot;, &quot;Please wait... If this message is not eventually replaced by the proper contents of the document, your PDF viewer may not be able to display this type of document.&quot;, etc.). PDF processors that can render XFA content should either not display the supplied warning page image or replace it quickly with the dynamic form content.

In 2013, as a solution for mobile platforms and desktop platforms without XFA support, Adobe created software that creates online HTML5 fillable forms from XFA (known as Adobe &quot;Mobile Forms&quot;). Mobile Forms are not a single file like a PDF or XDP.

===Rich text===
Rich text may appear in data supplied to the XFA forms, in XFA templates as default text values, as field captions, or as boilerplate (draw) content.

Starting with PDF 1.5 (XFA 2.02), the text contents of variable text form fields, as well as markup annotations, may include formatting information (style information). These rich text strings are XML documents that conform to the rich text conventions specified for the XML Forms Architecture specification, which is itself a subset of the XHTML 1.0 specification, augmented with a restricted set of CSS2 style attributes.

In PDF 1.6, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.2. In PDF 1.7, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.4. It was announced in 2011 that PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000 Part 2) would reference XFA 3.1, but when published, PDF 2.0 deprecated it.

=== PDF/A ===
When an XFA form is converted to PDF/A, both the boilerplate and field content are flattened into a PDF appearance stream. PDF/A forbids active content and all XFA content except, optionally, the XML Data Document (forms data created by a user).

== Standardization ==
The XML Forms Architecture specification is not included in the PDF 1.7 standard (ISO 32000-1:2008) and it is only referenced as an external proprietary specification created and published by Adobe. However, the ISO 32000-1 references XFA as normative and indispensable for the application of the ISO 32000-1 specification. XFA was not standardized as an ISO standard. 

Since 2007, development of PDF standard has been conducted by ISO&#x27;s Technical Committee 171/Subcommittee 2/Working Group 8 (TC 171/SC 2/WG 8).

In 2011 the ISO Committee urged Adobe Systems to submit the XFA Specification, XML Forms Architecture (XFA), to ISO for standardization, and requested that Adobe Systems stabilize the XFA specification. The Committee expressed its concerns about the stability of the XFA specification.

In 2017 the ISO Committee deprecated XFA from PDF 2.0.

<text>The 2nd Parachute Division () was an airborne division of the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during World War II.

==Formation==
The 2nd Parachute Division was raised in 1943, with the 2nd Parachute Regiment, recently detached from the 1st Parachute Division, serving as its nucleus.

==Operational history==

In May, the division was sent to Avignon in France, where it became part of the &quot;XI Flieger Corps&quot; along with the 1st Parachute Division. This Corps served as the reserve for the German 10th Army in Italy.
When the Italian government started to crumble in September, the 2nd Parachute Division was dispatched to Italy. It carried out coastal defense duties near the Tiber estuary. The men moved to Rome in the evening of September 8 and participated in a subsequent operation to capture the Italian Army defeating a large assembly of infantry and armoured troops that in Porta San Paolo tried to stop them. The 1st Battalion of the 2nd Parachute Regiment participated in the capture of Leros Island in the Dodecanese. The island was then still occupied by Italian forces supplemented by British units following the surrender of Italy. By November 16, the island was retaken by German forces.

In October 1943, the division was deployed to the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union and was subordinated to the 42nd Army Corps, west of Kiev. On December 15, the division was airlifted south toward Kirovograd to contain a Soviet breakout. A German counter-attack then commenced against heavy opposition. By December 23, the attack faltered and the division returned to the defensive. In January 1944, the division remained on the Eastern Front, successfully opposing the Soviet offensive around Kirovograd. The Soviet advance resumed in March causing the division to retreat behind the Bug River. The division fought its last actions on the Eastern Front in May during a counterattack against a Red Army bridgehead across the Dniestr river. At the end of May the weakened division was pulled from the line and returned to Germany for refit, during which time was supplied with more than 1000 FG 42 automatic rifles as part of a new program to equip the paratrooper divisions, although only the 2nd Parachute Division would have the weapon in large numbers. The division was sent to garrison the northern French area.

During the Allied D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, the 6th Regiment was stationed in the Carentan area of the Cotentin Peninsula, near the US 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s drop zones. The regiment was heavily engaged in the subsequent battles, including at Saint-Lô. On June 13 the remainder of the division was transferred to Brest in western France. In July, the surviving elements of the 6th Regiment were caught in the Falaise Pocket and destroyed during the Allied advance. By August 9 the remainder of the division was driven back and cut off in the city of Brest, where it surrendered on September 20. A new division was formed by December; it fought in the defense of Germany in January 1945 and ended the war in the Ruhr Pocket in April. Parts of the already depleted division managed to break out from the Ruhr Pocket and was absorbed by the 6th Parachute Division in mid April.

==War crimes==
The division has been implicated in a number of war crimes in Italy between September and October 1943, as follows:
* Rome (16 and 23 September, 7 and 23 October)
* Palidoro (23 September, shooting of Salvo D&#x27;Acquisto and 1 October, shooting of 3 civilians)
* Tolfa (10 October, shooting of 12 civilians)
* Mentana (27 October, shooting of 25 civilians and 4 British former prisoners of war)
* Bieda di Vetralla (29 October, shooting of 14 civilians)

<text>Malacky (German: &quot;Malatzka&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Malacka&quot;) is a town and municipality in western Slovakia around north of Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

It is one of the key cities of the region &quot;Záhorie&quot;, between the Little Carpathians in the east and Morava River in the west and a cultural and economic hub for nearby villages such as Gajary, Kostolište, Veľké Leváre and Jakubov. The town is located on the large Prague-Brno-Bratislava highway, and many residents commute daily to Bratislava. The Little Carpathians mountain range provides excellent opportunities for recreational activities like hiking or mountain biking, with its wide array of signposted trails.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is uncertain. According to the first theory, the name refers to the Hungarian word &quot;malacka&quot; which means &quot;piglet&quot; in Hungarian and because the town seal features a pig. A drawback of this theory is that the Hungarian &quot;malacka&quot; is only a later borrowing from Slovenian and the name is older than the borrowing (Slovene &quot;mladec&quot; – a young man, in wide meaning also a young animal; Slovak equivalent is &quot;mládenec&quot;). Other theories derive the name from Slovak &quot;mláky&quot; (fens, swamps), &quot;mlátiť&quot; (to flail, to smash, thus a placename derived from &quot;mlátiť&quot; was &quot;Mlaky&quot; &gt; &quot;Malacky&quot;) or from the name of the Malina creek (recorded as &quot;Maliscapotoca&quot;).

==History==
The name of the city was first mentioned in writing in 1206. During World War II, Malacky was captured on 5 April 1945 by troops of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front.

==Famous Buildings and Sites==
The most prominent sites in Malacky include the Franciscan church of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, the so-called &quot;Palffy Palace&quot; and the renovated synagogue. The church includes a precise from 1653 of the so-called Holy Stairs (Scala Sancta) that Christ ascended to the Pretorium of Pilate. The Palffy Palace until recently was used as a hospital and is currently unoccupied. It has recently been acquired by the local municipality. Located in the center of Malacky is also a large renovated synagogue built in 1886 in Moorish Revival style which is now being used a cultural center. Adjacent to it there is sport arena &quot;MALINA&quot; containing two indoor swimming pools (25m and 12m) and a multifunctional hall used for handball, basketball, volleyball and indoor football.

==Economy==
Swedspan, a subsidiary of IKEA, operates a large lumber plant just south of the city. Additionally the Kuchyňa airbase, which is occasionally used by the US Air Force and other NATO air forces for training purposes, is located approximately east of the city.

In September 2008, Slovak National Party (SNS) President Ján Slota facilitated the erection of a large Slovak cross near Malacky as a demonstration of Slovak nationalism.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 18,063 inhabitants. 96.68% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.02% Czechs and 0.51% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 70.35% Roman Catholics, 19.48% people with no religious affiliation, and 1.98% Lutherans.
According to the 1910 census, 75% were Slovaks.

==People==
*István Friedrich, prime minister of Hungary for three months in 1919, was born here.
*Ernst Wiesner, modern architect who designed buildings in Brno, was born here.
*Martin Benka, a Slovak painter and illustrator, was born near here and died here in 1971.

<text>The prime minister of Jordan is the head of government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

Since the establishment of the state as the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, 44 people have held the position of prime minister, several of whom have served multiple non-consecutive terms. Tawfik Abu Al-Huda served for a total of 12 years and is considered the longest-serving prime minister.

Jordan&#x27;s current constitution, which was promulgated in 1951, outlines that the prime minister is appointed by the king of Jordan, whose government must be approved through a vote of confidence by the elected lower chamber of Parliament, the House of Representatives. Jordan has had one parliamentary government in its history, the short-lived government led by Suleiman Nabulsi&#x27;s National Socialist Party in 1956–57. 

The incumbent prime minister is Jafar Hassan, who assumed office on 15 September 2024.

<text>WSOC-TV (channel 9) is a television station in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, affiliated with ABC and Telemundo. It is owned by Cox Media Group alongside Kannapolis-licensed independent station WAXN-TV (channel 64). The two stations share studios on West 23rd Street north of uptown Charlotte; WSOC-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located near Reedy Creek Park in the Newell section of the city.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on April 28, 1957, as Charlotte&#x27;s third television station, after WBTV (channel 3) and WAYS-TV (channel 36, later WQMC-TV); it was also Charlotte&#x27;s second station on the VHF band. It operated from a temporary facility on Plaza Road Extension in what was then a rural portion of eastern Mecklenburg County.

WSOC was originally locally owned by Carolina Broadcasting, operated by the Jones family, along with WSOC radio (1240 AM, now WYFQ on 930 AM, and 103.7 FM). WSOC was the second radio station to sign on in Charlotte, having made its debut in 1929, seven years after the debut of WBT (1110 AM). Channel 9 originally operated as a primary NBC affiliate (owing to WSOC radio&#x27;s affiliation with the NBC Red Network), and maintained a secondary affiliation with ABC, sharing the network with WBTV. In 1959, Carolina Broadcasting merged with the Miami Valley Broadcasting Company, forerunner of Cox Enterprises. That same year, it dedicated its studios on North Tryon Street.

Channel 36 went off the air in 1955. It operated as educational WUTV from 1961 to 1963, then returned to the air in November 1964 as WCCB. WCCB moved to the stronger UHF channel 18 allocation in November 1966, but it continued to be at a competitive disadvantage because many Charlotte-area households did not yet have television sets with UHF tuning capability. As a result, ABC retained a secondary affiliation with WSOC and WBTV, while WCCB aired programs from all three networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) that WSOC and WBTV declined to air. In 1967, WSOC became an exclusive NBC affiliate, while WCCB became a full-time ABC affiliate.

By 1978, ABC had become the highest-rated broadcast television network in the United States for the first time; the network wanted a stronger affiliate in Charlotte than WCCB. WSOC switched its affiliation back to ABC on July 1, 1978, this time as a full-time affiliate. NBC programming was moved over to former independent station WRET (channel 36, now WCNC-TV), due to a promise by then-owner Ted Turner to make $2.5 million in upgrades to that station, including the planned launch of a news department and a more powerful transmitter. WCCB became an independent station by default, remaining so for the next nine years until it affiliated with Fox when that network launched in October 1986. The WSOC radio stations were sold off in the early 1990s (the AM station, now WYFQ, is now owned by Bible Broadcasting Network; WSOC-FM is currently owned by Beasley Broadcast Group).

By the mid-1990s, WSOC-TV had a problem. It owned the rights to a large amount of syndicated programming, but increased local news commitments left it without enough time in its broadcast day to air it all. In 1996, it found a solution in the form of a joint sales agreement with independent station WKAY-TV (channel 64). As part of the deal, WKAY moved its operations to WSOC-TV&#x27;s studios and changed its call letters to WAXN-TV. Under the JSA, channel 9 bought WAXN&#x27;s entire broadcast day, using it to air much of channel 9&#x27;s surplus inventory of syndicated programming. One of those programs was &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;; it had been a mainstay on channel 9 for decades on weekday afternoons at 5 p.m. before being bumped in favor of a 5 p.m. newscast. Cox purchased WAXN outright for $3 million in 1999, shortly after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reversed its long-standing ban on television station duopolies; the sale was officially approved by the FCC in 2000. WSOC-TV served as the Charlotte &quot;Love Network&quot; affiliate of the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; from 1974 to 2001; the program moved to WAXN thereafter, before returning to WSOC in 2013 (by this point, known as the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot;) after the program abandoned its syndicated long-form telethon format and became a shortened two-hour network telecast on ABC; the telecast was discontinued after 2014.

On December 21, 2010, a distraught 51-year-old woman armed with a gun entered the WSOC-TV studios, forcing the station to temporarily go off the air just after the start of that evening&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast. After a one-hour standoff, the woman was taken into custody; it was later determined that the gun was not loaded. No injuries were reported in the incident.

In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.

During the 2024–25 season, the Charlotte Hornets, FanDuel Sports Network Southeast and Cox Media Group reached an agreement allowing CMG to simulcast five Hornets games on over-the-air stations. In Charlotte, two games will air on WSOC with the other three games on sister station WAXN.

==News operation==

WSOC-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces an additional 17 hours of newscasts each week for sister station WAXN-TV (in the form of a two-hour extension of WSOC&#x27;s weekday morning newscast and an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast).

Since the early 1970s, WSOC-TV has used the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand for its newscasts. However, its overall news presentation is very similar to the &quot;Action News&quot; format at Atlanta sister station WSB-TV. When channel 9 expanded its 6 p.m. newscast to a full hour, it began airing &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; at 7 p.m. This ended in 1993, when the addition of a newscast at 5:30 p.m. led the station to cut back the 6 p.m. newscast to a half hour and &quot;World News Tonight&quot; moved back to 6:30.

For most of its first quarter-century on the air, WSOC&#x27;s newscasts placed a very distant second in the Charlotte market, behind the longer-established WBTV. However, in 1981, the station scored a major coup when longtime WBTV anchorman Doug Mayes moved to WSOC as its noon anchor, where he stayed until his retirement in 1992. Mayes said years later that WSOC made an offer too generous for him to turn down, considering that he had two kids in college at the time. The move quickly paid off; in 1982, it overtook WBTV for the lead at 11 p.m., a lead it held for almost 25 years. It surpassed WBTV in most other timeslots beginning in 1990, but lost the lead in the noon time period to WBTV in 1994.

Channel 9&#x27;s two-decade dominance of the early evening news timeslots largely stemmed from the former presence of &quot;Oprah&quot; as a lead-in to the 5 p.m. newscast; the syndicated talk show aired on channel 9 throughout its national run from 1986 to 2011. During the February 2011 ratings period, the station&#x27;s newscasts won in every time slot except noon and 11 p.m., which were won by WBTV. WSOC-TV lost the lead at noon as well in the February 2013 sweeps period.

By the February 2016 sweeps, however, the departure of a number of key reporters in 2015 resulted in WSOC-TV falling to second place in all timeslots. However, it maintained its historic dominance east of the Catawba River. WSOC-TV would regain the market lead by 2023, where the station leads in three key timeslots.

Since 2000, WSOC-TV has produced a 10 p.m. newscast for sister station WAXN-TV. The program originated on then-Fox affiliate WCCB through a news share agreement established with that station in 1999, until the summer of 1999, when WCNC took over production of the prime time newscast shortly before WCCB launched its own news department in January 2000. During the February 2011 ratings period, WSOC&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast on WAXN placed second behind WCCB&#x27;s in-house newscast; it also placed ahead of the WBTV-produced newscast on then-CW affiliate WJZY (channel 46, now a Fox affiliate), as well as the 11 p.m. newscast on WCNC. Bill Walker served as WSOC&#x27;s main anchor from 1971 until his retirement in 2005, the longest tenure of any news anchor in Charlotte television history.

On April 22, 2007, WSOC-TV became the first television station in the Charlotte market and the second station in North Carolina overall (after Raleigh CBS affiliate WRAL-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (WSOC was also the fourth Cox-owned station to upgrade its newscasts to HD, following WSB-TV and Orlando&#x27;s WFTV); the WAXN broadcasts were not included in the upgrade until October 2008. In September 2010, WSOC began producing a two-hour extension of its morning newscast for WAXN, airing from 7 to 9 a.m. (which competes with WSOC&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;).

On August 26, 2012, starting with its 6 p.m. newscast, WSOC-TV debuted a brand new news set and graphics package as well as an updated version of the station&#x27;s &quot;Circle 9&quot; logo, which has been in use since 1984. On December 2, 2013, WSOC expanded the WAXN 10 p.m. newscast to one hour, citing the growing audience for the program (which had been placing at #1, among the prime time newscast in the Charlotte market; ahead of WCCB&#x27;s late evening newscast and a WBTV-produced program on WJZY, which has since been replaced with its own in-house newscast) as the reason for the expansion.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


On March 9, 2017, WSOC-TV announced that it would launch Telemundo Charlotte, on subchannel 9.2, which launched on June 1 of that year. Laff, which was on subchannel 9.2 since April 15, 2015, relocated to WAXN-DT4. WSOC-DT2 effectively took over the channel positions on pay-TV providers in the Charlotte market upon that day for Telemundo&#x27;s national feed. WSOC-DT2 also features a secondary Spanish-language local news operation which draws from both the resources of WSOC and its own reporting. It is the first full-power over-the-air Spanish-language station in Charlotte. On May 2, 2022, GetTV switched channels from WAXN-TV to WSOC-TV subchannel 9.3.

===Analog to digital conversion===
WSOC-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, until it moved to channel 19 as part of the digital repack in 2019. With the switch to digital, viewers in several parts of Charlotte itself needed an attic-mounted or roof-mounted antenna to get a clear picture from the station. Digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 9.

===NextGen TV===
WSOC-TV upgraded to NextGen TV on June 29, 2021.

===Translators===
Although WSOC-TV&#x27;s digital transmitter operates at a full million watts, several portions of the market lost coverage when the station switched to digital. The station operates three digital translators to improve coverage in these areas: W26FA-D in Valdese signed on the air on May 28, 2009 (simulcasting WSOC on digital channel 6.1 and a widescreen standard definition feed of WAXN on digital subchannel 6.2), in order to serve the Unifour region of the state. WSOCTV1 is a displacement translator on VHF channel 12 (virtual channel 9.5), which transmits from Crowders Mountain to serve Shelby, it signed on the air on January 15, 2010. WSOCTV2, Statesville went on the air on June 23, 2012, at 5:58 p.m., broadcasting on VHF channel 12 (virtual channel 9.9). WSOC previously operated a displacement translator for WAXN-TV in China Grove, on WAXNTV1 (UHF channel 30), which also carried a widescreen standard definition feed of WSOC-TV on virtual channel 9.7, until it was shut down on October 15, 2012.

==Out-of-market cable and DirecTV carriage==
In recent years, WSOC has been carried on cable in several areas outside of the Charlotte television market, including on cable systems within the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point market in North Carolina, the Greenville and Florence–Myrtle Beach markets in South Carolina, and the Tri-Cities market in Tennessee and Virginia. On DirecTV, WSOC has been carried in several counties that are part of the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point market.

<doc id="963017" wikidata="Q1362760" url="?curid=963017" title="Alfa Romeo 33">
<text>The Alfa Romeo 33 (Type 905 and 907) is a small family car produced by the Italian automaker Alfa Romeo between 1983 and 1995. From a mechanical standpoint it was essentially an evolution of its predecessor, the Alfasud, whose floorpan, chassis and drivetrain were carried over — albeit with simplifications to the suspension and braking system, eschewing the Alfasud&#x27;s inboard front brakes for instance. The Nissan-based Alfa Romeo Arna was launched shortly thereafter, offering a similarly sized but lower priced car.

The 33 has a unique place in the Alfa Romeo history, as nearly 1 million of these cars were produced. During its 11-year lifespan the 33 saw a light facelift in 1986 and a significant restyle in 1989. The 33 was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the Alfa Romeo 145 and 146, which used the same boxer engines but built around an entirely new platform based on the Fiat Tipo.

==First series (1983–1986)==
Initially known as the Alfa 33 (Type 905), the 5-door hatchback was launched in 1983 and a station wagon version (initially badged Giardinetta, later badged Sportwagon) was introduced the following year at the same time as a four-wheel drive version of the hatchback. The hatchback was styled by Ermanno Cressoni at the Centro Stile Alfa Romeo, while the station wagon was designed by Pininfarina.

The 33 became renowned for its nimble handling and powerful boxer engines, but also became equally well known for its unreliable electronics and tendencies to rust (a frequent complaint on Italian cars in general at the time). Another issue was its braking and increased unsprung weight—the Alfasud&#x27;s inboard front disc brakes (mounted on the gearbox) had been moved to the more common outboard discs (mounted on the wheel hubs). The rear discs of the Sud&#x27;s four-wheel disc arrangement had also been replaced with drums.

The car featured numerous innovations for the company, including an instrument binnacle that moved up and down with the adjustable steering wheel. The UK launch promoted the sleek design. It had a drag coefficient of 0.36.

At launch two models were available, 33 1.3 and 33 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro. Both engines were SOHC boxers fed by a twin-choke carburettor, carried over from the Alfasud along with its 5-speed gearbox: a 1,350 cc developing at 6,000 rpm, and a 1,490 cc developing at 5,800 rpm. Unlike on the Alfasud, fifth gear acted like an overdrive gear and top speed was reached in fourth.
The luxurious 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro (Gold Cloverleaf in the UK) was distinguished by a silver grille, two-tone paintwork (metallic paint upper body separated by a brown tape from the dark brown lower body and bumpers) and clear front turn indicator lenses outside; by beige Texalfa leatherette/cloth interior, a woodtone steering wheel and shifter knob inside. Standard equipment included bronze tinted glass, headlight wipers, passenger side wing mirror and a trip computer.

A four-wheel-drive variant, the 33 1.5 4x4, was introduced in at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show and put on sale in December. It was assembled by Pininfarina in Grugliasco, Turin. Normally front-wheel drive, the four-wheel drive system could be engaged manually by the driver at any speed, via a handle in front of the gear lever. Like the Quadrifoglio Oro the 4x4 was characterised by two-tone paint, either metallic red or silver separated from a black lower body by a double white pinstripe; the grille matched the body colour. Equipment level was also the same as on the richer Quadrifoglio Oro; ride height was raised in comparison to standard 33s.
The 33 1.5 Giardinetta (Estate in the UK), a 5-door estate designed and—like the 4x4 hatchback—assembled by Pininfarina, made its début at the March 1984 Geneva Motor Show.
The Giardinetta went on sale in 4x4 guise in June and was joined later in the year by a front-wheel drive model, shown at the Turin Motor Show in November.

Another Quadrifoglio top of the range model, this time the sporting 1.5 Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Cloverleaf in the UK), was put on sale in June 1984. It was powered by a version of the 1,490 cc boxer, equipped with double twin-choke carburettors like on the Sprint 1.5 QV coupé; Alfa Romeo claimed a top speed of over .
The Quadrifoglio Verde could be recognized from its specific grille, additional plastic spoilers under both body-colour bumpers, side skirts, and grey 8-hole alloy wheels with low profile 185/60 HR14 tyres; it was only available in two paint colours—Alfa red or optional metallic silver—highlighted by a light grey stripe in the body side indent.
In the cabin there were sport seats in black and grey cloth, a leather covered steering wheel and additional gauges for voltmeter and oil pressure.

October 1984 saw the introduction of the updated model year 1985 range, later displayed at the 60th Turin Motor Show. All models save for the base 1.3 were upgraded to one-choke-per-cylinder twin carburettor setups—as on the Quadrifoglio Verde. This gave birth to a sportier 1.3-litre model, the 33 1.3 S, which put out at 5,500 rpm, or 10 PS more than the standard; the 1.5 on the estates and Quadrifoglio Oro now had .
Minor changes were made to the equipment of most models but the recently introduced 1.5 QV, such as the adoption of side skirts and a black grille on the Quadrifoglio Oro.
With the arrival of the 1.3 S and front-wheel-drive Giardinetta, for 1985 the lineup included seven models: 1.3, 1.3 S, 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro, 1.5 Quadrifoglio Verde, 1.5 4x4, 1.5 Giardinetta and 1.5 Giardinetta 4x4.

All flat-4 petrol engines:
==First series facelift (1986–1989)==

In autumn 1986 a mild facelift resulted in a revised range. Exterior alterations were limited to clear instead of amber-coloured indicator lenses, new wheel covers and alloy wheels, the adoption of side skirts by all models, and a redesigned front grille; two-tone paint schemes were discontinued. If outside there were only detail changes, the interior was more deeply revised; starting from a more conventionally designed dashboard and steering wheel, which superseded the innovative moveable instrument binnacle. All 1.5 variants now had the 105 PS engine from the now discontinued 1.5 QV; a TI (&quot;Turismo Internazionale&quot;, International Touring) trim level was exclusive to the front-wheel drive 1.5 hatchback. Changes were made to the suspension, brakes and gearbox, with closer-spaced ratios.

A new , engine was introduced on the 1.7 Quadrifoglio Verde, which replaced the 1.5 QV. The 1.7 engine was developed from the 1.5 by enlarging bore and stroke; it also used new cylinder heads, incorporating hydraulic tappets. To cope with the increased power the new QV was equipped with vented front brake discs.
The 1.7 QV looked close to its predecessor, but had lost the grey mid-body stripe and gained new alloy wheels, front side window wind deflectors, more pronounced side skirts and a rear body-colour spoiler on the boot lid. Inside it featured a leather-covered steering wheel, red carpets, and leatherette-backed sport seats upholstered in a grey/black/red chequered cloth.

On the Italian and some other markets a 1.8 TD turbodiesel variant was also available. Like all diesels fitted to Alfa Romeo passenger cars at the time, it was supplied by VM Motori. In order to fit in an engine bay designed for the particularly short boxer engine, a straight-three layout had to be chosen; a balance shaft helped offset vibrations.
Fitted with a KKK turbocharger—but no intercooler—the diesel produced .
In all the 1986 models were nine: 1.3, 1.3 S, 1.5 TI, 1.5 4x4, 1.7 Quadrifoglio Verde and 1.8 TD Berlinas (hatchbacks), and 1.5, 1.5 4x4 and 1,8 TD Giardinettas.
In the United Kingdom only 1.5 and 1.7 Green Cloverleaf hatchback models were sold, as well as a market-specific 1.7 Sportwagon estate; all three were also available in &quot;Veloce&quot; versions, outfitted by Alfa Romeo GB with a colour-matching Zender body kit.

During 1988 the last updates before the major 1990 model revision were phased in.
In April the Giardinetta was rechristened Sport Wagon, and became available in 1.3 S, 1.5 4x4, 1.7 Quadrifoglio Verde and 1.8 TD variants.
The first fuel injected petrol-engined 33, the 33 1.7 IE, was introduced a few months later, in July. It was the 1,712 cc boxer from the 1.7 QV, fitted with Bosch 3.1 LE Jetronic electronic fuel injection and electronic ignition as well; it developed , slightly less than the carburetted version. In some countries it was also marketed in a catalytic converter-equipped variant. The 1.7 IE was distinguished from other models by the Quadrifoglio&#x27;s side skirts, slate grey painted bumpers, and velour upholstery. At the same time all models got some cosmetic tweaks: the upper bar in the grille was now matched to body colour, there was Glen plaid cloth upholstery on base models, and Quadrifoglio Verdes sported red piping across the front end, where bumper and grille met.

==Second series (1990–1995)==
The 33 was given a more extensive facelift in the end of 1989, the Series II or &#x27;Nuova&#x27; 33 (Type 907), which went on sale in January 1990. This featured a revised interior, the introduction of fuel injection, the 1.7 litre engine upgraded to include a 16 valve version, and a heavily restyled front and rear ends, in line with the new Alfa &quot;family look&quot; established by the flagship 164. The part-time four-wheel drive version (33 4x4) was joined by a version with permanent four-wheel drive, called the Permanent 4 and only offered on the most powerful, 16-valve version. The Permanent 4 received Recaro seats in front and a Nardi steering wheel, while providing better handling without the torque steer present in the front-wheel drive model. This model was renamed the Q4 starting from 1992. Late production 33s also do not suffer from the rust problems of their ancestors, as their frames are galvanized in the manner Alfa Romeo introduced with the 164.

The wagon was facelifted a little after the saloon, receiving darker versions of the 1986 (facelift) taillights and a curvier rear bumper. The estate was now sold as the Sport Wagon in most markets (no longer &quot;Giardinetta&quot;), including Italy. In mid-1992, as required by the recent introduction of the Euro 1 emissions requirements, uncatalyzed models were either discontinued or only built for certain export markets with laxer standards. In May 1992 the 1.8 TD was accordingly updated to become the 1.8 TD Eco, but it was discontinued midway through 1993.

==Z33 Free Time prototype==
Zagato made a tall-bodied three-door prototype, a Compact MPV anticipating the Renault Scénic by over a decade. Called the &quot;Z33 Free Time&quot; this was shown at the 1984 Geneva Motor Show, but the project remained a single prototype. The &quot;Free Time&quot; was no longer than the regular &quot;33&quot; at just under and retained most of its driving characteristics, but with greatly increased interior space. The tiny six-seater was based on the chassis of the 33 but was visually more related to the Giulietta.

==Hybrid version prototype==
The 33 1.5 Sport Wagon was chosen by Alfa Romeo to test the possibility of creating a hybrid vehicle. Standard 1.5 boxer engine was combined with three-phase asynchronous electric motor (16 hp). The electric motor was coupled with gearbox via a toothed belt and therefore the car could move from the electric motor only, from the petrol engine only or - in the sense of hybrid propulsion - from both. The hybrid car could go 5 km on electric power only, in speeds up to 60 km/h. Changes to the body were minimal and the car weight was increased by 150 kg (110 batteries, 20 engine and 10 for power electronics). 3 vehicles were built.

<doc id="963021" wikidata="Q127665" url="?curid=963021" title="Flirting (film)">
<text>Flirting is a 1991 Australian coming-of-age comedy drama film written and directed by John Duigan. The story revolves around a romance between two teenagers, and it stars Noah Taylor, who appears again as Danny Embling, the protagonist of Duigan&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot;. It also stars Thandiwe Newton and Nicole Kidman.

&quot;Flirting&quot; is the second in an incomplete trilogy of autobiographical films by Duigan. It was produced by Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, Barbara Gibbs, and George Miller, and made by Kennedy Miller Studios, which also made the &quot;Mad Max Trilogy&quot;. The film won the 1990 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film, as &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot; had in 1987.

== Plot ==
Danny, an awkward, underdeveloped 17-year-old, has been sent away by his parents to the all-male St. Albans boarding school in rural New South Wales, Australia, in the hopes he won’t become a delinquent. The year is 1965 and it has been some time since Danny has had a romantic relationship with a girl. Danny is the butt of jokes because of his stutter and long nose (for which he is nicknamed &quot;Bird&quot;). His only friend is Gilbert.

At a school rugby game, he meets and slowly becomes interested in Thandiwe, the daughter of a Ugandan father and Kenyan-British mother, who attends the all-girls Cirencester Ladies’ College across the lake, while her father, a political activist, is lecturing at university in Canberra. They later meet at a debate between the two schools, and covertly during a school dance. She is punished for leaving the dance without permission and is given chores by the prefect, Nicola. Thandiwe is later befriended by Melissa and Janet.

Throughout the course of the school year, they foster a budding romance, despite the overbearing regulations inflicted upon them — specifically racial politics and social conventions (Thandiwe is often regarded by the school authorities as rebellious and overtly sexual). After the musical performance, Danny introduces his parents to Thandiwe and her parents. They later decide to return to Uganda in response to the political turmoil there. Soon Thandiwe decides to return too, and lies about her true departure date, in order to spend the night in a motel with Danny. They are discovered, leading to his expulsion. Thandiwe writes to him regularly from Uganda, but then the letters stop coming. One day a letter arrives from Nairobi saying she is finally safe there.

== Cast ==
* Noah Taylor as Danny Embling
* Thandiwe Newton as Thandiwe Adjewa
* Nicole Kidman as Nicola Radcliffe 
* Marshall Napier as Mr. Rupert Elliott
* Kym Wilson as Melissa 
* Naomi Watts as Janet
* Les Hill as Greg Gilmore
* Judi Farr as Shella Embling
* Femi Taylor as Letitia Adjewa

== Production ==
The script was written before &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot;. Although the story evokes universal themes of romance and love, some say that it also examines the properties of the &quot;Australian character&quot;: existential isolation and strong cultural ties to Great Britain. It was filmed on location in Sydney, Bathurst, and Braidwood, New South Wales, including scenes at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst.

&quot;Flirting&quot; features one of the last appearances by Nicole Kidman in an Australian-produced film before she made her transition to Hollywood (though she would return in later years to act in movies for director Baz Luhrmann); Kidman had previously worked with director Duigan on the Australian miniseries &quot;Vietnam&quot;. Actress Thandiwe Newton later said that starting at her audition, when she was 16, Duigan groomed and sexually abused her.

== Music ==
* &quot;Proserpina&quot; – written by John Duigan and Sarah de Jong
* &quot;(By the) Sleepy Lagoon&quot; – performed by Harry James
* &quot;The Wasps&quot; – composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, performed by Queensland Symphony Orchestra
* &quot;Johnny Get Angry&quot; – performed by Joanie Sommers
* &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; – written by Little Richard, Dorothy La Bostrie and Joe Lubin
* &quot;I Just Wanna Make Love to You&quot; – written by Willie Dixon
* &quot;The Moochie&quot; – performed by Sidney Bechet
* &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; – performed by The Troggs
* &quot;Little Egypt&quot; – written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller
* &quot;Big Bad John&quot; – written by Jimmy Dean

The song &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; is actually out of the period, not being released until August 1966.

== Reception ==
&quot;Flirting&quot; grossed $1,655,044 at the box office in Australia and $2,415,396 in the US. and was widely critically acclaimed. It featured on Roger Ebert&#x27;s Top 10 Best Films List of 1992. Later it was ranked number 46 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented:

:There is a kind of painless calm about &quot;Flirting.&quot; The film is simultaneously attractive and just a little dull. Mr. Duigan avoids melodrama, which is all to the good. Yet his gift for the acutely observed commonplace detail is neither strong nor original enough to transform the movie into something comparable to so many similar, better films. The best things about &quot;Flirting&quot; are the performances. Ms. Newton is delightful as Thandiwe, who is far more sophisticated than Danny and wise enough never to let him know it. Mr. Taylor is also good, although the troubled Danny is not an easy character to play. He&#x27;s virtually the generic artist as a young man. Nicole Kidman appears in a supporting role as one of Thandiwe&#x27;s older classmates, who is less of a snob than she first appears.

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; Desson Thomson commented:
:The movie is full of wonderful scenes: Newton caught hiding in a boys&#x27; toilet stall as the unsuspecting lads come in to shower, a line of uniformed boys ritualistically facing a row of ballroom-gowned girls at a school dance, and so on. &quot;Flirting&quot; is also full of amusing rejoinders and comments: &quot;Remember her needs as well as yours,&quot; suggests Taylor&#x27;s friend with secondhand Kamasutra wisdom when Taylor heads toward an intended sensual tryst. &quot;If you can give her pleasure, she&#x27;ll be back for more.&quot;

== Awards ==
The film received the following 1990 AFI Awards:

*Best Film (Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, George Miller)
*Best Achievement in Editing (Robert Gibson)
*Best Achievement in Production Design (Roger Ford)

It was also nominated for:

*Best Achievement in Sound (Antony Gray, Ross Linton, Phil Judd)
*Best Actor in Supporting Role (Bartholomew Rose)
*Best Achievement in Cinematography (Geoff Burton)

As part of a years-long project to document his life, editor Robert Gibson took a rolling hand-held camera on stage as he accepted his Best Achievement in Editing Award for &quot;Flirting&quot; at the AFIs. The resulting footage is included in his later film &quot;Video Fool for Love&quot;, which focuses mostly on his intimate personal life.

<text>Titus is a 1999 epic surrealist historical drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Julie Taymor in her feature directorial debut, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. A co-production between Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the film stars Anthony Hopkins in the title role of Titus Andronicus, the Roman army general, chronicling his downfall following a victorious return from war.
It was produced by Overseas Filmgroup and Clear Blue Sky Productions and released by Fox Searchlight Pictures.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed approximately $2.9 million worldwide against a budget of $18 million, becoming a box-office bomb, although it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

==Plot==
A boy eating lunch in a 1950s-style kitchen plays war with his surrounding toys. A bomb blast outside the window frightens him under the table from where he is rescued and taken to an Amphitheatre, where an invisible audience cheers. The boy finds himself in the role of Young Lucius and watches as an army resembling the Terracotta Army enters; Romans under the command of Titus Andronicus, the general at the center of the play, return victorious from war. They bring back as spoils Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her sons, and Aaron the Moor. Titus sacrifices Tamora&#x27;s eldest son, Alarbus, so the spirits of his 21 dead sons might be appeased. Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alarbus, but Titus refuses her plea.

Caesar, the Emperor of Rome, dies. His sons Saturninus and Bassianus squabble over who will succeed him. The Tribune of the People, Marcus Andronicus, announces the people&#x27;s choice for new emperor is his brother, Titus. He refuses the throne and hands it to the late emperor&#x27;s eldest son Saturninus, much to the latter&#x27;s delight. The new emperor states he will take Lavinia, Titus&#x27; daughter, as his bride, to honor and elevate the family. She is already betrothed to Saturninus&#x27; brother, Bassianus, who steals her away. Titus&#x27; surviving sons aid in the couple&#x27;s run for the Pantheon, where they are to marry. Titus, angry with his sons because in his eyes they&#x27;re being disloyal to Rome, kills his son Mutius as he defends the escape. The new emperor, Saturninus, dishonors Titus and marries Tamora instead. Tamora persuades the Emperor to feign forgiveness to Bassianus, Titus and his family and postpone punishment to a later day, thereby revealing her intention to avenge herself on all the Andronici.

During a hunting party the next day, Tamora&#x27;s lover, Aaron the Moor, meets Tamora&#x27;s remaining sons, the sadistic Chiron and Demetrius. The two argue over which should take sexual advantage of the newly-wed Lavinia. Aaron easily persuades them to ambush Bassianus and kill him in the presence of Tamora and Lavinia, in order to have their way with her. Lavinia begs Tamora to stop her sons, but Tamora refuses. Chiron and Demetrius throw Bassianus&#x27; body in a pit, as Aaron directed them, then take Lavinia away and rape her. To keep her from revealing what she saw and endured, they cut out her tongue as well as her hands, replacing them with tree branches. When Marcus discovers her, he begs her to reveal the identity of her assailants; Lavinia leans towards the camera and opens her bloodied mouth in a silent scream.

Aaron frames Titus&#x27; sons Martius and Quintus for the murder of Bassianus with a forged letter outlining their plan to kill him. Angry, the Emperor arrests them. Later on, Marcus takes Lavinia to her father, who is overcome with grief. He and his remaining son Lucius beg for the lives of Martius and Quintus, but the two are found guilty and are marched off to execution. Aaron enters and tells Titus, Lucius and Marcus that the emperor will spare the prisoners if one of the three sacrifices a hand. Each demands the right to do so. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus&#x27;s) left hand and take it to the emperor. Aaron&#x27;s story is revealed to have been false, as a messenger brings Titus the heads of his sons and his own severed hand. In Renaissance semiotics, the hand is a representation of political and personal agency. With his hand chopped off, Titus has truly lost power. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.

Titus&#x27; grandson (Lucius&#x27; son and the boy from the opening), who helped Titus read to Lavinia, complains she will not leave his books alone. In the book, she indicates to Titus and Marcus the story of Philomela, in which a similarly mute victim &quot;wrote&quot; the name of her wrongdoer. Marcus gives her a stick to hold with her mouth and stumps. She writes the names of her attackers on the ground. Titus vows revenge. Feigning madness, he ties written prayers for justice to arrows and commands his kinsmen to aim them at the sky so they may reach the gods. Understanding the method in Titus&#x27; &quot;madness&quot;, Marcus directs the arrows to land inside the palace of Saturninus, who is enraged by this added to the fact Lucius is at the gates of Rome with an army of Goths.

Tamora delivers a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. To hide his affair from the Emperor, Aaron kills the nurse and flees with the baby. Lucius, marching on Rome with an army of Goths, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. To save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire plot to Lucius, relishing every murder, rape and dismemberment.

Tamora, convinced of Titus&#x27; madness, approaches him along with her two sons, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape. She tells Titus she (as a supernatural spirit) will grant him revenge if he will convince Lucius to stop attacking Rome. Titus agrees, sending Marcus to invite Lucius to a feast. &quot;Revenge&quot; offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora and is about to leave, but Titus insists &quot;Rape&quot; and &quot;Murder&quot; stay with him. She agrees. When she leaves, Titus&#x27; servants bind Chiron and Demetrius. Titus cuts their throats, while Lavinia holds a basin with her stumps to catch their blood. He plans to cook them into a pie for their mother.

The next day, during the feast at his house, Lavinia enters the dining room. Titus asks Saturninus whether a father should kill his daughter if she is raped. When the Emperor agrees, Titus snaps Lavinia&#x27;s neck, to the horror of the dinner guests, and tells Saturninus what Tamora&#x27;s sons did. When Saturninus demands Chiron and Demetrius be brought before him, Titus reveals they were in the pie Tamora enjoyed, and kills Tamora. Saturninus kills Titus after which Lucius kills Saturninus to avenge his father&#x27;s death.

Back in the Roman Arena, Lucius tells his family&#x27;s story to the people and is proclaimed Emperor. He orders his father Titus and sister Lavinia to be buried in the family monuments, Saturninus be given a proper burial, Tamora&#x27;s body to be thrown to the wild beasts, and Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron is unrepentant to the end. Young Lucius, who appears to have lost his taste for violence after witnessing the bloody cycle of revenge, carefully picks up Aaron&#x27;s child and reverts back to the boy from the beginning at the now silently empty Amphitheatre before carrying him away into the sunrise.

==Differences from the original text==
Apart from the deliberate anachronisms, the film follows the play quite closely. One of the experimental concepts in the film was that the character of Young Lucius (Titus&#x27; grandson) is initially introduced as a boy from the present who finds himself transported to the fantastical reality of the film after being brought to an Amphitheatre. At the beginning of the film, his toy soldiers turn into Titus&#x27; Roman army. At the end, when Titus&#x27; son Lucius avenges his father by condemning the villainous Aaron to a painful death, the boy takes pity on Aaron&#x27;s infant son; carrying him away from the violence of that world as he walks slowly into the sunrise, reverting to his original self as he leaves the empty Amphitheatre. This ending is perhaps more positive than the ending of other productions of the play, including Taymor&#x27;s stage production, in which Young Lucius is fixated upon the &quot;tiny black coffin&quot; holding the dead infant.

==Production==
===Development===
Julie Taymor took Shakespeare&#x27;s script, added various linking scenes without dialogue (while cutting some of the text) and set the play in an anachronistic fantasy world that uses locations, costumes and imagery from many periods of history, including Ancient Rome and Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, to give the impression of a Roman Empire that survived into the modern era. The opening scenes commence with a heavily choreographed triumphal march of the Roman troops, complete with motorcycle outriders. The selection of music is similarly diverse.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place at the Cinecittà studios in Rome and on location at various historic monuments. The arena that appears at the beginning and ending of the film is the Arena in Pula, Croatia. The Emperor&#x27;s palace is represented by the Fascist Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome. Some shots of tunnels and ruins were filmed at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa in Rome. The forest scenes were shot at Manziana, near Rome. Titus&#x27; house is represented by an old house near an aqueduct in Rome, and the streets where he rounds up his conspirators are the Roman Ghetto.

==Soundtrack==

The score for &quot;Titus&quot; was composed by Elliot Goldenthal, Taymor&#x27;s longtime friend and partner, and is a typical Goldenthal soundtrack with an epic, inventive, and dissonant feel.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Titus&quot; was a box office bomb, earning only $22,313 on its opening weekend due to its limited release in only two theaters, ranking number 57 in the box office. Its widest release in the US was only in 35 theaters, causing the film to earn only $2,007,290 in North America. Overseas, it grossed $252,390 in Chile, Mexico, and Spain, culminating in a worldwide total of $2,920,616.

===Critical response===

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, making it a &quot;Critic&#x27;s Pick&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also praised &quot;Titus&quot; and gave it three and a half out of four stars, referring to the source material as &quot;the least of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies&quot; and concluding, &quot;Anyone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy this film for what it is must explain: How could it be more? This is the film Shakespeare&#x27;s play deserves, and perhaps even a little more.&quot;

Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Titus&quot; strikes a near-impossible balance between magnificently cracked high camp and a more serious statement about corruption and the cycle of violence&quot; and that &quot;[Taymor&#x27;s] forceful adaptation builds to a glorious payoff and Cumming&#x27;s flamboyant performance alone—he&#x27;s a sort of fascist Pee-wee Herman—seems enough to ensure &quot;Titus&quot; lasting cult status.&quot;

Robin Askew wrote in a 2016 article for &quot;Bristol24-7&quot; that the film is &quot;brilliant and daring if under-appreciated.&quot;

<text>Karpal Singh s/o Ram Singh Deo (; 28 June 1940 – 17 April 2014) was an Indian Malaysian politician and lawyer. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bukit Gelugor in the state of Penang from 2004 to 2014. During that time, he was also the National Chairman of the Democratic Action Party (DAP).

Born in Penang to Sikh Punjabi Indian immigrant parents, Karpal studied law at the National University of Singapore. He was one of Malaysia&#x27;s most prominent lawyers and took a number of high-profile cases, including drug-trafficking charges against foreign nationals. Karpal was an opponent of the death penalty, especially for drug trafficking.

In the courtroom and Parliament, he was a controversial figure. Karpal was suspended from Parliament several times, charged with sedition and detained under Malaysia&#x27;s internal-security law. His reputation as a lawyer and opposition politician gave him the nickname &quot;the Tiger of Jelutong&quot;.

Karpal&#x27;s political career began in 1970 (when he joined the DAP), and he won a seat in the Kedah State Legislative Assembly in 1974. He was elected to parliament in 1978 as representative for Jelutong, Penang, and held the seat for more than 20 years until he lost it in 1999. Karpal returned to Parliament in the next general election, and led the DAP to its strongest-ever performance in the 2008 general election. A 2005 motor-vehicle accident put Karpal in a wheelchair, with neuro-motor problems in his right arm, but he continued his legal and political careers. He died on 17 April 2014 after another motor-vehicle accident.

==Early life and education==
Born in Georgetown, Penang, Karpal was the son of a watchman and herdsman, Ram Singh Deo. His mother was Kartar Kaur.

Karpal studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s Institution and received his Bachelor of Laws degree from the National University of Singapore, where he was the president of the student union. He was barred from his hostel for protesting against the university&#x27;s decision to mandate certificates of political suitability for incoming students. Karpal said he took seven years to graduate, admitting that he was &quot;playful&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t attend lectures&quot;. After failing his final-year courses, the dean made him sit at the front of his classes; according to Karpal, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t play the fool anymore and I passed my exams accordingly!&quot;

==Legal career==
He was called to the Penang bar in 1969 and joined a firm in Alor Star, Kedah. Karpal founded his legal firm the following year, and was known for his expertise in the field of litigation. He was a pioneer in drug trafficking and habeas corpus cases, and opposed the death penalty. Karpal was praised for &quot;defending the little man&quot;, and was called &quot;a friend to the oppressed and marginalised.&quot; Universiti Teknologi MARA law professor Shad Saleem Faruqi praised Karpal&#x27;s legal team for their innovative interpretations, which helped defendants with difficult cases.

===Death penalty===
Karpal was described as a leading opponent of the death penalty in Malaysia, and successfully defended at least ten foreigners on serious drug charges (which have a mandatory death sentence). However, in July 2010 he called for convicted child rapists to receive the death sentence.

Among Karpal&#x27;s highest-profile cases were his defence of Australian drug trafficker Kevin Barlow, who was executed in Malaysia in 1986. Barlow and fellow Australian Brian Chambers were convicted of trafficking heroin by the High Court in Penang in July 1985, and Karpal continued fighting to clear Barlow&#x27;s name after his execution. Karpal also defended New Zealanders Lorraine Cohen and her son, Aaron, against heroin-trafficking charges in 1987. They were convicted, with Lorraine sentenced to death and Aaron to life in prison. Lorraine&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1989, and both were pardoned and freed in 1996. In 1977, Karpal managed to persuade the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to pardon a 14-year-old Chinese boy who was sentenced to death for possession of a firearm under the Internal Security Act, reportedly suggesting that to let the boy hang would be &quot;politically explosive.&quot;

In 2006, Karpal represented two sisters who were charged with allegedly masterminding the murder of their Australian stepfather Hans Herzog, who was killed by two male teenagers in a parang attack at his Kuala Lumpur home in 2003. The sisters were alleged to have hired the two boys to attack Herzog due to their resentment over the supposed abusive treatment they received from Herzog. The sisters were later acquitted without their defence being called, and Karpal would later represent one of the two hired hitmen in his appeal in 2009, which ended with the boy, who was 17 at the time of the crime, to be convicted for murder and detained indefinitely at the Selangor Sultan&#x27;s pleasure. The boy&#x27;s older friend Low Kian Boon (aged 18 at the time of the murder) was sentenced to death, before the sentence was reduced to 35 years&#x27; imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in 2024.

Karpal also took on cases outside of Malaysia&#x27;s jurisdiction during his legal career. In January 1995, Karpal travelled to Singapore and represented Malaysian gunman Ng Theng Shuang in his appeal against the death sentence issued to Ng under the Arms Offences Act for discharging his firearm during a goldsmith robbery heist at Singapore&#x27;s South Bridge Road. Ng&#x27;s appeal was dismissed despite Karpal&#x27;s arguments in the appeal, and he was hanged on 14 July 1995 in Changi Prison.

===Anwar Ibrahim===
Karpal represented former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim during Anwar&#x27;s 1998 sodomy trial. In September 1999, he produced a pathological report confirming high levels of arsenic in Anwar&#x27;s body and accused authorities of poisoning him: &quot;It could well be that someone out there wants to get rid of him ... even to the extent of murder ... I suspect people in high places are responsible for this situation.&quot; The accusation led to Karpal&#x27;s detention under the Sedition Act in January 2000.

He was the lead defence counsel in Anwar&#x27;s second sodomy trial, after new allegations in 2008. After a two-year trial, Anwar was acquitted on 10 January 2012; however, the acquittal was overturned two years later.

==Political career==

===Entry into politics===
Karpal joined the Democratic Action Party (DAP) in 1970, citing its multiracial platform after the 1969 race riots. Although he planned to contest the 1974 general election in Penang, he withdrew after his father&#x27;s death. However, Karpal was persuaded by DAP national organising secretary Fan Yew Teng to stand for the Alor Setar parliamentary seat and the Alor Setar Bandar state seat. He won only the state seat, the first DAP candidate to win a seat in Kedah.

In the 1978 general elections, Karpal won the Jelutong parliamentary seat and the Bukit Gelugor state seat. He held the Bukit Gelugor state seat until 1990, losing subsequent elections for the Sungai Pinang and Padang Kota seats.

In 1989, Karpal accused Deputy Speaker D. P. Vijandran of appearing in pornographic videos. Although the allegations were dismissed due to lack of evidence, Vijandran resigned the following year. In 1992, Karpal produced the alleged videotape in parliament and gave it to Deputy Speaker Ong Tee Keat. Vijandran was convicted in May 1994 of fabricating evidence in an affidavit seeking a court order to stop his nephew from allegedly distributing pornographic videotapes in which he appeared, but the conviction was overturned in 1998. In 2000, Karpal was ordered to pay Vijandran RM500,000 (reduced to RM100,000 on appeal) in damages for defamation after he accused Vijandran of cheque fraud.

===Setback===
In the 1999 election, Karpal lost the Jelutong parliamentary seat he had held for 21 years, and DAP leader Lim Kit Siang was also defeated. The DAP had joined Barisan Alternatif, an opposition alliance with Parti Keadilan and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) (a move strongly supported by Karpal and Lim). Despite the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition&#x27;s significant losses in the election, Keadilan and PAS absorbed the gains as DAP support eroded due to suspicion of PAS and its hard-line Islamic stance. Although the DAP gained seats, the party performed well below expectations and Lim called the results a &quot;catastrophic defeat&quot;. Despite the setback, Karpal remained as party deputy chairman and Lim became chairman after the resignation of long-serving chairman Chen Man Hin. Karpal strongly opposed a PAS plan to introduce hudud (Islamic codes of behavior) into the Terengganu state legal system in 1999, threatening to take the state government to court.

===Return to Parliament===
In the 2004 general election, Karpal returned to parliament with a 1,261-vote majority in the new Bukit Gelugor seat. The DAP regained its position as the largest opposition party in Parliament, and Karpal became the party&#x27;s national chairman on 4 September 2004.

On 7 September, he was sanctioned for &quot;misleading Parliament&quot; after claiming that MPs had to raise their right hand while they took the oath of office on 17 May. A report by the Parliamentary Rights and Privileges Committee gave Karpal three days to apologise or face a six-month suspension. He refused to apologise and served the suspension.

===Victories and controversy===
Karpal retained his seat in the 2008 election with a nearly-20-fold-vote increased majority (21,015 votes). The election saw historic gains for the opposition, who denied the ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) a two-thirds majority in Parliament for the first time.

The three major opposition parties formed a coalition 
(the Pakatan Rakyat), and Karpal was listed as the DAP representative on the coalition&#x27;s Shadow Ministry of Home Affairs Committee in July 2009.

In April 2010, he was suspended from parliament for ten days after he called the speaker a &quot;dictator&quot;. In December of that year, he and opposition members of parliament Anwar Ibrahim, Azmin Ali and Sivarasa Rasiah were suspended for six months. Anwar was suspended for stirring up controversy over government links to APCO Worldwide, while the rest were punished for publicising a report by the Rights and Privileges Committee finding Anwar guilty before the report was presented to Parliament.

In December 2011, Karpal and Penang second deputy chief minister P. Ramasamy feuded over Ramasamy&#x27;s reported accusation that dissidents in the DAP were plotting against him for not giving them projects and favours. Karpal called Ramasamy a &quot;warlord&quot; and asked for him to resign as deputy chief minister. Ramasamy asked the party to remove its &quot;godfathers&quot;, an apparent reference to Karpal. The feud was resolved internally, and Ramasamy later denied ever making the accusation. At the DAP national conference in January 2012, Karpal joined Ramasamy and asked the party&#x27;s &quot;warlords and godfathers [to] stand together against Barisan Nasional.&quot;

==Political views==
Karpal Singh cited David Saul Marshall, Mahatma Gandhi and John F. Kennedy as influences. The 13 May Incident convinced him that Malaysia needed to take a multiracial course, and he joined the DAP in 1970. Karpal praised the country&#x27;s first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman for promoting racial unity. He criticised the legal immunity granted to the hereditary Malay rulers in the original constitution, which was removed by Mahathir Mohamad government in 1993.

Karpal Singh opposed the idea of Malaysia as an Islamic state, arguing that the constitution provided for a secular nation with Islam as the official religion, and clashed with Mahathir and fellow opposition party PAS over the issue. Karpal said &quot;an Islamic state over my dead body&quot; about the debate during a political speech, but later said that he had apologised for the remark.

==Controversies and issues==
Karpal was a controversial figure, and he and fellow DAP politician Lim Kit Siang have been referred to as racial provocateurs. He was nicknamed &quot;the Tiger of Jelutong&quot; by admirers after serving five terms as Jelutong MP. Karpal attributed the nickname to a confrontation with former Malaysian Indian Congress President Samy Vellu when he said to Samy, &quot;he could be the lion, and I could be the tiger, because there are no lions in Malaysia!&quot;

===Slurs===
He clashed with government parliamentarians and assemblymen during debates. On two occasions in the Penang State Assembly, the speaker called police to have Karpal removed from the chamber. Karpal ordered the police officers out both times, saying that they had no right to be there before walking out on his own.

He criticised the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in the Dewan Rakyat for allegedly assaulting two men who were brought to the palace by police, which sparked demands for an apology from members of Parliament; Karpal refused. Karpal filed a lawsuit against the king, Iskandar of Johor, in 1986 on behalf of one of the men. He lost, and the sultan reportedly named one of his dogs after him.

Karpal served two six-month suspensions from Parliament: in September 2004 for &quot;misleading&quot; Parliament, and in December 2010 for contempt. During a May 2008 session, he called fellow parliamentarian Bung Moktar Radin the &quot;Bigfoot from Kinabatangan&quot;. Moments later, Karpal was mocked by Ibrahim Ali and Bung Moktar Radin for his inability to stand while speaking as a result of his disability (provoking a furore among opposition members). The following month, he received a death threat in the form of a bullet delivered to his law firm. In October, Karpal was suspended from Parliament for two days for calling speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia &quot;not serious&quot; and &quot;playful&quot;.

===Detentions===
He and a number of other opposition politicians were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act during Operation Lalang in October 1987 for inciting &quot;racial tension&quot; in Malaysia. Karpal was released for several hours in March 1988 in response to a habeas corpus application before being rearrested and imprisoned until January 1989. Amnesty International called him a prisoner of conscience.

===Sedition trials===
Karpal, four other opposition politicians and the editor of the &quot;Harakah Daily&quot; (the newspaper published by the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party) were arrested in January 2000 under the Sedition Act, and he was charged with making seditious remarks in court during Anwar&#x27;s first corruption trial. This, the only known charge of sedition in any Commonwealth country brought against a lawyer for remarks made in court in defence of a client, was dropped in 2002.

He was again charged under the Sedition Act in March 2009 with threatening to sue the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah, in the wake of the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis. Karpal had contended that the sultan had exceeded his constitutional powers in appointing Zambry Abdul Kadir Menteri Besar. The charges were dismissed in June 2010 after the High Court determined that the prosecution had failed to prove a &quot;prima facie&quot; case. However, the Court of Appeal reversed the acquittal in January 2012 and ordered Karpal to enter a defence. In March 2019, 10 years after the incident the Federal Court acquitted Karpal posthumously.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Karpal married Gurmit Kaur, eight years his junior, in July 1970. Gurmit&#x27;s family, from Narathiwat, Thailand, moved to Penang when she was seven. They had five children and eleven grandchildren. Karpal&#x27;s eldest son, Jagdeep, is the Penang State Assemblyman for Datok Keramat; his second son, Gobind, was the Minister of Communications and Multimedia and is the Member of Parliament for Puchong, Selangor. His third son, Ramkarpal succeeded him as the MP for Bukit Gelugor after his death. His daughter, Sangeet Kaur works in his law firm and his youngest son, Man Karpal studied actuarial science.

Gurmit described Karpal&#x27;s detention from 1987 to 1989 as a &quot;very big experience&quot;, which took a toll on her life because she had to &quot;be strong&quot; for their young children. The initial stage of his disability also deeply upset her. Karpal and Gurmit lived in Damansara Heights, Kuala Lumpur, from 1994 until his death.

===Accident and disability===
On 28 January 2005, Karpal was involved in an accident which left him in a wheelchair. A car struck a taxi in which he was seated from behind, severely bruising his thoracic vertebrae. The accident left Karpal with sensory impairment and reduced motor strength, and he was unable to walk or raise his right arm more than a few centimeters. His seat in the parliamentary chamber was moved to the back row to accommodate his wheelchair.

==Death and funeral==

In the early hours of 17 April 2014, Karpal died in a car crash on the North–South Expressway E1 near Gua Tempurung, Perak. His personal assistant, Michael Cornelius, was also killed in the accident. Ramkarpal (Karpal&#x27;s son and one of the minivan&#x27;s five occupants) and an Indonesian maid believed to have been employed by Karpal were injured. The driver of the minivan was injured as well. Karpal&#x27;s Toyota Alphard collided with the right side of a slow-moving, five-tonne Mitsubishi Canter lorry carrying cement, steel, and tiles. Although the lorry driver (identified as Abu Mansor Mohd) tested positive for cannabis, it was uncertain if he was under influence at the time of the accident. According to Bukit Aman traffic-police chief SAC Mohd Fuad Abdul Latiff, road conditions and the weather were good at the time of the accident.

Karpal&#x27;s funeral was held on 20 April 2014 with full state honors in Penang, attended by his Family, Prime Minister Najib Razak and other mourners.
His body reached the Batu Gantong Crematorium, George Town, Penang at 1:35 pm and was cremated after thousands of mourners chanted his name. His son, Gobind, memorialised him on 5 May during the last of a series of tributes.

==Memorials, awards and accolades==
On 19 April 2014, two days after his death, the IJM Promenade in Lebuh Sungai Pinang was renamed Karpal Singh Drive (Persiaran Karpal Singh). &quot;The Full Biography: Karpal Singh, Tiger of Jelutong&quot; by Tim Donoghue, published in 2014 by Marshal Cavendish International, is an updated edition of Donoghue&#x27;s &quot;Karpal Singh: Tiger of Jelutong&quot; which published prior to his death. Karpal received the Glory of India Award of Excellence in 2011, and was one of the top 10 NRI Newsmakers of 2008.

<text>Minnesota State Highway 65 (MN 65) is a highway in the east–central and northeast parts of the U.S. state of Minnesota, which starts at its split from I-35W, skipping past the downtown Minneapolis core, only to resume at the intersection with &quot;Washington Avenue&quot; (Hennepin County Road 152) at the north end of downtown Minneapolis to continue north to its northern terminus at its intersection with U.S. Highway 71 (US 71) in Littlefork near International Falls.

Highway 65 is a four lane expressway between Interstate 694 (I-694) in Fridley to just north of State Highway 95 at Cambridge.

The route continues as a two-lane roadway from Cambridge to its northern terminus at Littlefork in northern Minnesota.

At in length, State Highway 65 is the third longest state route in Minnesota, after MN 23 and MN 1.

==Route description==
MN 65 serves as a north–south highway between Minneapolis, Fridley, Blaine, Cambridge, Mora, McGregor, Nashwauk, and Littlefork in east–central and northeast Minnesota.

The roadway is one of three Minnesota state-marked highways to carry the same number as an existing U.S. Highway within the state; the others being MN 61 and MN 169.

MN 65 begins at a split from I-35W south of downtown Minneapolis. The ramps end at an intersection with Tenth Street South, and so does the MN 65 designation, after MnDOT returned control of the section through downtown to the city in 2005. The MN 65 designation resumes at the intersection of Washington Avenue (CR 152) and 3rd Avenue South at the north end of downtown Minneapolis. MN 65 is signed locally as 3rd Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis. 3rd Avenue South leads to the Third Avenue (Mississippi River) Bridge and becomes Central Avenue upon crossing the river. After its intersection with Hennepin Avenue, the route becomes Central Avenue NE. MN 65 is signed locally as Central Avenue NE for this section. Many Minnesota landmarks are located on Central Avenue NE including the Aveda Institute, the Heights Theater, and the National Sports Center. The route remains Central Avenue until separating in Ham Lake, except for a split in Fridley and Spring Lake Park between I-694 and US 10.

The route is a divided highway from Minneapolis to Cambridge, with a speed limit, increasing to speed limit beginning in Ham Lake, just outside Blaine.

For part of its route (), MN 65 runs concurrently with MN 27 in Kanabec and Aitkin counties between Woodland and Rice River Township.

Savanna Portage State Park in Aitkin County is located northeast of the junction of MN 65 and CR 14 in Shamrock Township near McGregor. The park entrance is located on CR 14 in nearby Balsam Township.

==History==
MN 65 was authorized in 1934 and 1935. The route was numbered as an extension of old US 65.

By 1940, the route was paved from Minneapolis to just north of McGrath in Aitkin County. By 1949, the route was paved as far north as Libby. By 1953, the route was paved north to its intersection with US 2 at Swan River in Itasca County. Sections of MN 65 north of US 2 were paved in the 1960s and 1970s. The last section of MN 65 paved was through the Nett Lake Indian Reservation in 2000.

The expressway section of MN 65 between I-694 in Fridley to Spring Lake Park was constructed on a new alignment in 1953.

The MN 65 expressway bypass in Cambridge was completed .

A portion of MN 65 used to be part of old US 65. US 65 still enters Minnesota from Iowa, but ends now in the city of Albert Lea, where it has a junction with Interstate 35. I-35 and I-35W roughly follow the same route old US 65 used to take from Albert Lea to downtown Minneapolis. Before the freeways were built, the original US 65 had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and Minneapolis.

In July 2005, the eight-block-long section of MN 65 in downtown Minneapolis, between Washington Avenue and the junction of Tenth Street South with the on- and off-ramps to I-35W, was turned back to city maintenance. This turn-back leaves MN 65 with a gap through downtown. The ramps leading to and going from Minneapolis surface streets south to their junction with I-35W are still part of MN 65 according to state highway logs, and as indicated by the MN 65 shields used on the updated mileposts along those ramps.

It was the last state highway (along with MN 55) to directly run through Downtown Minneapolis, ending a 70-year era in which state trunk highways would have a segment running directly through Downtown Minneapolis.

MN 65 is designated as Legislative Route 105 between Washington Avenue and 37th Avenue Northeast, then as Constitutional Route 5 from Minneapolis to Swan River, then as Legislative Route 159 to Little Fork. The route is not marked with those numbers.

== Cultural district ==
In 2020, Minneapolis officials designated a portion Central Avenue as one of seven cultural districts in the city. The district&#x27;s boundaries were centered around the intersection of Central and Lowry avenues in the Holland and Windom neighborhoods, from 26th to 18th avenues northeast. The purpose of the cultural district was to promote racial equity, preserve cultural identity, and promote economic growth:

<text>Burudi Ali Johnson (born October 1, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2001 NFL draft.

Johnson was selected to the Pro Bowl with the Bengals in 2004 after leading the AFC team in rushing. He employed a bruising style of hard-nosed running that earned him the nickname the &quot;Auburn Rambler.&quot;

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Petersburg, Virginia, approximately 30 miles south of Richmond. His first name, &quot;Burudi&quot;, is Swahili and means &quot;cool&#x27;&quot; and his middle name &quot;Ali&quot; represents his family&#x27;s respect and admiration for Muhammad Ali. He began playing football at the age of six with the Ettrick Trojans of the Chesterfield Quarterback League. During his high school career, he played on both offense and defense for the Thomas Dale Knights under head coach Victor Williams, following in the footsteps of Ken Oxendine and William Henderson. During his career, he broke the school&#x27;s rushing record which was held by his friend, mentor and coach, Henry Jefferson.

After graduation, he enrolled at Butler Community College in El Dorado, Kansas.

==College career==

===Butler Community College===
Johnson played for two years at Butler Community College. He helped lead Butler to two national championships, defeating Ricks College in 1998 and Dixie College in 1999. His most memorable performance came against Dixie College in the championship game in which he ran for 375 yards and scored seven touchdowns. He was subsequently named NJCAA &quot;Player of the Year&quot;. Johnson was subsequently inducted into the NJCAA Hall of Fame.

===Auburn===
At Auburn University, Johnson finished his career with 324 rushing attempts for 1,567 yards (4.84 yards per rush average). His 324 rushing attempts was a school single-season record and his 1,567 rushing yards were the second-most in school history. He had ten games in which he rushed for 100 yards or more. He was named SEC player of the year and nominated for the Doak Walker Award, which was won by LaDainian Tomlinson. He was a sociology major. His fullback was Heath Evans, who would later go onto the NFL as well. NFL running back Ronnie Brown was also a teammate.

==Professional career==

===Pre-Draft===
===Cincinnati Bengals===
The Cincinnati Bengals selected Johnson in the fourth round (100th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft.

Johnson saw little playing time in his first two NFL seasons. He backed up four-time Pro Bowler Corey Dillon, the Bengals&#x27; leading rusher since 1997, and had just 17 carries and seven receptions.

Dillon missed much of the 2003 season with injuries, and Johnson found himself in the starting lineup. In a Week 10 victory over the Houston Texans, Johnson had a career-high 43 carries for 182 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. In a Week 15 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, he had 21 carries for 174 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. Overall, he rushed for 957 yards and nine touchdowns, while adding another 146 yards on 21 receptions in just nine games.

After Dillon was traded to the New England Patriots following the 2003 season, Johnson was named the starter. He started every game in the 2004 season. In Week 12, against the Cleveland Browns, he had 26 carries for a career-high 202 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 58–48 victory. In the regular season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had three rushing touchdowns in the 38–10 victory. He set a franchise rushing record with 1,454 yards. In addition, he scored 12 touchdowns and was named to the AFC Pro Bowl team.

Johnson was a major contributor in 2005 season, in which the Bengals reached the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Johnson remained the starter as a punishing runner providing the running game needed to complement quarterback Carson Palmer and wide receiver Chad Johnson (Ochocinco). Chris Perry, former University of Michigan running back, joined the backfield as the Bengals&#x27; first round pick in the 2004 NFL draft. In a Week 14 victory over the Cleveland Browns, he had 30 carries for 169 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. At the end of the season, the Bengals finished with an 11–5 record, an AFC North Division title, and the team&#x27;s first winning season since 1990. Johnson broke his own franchise record with 1,458 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns while also recording a career-high 23 receptions for 90 yards. Johnson scored a rushing touchdown in his playoff debut, a 31–17 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round.

In Week 2 of the 2006 season, Johnson had 26 carries for 145 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 34–17 victory. In the 2006 season, Johnson had 341 carries for 1,309 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns in 16 games and 15 starts.

During the 2007 season, Johnson missed five games to injury, and he had only one game in which he rushed for over 100 yards, a Week 2 loss to the Cleveland Browns. He finished the season with 497 yards on 170 carries for three touchdowns.

In August 2008, it was reported that the Bengals were interested in trading Johnson for a &quot;top receiver&quot; to shore up their injured receiving corps, which would leave Chris Perry as the new feature back and either Kenny Watson or DeDe Dorsey as his backup. Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis denied any trade talks involving Johnson. &quot;It&#x27;s a rumor,&quot; he stated. However, on August 27, Johnson stated he expected to be gone &quot;any minute.&quot; After a trade fell through, Johnson was released by the team on August 30 during the final roster cuts.

===Detroit Lions===
Johnson signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions on September 1, 2008. The Lions released running back Tatum Bell to make room for Johnson. The following day, Johnson accused Bell of stealing his luggage, although Bell insisted &quot;it was just an honest mistake.&quot; In one season with the Lions, Johnson had 237 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, 88 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown. The 2008 season was Johnson&#x27;s last in the NFL.

==Community==
The Rudi Johnson Foundation was established in July 2005. The foundation provides assistance to families and children to promote self-sufficiency and self-reliance and incorporates several community-based programs. In 2007, James Farrior of the Pittsburgh Steelers joined the effort, establishing his own foundation to assist in this movement. The foundation helped fund the organization of the first football team for Clark Montessouri High School in Cincinnati. The foundation is a strong supporter of &quot;Be The Match&quot;, the national registry of the National Bone Marrow Registry, and regularly organizes and conducts donor drives to recruit minorities.

<doc id="963040" wikidata="Q2745706" url="?curid=963040" title="ClayFighter 63⅓">
<text>ClayFighter 63⅓ is a 1997 fighting game developed and published by Interplay Productions for the Nintendo 64. It is the third installment in the &quot;ClayFighter&quot; series. The title is a parody of the &quot;64&quot; suffix common in Nintendo 64 games.

Upon release, &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; was negatively received by critics for its gameplay, animation, and AI. An updated version, titled ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut, was released in 1998 as a Blockbuster rental exclusive. Due to its limited distribution, &quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot; is one of the rarest and most valuable Nintendo 64 games.

==Gameplay==
Like its predecessors, &quot;ClayFighter&quot; and &quot;ClayFighter 2: Judgment Clay&quot;, &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; uses stop motion animation and claymation rather than traditional computer animation, producing a unique visual effect.

The arenas in &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; are distinctive, as most feature multiple rooms. During fights, players can punch or kick their opponents into different rooms, and the fight will continue there. There are 26 different rooms to fight in.

The game parodies other fighting games. It incorporates a 3-level bar for super combos, similar to the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, and uses parries like in the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series. Many of the super attacks are clear variations of attacks from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. It also features a combo system similar to &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, though it humorously mocks the combo names (e.g., &quot;Itty Bitty Combo&quot; or &quot;Triple Brown Betty Combo&quot;). During battles, players can use various attacks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

==Plot==
The Isle of Klaymodo is home to &quot;Bessie,&quot; a purple meteor that crashed onto the island. Bessie contains the essential ingredient, Bawk Choy, which Dr. Kiln needs for his world-dominating Mutagen. Klaymodo&#x27;s chief villains are the devious Dr. Kiln and the local voodoo practitioner, Happy Harry Houngan.

Using a mix of laboratory experiments and voodoo spells, they have created a bizarre group of henchmen to assist in their plan to take over the world. These grotesque goons include Bonker, a clown gone bad, and Ickybod Clay, a mysterious entity from down under. 

Dr. Kiln is putting the finishing touches on his top-secret mutagen, code-named &quot;Clayotic Claymorphisis,&quot; when Houngan enters the lab. Upon discovering Dr. Kiln&#x27;s secret formula, chaos ensues. In the commotion, a vial of the mutagen shatters in Dr. Kiln&#x27;s hand, and it begins to take on a life of its own.

The condition spreads quickly, forcing Dr. Kiln to amputate his own hand. As the severed hand hits the floor, it scurries out of the lab and into the dense jungle of Klaymodo. Houngan immediately rushes out in pursuit of the rogue hand, while Dr. Kiln writhes in agony.

Meanwhile, as Dr. Kiln copes with his new stump, a ship on a three-hour tour capsizes near Rubbage Reef. The ship&#x27;s passengers are an eclectic group, each with their own goals. Among them is Bad Mister Frosty®, a former villain turned good, and Kung Pow, a wok chef known as Chef Boy R&#x27; Clay. Taffyman and Blob complete the castaways of the SS Manure.

==Characters==
There are twelve characters in &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;, six of whom return from previous games in the &quot;ClayFighter&quot; series. Four characters make their debut in this game, and two are from other game series. The first nine characters are available for play from the start, while the remaining three are hidden and can be unlocked using cheat codes or by completing the game with each character. 

All twelve characters from &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; also appear in the updated version of the game, &quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which includes four additional characters, bringing the total roster to sixteen.

===Default characters===
*Bad Mr. Frosty: The Fighting Snowman 

Once again reformed, Bad Mr. Frosty is a grouchy snowman determined to stop Dr. Kiln&#x27;s sinister plot and reclaim the North Pole from Sumo Santa. Frosty fights by transforming his frozen body in various ways, creating snowballs, ice picks, and other icy weapons. He often attacks while growling the taunt, &quot;Call me Daddy!&quot; Frosty is one of the few characters to appear in every &quot;ClayFighter&quot; game, though his appearance has significantly changed in each installment. He is a parody of Frosty the Snowman.

*Blob 

Blob is an amorphous green blob with a dopey grin, who may not seem like a skilled fighter at first glance. However, Blob is a master of morphing, able to transform his body into various weapons, such as cannons, sledgehammers, and boxing gloves. He also has a taste for living clay and doesn&#x27;t hesitate to devour a downed opponent for a quick snack. Blob has appeared in all three games in the series. In previous entries, he had a high-pitched voice and a sadistic grin, but in this installment, he is given a Quasimodo-like voice and a dopey expression.

*Bonker 

Once a children&#x27;s entertainer, Bonker went insane years ago and now seeks revenge on anyone who laughed at him. With a perpetual scowl and a somber tone, Bonker&#x27;s homicidal tendencies contrast sharply with his flamboyant dress and makeup. He attacks with cream pies, mallets, and a portable cannon, making his enemies suffer in creative ways. Bonker returns from the first &quot;ClayFighter&quot; game but with a completely different design. The original Bonker had a manic grin and a cheerfully goofy voice.

*Earthworm Jim 

The mightiest worm in all creation, Earthworm Jim is vacationing on Klaymodo Island when he hears of Dr. Kiln&#x27;s mad scheme. Never one to allow evil to triumph, Jim springs into action, showcasing the head-whipping, raygun-blasting, and cow-dropping moves his fans adore. Jim is a guest character from his own game series, with Dan Castellaneta reprising his role from the cartoon series. In &quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;, Jim is only playable as a secret character.

*Houngan 

Happy Harry Houngan is an evil Jamaican witch doctor and master of voodoo with a sinister set of abilities to aid his quest for world domination through black magic. His primary weapon is a rubber chicken that he has transformed into a zombie. Houngan also wields a juju staff and a wooden tiki mask, which he can use as a bludgeon or even as a snowboard. Some of his attacks summon rotting zombie hands that reach out of the ground to grab his opponent. Upon entering the Battle Stage, Houngan rotates his head around, parodying &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

*Ickybod Clay 

Ickybod Clay is a withered ghoul with a mushy Jack-o&#x27;-lantern for a head. He resides in his own haunted mansion, but his squeaky voice and somewhat geeky personality make him less terrifying than he aspires to be. His attacks include throwing his own head as a weapon, performing a parody of the shoryuken called the &quot;Boo-Hoo Ken,&quot; and teleporting. Ickybod appeared in the original &quot;ClayFighter&quot; but had a more whispery and creepy voice. His name is a parody of Ichabod Crane.

*Kung Pow 

Kung Pow resembles a bucktoothed version of Bruce Lee and is a Chinese chef who also excels in martial arts. He wears a white gi and delivers dialogue filled with bland and questionable &quot;oriental&quot; wisdom. Most of his attacks are named after Chinese cuisine (such as Egg foo young and chop suey), and he uses utensils like chopsticks, woks, and meat cleavers as weapons. His name is a reference to Kung Pao chicken.

*T-Hoppy: The Battle Bunny 

T-Hoppy is a cyborg rabbit created by Dr. Kiln, who combined the disfigured Hoppy from &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot; with mechanical implants to transform him into a living weapon. However, T-Hoppy rebelled against his creator and now fights to destroy Kiln and find peace of mind. Along with his impressive physical strength and cybernetic enhancements, T-Hoppy is also a skilled stage magician. In &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot;, Hoppy had an Austrian accent, parodying Arnold Schwarzenegger (despite not yet having his implants). The &quot;T&quot; in his name references Schwarzenegger&#x27;s role as the Terminator, but in this installment, he is given a generic drill sergeant-style voice to match his new design. Hoppy is the only new character from &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot; to return, as all other new characters from that game were removed.

*Taffy 

Taffy, a former circus freak and partner of Bonker, is a bizarre creature made entirely out of taffy, granting him extraordinary flexibility and agility. He also uses gumballs as throwing weapons and carries a pair of six-shooters. Taffy frequently mimics Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, especially Moe&#x27;s iconic line, &quot;Oh, a wise guy, eh?&quot; This vocal resemblance was more pronounced in the original &quot;ClayFighter&quot;, where Taffy first appeared.

===Unlockable characters===

Boogerman, another hero from previous Interplay games, joins the Clayfighters to save the day and outshine his old rival, Earthworm Jim. Boogerman fights using his signature bodily emissions, including mucus, belches, and explosive flatulence. Additionally, he can summon a barrage of falling toilets to crush his foes.

*Dr. Kilnklein (often referred to as Dr. Kiln) 

Dr. Generic Kiln is the main villain of the game. After being indirectly responsible for the events of &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot; (he is mentioned in the manual but doesn&#x27;t appear in the game), Dr. Kiln&#x27;s latest scheme is to transform the entire world into clay, allowing him to mold it as he pleases. His hand, now replaced with a piece of clay, can transform into various weapons such as a propeller, machine gun, chainsaw, jumper cables, and a scalpel. Meanwhile, his lost hand gained sentience and became High Five, a hidden character in &quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;. With his opaque eyeglasses, hunched back, and thick Germanic accent, Dr. Kiln embodies the archetype of the mad scientist.

*Sumo Santa 

Sumo Santa is an evil doppelgänger of Santa Claus, dressed in little more than a loincloth. Megalomaniacal and power-hungry, Sumo Santa has conquered the North Pole and now views it as his domain, with only Frosty standing in his way. Despite his grotesque obesity, Sumo Santa is surprisingly agile and delights in using his massive bulk to flatten his opponents.

==Development==
&quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; was developed by Interplay Entertainment as part of its &quot;ClayFighter&quot; series, which originated on the Super NES. Initially titled &quot;ClayFighter 3&quot;, the project was produced by Jeremy Airey, who had worked on previous titles in the franchise, alongside designers Eric Hart and Rodney Relosa. The development team&#x27;s goal was to create a legitimate fighting game while humorously parodying popular franchises in the genre, such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. Airey explained that the team aimed to replace the extreme violence of those games with gross or humorous actions: &quot;Buckets of blood and gore get boring after a while. We want to make a game that stays fresh [...] We think this sort of thing works better than gore because each character has something unique and funny to show&quot;.

Dissatisfied with the clay animation in &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot;, Interplay reached out to Danger Productions for the new game&#x27;s character models and stop motion animation, as they had done with the original &quot;ClayFighter&quot;. Once Interplay&#x27;s artists had sketched out the game&#x27;s characters, Danger Productions transformed the illustrations into maquettes for plastic molds, which were then crafted into models using clay, foam, and wire. Interplay directed Danger Productions to film the models in various positions using stop motion photography with backlighting. Interplay then digitized the photographs and integrated the animation, sound, and player input using computer scripting tools. These tools had been created during the short production of &quot;ClayFighter 2&quot; but were not fully refined until work began on this third entry in the series.

Newer technology enabled Interplay to achieve the aesthetic they had originally envisioned for the &quot;ClayFighter&quot; series. Development initially began for the 3DO M2 but later transitioned to the Nintendo 64. Airey and the development team found the N64&#x27;s software development kit much easier to work with compared to the M2, although Airey expressed regret that the N64 lacked a CD-ROM drive. The N64 allowed the team to render characters within 3D environments while maintaining 24-bit color depth. Airey also mentioned that the team implemented &quot;Spillits&quot; (bits of clay that scatter in 3D space, akin to blood or impact stars in other games) when characters are hit.

For the game&#x27;s audio, Interplay brought in a sound director from Disney to record the character voice-overs, with a cast that included Rob Paulsen, Frank Welker, and Dan Castellaneta, among others. The team recorded 30 to 40 unique voice lines for each character. Additionally, the game features the voice of famous ring announcer Michael Buffer, who provides commentary throughout each round.

==Release==
&quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; was initially announced in the fall of 1995 as a launch game for the anticipated M2 console. By mid-1996, the game remained a key title in the prospective M2 library. However, during the third quarter of the year, following the M2&#x27;s eventual cancellation, Interplay announced that development had shifted to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and Nintendo&#x27;s N64. 

The game resurfaced under the name &quot;ClayFighter Extreme&quot; in late 1996; it was later retitled &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; in early 1997 for its imminent N64 release. 

The planned PlayStation version was ultimately cancelled due to delays in its development. An Interplay representative stated that this version was scrapped because it could not be released simultaneously with &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;; the developers wanted to avoid giving PlayStation owners the impression that it was merely a port of the N64 version.
&quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; faced numerous delays, ultimately releasing nearly a year later than initially planned. The magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; featured a cover story and an early review of the game in its June 1997 issue, highlighting anticipation for its launch. 

Before releasing &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;, Interplay made significant adjustments, including altering the combat system, changing many fighters&#x27; movesets, and removing five of the original seventeen playable characters from the roster due to space limitations. 

The game was quietly released in North America on October 23, 1997, followed by its launch in Europe the following month.

==&quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;==
Interplay later released an updated version of &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; titled &quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which became a rental exclusive at Blockbuster Video in North America on May 15, 1998. Although the game could only be rented, Blockbuster held an online contest that allowed customers to win a copy of the game. 

&quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot; introduced new storylines, simplified menu navigation, adjustments to the combat system, and a new introduction sequence featuring vocal lyrics, along with other minor changes. Most notably, it reinstated four of the five characters that were removed from the original release of &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;, in addition to the original twelve fighters. The fifth character, Hobo Cop, was omitted due to Nintendo&#x27;s disapproval; he was portrayed as a homeless vigilante with a penchant for alcohol consumption.

The four characters exclusive to &quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot; are:
*High Five (voiced by Tress MacNeille)
Dr. Kiln&#x27;s severed hand, mutated by chemicals and transformed into a sentient being, High Five harbors deep resentment towards his former host. Despite his physical limitations, he is a skilled &quot;hand-to-hand combatant.&quot; Interestingly, it remains ambiguous whether High Five is a right or left hand, as the fighters are reversed when they cross sides of the screen during gameplay. In terms of gameplay mechanics, High Five appears somewhat unfinished; he lacks a ducking Brutal Kick, has only one super attack, and no Claytalities.

*Lady Liberty (voiced by Tress MacNeille) 
Transformed by Dr. Kiln into a living clay creature, Lady Liberty, inspired by the Statue of Liberty, turned against her creator and seeks to destroy him. Her primary weapon is her iconic torch, which she can wield as a flamethrower, adding a unique combat dynamic to her character.

*Lockjaw Pooch (voiced by Frank Welker) 
Originally marked as killed during the production of the original &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot;—with a humorous note stating, &quot;This animal was severely injured during the making of this game&quot;—Lockjaw returns to wreak havoc in &quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;. As a vicious junkyard dog granted sentience by Dr. Kiln&#x27;s experiments, Lockjaw uses his powerful fangs effectively in battle, showcasing loyalty and ferocity.

*Zappa Yow Yow Boyz (voiced by Frank Welker) 
Comprising three little pygmy brothers who are a nuisance to Houngan, the Zappa Yow Yow Boyz may be short and squat, but they become a formidable force when they stack onto each other&#x27;s shoulders. They also summon their pet goat to assist in battle. Notably cannibalistic, the Boyz have a darkly humorous trait of tossing defeated opponents into a boiling kettle for dinner, adding to their quirky and menacing charm. 

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; received a largely negative critical reception. The game holds an aggregate score of 47.96% on GameRankings, based on 13 reviews. While many reviewers found the game&#x27;s humor and parody to be effective, they felt that its shortcomings in other areas left it lacking in long-term appeal. &quot;Next Generation&quot; noted, &quot;What&#x27;s so likable about &quot;Clay Fighter 63 1/3&quot;—in fact, about the only thing that&#x27;s likable—is that it&#x27;s just so damn silly, and it parodies its targets pretty squarely. Anyone who&#x27;s played, or even watched someone else play &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, or &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; ... will find the characters, their moves, and voice-overs hilarious. ... In the end, most gamers will have a difficult time spending $69.99 on this comic-tragic game. How much do you value a good, albeit short-lived, chuckle?&quot; Critics condemned the game for its sprite-based graphics, derivative mechanics, weak AI, and choppy animation. &quot;GamePro&quot; summarized: &quot;Slow action, forced humor, fuzzy speech, frustrating combos, cheesy A.I.—the game is practically a laundry list of what not to do without good gameplay.&quot;

Matt Casamassina predicted that &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; would &quot;remain a prominent title in the N64 library for years to come&quot; because the game &quot;is so terrible it sets the standards for bad.&quot; In contrast, the editors of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, who reviewed the game in both its unreleased and released forms in June and November 1997, respectively, were much more favorable. Sushi-X also defended the game in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, arguing that while it is unenjoyable in a traditional fighting game sense, it makes for a great party game. His three co-reviewers leaned more toward the majority opinion, stating that the game is funny but would eventually become tiresome.

According to Toy Retail Sales Tracking, &quot;ClayFighter 63⅓&quot; sold approximately 60,000 copies before Christmas in 1997. The &quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot; version of the game remains one of the rarest North American N64 games. Released as a Blockbuster rental deal, only 20,000 copies were manufactured. Due to this limited distribution and the poor treatment that games typically received at video rental stores, boxes and instruction manuals are extremely rare, and their value increased significantly in the early 2010s.

In September 2009, Interplay announced plans to update the &quot;ClayFighter&quot; series for the WiiWare and DSiWare services with a new title, &quot;ClayFighter: Call of Putty&quot;. Development was being handled by StudioBlack Games, which included Eric Hart, a programmer from the original &quot;ClayFighter&quot;. The title of this installment parodies &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, a popular series of first-person shooter games. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; revealed that &quot;Call of Putty&quot; would include all the gameplay, fighters, and modes from &quot;ClayFighter: Sculptor&#x27;s Cut&quot;, with an expected release date in late 2010 or early 2011. However, after continuous delays, the game was listed with a TBA release status on Interplay&#x27;s website. 

In 1999, Interplay commented that &quot;ClayFighter&quot; had &quot;broken a million&quot; in sales on the Nintendo 64, though it was unclear if the Sculptor&#x27;s Cut edition was included in that figure.
