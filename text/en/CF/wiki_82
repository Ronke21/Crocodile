<text>The FN Five-seven (stylized as Five-seveN) is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. The pistol is named for the 5.7×28mm cartridge&#x27;s bullet diameter, and the trademark&#x27;s capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer&#x27;s initials—&quot;FN&quot;.

The Five-seven pistol was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon and the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge. The P90 was introduced in 1990, and the Five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition. Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seven shares many of its design features: it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a relatively large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls, low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types.

Sales of the Five-seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for uses such as personal protection and target shooting. Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seven&#x27;s introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.

The Five-seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. In the United States, the Five-seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. In the years since the pistol&#x27;s introduction to the United States&#x27; civilian market, it has become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The Five-seven pistol and its 5.7×28mm ammunition were developed by FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and associated pistols and submachine guns. NATO called for two types of weapons chambered for a new cartridge—one a shoulder-fired weapon, and the other a handheld weapon. According to NATO, these new weapons, termed personal defense weapons (PDWs), were to provide &quot;personal protection in last-resort situations when the user is directly endangered by the enemy [...].&quot; In 1989, NATO published document &quot;D/296&quot;, outlining a number of preliminary specifications for these weapons:
* The new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, it was to be capable of penetrating certain types of body armor.
* The shoulder-fired personal defense weapon was to weigh less than 3 kg (6.6 lb), with a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds.
* The handheld personal defense weapon (pistol) was to weigh less than , although a weight of was deemed desirable; it was to have a magazine capacity of no fewer than 20 rounds.
* Both weapons were to be sufficiently compact to be carried hands-free on the user&#x27;s person at all times, whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.

FN Herstal was the first small arms manufacturer to respond to NATO&#x27;s requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the FN P90, along with a small caliber, high velocity 5.7×28mm cartridge type. The original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the &quot;SS90&quot;, went into production with the P90 in 1990. This cartridge type was discontinued in 1993, and replaced with the 5.7×28mm &quot;SS190&quot;, which used a heavier and slightly shorter projectile weighing 2.0 g (31 grains). The reduced length of the SS190 projectile allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven, which was under development at that time.

In 1993, Jean-Louis Gathoye of FN filed a United States patent application for a delayed blowback operating system intended for the Five-seven pistol, and &quot;U.S. Patent 5,347,912&quot; (&quot;Elements for decelerating the recoil of the moving parts of a firearm&quot;) was received the following year. In 1995, FN officially announced development of the Five-seven pistol, and a prototype of the pistol was publicly displayed the following year. With some improvements, a double-action only model of the pistol went into production in 1998, and a single-action model called the &quot;Five-seven Tactical&quot; was then introduced shortly afterward. The Five-seven first entered service in May 2000, when the Cypriot National Guard () purchased 250 pistols for their special forces group.

=== NATO evaluation ===

In 2002 and 2003, NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge and the HK 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by German small arms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The results of the NATO tests were analyzed by a group formed of experts from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the group&#x27;s conclusion was that the 5.7×28mm was &quot;undoubtedly&quot; the more efficient cartridge.

At the time, the German delegation and others rejected the NATO recommendation that 5.7×28mm should be standardized, delaying the standardization until its eventual completion in February 2021. Despite this delay, both the 4.6×30mm and 5.7×28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; the Five-seven pistol is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world (see ).

=== Present ===
At first, sales of the Five-seven pistol were restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but in 2004 the new &quot;Five-seven IOM&quot; model was introduced and offered to civilian shooters for use with 5.7×28mm sporting ammunition. The IOM model incorporated several modifications to the weapon&#x27;s design, such as the addition of an M1913 accessory rail, a magazine safety mechanism, and fully adjustable sights.

Further development of the Five-seven pistol led to the introduction of the &quot;Five-seven USG&quot; model, which was approved by the ATF as a sporting firearm in 2004. The USG model incorporates a conventionally shaped square trigger guard, a reversible magazine release, and other minor changes.

The &quot;Five-seven MK2&quot; was introduced in 2013, replacing the USG model. The MK2 model has cocking serrations on the front of the slide, all black controls, and slightly different iron sights.

The &quot;Five-seven MK3 MRD&quot; was introduced at Eurosatory in 2022, introducing the possibility to mount a Mini Red Dot on top of the slide, a threaded barrel, making it possible to use a silencer, a new texture pattern on the grip and deeper slide serrations.

== Design ==
The Five-seven is a semi-automatic delayed blowback pistol chambered for FN&#x27;s 5.7×28mm ammunition. The pistol has a concealed hammer. Polymer materials are used extensively in the pistol&#x27;s design, and even the steel slide is encased in a polymer shell. This provides reduced weight and greater resistance to corrosion. The slide&#x27;s polymer shell gives the pistol the appearance of being constructed entirely of polymers, but the slide interior, barrel, trigger, springs, pins, and similar parts are all steel. However, the pistol is unusually lightweight, weighing only 744 g (1.6 lb) with a loaded 20-round magazine.

The Five-seven is a full-size pistol, having an overall length of , a height of , and a max width of . It has the same grip angle as the distinguished Browning Hi-Power and M1911 pistols. Despite the considerable length of the pistol&#x27;s 5.7×28mm ammunition, the grip is not particularly unwieldy—the distance from the trigger to the back of the grip measures , which is identical to a U.S. Military issue M9 pistol chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The Five-seven barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with a total length of and a rifled length of . The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231 mm (1:9.1 in), and it weighs . The small caliber gives the barrel a
length in calibers of more than 20, 58% more than a comparable 9x19 barrel. It has a stated service life of 20,000 rounds and the Five-seven is noted for being very accurate.

Current models of the Five-seven are single-action, having a short and light trigger pull of 20 to 30 N (4.4 to 6.6 lb&quot;F&quot;). They have a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories, and a magazine safety mechanism that prevents the pistol from firing without a magazine inserted. The grip texture on current pistols is extensively checkered for a superior hold, and each side of the slide has a series of narrow ridges at the rear to aid grasping. The trigger and trigger guard surfaces also have grooves to reduce finger slip, and the trigger guard is elongated to ease firing while wearing gloves. The Five-seven is currently offered in two different frame finishes (standard black or flat dark earth), and two different iron sight systems (adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights).

=== Ammunition ===

Particularly significant to the design of the Five-seven pistol is the small caliber, high velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0 g (93 grains)—significantly lighter than the average 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge (M882 NATO total cartridge weight of 12 grams (180 grains))—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash, but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.

One of the design intents for the standard 5.7×28mm cartridge type, the &quot;SS190&quot;, was that it would have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the Five-seven, the 5.7×28mm SS190 has a muzzle velocity of roughly 650 m/s (2,130 ft/s) and is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of , or 48 layers of Kevlar material (roughly equivalent to two stacked Level II Kevlar vest panels) at a range of . It is also capable of penetrating a PASGT vest at a range of or a PASGT helmet at a range of . FN states an effective range of and a maximum range of for the 5.7×28mm cartridge when fired from the Five-seven pistol.

In testing conducted by Passaic County, New Jersey Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the 5.7×28mm SS190 penetrated to a depth of in bare ballistic gelatin, and a depth of in gelatin protected with a Kevlar vest. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point (&quot;tumble&quot;) as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85 in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet&#x27;s terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.

The 5.7×28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, as well as risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only , whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond . This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge&#x27;s intended applications, so the cartridge&#x27;s limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the 5.7×28mm SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow-point bullet, the cartridge and pistol are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.

=== Feeding ===
The Five-seven pistol feeds from detachable box magazines, but it is unconventional in that it feeds cartridges into the chamber without the use of a barrel feed ramp, having a beveled chamber only—the pistol&#x27;s feeding is inherently reliable because of its use of bottlenecked cartridges. The pistol is supplied with 20-round magazines as standard, or 10-round magazines for jurisdictions with a high-capacity magazine ban. The Five-seven will also accept an aftermarket extended 30-round magazine, which protrudes an additional from the base of the pistol. With an additional cartridge in the chamber, the Five-seven pistol has a total capacity of 11, 21, or 31 rounds depending on which magazine type is used. Magazine pouches for the Five-seven magazine are available from various manufacturers.

The Five-seven&#x27;s magazine can be disassembled for cleaning or lubrication by removing the polymer floorplate. The magazine body is constructed of polymer, with steel inserts at the feed lips. Unlike a conventional pistol magazine, it is a double-stack staggered-feed magazine, with a follower that has the same appearance as that of an M16 rifle&#x27;s magazine, and which is loaded in the same manner: by pushing cartridges straight down into the magazine, rather than pushing them down and back. This setup makes it very easy to load individual cartridges into the magazine. The magazine floorplate has a slight finger spur, and four holes in the left side of the magazine body allow a convenient estimate of the amount of remaining ammunition.

=== Controls ===
All controls (excluding the trigger) on the Five-seven USG and earlier models are grey polymer, in contrast to the black polymer frame and slide cover. Similarly, all of the controls on the Five-seven FDE and Five-seven ODG models are black polymer, in contrast to the flat dark earth and olive drab polymer frames. A takedown lever is located at the front on the left side of the weapon&#x27;s frame, and a slide release is located at the rear on the left side of the frame; these controls are protected from accidental movements by slight projections in the frame contour. A chamber indicator, in the form of a pin inside a tiny hole, is provided on the left side of the slide. When a round has been chambered, this pin will protrude , which is sufficient to provide both visible and tactile indication of the chamber&#x27;s status.

Current models of the Five-seven have an ambidextrous manual safety device, which is located in an unconventional position: one control is found on each side of the frame above the trigger guard, where it is reachable with the trigger finger or support hand thumb. A red dot is visible here when the safety is deactivated and the pistol is ready to fire; when the safety is moved to the raised position, it is activated and the red dot is no longer visible. The pistol&#x27;s push-button magazine release, located on the left side of the frame where the trigger guard intersects with the grip, is square-shaped and reversible for left-handed shooters.

The Five-seven can be disassembled quickly and easily, by using the left hand to retract and hold the slide rearwards, while simultaneously using the left-hand thumb to push and hold the takedown lever rearwards. When the slide is released, it moves forward freely and the complete slide assembly can be disengaged from the frame, whereupon the barrel (and captured recoil spring) can be removed from the slide. This level of disassembly is sufficient to perform thorough cleaning of the pistol, and FNH USA recommends no further disassembly except by an authorized armorer, FN Herstal, or FNH USA. Reassembly of the pistol is done in the reverse order, except no use of the disassembly lever is necessary.

=== Sights and accessories ===
The Five-seven has a sight radius of ; the pistol is currently offered with either adjustable sights or fixed sights. The &quot;three-dot&quot; type adjustable sights consist of a 2.9-mm (0.12 in) square notch rear and a 3.6-mm (0.14 in) blade front, which has a height of . The sights are targeted at , but can be adjusted for either windage or elevation. The &quot;three-dot&quot; type C-More fixed sights, which are offered as a low profile alternative to the adjustable sights, can only be adjusted for windage. The fixed sights are targeted at using SS195LF ammunition, and are available with or without tritium-illuminated inserts (&quot;night sights&quot;) to aid use of the pistol in dim lighting.

The Five-seven is supplied with a lockable hard case, a locking device and keys, a magazine release reversal tool, a sight adjustment tool (not included with the fixed sights model), a cleaning kit, an owner&#x27;s manual, and three 20-round magazines (or three 10-round magazines, where restricted by law).

The Five-seven can be used in conjunction with a wide range of firearm accessories; holsters are offered by various manufacturers, and the pistol&#x27;s MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) accessory rail will accept tactical lights or laser aiming devices. With the use of an extended, threaded barrel, the pistol can also be fitted with various sound suppressors developed by Advanced Armament Corporation, Gemtech, Silencerco, and other manufacturers. The Gemtech &quot;SFN-57&quot;, which was developed in 1998 specifically for use with the Five-seven, is a matte black aluminum suppressor with a length of , a diameter of , and a weight of . Israeli manufacturer FAB Defense offers a complete PDW conversion kit for the Five-seven, designated the &quot;KPOS G2 FN 5.7&quot;, that allows the pistol to be reconfigured into a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, and CornerShot offers a weapon system compatible with the Five-seven that allows the shooter to aim and fire around corners without being exposed.

== Variants ==
;Five-seven
:The original &quot;Five-seven&quot; was introduced in 1998, and it is now discontinued. It had no manual safety device and it was double-action only, with a heavy trigger pull of 4.5 to 6.5 daN (10 to 14 lb&quot;F&quot;); its double-action only trigger was harshly criticized. The original Five-seven had a pebbled grip pattern, a smoothly contoured accessory rail, low profile fixed sights and a large circular-shaped trigger guard designed to facilitate gloved use. It did not have a slide release and the slide was not serrated as on newer models, but a portion at the rear of the slide was instead slightly concave to aid grasping. The pistol also had slightly different markings, with an &quot;FN&quot; logo placed on the left side of the frame above the trigger guard.

;Five-seven Tactical
:The &quot;Five-seven Tactical&quot; was introduced shortly after the original double-action only model, as a single-action alternative. It had a short and light trigger pull of 2 to 3 daN (4.4 to 6.6 lb&quot;F&quot;), as on current models. It also had the addition of an ambidextrous manual safety device (located on each side of the frame, as on current models), and a slide release. Aside from these modifications, the Tactical model was identical to the original double-action only Five-seven. It was discontinued following the introduction of the IOM model.

;Five-seven IOM
:The &quot;Five-seven IOM&quot; (Individual Officer Model) was the first model of the Five-seven pistol to be offered to civilian shooters, debuting in 2004. It is now discontinued in favor of the USG model. The IOM was similar in its basic design to the Tactical version, but differed in that it had a MIL-STD-1913 (&quot;Picatinny&quot;) accessory rail, a serrated slide and trigger guard, and fully adjustable sights. It also had a magazine safety mechanism incorporated into the design, to prevent the pistol from being fired without a magazine inserted.

;Five-seven USG
:The &quot;Five-seven USG&quot; (United States Government) model was approved by the ATF as a sporting firearm in 2004, replacing the IOM model. The USG retained the changes that were incorporated in the IOM, but it had further modifications, including a conventionally shaped square trigger guard, a tightly checkered grip pattern, and a larger, reversible magazine release. It was originally offered with adjustable sights, but starting in 2009 it was also offered with low profile fixed sights. The USG model had a black frame finish with grey controls as standard, but it was also offered in limited quantities with black controls. Since 2013, the USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA.

;Five-seven FDE
:The &quot;Five-seven FDE&quot; (Flat Dark Earth) model was built to the same specifications as the Five-seven USG, but it had a brown frame finish and black controls, as opposed to the standard black frame finish and grey controls of the Five-seven USG. Like the USG model, the FDE was offered with either adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights. Since 2013, the original FDE model is no longer listed by FNH USA, although a flat dark earth version of the new MK2 is available.

;Five-seven ODG
:The &quot;Five-seven ODG&quot; (Olive Drab Green) model was built to the same specifications as the Five-seven USG model, but it had an olive drab frame finish and black controls, as opposed to the standard black frame finish and grey controls of the Five-seven USG. Like the USG model, the ODG model was offered with either adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights. Since 2012, the ODG model is no longer listed by FNH USA.

;Five-seven MK2
:The &quot;Five-seven MK2&quot; model was introduced in 2013, and is now the standard version of the Five-seven offered by FN Herstal. This new model has cocking serrations on the front of the slide, and has a one-piece metal slide (under the polymer cover), whereas the previous models have a two-piece welded metal slide. It is available only with adjustable sights. The rear sight on the adjustable-sight version has also been changed, with beefed-up construction and white straight-edge sight references compared to the present three-dot target-style sights; these have been described as &quot;combat adjustable sights&quot;.

:The MK2 has a black frame and slide, with flat black controls in place of the grey controls of the IOM and USG models. It is also available with a flat dark earth frame color. It is slightly wider than previous models and will not fit most custom holsters made for earlier versions of the Five-seven.
=== Current model ===
;Five-seven MK3 MRD
:The &quot;Five-seven MK3 MRD&quot; model was introduced in 2022, the main difference is the new FN patented interface that accepts the most commonly used red dot sights, and multisurfaced textures. Optically it has a new slide and a more textured grip, compared to the MK2. It is available in black and flat dark earth.

== Controversies ==
The Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but in 2004 the new &quot;Five-seven IOM&quot; model was introduced, and offered to civilian shooters for use with 5.7×28mm SS192 ammunition. FNH USA has marketed the Five-seven to civilian shooters as a pistol suitable for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses, but the Five-seven&#x27;s introduction to civilian shooters was strongly opposed by U.S. gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign; by the end of 2004, sales of the Five-seven pistol had increased dramatically.

In early 2005, the pistol was subject to controversy in the United States after the Brady Campaign stated that commercially available 5.7×28mm SS192 ammunition penetrated a Level IIA Kevlar vest in testing. The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) shortly countered the Brady Campaign&#x27;s claim by stating that the gun control group may not have adhered to standard testing procedures, and that FN offers armor-piercing varieties of the 5.7×28mm cartridge only to military and law enforcement customers. Varieties offered to civilians are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing, and it was stated that the SS192 and SS196 cartridge variations were unable to penetrate various types of Kevlar vests in tests conducted by FNH USA.

Michael D. Barnes, then-president of the Brady Campaign, responded to the NRA&#x27;s statements on the Five-seven by challenging NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to be shot with the pistol while wearing a Kevlar vest. The NRA again responded to the Brady Campaign&#x27;s statements, saying that &quot;Barnes demonstrated his group&#x27;s complete and utter disregard for gun safety and its flaming zeal to further restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners.&quot; In the same year, two pieces of legislation were introduced in the United States Congress, specifically targeting the Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition for a federal ban: the &quot;H.R. 1136: PLEA Act&quot; was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), and the &quot;S. 527: PLEA Act&quot; was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ); neither bill proceeded to a vote by the House or Senate.

In March 2007, legislation was again introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel, under the new designation &quot;H.R. 1784: PLEA Act&quot;. Once again, the bill failed to proceed to a vote. In the following years, the Five-seven was subject to further controversy due to reports of the pistol&#x27;s use by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War. In the United States, the Five-seven has been used once to shoot and kill a police officer, causing the line of duty death of Wisconsin State Patrol Trooper Trevor Casper. Various news sources such as &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;La Jornada&quot; also report incidents in which the pistol was used to shoot and kill police officers or civilians in Mexico. According to the ATF, the Five-seven is one of the weapons favored by drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War, and a smuggled Five-seven pistol can sell for up to 66,000 pesos (US$5,000) in Mexico. From Mexico, the pistols have been smuggled into other South American countries; in a July 2010 drive-by shooting in Envigado, Colombia, two cartel gunmen armed with Five-seven pistols opened fire on a group of bystanders outside a nightclub, leaving 9 people dead and 10 wounded.

In November 2009, the Five-seven again became subject to controversy in the United States, following the shooting at Fort Hood military base, in Texas. A U.S. Army psychiatrist, Major Nidal Hasan, opened fire on fellow soldiers with a Five-seven pistol, killing 13 people and wounding 29 in the worst shooting ever to take place on an American military base. Shortly after the shooting, FNH USA responded with a fact sheet dismissing allegations about the nature of the pistol, stating that it is only offered to civilians with sporting ammunition. Later in the month, a number of gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign wrote a collaborative letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, citing the weapon&#x27;s use by the Fort Hood shooter and Mexican drug cartels, and calling on him to ban importation of the Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition. In July 2010, legislation was introduced in the United States Congress by Rep. Engel, for a third time, under the new designation &quot;H.R. 6030: PLEA Act&quot;. Like its previous incarnations, the &quot;H.R. 6030&quot; bill failed to proceed to a vote by either the House of Representatives or Senate.

== Users ==

The first military organization to adopt the Five-seven was the Cypriot National Guard (Greek: &quot;Εθνική Φρουρά&quot;), which purchased 250 pistols in May 2000 for its special forces group. By 2009, the Five-seven was in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world.

In the United States, the Five-seven (as of 2010) is used by over 300 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. Military and law enforcement organizations using the Five-seven include:

<text>John Kendrick Bangs (May 27, 1862 – January 21, 1922) was an American writer, humorist, editor and satirist.

==Biography==
He was born in Yonkers, New York. His father Francis N. Bangs was a lawyer in New York City, as was his brother, Francis S. Bangs.

He went to Columbia College from 1880 to 1883 where he became editor of Columbia&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;Acta Columbia&quot;, and contributed short anonymous pieces to humor magazines. After graduation in 1883 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in Political Science, Bangs entered Columbia Law School but left in 1884 to become Associate Editor of &quot;Life&quot; under Edward S. Martin. Bangs contributed many articles and poems to the magazine between 1884 and 1888. During this period, Bangs published his first books.

In 1888 Bangs left &quot;Life&quot; to work at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Young People&quot;, though he continued to contribute to &quot;Life&quot;. From 1889 to 1900 he held the title of Editor of the Departments of Humor for all three Harper&#x27;s magazines and from 1899 to 1901 served as active editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Bangs also served for a short time (January–June 1889) as the first editor of &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and became editor of the American edition of the Harper-owned &quot;Literature&quot; from January to November 1899.

In 1894, Bangs ran for the office of mayor of Yonkers, New York, but was defeated. He also was a member of the Board of Education in Yonkers.

He left Harper &amp; Brothers in 1901 and became editor of the &quot;New Metropolitan magazine&quot; in 1903. In 1904 he was appointed editor of &quot;Puck&quot;, perhaps the foremost American humor magazine of its day. In this period, he revived his earlier interest in drama. In 1906 he switched his focus to the lecture circuit.

During the period between 1901 and 1906 Bangs was known to have spent at least parts of his summers at the Profile House in Franconia, New Hampshire. He owned one of the 20 connected cottages adjacent to the large hotel, which he sold to Cornelius Newton Bliss in August 1906. As a satirical writer, he was also known in the &quot;Profile Cottage&quot; circles as a jokester and prankster and was frequently the jovial topic of hotel guests and cottage owners alike.

In 1918, he lectured for YMCA and allied troops on the battle front in France during World War I.

In 1886, he married Agnes L. Hyde, with whom he had three sons. Agnes died in 1903. Bangs then married Mary Blakeney Gray of New York in 1904. In 1907 they moved from Yonkers to Ogunquit, Maine. John Kendrick Bangs died from stomach cancer in 1922 at age fifty-nine, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

<doc id="966210" wikidata="Q667663" url="?curid=966210" title="Vindication Island">
<text>Vindication Island is a small uninhabited island of the Candlemas Islands in the South Sandwich Islands. It is one of about a dozen islands that make up the South Sandwich island arc, a chain of volcanoes in the Southern Ocean that was discovered in 1775 by James Cook. The volcanism is caused by the subduction of the South American Plate beneath the Sandwich Plate. 

The island has a rectangular outline and is the remnant of three mostly eroded volcanoes. The highest point of the island, Quadrant Peak, directly overlies the coast. Inland Vindication Island features a rich vegetation, consisting of lichens and mosses, while various bird and penguin species breed along the coasts. There is no evidence of recent volcanic activity.

== History and toponymy ==

Vindication and Candlemas Island were both discovered on 2 February 1775 by James Cook on the . In 1951–1952 the Argentine frigates and installed a marker on Vindication, claiming Argentine sovereignty over the island; this is the first recorded landing on the island. The British landed a party on Vindication in 1956–1957 as part of a larger operation in the South Sandwich Islands, with other visits from the same ship in 1962 and 1964. In 1961, the landed a boat. In May 1975, the Argentine research vessel investigated seafloor communities in the channel between Vindication and Candlemas. In January 2011, the sent a landing party ashore at Chinstrap Point.

The name &quot;Vindication Island&quot; refers to the fact that initially, James Cook&#x27;s report of there being two islands (rather than one or three) was not believed. Knob Point was charted in 1930 by Discovery Investigations personnel on the &quot;Discovery II&quot;, and probably so named because a conspicuous height of land overlooks the point.

==Geography==

Vindication Island is one of the South Sandwich Islands, a long north–south trending island arc to the southeast of South Georgia and the Falklands. They include Zavodovski, Leskov Island, Visokoi, Candlemas Island-Vindication Island, Saunders Island, Montagu Island, Bristol Island and Freezland Rock, Bellingshausen Island, Cook Island and Thule Island. All the islands are small and volcanic, most showing evidence of activity during the last two centuries. They are subject to intense marine erosion. Submarine volcanoes include Protector Shoals at the northern end and Nelson and Kemp seamounts at the southern end of the island chain. Politically, the South Sandwich Islands are part of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Vindication Island is among the most visited South Sandwich Islands, and once one has overcome the coastal cliffs, traversing the interior is relatively easy.

Vindication Island is rectangular, with a long side and a short side. The corners of the rectangle are the northwestern Crosscut Point cape, the northeastern Braces Point, the southeastern Chinstrap Point and the southwestern Knob Point. The entire coastline is made up by steep cliffs that rise above bouldery beaches; the only exception is the valley where Pothole Gulch enters the sea. Offshore lie numerous islets, such as Castor Rock and Pollux Rock south/southwest of Chinstrap Point and an unnamed islet west of Crosscut Point.

The island&#x27;s highest point is Quadrant Peak at , and lies in the southwestern corner of the island above Knob Point, dropping almost directly into the sea. A subsidiary peak above Crosscut Point is Splinter Crag, which rises above sea level. From there, the island slopes downwards in eastern direction. This asymmetric shape is due to erosion by weather and sea being concentrated on the western side of the island. The inland is formed by tablelands, ridges and creeks, its surface covered with blocky debris from which lavas and pyroclastics emerge.

The island is mostly ice-free save for a shrinking area above around Quadrant Peak; in 1964 ice covered about . Only about one tenth of the island is ice-covered, because the small size of the island limits the area on which snow and ice can accumulate. Separate ice bodies are found on the eastern side, where the main ice cap has left moraines. There are three major drainages that all emanate from Quadrant Peak: An unnamed one going northeast, Leafvein Gulch that runs eastward and Pothole Gulch to the southeast. Leafvein Gulch during summer forms a waterfall across the coastal cliffs. Pothole Gulch is fed by meltwater from the small ice cap. The shape of the unnamed drainage implies that it once extended farther west, before coastal erosion truncated it.
=== Submarine structure ===

Vindication Island lies about west of Candlemas Island. The Nelson Channel between the two islands is only about deep. Both Candlemas and Vindication rise from the same submarine volcano, and are named the Candlemas Islands. Around the islands the sea is less than deep, forming a wide shallow platform with numerous shoals, islets and sea stacks. They are remnants of eroded islands and include Buddha Rock, Castor Rock, Cook Rock, Pollux Rock, Santa Rock, Saw Rock, Tomblin Rock and Trousers Rock. Most of the islets lie around Vindication. Some of these rocks make up a series of shoals between the islands. The shelf itself probably formed through marine erosion and scouring by icebergs.

The volcano has a base diameter of more than at and a total volume of about . Away from the shallow platform, the slopes of the volcano drop off steeply into the deep ocean. East of Candlemas and abutting its southeastern side is a large wide submarine embayment, probably the remnant of a large sector collapse. Two other structures interpreted as landslide scars lie north and south of the shelf, which is scalloped by landslide scars. The submarine slopes have wave-like bedforms in many places. Smaller ridges emanate from the submarine volcano and are interpreted as parts of it, while chutes emanating in all directions formed through mass wasting. A submarine ridge at depth connects the group to Visokoi farther north. West of Candlemas, monogenetic volcanoes are developed on the seafloor.

== Geology ==

East of the South Sandwich Islands, the South America Plate subducts beneath the Scotia Plate at a rate of . The subduction is responsible for the existence of the South Sandwich island arc, which is constituted by about eleven islands in an eastward curving chain, and submarine volcanoes such as Protector in the north and Adventure and Kemp in the south. Most of the islands are stratovolcanoes of various sizes. Geologically, Vindication Island resembles the older southeastern part of Candlemas Island.

=== Composition ===

Basalt and basaltic andesite make up Vindication Island. Andesite, gabbro and palagonite have been reported as well; the gabbro may be a xenolith. Phenocrysts include olivine, plagioclase and pyroxene. The rocks of Vindication Island and the older series on Candlemas Island define a potassium-poor tholeiitic suite.

=== Geologic history ===

The island is made up by layers of lava flows, scoria and tuff, intruded by dykes. The tuffs have red, yellow and brown colours. Some surfaces are formed by volcanic ash, while lava flows make up the islets. The oldest rocks are presumably found at the bottom of the cliffs, while lava flows at the surface are probably the youngest rocks. Coastal erosion has removed most of the volcanic pile, so that only about one-fifth of the original volcano remains. The island was probably formed by three separate volcanic centres, two of which were centered offshore of the current island and are now completely eroded. 

The island is probably younger than one million years and activity may have continued into the Holocene. No historical activity is known from Vindication Island. There is no evidence of recent activity nor of any recently active fumaroles.

== Climate and vegetation ==

Vindication Island has a well-developed vegetation, consisting of algae, lichens and mosses. Soils on the island are less permeable than on other islands in the archipelago, allowing more water retention and thus facilitating vegetation growth. The vegetation forms distinct plant communities, with mats and tall turfs. Mites and springtails inhabit the vegetation. 

Numerous bird species breed on Vindication Island, including Antarctic fulmars, cape petrels, chinstrap penguins, macaroni penguins, snow petrels. The penguins are concentrated on Chinstrap Point, where in 1964 60,000-100,000 breeding pairs were observed, while the seabirds nest in cliffs. A survey in 2011 showed that the penguin populations were either stable or increasing. Other animals that visit Vindication Island include Antarctic fur seals, brown skuas, Dominican gulls, elephant seals, leopard seals, shags, Weddel seals and Wilson&#x27;s petrels.

<text>Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) is a class of hangars where U.S. Space Shuttle orbiters underwent maintenance between flights. They are located west of the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the orbiter was mated with its external tank and Solid Rocket Boosters before transport to the launch pad. OPF-1 and OPF-2 are connected with a low bay between them, while OPF-3 is across the street.

OPF-3 was previously called the Orbiter Maintenance &amp; Refurbishment Facility (OMRF), but was upgraded to a fully functioning OPF.

== Processing flow ==
When a Shuttle mission was completed, the orbiter was towed from the Shuttle Landing Facility to its assigned OPF where it spent several months (typically less than 100 days) being prepared for the next mission. Any remaining payloads from the previous mission were removed and the vehicle was fully inspected, tested, and refurbished.

* The orbiter&#x27;s main engines were purged to remove the moisture that was a by-product of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen combustion. 
* payload bay doors were opened and any hazardous payloads were processed for safety
* fuel cell tanks were drained of remaining cryogenic reactants. The oxygen system was rendered inert with gaseous nitrogen and the hydrogen system with gaseous helium.
* high-pressure gases were vented from the environmental control and life support systems.
* refuse and other waste products including draining of the potable water system were offloaded
* heat shields were removed from the engines and aft access were opened 
* main engines were locked in place and covers installed.
* scaffolding was installed around the orbiters aft to allow technicians to access the main engines
* main engines were removed and transferred to the Main Engine Processing Facility for checkout and service
* any needed repairs on the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system including the thermal blankets and the silica tiles were completed. 
* the Orbital Maneuvering System and Reaction Control System pods were possibly removed and transferred to the Hypergol Maintenance Facility for troubleshooting, repair or other services.
* any modifications to the orbiter were completed in the OPF.
* After all its flights, the orbiter went through &quot;Down Mission Processing.&quot;

Prior to rollout to the Vehicle Assembly Building, several weeks before scheduled launch, the orbiter was prepared for the next mission by installing mission flight kits, payloads, consumable fluids and gases where possible. Remaining payloads, fuels and fluids were installed on the pad closer to launch day. The last step before rollover to the VAB was weighing the orbiter to determine its center of gravity.

==Current status==
OPF-1 was closed following &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s rollout on June 29, 2012. OPF-2 is now inactive following &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s departure on October 18, 2012. OPF-3 is under lease to Boeing for the manufacture and testing of their CST-100 Starliner spacecraft.

On 8 October 2014, NASA confirmed that Boeing X-37B vehicles would be housed at Kennedy Space Center in OPF-1 and 2, hangars previously occupied by the Space Shuttle. Boeing had said the space planes would use OPF-1 in January 2014, and the Air Force had previously said it was considering consolidating X-37B operations, housed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, nearer to their launch site at Cape Canaveral. NASA also stated that the program had completed tests to determine whether the X-37B, one-fourth the size of the Space Shuttle, could land on the former Shuttle runways. NASA furthermore stated that renovations of the two hangars would be completed by the end of 2014; the main doors of OPF-1 were marked with the message &quot;Home of the X-37B&quot; by this point.

<text>Jörn Johan Donner (5 February 1933 – 30 January 2020) was a Finnish writer, film director, actor, producer, politician and founder of Finnish Film Archive. He produced Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, which won four Academy Awards in 1984. Donner also served in the Finnish parliament and the European Parliament, making significant contributions to both cinema and politics.

==Biography==
Born into the Finland-Swedish Donner family of German descent, Jörn Donner was the son of the linguist Kai Donner and the grandson of linguist and politician Otto Donner.

He lived and worked for long periods in Sweden, and served as director of the Swedish Film Institute. In 1979, he was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival. Internationally Jörn Donner was best known as the producer of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (, 1982). In 1984 the movie won a total of four Academy Awards including the award for best foreign language film, making him to date the only Finn to receive an Oscar. His novel (&quot;Father and Son&quot;) won the Finlandia Prize in 1985.

Donner was associated with several different political parties, such as SDP and RKP, and was at different times a member both of the Finnish parliament and the European Parliament. he was again a member of the Finnish parliament for a short while, after Eva Biaudet resigned to take a position at the OSCE.

Donner suffered from prostate and lung cancers. He died of lung disease at Meilahti hospital in Helsinki on 30 January 2020, six days before his 87th birthday. After his death, an archive of thousands of photographs was discovered at his home, showing that Donner was also a skilled photographer. In 2023, Donner&#x27;s widow revealed that she had thrown his ashes in the compost after discovering his history of infidelity.

<text>Alewife station is a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) intermodal transit station in the North Cambridge neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the northwest terminal of the rapid transit Red Line (part of the MBTA subway system) and a hub for several MBTA bus routes. The station is at the confluence of the Minuteman Bikeway, Alewife Linear Park, Fitchburg Cutoff Path, and Alewife Greenway off Alewife Brook Parkway adjacent to Massachusetts Route 2, with a five-story parking garage for park and ride use. The station has three bike cages. Alewife station is named after nearby Alewife Brook Parkway and Alewife Brook, themselves named after the alewife fish.

The Fitchburg Railroad (now the MBTA Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line) opened through North Cambridge in 1842, followed by the now-closed Lexington Branch and Fitchburg Cutoff branch lines. An extension of the 1912-opened Cambridge–Dorchester line to North Cambridge was first proposed in the 1930s, though planning for the project did not begin until the 1960s. The Red Line Northwest Extension project included a station at Alewife Brook Parkway to capture traffic from Route 2, as a planned extension of the highway was cancelled in 1970. Construction began in 1979; with the planned route to Arlington Heights rejected by Arlington, Alewife became the terminus of the extension.

Alewife station opened on March 30, 1985, though some peak-hour service did not run to the station until that December. The station has a single underground island platform, with a busway and glass-roofed fare lobby inside the parking garage. Ramps connecting the garage to Route 2 opened in 1986. The station spurred transit-oriented development on formerly industrial land in the surrounding area. The MBTA plans to replace the aging parking garage with new development in the late 2020s. The station features six works of public art built under the Arts on the Line program.

==Station layout==

Alewife station has one underground island platform serving two tracks. Both tracks are used for boarding and alighting; a scissors crossover east of the station allows arriving and departing trains to switch tracks. A three-track underground yard extends about northwest past the station for use as layup tracks and overnight storage.

A five-story, 2,733-space parking garage is located just west of the station platform, with vehicle entrance and exit at its northwest side. The first floor of the garage includes a -long enclosed bus platform with bus bays on both sides, as well as two bike cages. Pedestrian entrances to the garage are on the south (Cambridgepark Drive) and west (Steel Place) sides. A below-ground concourse runs east–west under the garage, with ramps to the bus platform. The garage is bisected by an elongated atrium, which has red exhaust pipes on one side to ventilate the bus platform.

East of the garage, the concourse widens into an atrium covered with a glass pyramid, with faregates and access to the platform on the north side. A third bike cage is located on the south side of the glass pyramid, under escalators connecting the atrium to the garage levels. A freestanding headhouse connects to the east end of the platform. Elevators connect both ends of the platform to the fare lobbies, making the station fully accessible. The walls and floors of the station are finished with brown Welsh quarry tiles with granite highlights. The Minuteman Bikeway and Fitchburg Cutoff Path meet at the northwest corner of the garage; the Alewife Linear Park runs along the north side of the garage and past the east headhouse.

===Bus connections===

 MBTA bus routes – – terminate at the busway inside the Alewife garage. The routes serve northwestern suburbs including Arlington, Lexington, and Burlington. Route terminates nearby at Russell Field because is not possible to turn left from Alewife Brook Parkway onto Rindge Avenue, preventing the bus from serving Alewife directly. The bus stop is connected to Alewife by a short spur of the Cambridge Linear Park.

Alewife station is also served by bus routes operated by private carriers:
*The Route 128 Business Council operates shuttle bus services from Alewife to companies along the Route 2 and Route 128 corridors. Seven routes to Waltham and Lexington are open to all riders; one private residential route is also run.
*Go Bus (formerly World Wide Bus) operates intercity bus service between Alewife, , and New York City. The service began in October 2010.
== History ==
===Railroads===

The Charlestown Branch Railroad opened from Charlestown to Somerville in October 1839. It was extended to Fresh Pond in West Cambridge in 1842 for ice harvesting. Under the control of Alvah Crocker, the line was extended from West Cambridge to Fitchburg as the Fitchburg Railroad in 1843–1845. Stops on the line included West Cambridge (Brick Yards) at Sherman Street, and Hills Crossing at Brighton Street just over the Belmont border to the west. The Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad (Lexington Branch) opened north from West Cambridge in 1846; the Watertown Branch opened south from West Cambridge in 1849.

In 1870, the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&amp;L) bought the Lexington Branch to prevent it from being a competitor. The B&amp;L constructed a new line from near West Cambridge to Somerville Junction to connect the branch with its mainline. Among the stops on the new line was North Cambridge (North Avenue) at what is now Massachusetts Avenue. The Massachusetts Central Railroad (later Central Massachusetts Railroad) opened in 1881; it paralleled the Fitchburg west of Hills Crossing, then turned slightly north to meet the Lexington Branch at North Cambridge. The B&amp;L was acquired by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) in 1887, followed by the Fitchburg in 1900.

In 1926–27, the B&amp;M built two new sections of track; these allowed the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad to use the Fitchburg mainline east of West Cambridge. On April 24, 1927, passenger service was rerouted over the rebuilt line; the Fitchburg Cutoff (Hills Crossing to Somerville Junction) became freight-only, with North Cambridge and the two other passenger stations on the line closed. Passenger service ended on the Watertown Branch in 1938. Hills Crossing station closed by the mid-1940s, and West Cambridge by the 1960s. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed in 1964 to support suburban rail service. A number of lightly used branch lines were closed by the MBTA, with the Lexington Branch closing in January 1977.

===Planning the Red Line===

By 1922, the Boston Elevated Railway believed that would be the permanent terminus of the Cambridge–Dorchester line; the heavy ridership from the north was expected to be handled by extending rapid transit from Lechmere Square. A 1926 report proposed an extension from Lechmere to North Cambridge via the Southern Division and the Fitchburg Cutoff, with a possible further extension along the Lexington Branch. A northwards extension from Harvard to the North Cambridge/Arlington border was proposed by Cambridge mayor John D. Lynch in 1933 and by then-freshmen state representative Tip O&#x27;Neill in 1936, but was not pursued.

The 1945 Coolidge Commission report – the first major transit planning initiative in the region since 1926 – recommended an extension from Harvard to Arlington Heights via East Watertown. The 1947 revision recommended an extension north to Porter Square instead, with branches along the Fitchburg Railroad to Waltham and the Lexington Branch to Lexington. The 1966 &quot;Program for Mass Transportation&quot; called for an immediate extension to Alewife Brook Parkway (the eastern terminus of the Concord Turnpike) via Porter Square, with possible future extensions to Arlington or Waltham. Original plans called for a subway under Massachusetts Avenue to Porter Square, then a surface route along the Fitchburg Route to Alewife. In the late 1960s, the project was expanded to follow the Lexington Branch to a terminal at Route 128.

By then, highway plans called for the Concord Turnpike (Route 2) to be expanded to eight lanes and extended east along the Fitchburg Line right-of-way to the proposed Inner Belt Expressway. In 1970, then-governor Francis Sargent suspended most highway construction inside Route 128 and created the Boston Transportation Planning Review, which focused on the implementation of new transit routes. This placed increased pressure on a Red Line extension at least as far as a park-and-ride station at Alewife Brook Parkway to handle Route 2 traffic. By the mid-1970s, the project was split into two phases: an all-subway extension to Arlington Heights via Alewife, with a later extension to Route 128.

Three general sites were considered for Alewife station, depending on the alignment of the whole project. Alternatives running via Garden Street or via Porter Square and the Fitchburg mainline were to have a station along the Lexington Branch just north of the Fitchburg mainline. Alternatives using the freight cutoff (via Davis Square or Cotter Square) were to have a station east of Alewife Brook Parkway on the pre-1927 Lexington Branch alignment, or to the south straddling the parkway. The chosen alignment was an all-tunnel route via Porter Square and Davis Square, with the southern station option.

===Construction===

Intended primarily as a park-and-ride facility for suburban commuters, Alewife station was built on a former brickyard adjacent to the terminus of the expressway portion of Route 2. Although largely away from residential and commercial areas, the station was intended to be walkable from East Arlington and North Cambridge. The industrial site was chosen to minimize disruptive land takings. The station was designed by Ellenzweig Associates. After and , Alewife was among the first MBTA stations made accessible during initial construction, rather than by renovation. Alewife station was named for the adjacent Alewife Brook (a tributary of the Mystic River) and Alewife Brook Parkway – themselves named for the alewife, a type of fish long associated with the Massachusetts Bay area.

By the time the Red Line Northwest Extension began construction in 1978, opposition in Arlington and reductions in federal funding had caused the MBTA to choose a shorter alternative with Alewife as the terminus. The Fitchburg Cutoff was abandoned in 1979 to allow construction of the extension. The station was constructed by the Perini Corporation. On January 12, 1981, construction worker Ulysses Lemon was killed in a tank truck explosion on Harvey Street in North Cambridge.

After six years of construction, Alewife was the final station on the extension to open. Revenue service began on March 30, 1985. Because the yard facilities were not complete, only Ashmont trains terminated at Alewife at peak hours; peak-hour Braintree trains ran only to Davis until December 26. Initially expected to cost $78 million to construct, the station ultimately cost $84 million. In 1989, the station was awarded a Federal Design Achievement Award by the National Endowment for the Arts, which stated that the &quot;design surrounds all the activity with excitement and beauty... The entire structure is full of art...&quot;

When the station opened, all road access to the garage was from Alewife Brook Parkway, which forced those driving to the station on Route 2 to use a congested rotary north of the station. The design and construction of roadway improvements trailed that of the Red Line project, complicated by political controversy between Arlington, Belmont, and Cambridge over traffic concerns. The state announced a short-term plan in May 1984, under which the rotary would be replaced with a signalized intersection. A direct ramp from eastbound Route 2 to the garage would be built (following a short section of the former Lexington Branch), with a second ramp from the garage under Alewife Brook Parkway (reusing the Fitchburg Cutoff underpass) to the intersection. Environmental review was completed in August 1984. The $3.5 million project was approved by the MBTA board in June 1985; construction began that September and was completed about a year later.

===Development and trails===

Prior to the construction of Alewife station, the surrounding area was known as the &quot;industrial triangle&quot;; the only nearby development was the 1971-built Rindge Towers. Major development had been proposed in the triangle by Arthur D. Little in the 1960s, and by a 1970 city planning study. The construction of Alewife station resulted in what would later be termed transit-oriented development, with commercial developments replacing struggling industrial sites. The first developments around the station were primarily office buildings and high-tech research and development facilities that flourished in Massachusetts in the 1980s. Developers were attracted to the Alewife area by the large plots of available land, the subway connection to Cambridge and Boston, and the proximity to Route 2. An additional development surrounding the east headhouse was considered in the mid-1980s, but was rejected by the community because it would have added 2,000 parking spaces. Residential developments were built in the Alewife triangle beginning in 2003.

The Alewife Linear Park between Alewife and Davis opened in 1985. The Minuteman Bikeway opened in 1992–93 and was extended a short distance to Alewife in 1998, connecting the northwestern suburbs of Arlington, Lexington, and Bedford to Alewife along the former Lexington Branch right-of-way. Alewife became a major junction point between trails: wider sidewalks along Alewife Brook Parkway to the south were added in the 1990s (later connecting to the Fresh Pond Parkway path and the Watertown Greenway), the Alewife Greenway to the north opened in 2012, and the Fitchburg Cutoff Path to the west opened in 2013. The Minuteman quickly became a popular commuter route, necessitating additional bike storage at Alewife. On September 18, 2008, the MBTA opened two 150-bike parking cages on the ground level of the garage. A third cage was added around 2013 as the MBTA built bike cages at a number of stations.

===Parking garage changes===

By the 2000s, the parking garage frequently filled to capacity. In April 2008, the MBTA said that it did not have funds to add two levels to the parking garage, which would cost $30–35 million and add about 1,300 spaces. The structure was originally designed to support two more levels, but whether the condition of the supports and building codes would still allow this expansion was not clear. In August 2018, the MBTA awarded a $5.7 million contract for garage repairs, which were needed even in the absence of funding for expansion. Work began in September 2018, and the main garage entrances were temporarily closed on October 19, 2019. Phased replacement of the garage elevators and the west platform elevator began in mid-2018 and was completed in September 2020.

On February 4, 2023, a driver crashed their car into an edge barrier of the upper level of the parking garage, causing a piece of concrete to fall onto the glass ceiling of the west fare lobby. One passenger suffered minor injuries. The station was temporarily closed for inspection and repairs; shuttle buses operated between Alewife and Davis. The garage reopened on February 8, except for the top level where the crash occurred; the station reopened using only the east headhouse on February 10. The main lobby reopened on March 27, 2023, along with the top floor of the garage.

In April 2024, the MBTA indicated plans to study future scenarios for the station – including the feasibility of removing the garage – in a five-year spending plan. The MBTA issued a request for proposals in August 2024 for a private developer to demolish the garage and construct new buildings in its place. This may also include redevelopment of about on the north side of the Fitchburg Line west of Alewife Brook Parkway, which is occupied by a commuter rail maintenance facility that will be moved to Iron Horse Park in Billerica. , the MBTA plans to construct an access point near for hi-rail construction vehicles near Alewife from 2026–2028, as the nearest access point is near Charles/MGH station. The tunnel will connect to the Alewife Center access road just north of the Russell Field headhouse.
== Arts on the Line ==

In 1978, the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council began a program entitled Arts on the Line to add public art to new and renovated subway stations. For the Red Line Northwest Extension, 0.5% of the cost of the project was reserved for artworks. They were largely constructed of durable materials like stone and metal, designed to withstand vandalism as well as normal wear and tear for 75 years.

Six of the original twenty artworks are located at Alewife station:
* &quot;Untitled&quot; by Richard Fleischner – A environmental work containing an artificial pond, large granite blocks, decorative pavers, and trees; located south of the garage
* &quot;Alewife Wayside&quot; by David Davison – of abstractly painted blue porcelain tiles on the wall of the south pedestrian ramp to the garage
* &quot;Alewife Cows&quot; by Joel Janowitz – A mural of a false exit to the bus platform with cows grazing in a pasture outside.
* &quot;Untitled&quot; by William Keyser Jr. – Two maple sculptural benches on the ground level of the garage
* &quot;The End of the Red Line&quot; by Alejandro and Moira Siña – 1000 neon art tubes suspended from the ceiling over the north Red Line track
* &quot;Untitled&quot; by Nancy Webb – 100 -square bronze tiles with low relief images of plants and animals found in the Alewife Brook Reservation, scattered throughout the station lobby. The tiles depict &quot;alewives (fish), frogs, song sparrows, dandelions, roses, snakes, toads, herons, and grasshoppers&quot;.

Two additional works at the station were not part of the Arts on the Line program:
* &quot;Sculpture as a Sign&quot; by Toshihiro Katayama – a diameter, thick large stainless steel disk, designed in 1985, that forms the MBTA&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; logo outside the south end of the garage. 
* &quot;The Alewife Reservation Mural Project&quot; by David Fichter – an mural depicting plants and animals found in the Alewife Brook Reservation, located on the south end of the garage. Painted by Fitcher and twelve students (most from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School) in 2004, it was funded by the Friends of Alewife Reservation and the Cambridge Arts Council.

<text>The MCP (Master Control Program) is the operating system of the Burroughs B5000/B5500/B5700 and the B6500 and successors, including the Unisys Clearpath/MCP systems.

MCP was originally written in 1961 in ESPOL (Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language). In the 1970s, MCP was converted to NEWP which was a better structured, more robust, and more secure form of ESPOL.

The MCP was a leader in many areas, including: the first operating system to manage multiple processors, the first commercial implementation of virtual memory, and the first OS written exclusively in a high-level language.

==History==
In 1961, the MCP was the first OS written exclusively in a high-level language (HLL). The Burroughs Large System (B5000 and successors) were unique in that they were designed with the expectation that all software, including system software, would be written in an HLL rather than in assembly language, which was a unique and innovative approach in 1961.

Unlike IBM, which faced hardware competition after the departure of Gene Amdahl, Burroughs software only ever ran on Burroughs hardware due to a lack of compatible third party hardware. For this reason, Burroughs was free to distribute the source code of all software it sold, including the MCP, which was designed with this openness in mind. For example, upgrading required the user to recompile the system software and apply any needed local patches. At the time, this was common practice, and was necessary as it was not unusual for customers (especially large ones, such as the Federal Reserve) to modify the program to fit their specific needs. As a result, a Burroughs Users Group was formed, which held annual meetings and allowed users to exchange their own extensions to the OS and other parts of the system software suite. Many such extensions have found their way into the base OS code over the years, and are now available to all customers. As such, the MCP could be considered one of the earliest open-source projects.

Burroughs was not the first manufacturer to distribute source code and was a late entry to electronic computing (compared to its traditional rivals NCR, IBM, and Univac). Now that MCP runs on commodity hardware, some elements of the MCP based software suite are no longer made available in source form by Unisys.

The MCP was the first commercial OS to provide virtual memory, which has been supported by the Burroughs large systems architecture since its inception. This scheme is unique in the industry, as it stores and retrieves compiler-defined objects rather than fixed-size memory pages, as a consequence of its overall non-von Neumann and uniformly stack-based architecture.

Donald Knuth also had influence during this period, becoming consultant to Burroughs Corporation, joining the Product Planning Department from 1960 to 1968. He refers to “a control program” (presumably the MCP then under development) in his book ‘Fundamental Algorithms’ in section 2.5 on Dynamic Storage Allocation, Knuth claims credit for “The “boundary-tag” method, introduced in Section 2.5, was designed by the author in 1962 for use in a control program for the B5000 computer.”

Unisys stopped producing the hardware in the early 2010s, and the operating system is now run under emulation.

==File system==
The MCP provides a file system with hierarchical directory structures. In early MCP implementations, directory nodes were represented by separate files with directory entries, as other systems did. However, since about 1970, MCP internally uses a &#x27;FLAT&#x27; directory listing all file paths on a volume. This is because opening files by visiting and opening each directory in a file path was inefficient and for a production environment it was found to be better to keep all files in a single directory, even though they retain the hierarchical naming scheme. Programmatically, this makes no difference. The only difference visible to users is that an entity file can have the same name as a directory. For example, &quot;A/B&quot; and &quot;A/B/C&quot; can both exist; &quot;B&quot; can be both a node in a file and a directory.

Files are stored on named volumes, for example &#x27;this/is/a/filename on myvol&#x27;, &#x27;myvol&#x27; being the volume name. This is device independent, since the disk containing &#x27;myvol&#x27; can be moved or copied to different physical disk drives. Disks can also be concatenated so that a single volume can be installed across several drives, as well as mirrored for recoverability of sensitive data. For added flexibility, each program can make volume substitutions, a volume name may be substituted with a primary and secondary alternate name. This is referred to as the process’ FAMILY. For instance, the assignment “FAMILY DISK = USERPACK OTHERWISE SYSPACK” stores files logically designated on volume DISK onto the volume USERPACK and will seek files first on volume USERPACK. If that search has no success, another search for the file is done on volume SYSPACK. DISK is the default volume name if none is specified.

Each file in the system has a set of file attributes. These attributes record all sorts of meta data about a file, most importantly its name and its type (which tells the system how to handle a file, like the more limited four-character file type code on the Macintosh). Other attributes have the file&#x27;s record size (if fixed for commercial applications), the block size (in multiples of records that tells the MCP how many records to read and write in a single physical IO) and an area size in multiples of blocks, which gives the size of disk areas to be allocated as the file expands.

The file type indicates if the file is character data, or source code written in particular languages, binary data, or code files.

Files are protected by the usual security access mechanisms such as public or private, or a file may have a guard file where the owner can specify complex security rules.

Another security mechanism is that code files can only be created by trusted compilers. Malicious programmers cannot create a program and call it a compiler – a program could only be converted to be a compiler by an operator with sufficient privileges with the &#x27;mc&#x27; make compiler operator command.

The MCP implements a Journaling file system, providing fault tolerance in case of disk failure, loss of power, etc. It is not possible to corrupt the file system (except by the operating system or other trusted system software with direct access to its lower layers) .

The file system is case-insensitive and not case-preserving unless quotes are added around the name in which case it is case-sensitive and case-preserving.

==Process management==
MCP processes are called &quot;Jobs&quot; and &quot;Tasks.&quot; A Job contains one or more tasks. Tasks within a job can run sequentially or in parallel. Logic can be implemented at the Job level, typically in the MCP&#x27;s job control language WFL, to control the flow of a job. Once all tasks in a job are complete, the job itself is completed.

An MCP Process goes through a life cycle from the time it enters the system until it leaves. The initial state for a Job is &quot;Queued.&quot; There is a period of time while the Job resides in one of several user defined Job Queues. The next state is &quot;Scheduled&quot; as the Job moves from a queue into memory. Tasks within a job do not wait in queue; instead going directly to the &#x27;Scheduled&#x27; state when initiated. Once a Job or Task is started, it can transition between &quot;Active,&quot; &quot;Waiting&quot; and &quot;Scheduled&quot; as it progresses. Once a Job or Task completes, it moves to the &#x27;Completed&#x27; state.

Running processes are those that use a processor resource and are marked as &#x27;running&#x27;. Processes that are ready to be assigned to a processor, when there is no free processor are placed in the ready queue. Processes may be assigned a “Declared” or “Visible” priority, generally 50 as the default, but can be from 0 to 99 for user processes. System processes may be assigned the higher values. Note that this numerical priority is secondary to an overall priority, which is based on the task type. Processes that are directly part of the operating system, called Independent Runners, have the highest priority regardless of numeric priority value. Next come processes using an MCP lock, then Message Control Systems such as CANDE. Then Discontinued processes. Then Work Flow Language jobs. Finally come user processes. At a lower level, there is a Fine priority intended to elevate the priority of tasks that do not use their full processor slice. This allows an IO bound task to get processor time ahead of a processor bound task on the same declared priority.

Processes that are waiting on other resources, such as a file read, wait on the EVENT data structure. Thus all processes waiting on a single resource wait on a single event. When the resource becomes available, the event is caused, which wakes up all the processes waiting on it. Processes may wait on multiple events for any one of them to happen, including a time out. Events are fully user programmable – that is, users can write systems that use the generalized event system provided by the MCP.

Processes that have terminated are marked as completed.

Operationally, the status of all tasks in the system is displayed to the operator. All running and ready processes are displayed as &#x27;Active&#x27; tasks (since the system implements preemptive multitasking, the change from ready to running and back is so quick that distinguishing ready and running tasks is pointless because they will all get a slice of the processor within a second). All active tasks can be displayed with the &#x27;A&#x27; command.

Terminated tasks are displayed as completed tasks with the reason for termination, EOT for normal &#x27;end of task&#x27;, and DSed with a reason for a process failure. All processes are assigned a mix number, and operators can use this number to identify a process to control. One such command is the DS command (which stands for either Delete from Schedule, DiScontinue, or Deep Six, after the influence of Navy personnel on early computer projects, depending on who you talk to). Tasks terminated by the operator are listed in the complete entries as O-DS.

Tasks can also terminate due to program faults, marked as F-DS or P-DS, for faults such as invalid index, numeric overflow, etc. Completed entries can be listed by the operator with the &#x27;C&#x27; command.

Tasks waiting on a resource are listed under the waiting entries and the reason for waiting. All waiting tasks may be listed with the &#x27;W&#x27; command. The reason for waiting is also listed and more information about a task may be seen with the &#x27;Y&#x27; command. It may be that a task is waiting for operator input, which is sent to a task via the accept &#x27;AX&#x27; command (note that operator input is very different from user input, which would be input from a network device with a GUI interface).

Tasks waiting on user input or file reads would not normally be listed as waiting entries for operator attention. Another reason for a task to be waiting is waiting on a file. When a process opens a file, and the file is not present, the task is placed in the waiting entries, noting that it is waiting on a certain file. An operator (or the user that owns the process) has the opportunity either to copy the file to the expected place, or to redirect the task to read the file from another place, or the file might even be created by an independent process that hasn&#x27;t yet completed.

If the resource cannot be provided by the operator, the operator can DS the task as a last resort. This is different from other systems, which automatically terminate a task when a resource such as a file is not available. The MCP provides this level of operator recoverability of tasks. Other systems force programmers to add code to check for the presence of files before accessing them, and thus extra code must be written in every case to provide recoverability, or process synchronization. Such code may be written in an MCP program when it is not desirable to have a task wait, but because of the operator-level recoverability, this is not forced and therefore makes programming much simpler.

In addition to the ability to dynamically remap file (or database) requests to other files (or databases), before or during program execution, several mechanisms are available to allow programmers to detect and recover from errors. One way, an &#x27;ON&#x27; statement, has been around for many years. Specific faults (e.g., divide by zero) can be listed, or the catch-all &#x27;anyfault&#x27; can be used. The statement or block following the &#x27;ON&#x27; statement is recognized by the compiler as fault-handling code. During execution, if a recoverable fault occurs in scope of the &#x27;on&#x27; statement, the stack is cut back and control transferred to the statement following it.

One problem with the handling logic behind the ON statement was that it would only be invoked for program faults, not for program terminations having other causes. Over time, the need for guaranteed handling of abnormal terminations grew. In particular, a mechanism was needed to allow programs to invoke plug-ins written by customers or third parties without any risk should the plug-in behave badly. In addition to general plug-in mechanisms, the new form of dynamic library linkage (Connection Libraries) allows programs to import and export functions and data, and hence one program runs code supplied by another.

To accomplish such enhanced protection, a newer mechanism was introduced in the mid 1990s. In a misguided attempt at compatibility, it was named after the then-proposed C++ language construct of the same name. Because the syntax and behavior of the two differ to such a large extent, choosing the same name has only led to confusion and misunderstanding.

Syntactically, &#x27;try&#x27; statements look like &#x27;if&#x27; statements: &#x27;try&#x27;, followed by a statement or block, followed by &#x27;else&#x27; and another statement or block. Additional &#x27;else&#x27; clauses may follow the first. During execution, if any recoverable termination occurs in the code following the &#x27;try&#x27; clause, the stack is cut back if required, and control branches to the code following the first &#x27;else&#x27;. In addition, attributes are set to allow the program to determine what happened and where (including the specific line number).

Most events that would result in task termination are recoverable. This includes stack overflow, array access out-of-bounds, integer over/under flow, etc. Operator (or user) DS is not recoverable except by privileged tasks using an UNSAFE form of try.

MCP thus provides a very fault-tolerant environment, not the crash-and-burn core-dump of other systems.

As with file attributes, tasks have attributes as well, such as the task priority (which is assigned at compile time or execution time, or can be changed while the task is running), processor time, wait time, status, etc. These task attributes can be accessed programmatically as can file attributes of files. The parent task is available programmatically as a task attribute that is of type task. For example, &#x27;myself.initiator.name&#x27; gives the name of the process that initiated the current process.

codice_1 and codice_2 are the two main procedures handling memory allocation and deallocation. Memory needs to be allocated at process initiation and whenever a block is entered that uses arrays, files, etc. codice_1 and codice_2 not only handle memory space, they also allocate or deallocate the disk space where non memory resident data may be overlaid. Memory may be SAVE (i.e., memory resident), OVERLAYABLE (i.e., virtual memory) or STICKY (meaning memory resident, but movable). They are called upon e.g. by codice_5 when a process addresses an uninitialized array or by codice_6.

codice_5 handles hardware interrupts and may call upon codice_1, codice_9 or the like.

codice_10 is called upon by a task exiting a block. BLOCKEXIT may in turn call codice_11, codice_2 or the like while cleaning up and releasing resources declared and used within that block.

J_EDGAR_HOOVER is the main security guardian of the system, called upon at process start, file open, user log on, etc.

codice_13 is the procedure that decides which process is the next one to receive CPU resources and is thus one of the few processes that uses the MoveStack instruction.

A task goes through various states starting with NASCENT. At DELIVERY the event BIRTH is caused and the task&#x27;s state changes to ALIVE. When PROCESSKILL is called upon, the state changes into DISEASED. When DEATH is caused the task gets put into the queue structure the MORGUE, after which all remaining resources are freed to the system by a process called PROCESSKILL.

While the task is ALIVE, MCP functions are run on top of that particular process, thus CPU resources are automatically charged to the task causing the MCP overhead. Also, much of the MCP work is being performed with that particular stack&#x27;s security rights. Only before BIRTH and after DEATH does the MCP need to be operating out of some other stack. If none is available, the system maintains an idle stack.

==Software components and libraries==
MCP libraries provide a way of sharing data and code between processes. The article on Burroughs large systems looks at the way dependent processes could be asynchronously run so that many processes could share common data (with the mechanisms to provide synchronized update). Such a family of related processes had to be written as a single program unit, processing procedures at higher lex levels as the asynchronous processes, which could still access global variables and other variables at lower lex levels.

Libraries completely inverted this scenario with the following advantages:

* Libraries and independent processes are written as independent programming units
* Libraries completely controlled access to shared resources (data encapsulation and hiding)
* Libraries and clients could be written in different languages
* Process switching was not required to safely access data

So clean and radical was the library mechanism that much system software underwent major rewrites resulting in a better structured systems and performance boosts.

Libraries were introduced to MCP systems in the early 1980s, having been developed by Roy Guck and others at Burroughs. They are very much like C. A. R. Hoare&#x27;s monitors and provide the opportunity for controlled mutual exclusion and synchronization between client processes, using MCP EVENTs and the Dahm locking technique. Libraries offer procedural entry-points to the client, which are checked for a compatible interface (all parameters and return types of imported procedures checked) before the client is linked to the library. The library and its client may be written in different languages. The advantage is that all synchronization is provided in the library and client code does not need to worry about this level of programming at all. This results in robust code since clients can&#x27;t undermine the synchronization code in the library. (Some would call this a &#x27;Trusted Computing Initiative&#x27;.)

Libraries are more sophisticated forms of libraries on other systems such as DLLs. MCP libraries can be &#x27;shared by all&#x27;, ‘shared by rununit’ or &#x27;private&#x27;. The private case is closest to libraries on other systems – for each client a separate copy of the library is invoked and there is no data sharing between processes.

Shared by all is more interesting. When a client starts up, it can run for a while until it requires the services in the library. Upon first reference of a library entry-point, the linkage is initiated. If an instance of the library is already running, the client is then linked to that instance of the library. All clients share the same instance.

Shared by rununit is a sharing mechanism in between these two sharing schemes. It was designed specifically for COBOL, where a rununit is defined as the original initiating client program and all the libraries it has linked to. Each rununit gets one instance of the library and different rununits get a different instance. This is the only dynamic implementation of COBOL rununits.

If this was the first invocation of the library, the library would run its main program (outer block in an ALGOL program) to initialize its global environment. Once initialization was complete, it would execute a freeze, at which point all exported entry points would be made available to clients. At this point, the library&#x27;s stack was said to be frozen since nothing more would be run on this stack until the library became unfrozen, in which case clean-up and termination code would be run. When a client calls a routine in a library, that routine runs on top of the client stack, storing its locals and temporary variables there. This allows many clients to be running the same routine at the same time, being synchronized by the library routine, which accesses the data in the global environment of the library stack.

Freeze could also be in three forms – temporary, permanent and controlled. Temporary meant that once the client count dropped to zero, the library would be unfrozen and terminated. Permanent meant that the library remained available for further clients even if the client count dropped to zero – permanent libraries could be unfrozen by an operator with a THAW command. A controlled freeze meant that the library actually kept running, so that it could execute monitoring functions and perform data initialization and cleanup functions for each linking client.

Libraries could also be accessed &#x27;by title&#x27; and &#x27;by function&#x27;. In &#x27;by title&#x27; the client specified the file name of the library. &#x27;By function&#x27; was an indirect method where a client would just specify the function name of the library, for example &#x27;system_support&#x27; and the actual location of the library is found in a table previously set up by an operator with &#x27;SL&#x27; (system library) commands, for example &#x27;SL system_support = *system/library/support&#x27;. MCP&#x27;s fault tolerant attitude also works here – if a client tries accessing a library that is not present, the client is put in the &#x27;waiting&#x27; tasks and the library could be made present, or the request redirected.

Libraries can also be updated on the fly, all that needs to be done is to &#x27;SL&#x27; the new version. Running clients will continue to use the old version until they terminate and new clients will be directed to the new version.

Function libraries also implemented a very important security feature, linkage classes. All normal libraries have a linkage class of zero. Libraries used by the MCP or other privileged system modules may not be usable from normal programs. They are accessed by function and forced in linkage class one. A client in linkage class zero cannot link to linkage class one entry-points. A library with linkage class one that needs to offer entry-points to normal programs can do so if it is designated as ‘trusted’. It can offer selected entry-points in linkage class zero.

The entire database system is implemented with libraries providing very efficient and tailored access to databases shared between many clients. The same goes for all networking functionality and system intrinsics.

In the mid-1990s a new type of library was made available: Connection Libraries. These are programs in their own right that can execute independently as well as import and export data and functions to other programs in arrays of structure blocks. For example, the networking component of the operating system is available as a connection library, allowing other programs to use its services by exporting and importing functions. Upon linkage, each client gets a dedicated structure block to keep state information in. A program that uses the network might import a network-write function and export a network-read function. Thus, if you open a network connection (e.g., using TCP), when data arrives for you to read, the networking component can directly call your function to consume it, without having to first copy the data to a buffer and do a context switch. Likewise, you can write data to the network by directly calling a network-write function.

Connection Libraries allow a significant degree of control over linkages. Each side of a linkage can optionally approve a linkage and can sever the linkage as desired. State can be easily maintained per linkage as well as globally.

==Port files==
Another technique for inter-process communication (IPC) is port files. They are like Unix pipes, except that they are generalized to be multiway and bidirectional. Since these are an order of magnitude slower than other IPC techniques such as libraries, it is better to use other techniques where the IPC is between different processes on the same machine.

The most advantageous use of port files is therefore for distributed IPC. Port files were introduced with BNA (Burroughs Network Architecture), but with the advent of standard networking technologies such as OSI and TCP/IP, port files can be used with these networks as well.

A server listening for incoming connections declares a port file (a file with the KIND attribute equal to PORT). Each connection that is made from a client creates a subfile with an index, so each port file represents multiple connections to different clients around the network.

A server process receives client requests from anywhere on the network by issuing a read on the port file (subfile = 0 to read from any subfile). It issues a response to the client that issued the request by writing to the particular subfile from which the request was read.

==Operating environment==
The MCP also provides a sophisticated yet simple operator environment. For large installations, many operators might be required to make physical resources, such as printers (loading paper, toner cartridges, etc.) available. Low-end environments for small offices or single user may require an operator-free environment (especially the laptop implementation).

Large systems have dedicated operations terminals called ODTs (Operator Display Terminals), usually kept in a secure environment. For small systems, machines can be controlled from any terminal (provided the terminal and user have sufficient privileges) using the MARC program (Menu Assisted Resource Control). Operator commands can also be used by users familiar with them.

Operator commands are mostly two letters (as with Unix), and some are just one letter. This means that the operator interface must be learned, but it is very efficient for experienced operators who run a large mainframe system from day to day. Commands are case insensitive.

Tasks are entered in the program &#x27;mix&#x27; and identified by mix numbers, as are libraries. To execute a program, operators can use the &#x27;EX&#x27; or &#x27;RUN&#x27; command followed by the file name of the program. ODTs are run typically with ADM (Automatic Display Mode), which is a tailorable display of system status usually set up to display the active, waiting, and completed mix entries, as well as system messages to the operator for notifications or situations requiring operator action.

Complete listing of these displays are given by the &#x27;A&#x27; (active), &#x27;W&#x27; (waiting), &#x27;C&#x27; (completed), and &#x27;MSG&#x27; (message commands).

If a task becomes waiting on some operator action, the operator can find out what the task needs by entering its mix number followed by the &#x27;Y&#x27; command. (Note the object-oriented style of commands, selecting the object first, followed by the command.) For example, &#x27;3456Y&#x27;.

An operator can force a task into the waiting entries with the stop command &#x27;3456ST&#x27; and make it active again with OK: &#x27;3456OK&#x27;. The OK command can also be used when an operator has made a resource available for a task, although more frequently than not, the MCP will detect that resources have become available, CAUSE the EVENT that processes have been waiting on without further operator intervention. To pass textual information from an operator to a program, the accept command ‘3456AX MORE INFO’ can be used. Programs can pass information to operators using the DISPLAY mechanism, which causes DISPLAY messages to be added to the MSG display.

As well as tasks and processes, operators also have control over files. Files can be listed using the FILE command, copied using COPY, removed using REMOVE, and renamed.

The operating environment of the MCP is powerful, yet simple and usually only requires a fraction of the number of operators of other systems.

An important part of the operations environment is the high-level Work Flow Language.

==Logging==
All actions in the system are logged, for example all messages displayed to the operator, and all operator actions. All significant program actions are optionally logged in a system log and a program log, for example BOJ for beginning of a WFL job, BOT for beginning of a task within a WFL job, EOT and EOJ for end of tasks and jobs. As well, all file and database open and closes can be logged. Logging many events contributes to an apparent slowness of the MCP operating environment compared to systems like Unix, since everything is logged with forced physical writes to the program log after every record, which is what systems like Unix don&#x27;t do, even though they too keep many things in the system logs.

The logs can be used for forensics to find out why programs or systems may have failed, or for detecting attempts to compromise system security. System logs are automatically closed after a system-settable period and a new one opened. System logs contain a huge amount of information, which can be filtered and analyzed with programs such as LOGANALYZER.

The DUMPANALYZER analyzes memory dumps that were originally written to tape. As all compilers added LINEINFO into the code-files, the DUMPANALYZER is able to pinpoint exactly which source statement was being executed at the time of error.

Also a normal program dump, where just one program was dumped, contains information on source-code sequence number and variable names.

The two analyzers are major diagnostic tools for all kinds of purposes.

==Innovations==
Beyond the many technical innovations in the MCP design, the Burroughs Large Systems had many management innovations now being used by the internet community at large. The system software was shipped to customers inclusive of source code and all the editing and compilation tools needed to generate new versions of MCP for customers. Many customers developed niche expertise on the inner workings of the MCP, and customers often sent in the &#x27;patches&#x27; (fragment pieces of source code with sequence numbers) as suggestions of new enhanced features or fault corrections (FTR - field trouble reports). Many of the suggested patches were included by the systems developers and integrated into the next version of the MCP release. Including a community of voluntary, self-professed experts, into mainstream technical work, is now widely practised and is the essence of open innovation. This management innovation of community development dated back to the 1970s.

==Compilers==
Unisys MCP has had several generations of compilers in its history supporting a wide variety of programming languages, including:
*ALGOL, including DCALGOL, BDMSALGOL and DMALGOL.
*C
*COBOL which includes COBOL74 and COBOL85 
*Fortran77 
*NEWP 
*Pascal 
*RPG

Other products include:

*Binder
*Network Definition Language
*Work Flow Language 

Compilers previously existed for ESPOL, COBOL(68), Fortran(66), APL, and PL/I.

===Assembler===
There is no assembler on the Unisys MCP operating system.

==Summary==
The MCP was the first OS developed exclusively in a high-level language. Over its 50-year history, it has had many firsts in a commercial implementation, including virtual memory, symmetric multiprocessing, and a high-level job control language (WFL). It has long had many facilities that are only now appearing in other widespread operating systems, and together with the Burroughs large systems architecture, the MCP provides a , high performance, multitasking and transaction processing environment.

<text>The Dirigible/Balloon Pilot Insignia was a military decoration of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps that was issued to those service members who received training and qualification as dirigible pilots. The badge first appeared in Navy Uniform Regulations in 1922, during which time the Navy was experimenting with lighter-than-air craft, as opposed to conventional, fixed-wing aircraft.

The Dirigible/Balloon Pilot Insignia was issued well into the 1970s, with occasional awards, on a case-by-case basis, to the end of the 20th century. The 1978 U.S. Navy Uniform Regulations removed the Dirigible/Balloon Pilot Insignia from the authorized list of aviation breast insignia. Although the Dirigible/Balloon Pilot Insignia is considered obsolete, it may still be found on various insignia and badge charts promulgated through U.S. Navy instructions and publications.

The Dirigible/Balloon Pilot Insignia appears as a &quot;half-wing&quot; version of the Naval Aviator Badge. Its design was based on early versions of the Observer Badge.

<doc id="966255" wikidata="Q1038171" url="?curid=966255" title="Participatory design">
<text>Participatory design (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is an approach to design attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style. The term is used in a variety of fields e.g. software design, urban design, architecture, landscape architecture, product design, sustainability, graphic design, industrial design, planning, and health services development as a way of creating environments that are more responsive and appropriate to their inhabitants&#x27; and users&#x27; cultural, emotional, spiritual and practical needs. It is also one approach to placemaking.

Recent research suggests that designers create more innovative concepts and ideas when working within a co-design environment with others than they do when creating ideas on their own. Companies increasingly rely on their user communities to generate new product ideas, marketing them as &quot;user-designed&quot; products to the wider consumer market; consumers who are not actively participating but observe this user-driven approach show a preference for products from such firms over those driven by designers. This preference is attributed to an enhanced identification with firms adopting a user-driven philosophy, consumers experiencing empowerment by being indirectly involved in the design process, leading to a preference for the firm&#x27;s products. If consumers feel dissimilar to participating users, especially in demographics or expertise, the effects are weakened. Additionally, if a user-driven firm is only selectively open to user participation, rather than fully inclusive, observing consumers may not feel socially included, attenuating the identified preference.

Participatory design has been used in many settings and at various scales. For some, this approach has a political dimension of user empowerment and democratization. This inclusion of external parties in the design process does not excuse designers of their responsibilities. In their article &quot;Participatory Design and Prototyping&quot;, Wendy Mackay and Michel Beaudouin-Lafon support this point by stating that &quot;[a] common misconception about participatory design is that designers are expected to abdicate their responsibilities as designers and leave the design to users. This is never the case: designers must always consider what users can and cannot contribute.&quot;

In several Scandinavian countries, during the 1960s and 1970s, participatory design was rooted in work with trade unions; its ancestry also includes action research and sociotechnical design.

==Definition==

In participatory design, participants (putative, potential or future) are invited to cooperate with designers, researchers and developers during an innovation process. Co-design requires the end user&#x27;s participation: not only in decision making but also in idea generation. Potentially, they participate during several stages of an innovation process: they participate during the initial exploration and problem definition both to help define the problem and to focus ideas for solution, and during development, they help evaluate proposed solutions. Maarten Pieters and Stefanie Jansen describe co-design as part of a complete co-creation process, which refers to the &quot;transparent process of value creation in ongoing, productive collaboration with, and supported by all relevant parties, with end-users playing a central role&quot; and covers all stages of a development process.

===Differing terms===
In &quot;Co-designing for Society&quot;, Deborah Szebeko and Lauren Tan list various precursors of co-design, starting with the Scandinavian participatory design movement and then state &quot;Co-design differs from some of these areas as it includes all stakeholders of an issue not just the users, throughout the entire process from research to implementation.&quot;

In contrast, Elizabeth Sanders and Pieter Stappers state that &quot;the terminology used until the recent obsession with what is now called co-creation/co-design&quot; was &quot;participatory design&quot;. They also discuss the differences between co-design and co-creation and how they are &quot;often confused and/or treated synonymously with one another&quot;. In their words, &quot;Co-creation is a very broad term with applications ranging from the physical to the metaphysical and from the material to the spiritual&quot;, while seeing &quot;co-design [as] a specific instance of co-creation&quot;. Pulling from the idea of what co-creation is, the definition of co-design in the context of their paper developed into &quot;the creativity of designers and people not trained in design working together in the design development process&quot;. Another term brought up in this article front end design, which was formerly known as pre-design. &quot;The goal of the explorations in the front end is to determine what is to be designed and sometimes what should not be designed and manufactured&quot; and provides a space for the initial stages of co-design to take place.

An alternate definition of co-design has been brought up by Maria Gabriela Sanchez and Lois Frankel. They proposed that &quot;Co-design may be considered, for the purpose of this study, as an interdisciplinary process that involves designers and non-designers in the development of design solutions&quot; and that &quot;the success of the interdisciplinary process depends on the participation of all the stakeholders in the project&quot;.

&quot;Co-design is a perfect example of interdisciplinary work, where designer, researcher, and user work collaboratively in order to reach a common goal. The concept of interdisciplinarity, however, becomes broader in this context where it not only results from the union of different academic disciplines, but from the combination of different perspectives on a problem or topic.&quot;

=== Fourth Order Design ===
Similarly, another perspective comes from Golsby-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Order Design&quot; which outlines a design process in which end-user participation is required and favours individual process over outcome. Buchanan&#x27;s definition of culture as a verb is a key part of Golsby-Smith&#x27;s argument in favour of fourth order design. In Buchanan&#x27;s words, &quot;Culture is not a state, expressed in an ideology or a body of doctrines. It is an activity. Culture is the activity of ordering, disordering and reordering in the search for understanding and for values which guide action.&quot; Therefore, to design for the fourth-order one must design within the widest scope. The system is discussion and the focus falls onto process rather than outcome. The idea that culture and people are an integral part of participatory design is supported by the idea that a &quot;key feature of the field is that it involves people or communities: it is not merely a mental place or a series of processes&quot;. &quot;Just as a product is not only a thing, but exists within a series of connected processes, so these processes do not live in a vacuum, but move through a field of less tangible factors such as values, beliefs and the wider context of other contingent processes.&quot;

=== Different dimensions ===
As described by Sanders and Stappers, one could position co-design as a form of human-centered design across two different dimensions. One dimension is the emphasis on research or design, another dimension is how much people are involved. Therefore, there are many forms of co-design, with different degrees of emphasis on research or design and different degrees of stakeholder involvement. For instance, one of the forms of co-design which involves stakeholders strongly early at the front end design process in the creative activities is generative co-design. Generative co-design is increasingly being used to involve different stakeholders as patient, care professionals and designers actively in the creative making process to develop health services.

Another dimension to consider is that of the crossover between design research and education. An example of this is a study that was completed at the Middle East Technical University in Turkey, the purpose of which was to look into the use of “team development [in] enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration between design and engineering students using design thinking”. The students in this study were tasked with completing a group project and reporting on the experience of working together. One of the main takeaways was that &quot;Interdisciplinary collaboration is an effective way to address complex problems with creative solutions. However, a successful collaboration requires teams first to get ready to work in harmony towards a shared goal and to appreciate interdisciplinarity&quot;

==History==

From the 1960s onward there was a growing demand for greater consideration of community opinions in major decision-making. In Australia many people believed that they were not being planned &#x27;for&#x27; but planned &#x27;at&#x27;. (Nichols 2009). A lack of consultation made the planning system seem paternalistic and without proper consideration of how changes to the built environment affected its primary users. In Britain &quot;the idea that the public should participate was first raised in 1965.&quot; However the level of participation is an important issue. At a minimum public workshops and hearings have now been included in almost every planning endeavour. Yet this level of consultation can simply mean information about change without detailed participation. Involvement that &#x27;recognises an active part in plan making&#x27; has not always been straightforward to achieve. Participatory design has attempted to create a platform for active participation in the design process, for end users.

===History in Scandinavia===

Participatory design was actually born in Scandinavia and called &quot;cooperative design&quot;. However, when the methods were presented to the US community &#x27;cooperation&#x27; was a word that didn&#x27;t resonate with the strong separation between workers and managers - they weren&#x27;t supposed to discuss ways of working face-to-face. Hence, &#x27;participatory&#x27; was instead used as the initial Participatory Design sessions weren&#x27;t a direct cooperation between workers and managers, sitting in the same room discussing how to improve their work environment and tools, but there were separate sessions for workers and managers. Each group was participating in the process, not directly cooperating. (in historical review of Cooperative Design, at a Scandinavian conference).

In Scandinavia, research projects on user participation in systems development date back to the 1970s. The so-called &quot;collective resource approach&quot; developed strategies and techniques for workers to influence the design and use of computer applications at the workplace: The Norwegian Iron and Metal Workers Union (NJMF) project took a first move from traditional research to working with people, directly changing the role of the union clubs in the project.

The Scandinavian projects developed an action research approach, emphasizing active co-operation between researchers and workers of the organization to help improve the latter&#x27;s work situation. While researchers got their results, the people whom they worked with were equally entitled to get something out of the project. The approach built on people&#x27;s own experiences, providing for them resources to be able to act in their current situation. The view of organizations as fundamentally harmonious—according to which conflicts in an organization are regarded as pseudo-conflicts or &quot;problems&quot; dissolved by good analysis and increased communication—was rejected in favor of a view of organizations recognizing fundamental &quot;un-dissolvable&quot; conflicts in organizations (Ehn &amp; Sandberg, 1979).

In the Utopia project (Bødker et al., 1987, Ehn, 1988), the major achievements were the experience-based design methods, developed through the focus on hands-on experiences, emphasizing the need for technical and organizational alternatives (Bødker et al., 1987).

The parallel Florence project (Gro Bjerkness &amp; Tone Bratteteig) started a long line of Scandinavian research projects in the health sector. In particular, it worked with nurses and developed approaches for nurses to get a voice in the development of work and IT in hospitals. The Florence project put gender on the agenda with its starting point in a highly gendered work environment.

The 1990s led to a number of projects including the AT project (Bødker et al., 1993) and the EureCoop/EuroCode projects (Grønbæk, Kyng &amp; Mogensen, 1995).

In recent years, it has been a major challenge to participatory design to embrace the fact that much technology development no longer happens as design of isolated systems in well-defined communities of work (Beck, 2002). At the dawn of the 21st century, we use technology at work, at home, in school, and while on the move.

== Co-design ==
As mentioned above, one definition of co-design states that it is the process of working with one or more non-designers throughout the design process. This method is focused on the insights, experiences and input from end-users on a product or service, with the aim to develop strategies for improvement. It is often used by trained designers who recognize the difficulty in properly understanding the cultural, societal, or usage scenarios encountered by their user. C. K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy are usually given credit for bringing co-creation/co-design to the minds of those in the business community with the 2004 publication of their book, The Future of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value with Customers. They propose:

The phrase co-design is also used in reference to the simultaneous development of interrelated software and hardware systems. The term co-design has become popular in mobile phone development, where the two perspectives of hardware and software design are brought into a co-design process.

Results directly related to integrating co-design into existing frameworks is &quot;researchers and practitioners have seen that co-creation practiced at the early front end of the design development process can have an impact with positive, long-range consequences.&quot;

=== New role of the designer under co-design ===
Co-design is an attempt to define a new evolution of the design process and with that, there is an evolution of the designer. Within the co-design process, the designer is required to shift their role from one of expertise to one of an egalitarian mindset. The designer must believe that all people are capable of creativity and problem solving. The designer no longer exists from the isolated roles of researcher and creator, but now must shift to roles such as philosopher and facilitator. This shift allows for the designer to position themselves and their designs within the context of the world around them creating better awareness. This awareness is important because in the designer&#x27;s attempt to answer a question, &quot;[they] must address all other related questions about values, perceptions, and worldview&quot;. Therefore, by shifting the role of the designer not only do the designs better address their cultural context yet so do the discussions around them.

==Discourses==
Discourses in the PD literature have been sculpted by three main concerns: (1) the politics of design, (2) the nature of participation, and (3) methods, tools and techniques for carrying out design projects (Finn Kensing &amp; Jeanette Blomberg, 1998, p. 168).

=== Politics of design ===
The politics of design have been the concern for many design researchers and practitioners. Kensing and Blomberg illustrate the main concerns which related to the introduction of new frameworks such as system design which related to the introduction of computer-based systems and power dynamics that emerge within the workspace. The automation introduced by system design has created concerns within unions and workers as it threatened their involvement in production and their ownership over their work situation. Asaro (2000) offers a detailed analysis of the politics of design and the inclusion of &quot;users&quot; in the design process.

=== Nature of participation ===
Major international organizations such as Project for Public Spaces create opportunities for rigorous participation in the design and creation of place, believing that it is the essential ingredient for successful environments. Rather than simply consulting the public, PPS creates a platform for the community to participate and co-design new areas, which reflect their intimate knowledge. Providing insights, which independent design professionals such as architects or even local government planners may not have.

Using a method called Place Performance Evaluation or (Place Game), groups from the community are taken on the site of proposed development, where they use their knowledge to develop design strategies, which would benefit the community.
&quot;Whether the participants are schoolchildren or professionals, the exercise produces dramatic results because it relies on the expertise of people who use the place every day, or who are the potential users of the place.&quot; This successfully engages with the ultimate idea of participatory design, where various stakeholders who will be the users of the end product, are involved in the design process as a collective.

Similar projects have had success in Melbourne, Australia particularly in relation to contested sites, where design solutions are often harder to establish. The Talbot Reserve in the suburb of St. Kilda faced numerous problems of use, such as becoming a regular spot for sex workers and drug users to congregate. A Design In, which incorporated a variety of key users in the community about what they wanted for the future of the reserve allowed traditionally marginalised voices to participate in the design process. Participants described it as &#x27;a transforming experience as they saw the world through different eyes.&#x27; (Press, 2003, p. 62). This is perhaps the key attribute of participatory design, a process which, allows multiple voices to be heard and involved in the design, resulting in outcomes which suite a wider range of users. It builds empathy within the system and users where it is implemented, which makes solving larger problems more holistically. As planning affects everyone it is believed that &quot;those whose livelihoods, environments and lives are at stake should be involved in the decisions which affect them&quot; (Sarkissian and Perglut, 1986, p. 3). C. West Churchman said systems thinking &quot;begins when first you view the world through the eyes of another&quot;.

=== In the built environment ===

Participatory design has many applications in development and changes to the built environment. It has particular currency to planners and architects, in relation to placemaking and community regeneration projects. It potentially offers a far more democratic approach to the design process as it involves more than one stakeholder. By incorporating a variety of views there is greater opportunity for successful outcomes. Many universities and major institutions are beginning to recognise its importance. The UN, Global studio involved students from Columbia University, University of Sydney and Sapienza University of Rome to provide design solutions for Vancouver&#x27;s downtown eastside, which suffered from drug- and alcohol-related problems. The process allowed cross-discipline participation from planners, architects and industrial designers, which focused on collaboration and the sharing of ideas and stories, as opposed to rigid and singular design outcomes. (Kuiper, 2007, p. 52)

==== Public interest design ====

Public interest design is a design movement, extending to architecture, with the main aim of structuring design around the needs of the community. At the core of its application is participatory design. Through allowing individuals to have a say in the process of design of their own surrounding built environment, design can become proactive and tailored towards addressing wider social issues facing that community. Public interest design is meant to reshape conventional modern architectural practice. Instead of having each construction project solely meet the needs of the individual, public interest design addresses wider social issues at their core. This shift in architectural practice is a structural and systemic one, allowing design to serve communities responsibly. Solutions to social issues can be addressed in a long-term manner through such design, serving the public, and involving it directly in the process through participatory design. The built environment can become the very reason for social and community issues to arise if not executed properly and responsibly. Conventional architectural practice often does cause such problems since only the paying client has a say in the design process. That is why many architects throughout the world are employing participatory design and practicing their profession more responsibly, encouraging a wider shift in architectural practice. Several architects have largely succeeded in disproving theories that deem public interest design and participatory design financially and organizationally not feasible. Their work is setting the stage for the expansion of this movement, providing valuable data on its effectiveness and the ways in which it can be carried out.

== Difficulties of adoption and involvement ==
Participatory Design is a growing practice within the field of design yet has not yet been widely implemented. Some barriers to the adoption of participatory design are listed below.

=== Doubt of universal creativity ===
A belief that creativity is a restricted skill would invalidate the proposal of participatory design to allow a wider reach of affected people to participate in the creative process of designing. However, this belief is based on a limited view of creativity which does not recognize that creativity can manifest in a wide range of activities and experiences. This doubt can be damaging not only to individuals but also to society as a whole. By assuming that only a select few possess creative talent, we may overlook the unique perspectives, ideas, and solutions.

=== Lack of technology in software based co-op design ===

Often co-op based design technology assumes users have equal knowledge of technology used. For example: Co-op 3d-design program can let multiple people design at same time, but does not have support for guided help – tell the other guy what to do through markings and text, without talking to the person.

In programming, one also have the lack of guided help support, concerning co-op based programing. One have support for letting multiple people programming at same time, but here one also have lack of guided help support – text saying write this code, hints from other user, that one can mark relevant stuff on screen and so on. This is a problem in pair-programming, with communication as a bottle neck – one should have possibility to mark, configure and guide the user without knowledge.

=== Self-serving hierarchies ===
In a profit-motivated system, the commercial field of design may feel fearful of relinquishing some control in order to empower those who are typically not involved in the process of design. Commercial organizational structures often prioritize profit, individual gain, or status over the well-being of the community or other externalities. However, participatory practices are not impossible to implement in commercial settings. It may be difficult for those who have acquired success in a hierarchical structure to imagine alternative systems of open collaboration.

=== Lack of investment ===
Although participatory design has been of interest in design academia, applied uses require funding and dedication from many individuals. The high time and financial costs make research and development of participatory design less appealing for speculative investors. It also may be difficult to find or convince enough shareholders or community members to commit their time and effort to a project. However, widespread and involved participation is critical to the process.

Successful examples of participatory design are critical because they demonstrate the benefits of this approach and inspire others to adopt it. A lack of funding or interest can cause participatory projects to revert to practices where the designer initiates and dominates rather than facilitating design by the community.

=== Differing priorities between designers and participants ===
Participatory design projects which involve a professional designer as a facilitator to a larger group can have difficulty with competing objectives. Designers may prioritize aesthetics while end-users may prioritize functionality and affordability. Addressing these differing priorities may involve finding creative solutions that balance the needs of all stakeholders, such as using low-cost materials that meet functional requirements while also being aesthetically pleasing. Despite any potential predetermined assumptions, &quot;the users’ knowledge has to be considered as important as the knowledge of the other professionals in the team, [as this] can be an obstacle to the co-design practice.&quot; &quot;[The future of] co-designing will be a close collaboration between all the stakeholders in the design development process together with a variety of professionals having hybrid design/research skills.&quot;

=== Emotional and ethical dimensions ===
Recent scholarship has highlighted the complex emotional landscape navigated by researchers engaged in participatory design, especially in contexts involving vulnerable or marginalized communities. Emotional challenges such as guilt and shame often emerge as researchers confront the disparity between their professional objectives and the lived realities of the communities they engage with. These emotions may stem from unmet expectations, perceived exploitation, or limited project impact. For instance, researchers may experience a sense of guilt when project outcomes fail to meet community needs or when research goals appear to benefit academic careers more than the communities themselves. The ethical dilemmas associated with balancing research agendas, funding constraints, and community needs can create a conflict between professional obligations and personal commitments, potentially leading to emotional burnout or moral distress. Consequently, there is a growing call within the field for frameworks that address these emotional aspects, advocate for ethical reflexivity, and promote sustained engagement strategies that align more closely with community well-being and autonomy. This perspective broadens the traditional scope of participatory design by acknowledging the emotional toll on researchers, thereby emphasizing the need for supportive structures that account for these emotional and ethical intricacies.

==From Community Consultation to Community Design==

Many local governments require community consultation in any major changes to the built environment. Community involvement in the planning process is almost a standard requirement in most strategic changes. Community involvement in local decision making creates a sense of empowerment. The City of Melbourne Swanston Street redevelopment project received over 5000 responses from the public allowing them to participate in the design process by commenting on seven different design options. While the City of Yarra recently held a &quot;Stories in the Street&quot; consultation, to record peoples ideas about the future of Smith Street. It offered participants a variety of mediums to explore their opinions such as mapping, photo surveys and storytelling. Although local councils are taking positive steps towards participatory design as opposed to traditional top down approaches to planning, many communities are moving to take design into their own hands.

Portland, Oregon City Repair Project is a form of participatory design, which involves the community co-designing problem areas together to make positive changes to their environment. It involves collaborative decision-making and design without traditional involvement from local government or professionals but instead runs on volunteers from the community. The process has created successful projects such as intersection repair, which saw a misused intersection develop into a successful community square.

In Malawi, a UNICEF WASH programme trialled participatory design development for latrines in order to ensure that users participate in creating and selecting sanitation technologies that are appropriate and affordable for them. The process provided an opportunity for community members to share their traditional knowledge and skills in partnership with designers and researchers.

Peer-to-peer urbanism is a form of decentralized, participatory design for urban environments and individual buildings. It borrows organizational ideas from the open-source software movement, so that knowledge about construction methods and urban design schemes is freely exchanged.

===In software development===
In the English-speaking world, the term has a particular currency in the world of software development, especially in circles connected to Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), who have put on a series of Participatory Design Conferences. It overlaps with the approach extreme programming takes to user involvement in design, but (possibly because of its European trade union origins) the Participatory Design tradition puts more emphasis on the involvement of a broad population of users rather than a small number of user representatives.

Participatory design can be seen as a move of end-users into the world of researchers and developers, whereas empathic design can be seen as a move of researchers and developers into the world of end-users. There is a very significant differentiation between user-design and user-centered design in that there is an emancipatory theoretical foundation, and a systems theory bedrock (Ivanov, 1972, 1995), on which user-design is founded. Indeed, user-centered design is a useful and important construct, but one that suggests that users are taken as centers in the design process, consulting with users heavily, but not allowing users to make the decisions, nor empowering users with the tools that the experts use. For example, Wikipedia content is user-designed. Users are given the necessary tools to make their own entries. Wikipedia&#x27;s underlying wiki software is based on user-centered design: while users are allowed to propose changes or have input on the design, a smaller and more specialized group decide about features and system design.

Participatory work in software development has historically tended toward two distinct trajectories, one in Scandinavia and northern Europe, and the other in North America. The Scandinavian and northern European tradition has remained closer to its roots in the labor movement (e.g., Beck, 2002; Bjerknes, Ehn, and Kyng, 1987). The North American and Pacific rim tradition has tended to be both broader (e.g., including managers and executives as &quot;stakeholders&quot; in design) and more circumscribed (e.g., design of individual &quot;features&quot; as contrasted with the Scandinavian approach to the design of &quot;entire systems&quot; and design of the &quot;work that the system is supposed to support&quot;) (e.g., Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998; Noro and Imada, 1991). However, some more recent work has tended to combine the two approaches (Bødker et al., 2004; Muller, 2007).

== Research methodology ==
Increasingly researchers are focusing on co-design as a way of doing research, and therefore are developing parts of its research methodology. For instance, in the field of generative co-design Vandekerckhove et al. have proposed a methodology to assemble a group of stakeholders to participate in generative co-design activities in the early innovation process. They propose first to sample a group of potential stakeholders through snowball sampling, afterwards interview these people and assess their knowledge and inference experience, lastly they propose to assemble a diverse group of stakeholders according to their knowledge and inference experience.

Though not completely synonymous, research methods of Participatory Design can be defined under Participatory Research (PR): a term for research designs and frameworks using direct collaboration with those affected by the studied issue. More specifically, Participatory Design has evolved from Community-Based Research and Participatory Action Research (PAR). PAR is a qualitative research methodology involving: &quot;three types of change, including critical consciousness development of researchers and participants, improvement of lives of those participating in research, and transformation of societal &#x27;decolonizing&#x27; research methods with the power of healing and social justice&quot;. Participatory Action Research (PAR) is a subset of Community-Based Research aimed explicitly at including participants and empowering people to create measurable action. PAR practices across various disciplines, with research in Participatory Design being an application of its different qualitative methodologies. Just as PAR is often used in social sciences, for example, to investigate a person&#x27;s lived experience concerning systemic structures and social power relations, Participatory Design seeks to deeply understand stakeholders&#x27; experiences by directly engaging them in the problem-defining and solving processes. Therefore, in Participatory Design, research methods extend beyond simple qualitative and quantitative data collection. Rather than being concentrated within data collection, research methods of Participatory Design are tools and techniques used throughout co-designing research questions, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, knowledge dissemination, and enacting change.

When facilitating research in Participatory Design, decisions are made in all research phases to assess what will produce genuine stakeholder participation. By doing so, one of Participatory Design&#x27;s goals is to dismantle the power imbalance existing between &#x27;designers&#x27; and &#x27;users.&#x27; Applying PR and PAR research methods seeks to engage communities and question power hierarchies, which &quot;makes us aware of the always contingent character of our presumptions and truths... truths are logical, contingent and intersubjective... not directed toward some specific and predetermined end goal... committed to denying us the (seeming) firmness of our commonsensical assumptions&quot;. Participatory design offers this denial of our &quot;commonsensical assumptions&quot; because it forces designers to consider knowledge beyond their craft and education. Therefore, a designer conducting research for Participatory Design assumes the role of facilitator and co-creator.

<text>Jane Akre is an American journalist best known for the whistleblower lawsuit by herself and her former husband, Steve Wilson, against Fox station WTVT in Tampa, Florida. Akre and Wilson are featured in the 2003 documentary film &quot;The Corporation&quot; which includes a section about the same lawsuit.

==Professional life==

Akre began her career at a small radio station as a news reporter and occasional disc jockey in 1978. She moved around the country as a news reporter and news anchor until spending some time at CNN. Following her firing from WTSP, she joined WTVT, a Fox Broadcasting Company affiliate.

Following her issues with WTVT, she took a series of jobs and was featured in &quot;The Corporation&quot; regarding her whistleblower lawsuit. In 2007 Akre became the editor-in-chief of the national news desk at InjuryBoard.com.

==Whistleblower lawsuit==

In 1997, Wilson and Akre began work on a story regarding the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto and recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a milk additive that had been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration but also blamed for a number of health issues. Wilson and Akre planned a four-part investigative report on Monsanto&#x27;s use of rBGH, which prompted Monsanto to write to Roger Ailes, president of Fox News Channel, in an attempt to have the report reviewed for bias and because of the &quot;enormous damage that can be done&quot; as a result of the report.

WTVT did not run the report, and later argued in court that the report was not &quot;breakthrough journalism&quot;. Wilson and Akre then claimed that WTVT&#x27;s actions constituted the news broadcast telling lies, while WTVT countered that it was looking only for fairness. According to Wilson and Akre, the two rewrote the report over 80 times over the course of 1997, and WTVT decided to exercise &quot;its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause,&quot; and did not renew their contracts in 1998. WTVT later ran a report about Monsanto and rBGH in 1998, and the report included defenses from Monsanto.

When their contracts were not renewed, Wilson and Akre filed a lawsuit concerning WTVT&#x27;s alleged news distortion under Florida&#x27;s whistleblower laws, claiming their termination was retaliation for &quot;resisting WTVT&#x27;s attempts to distort or suppress the Monsanto recombinant bovine growth hormone story.&quot; In a joint statement, Wilson claimed that he and Akre &quot;were repeatedly ordered to go forward and broadcast demonstrably inaccurate and dishonest versions of the story,&quot; and &quot;were given those instructions after some very high-level corporate lobbying by Monsanto (the agriculture company that makes the hormone) and also ... by members of Florida’s dairy and grocery industries.&quot; The trial commenced in summer 2000 with a jury dismissing all of the claims brought to trial by Wilson, but siding with one aspect of Akre&#x27;s complaint, awarding Akre $425,000 and agreeing that Akre was a whistleblower because she believed there were violations of the Communications Act of 1934 and because she planned on reporting WTVT to the Federal Communications Commission.

An appeal was filed, and a ruling in February 2003 came down in favor of WTVT, who successfully argued that the FCC policy against falsification was not a &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot;, and so the whistle-blower law did not qualify as the required &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot; under section 448.102 of the Florida Statutes. ... Because the FCC&#x27;s news distortion policy is not a &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot; under section 448.102 of the Florida Statutes, Akre has failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower&#x27;s statute.&quot; The appeal did not address any falsification claims, noting that &quot;as a threshold matter ... Akre failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower&#x27;s statute,&quot; but noted that the lower court ruled against all of Wilson&#x27;s charges and all of Akre&#x27;s claims with the exception of the whistleblower claim that was overturned.

The 2003 documentary, &quot;The Corporation,&quot; which was a 2 hr and 24 minute documentary, included a 10-minute section on Wilson and Akre discussing their battle with WTVT, with Wilson claiming that the jury &quot;determined that the story they pressured us to broadcast, the story we resisted telling, was in fact false, distorted, or slanted.&quot; Project Censored called their story one of the &quot;Most Censored Stories&quot; of 2003, claiming that the &quot;Court Ruled That the Media Can Legally Lie.&quot; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. later quoted Wilson in his book, &quot;Crimes Against Nature&quot;, with Wilson asking &quot;[W]hat reporter is going to challenge a network ... if the station can retaliate by suing the reporter to oblivion the way the courts are letting them do to us?&quot; Wilson and Kennedy both failed to note that Wilson and Akre originally brought the suit. Following the story, Akre and Wilson won the Goldman Environmental Prize for the report, as well as an Ethics in Journalism Award from the Society of Professional Journalists. The two continued to challenge WTVT&#x27;s license, the last such challenge coming in 2005.

The two lost that final challenge with the FCC in July 2007 calling the conflict an &quot;editorial dispute ... rather than a deliberate effort by [WTVT] to distort news.&quot;

<doc id="966260" wikidata="Q941559" url="?curid=966260" title="Low (band)">
<text>Low was an American indie rock band from Duluth, Minnesota, formed in 1993 by Alan Sparhawk (guitar and vocals) and Mimi Parker (drums and vocals). The band was a trio from 1993 to 2020, having featured four different bassists. Low disbanded following the death of Parker in 2022.

The music of Low was characterized by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to the band&#x27;s style as a rock subgenre called &quot;slowcore&quot;, and Low were often compared to the band Bedhead, who played this style during the early 1990s. However, Low&#x27;s members ultimately disapproved of the term.

Parker and Sparhawk&#x27;s vocal harmonies represented perhaps the group&#x27;s most distinctive element; critic Denise Sullivan writes that their shared vocals are &quot;as chilling as anything Gram [Parsons] and Emmylou [Harris] ever conspired on—though that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s country-tinged, just straight from the heart.&quot; Low&#x27;s style grew experimental over time, gradually incorporating elements of electronica and glitch music on later releases, while retaining their minimalist approach.

==History==

The band formed in early 1993. Sparhawk had been playing in the Superior, Wisconsin, band Zen Identity, the core of which was formed by drummer Robb Berry and vocalist Bill Walton. That band needed a new bassist, and recruited future Low bassist John Nichols. At that time, Nichols was a senior at Superior Senior High School, and bassist in the band Lorenzo&#x27;s Tractor. Sparhawk taught Zen Identity songs to Nichols and during practices, the two started improvising with some very modest, quiet themes. As a joke, they wondered what would happen if they played such quiet music in front of Duluth, Minnesota, crowds, during a time when the most popular style of rock music was the loud, grunge, &quot;post-punk&quot; sound. Soon, the joke became a serious thought. Sparhawk left Zen Identity, who continued to perform and record without him, and he and Nichols recruited Sparhawk&#x27;s wife Mimi Parker to play a very modest drum kit composed of a single snare drum, single cymbal, and a single floor tom. She was to use brushes almost exclusively, rather than drum sticks. Sparhawk said they played their first two shows in 1993 at the RecyclaBell in Duluth.

Low&#x27;s debut album, &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot;, was released on Virgin Records&#x27; Vernon Yard imprint in 1994. It featured Nichols on bass, though he was replaced by Zak Sally, who joined for the recording of the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Long Division&quot;. Both &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot; and &quot;Long Division&quot; were produced and recorded by Kramer. &quot;Long Division&quot; and its similar follow-up, 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Curtain Hits the Cast&quot;, established the band as critical darlings; extensive touring helped them to develop a highly devoted fan base. &quot;Over the Ocean&quot;, a single drawn from &quot;The Curtain Hits the Cast&quot;, also became something of a hit on college radio.

By the time of their next full-length album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Secret Name,&quot; Low had moved to the independent label Kranky. In between, they released several singles and EPs. In 1999, Low joined forces with Dirty Three to record an In The Fishtank session for Konkurrent records. Allmusic called the six-song disc &quot;some of the best material either unit has produced.&quot; Of particular note is the disc&#x27;s lengthy cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Down by the River&quot;. 2001 saw the release of &quot;Things We Lost in the Fire&quot;.

The following year saw the release of the band&#x27;s final full-length on Kranky, &quot;Trust&quot;. All three of the band&#x27;s full-length releases on Kranky featured superstar producers: &quot;Secret Name&quot; and &quot;Things We Lost in the Fire&quot; feature the work of recording engineer Steve Albini, who proved sympathetic to capturing the band&#x27;s strengths; while &quot;Trust&quot; was recorded by Tom Herbers along with Duluth engineer Eric Swanson and mixed by Tchad Blake at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios.

In April 2003, Peter S. Scholtes of the Twin Cities weekly paper &quot;City Pages&quot; posted in his weblog that Zak Sally had left Low. The following month, the band posted an update to the news on their website: &quot;We have all had to work through some personal things recently ... After sorting it out, the good news is that Zak is remaining in the band ...&quot; In July 2003, they toured Europe with Radiohead, Sally in tow. Following a successful tour in early 2004 that vividly demonstrated the band&#x27;s commitment to their fans (Parker was visibly pregnant throughout), the band signaled their intent to continue making music by signing with powerhouse indie label Sub Pop. To tie up the loose ends of the era, Low released a three-disc rarities compilation on its own Chairkickers label in 2004.

Beginning with &quot;Secret Name&quot;, the band have diversified their sound. The band use subtle electronic music touches to augment their sound, reflective of their tenure with Kranky and their exposure to the Midwest&#x27;s post-rock scene. Adding a more overt rock element to their aesthetic, the band has used fuzz bass from &quot;Things We Lost In the Fire&quot; onward, and began using distorted lead guitar on &quot;Trust&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;, nods even further in the direction of rock. Recorded with producer Dave Fridmann and released by Sub Pop in January 2005, &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot; has received mostly positive reviews; the &quot;Village Voice&quot; described the record&#x27;s &quot;comparatively thunderous verve&quot;.

Low cancelled the second leg of their extensive tour in support of &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot; in late spring of 2005. Sparhawk published a statement on the band&#x27;s website, addressed directly to fans, detailing his personal problems with depression that resulted in the cancellation of the tour. In August 2005, Sparhawk announced his return to performance, embarking on a US tour with former Red House Painters frontman Mark Kozelek. In October 2005, Sally announced he was leaving the band. Low replaced Sally with Matt Livingston, a bassist and saxophonist from Duluth&#x27;s musical scene. In addition to playing bass guitar, Livingston also played an antique Navy chaplain&#x27;s pump organ in the group.

After appearing on 2007&#x27;s &quot;Drums and Guns&quot; and touring with the group, Matt Livingston left Low in 2008, to be replaced by Steve Garrington. Garrington would perform with the band for the next 12 years and four studio albums: 2011&#x27;s &quot;C″mon&quot;, 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Way&quot;, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Ones and Sixes&quot; and 2018&#x27;s &quot;Double Negative&quot;.

Sparhawk and Parker provided guest vocals on &quot;Lunacy&quot;, the opening track on Swans&#x27; 2012 album &quot;The Seer&quot;.

In June 2021, the band announced an upcoming release on Sub Pop entitled &quot;Hey What&quot;. The album was released on September 10. With the announcement of the album came news of Garrington&#x27;s departure from the band a year prior, turning Low into an official duo for the first time in their career. It was soon announced that the band had hired Charlie Parr bassist Liz Draper to support &quot;Hey What&quot; on tour.

Parker was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in late 2020; she began treatment in 2021 and publicly revealed the diagnosis during a podcast interview in January 2022. In August 2022, the band cancelled some European shows to accommodate Parker&#x27;s treatment. In September, the band cancelled its dates opening for Death Cab for Cutie in the United States. In October, the band cancelled the remainder of their 2022 European tour dates, due to continued concerns about Parker&#x27;s health. Parker died on November 5, 2022.

Following Parker&#x27;s death, Sparhawk focused his musical attention to a new project named Damien, featuring their son, Cyrus, on bass guitar, songwriter Marc Gartman on vocals and drummer Owen Mahon. Formed in late 2021, prior to Parker&#x27;s death, the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Boy Who Drew Cats&quot; was released in May 2023. Upon the album&#x27;s release, Sparhawk noted: &quot;I&#x27;m learning not to be surprised by anything. There is a weird process going on and I have to allow myself the possibility that I have no idea what I&#x27;m going to be by the end of this.&quot; In June 2023, Sparhawk confirmed via Twitter that Low had ended with Parker&#x27;s passing. &quot;Low is and was Mimi,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It was amazing. I&#x27;m grateful.&quot;

==Performance==

Low were known for their live performances. Rock club audiences sometimes watched the band while seated on the floor. During their early career, the band often faced unsympathetic and inattentive audiences in bars and clubs, to which they responded by bucking rock protocol and turning their volume down. The dynamic range of their early music made it susceptible to background noise and chatter, since many of their songs were very quiet. A performance in 1996 at the South by Southwest festival was overpowered when a Scandinavian hardcore band was booked downstairs. The &quot;Trust&quot; album marked a turning point, and Low&#x27;s music developed a more emphatic sound.

Their shows often featured drastically reinterpreted cover versions of famous songs by Joy Division and The Smiths, in addition to their own original material. In performance, Low showed off a sense of humor not necessarily found on their recordings; a tour in early 2004 featured a cover of OutKast&#x27;s hit song &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;. At a gig in Los Angeles on Halloween 1998, the band took the stage as a Misfits tribute act, complete with corpse paint and black clothing.

At the 2008 End of the Road Festival in Dorset, England, Sparhawk abruptly ended the band&#x27;s performance by ripping the strings and lead out of his guitar, throwing it to the ground and then hurling it into the crowd before exiting the stage. He had earlier informed the audience that it had been a &quot;crappy day&quot;. In 2010 they performed &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot; at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona. On Friday July 13, 2012, Low gave a candlelit concert at Halifax Minster in England.

Low&#x27;s performance at the 2013 Rock the Garden concert in Duluth consisted of a slowed and lengthened version of their drone rock song &quot;Do You Know How to Waltz?&quot; followed by Alan saying, &quot;Drone, not drones,&quot; a reference to an anti-drone sticker made by Minneapolis&#x27;s Luke Heiken; the performance resulted in mass audience confusion and divisive online discussion. The performance lasted half an hour and was broadcast live on radio station KCMP, which had been playing cuts of their recent album. Low had performed a more traditional show for KCMP at the Fitzgerald Theater earlier in the year.

On September 4, 2022, at what proved to be the band&#x27;s final performance, Low took the stage at the Water Is Life Festival in Duluth.

==Commercial success==
The band&#x27;s mainstream exposure was limited in the early part of their career. The band&#x27;s version of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, played as a hymn, was featured in a Gap television ad that depicted a snowball fight in slow-motion to match the song&#x27;s glacial tempo.

Starting with &quot;Things We Lost in the Fire&quot; (2001), Low&#x27;s albums began to appear on sales charts in Europe; starting with &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot; (2005) they began to chart in the United States as well. A remix of their song &quot;Halflight&quot; was featured in the &quot;Mothman Prophecies&quot; motion picture in 2002. The band made their network television debut in 2005 by performing the single &quot;California&quot; on an episode of &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. On June 11, 2007, Scott Bateman, a web animator, announced that his video for Low&#x27;s song &quot;Hatchet (Optimimi version)&quot; would be one of the preloads on the new Microsoft Zune portable media player. That same year they recorded a song called &quot;Family Tree&quot; which featured in the &quot;Careful&quot; episode of the Nick Jr. kids&#x27; show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;

On March 24, 2008, their song &quot;Point of Disgust&quot; was featured in the UK television show &quot;Skins&quot;, prompting a rush of download sales from iTunes. Another of their songs, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, was featured in the following episode (episode 9), and &quot;Breaker&quot; was featured in a later episode. As the music supervisor of &quot;Skins&quot; declared in the Episode Track Listing section of the show&#x27;s official website: &quot;You may have guessed by now that we are all pretty huge fans of Low in the Skins office&quot;.

The 2008 movie &quot;KillShot&quot;, starring Mickey Rourke and Diane Lane, features the song &quot;Monkey&quot; early in the film. The 2003 documentary film &quot;Tarnation&quot; by Jonathan Caouette features the Low tracks &quot;Laser Beam&quot;, &quot;Embrace&quot;, and &quot;Back Home Again&quot; alongside tracks by artists such as Red House Painters and The Magnetic Fields. &quot;Laser Beam&quot; also featured on episode 4 season 2 of the television show &quot;Misfits&quot;. Low was the subject of the 2008 documentary &quot;Low: You May Need a Murderer&quot;.

In 2010, Robert Plant recorded two Low songs from &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Monkey&quot; and &quot;Silver Rider&quot;, for his album &quot;Band of Joy&quot;. In an interview, Plant said of &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s great music; it&#x27;s always been in the house playing away beside Jerry Lee Lewis and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, you know. There&#x27;s room for everything.&quot; Buddy Miller, who played guitar on &quot;Band of Joy&quot;, had worked with Low in the past.

The band were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

==Personal lives==
George Alan Sparhawk moved from Seattle to Minnesota when he was nine years old. He met Mimi Jo Parker (1967–2022) while they were both students at the same grade school in the small town of Clearbrook, Minnesota outside of Bemidji. They married and moved to Duluth, where they formed Low. Sparhawk is, and Parker was, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, about which Sparhawk said, &quot;Our spiritual beliefs encompass our whole life and understanding of who we are and what we do.&quot;

Sparhawk has done charity work with the Maasai tribe in Kenya. After a friend of his became a friend of the village of Namuncha, Sparhawk played a Christmas show to raise funds to build a school there, where students had previously been meeting in the shade outside. He calls the experience of visiting the Maasai one of the most spiritual of his life.

Parker was diagnosed with cancer in December 2020. She did not disclose her illness until mid-2021, when Low was forced to cancel multiple tour dates. She died on November 5, 2022.

Low announced Parker&#x27;s death on their Twitter account on November 6 with the message: &quot;Friends, it&#x27;s hard to put the universe into language and into a short message, but she passed away last night, surrounded by family and love, including yours. Keep her name close and sacred. Share this moment with someone who needs you. Love is indeed the most important thing.&quot;

==Side projects==
Low founded the record label Chairkickers&#x27; Union, which releases their own material as well as work by musicians such as Rivulets and Haley Bonar. Sparhawk is notably active in Duluth&#x27;s small but vibrant independent music scene; he operates a recording studio in the town, in a deconsecrated church where the acoustics provided the lush reverb which was characteristic of Low&#x27;s sound. Most of the musicians on the Chairkickers&#x27; Union label are based in Duluth and its environs.

Zak Sally has toured as a bassist with Dirty Three, and Sparhawk has devoted considerable time and energy to his Black Eyed Snakes project, a blues-rock revival band which plays a style of music that is dissimilar to that played by Low; in this group, Sparhawk performs under the pseudonym &quot;Chicken-Bone George&quot;. Low and the Black-Eyed Snakes have played some of the same songs, including &quot;Lordy&quot;. Sparhawk has also played with the Retribution Gospel Choir (RGC). Matt Livingston, who became Low&#x27;s bassist in late 2005, also played in the RGC. On that band&#x27;s first tour, which began in fall 2005, the group covered the Low song &quot;From Your Place on Sunset&quot;. Songs have also crossed over in the other direction—Low covered the RGC songs &quot;Hatchet&quot; and &quot;Breaker&quot; on their &quot;Drums and Guns&quot; album.

Sparhawk released his debut solo album &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; in August 2006. As Hollis M. Sparhawk &amp; Her Father, his track &quot;Thanks 1 2 3 Watch&quot; appeared on the 2002 compilation album &quot;Songs for the End of the World&quot; released by Duluth label Silber Records. Sparhawk contributed the song &quot;Be Nice to People with Lice&quot; to the Paper Bag Records compilation of children&#x27;s songs &quot;See You on the Moon!&quot; released in 2006.

Sparhawk and Sally have recorded synthesizer-centric songs in the New Wave style under the name The Hospital People. Its most widely distributed record was &quot;Crash / We&#x27;ll Be Philosophers&quot;, released as a 7-inch on clear vinyl by Duck Suit Records. Sparhawk and Sally have also played live as The Tooth Fairies, with Sally performing on drums and Sean Erspamer on bass; Tooth Fairies sets have typically consisted of cover songs by the Stooges, MC5, and similar bands. Sally has done the art for several graphic novels, and he also did the artwork for former Pedro the Lion member David Bazan&#x27;s first solo release, the EP &quot;Fewer Moving Parts&quot; (now part of the Barsuk Records catalog). At one time, Mimi Parker was rumored to have started a punk band called Rubbersnake, but this was an inside joke on the part of the band.

In April 2012, Low collaborated with artist Peter Liversidge for a combined performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London. A year later, Low collaborated with Liversidge again for a performance at the Barbican Centre in London.

In 2011, Sparhawk began collaborating with Duluth violinist and vocalist Gaelynn Lea in a band called The Murder of Crows. The duo
plays Lea&#x27;s originals, instrumentals, and covers, using looping pedals and pared-down arrangements. Their first album, &quot;Imperfecta&quot;, was released in June 2012.

Sparhawk plays in the Neil Young tribute act Tired Eyes and Derecho Rhythm Section.

On September 27, 2024, Sparhawk released his second solo album, &quot;White Roses, My God&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue; the honor recognizes performers who have played sold-out shows at the iconic venue and have made major contributions to local culture. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<text>Harvard station is a rapid transit and bus transfer station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Located at Harvard Square, it serves the MBTA&#x27;s Red Line subway system as well as MBTA buses. Harvard averaged 18,528 entries each weekday in FY2019, making it the third-busiest MBTA station after and .

Harvard station is located directly beneath Harvard Square, a transportation, business, and cultural focal point in Cambridge. The Red Line rail platforms lie underneath Massachusetts Avenue just north of the center of the square. Many connecting surface transit routes are served by the Harvard bus tunnel, which runs on the west side of the station. The primary station entrance leads to a central atrium fare lobby under Harvard Square; there is also a secondary fare lobby for the Red Line toward the north end of the station, with entrances at Church Street and opposite it, near Harvard&#x27;s Johnston Gate; and an unpaid entrance to the bus tunnel at Brattle Square.

==Station layout==

Harvard station has a complex structure located largely under triangular Harvard Square, from which Massachusetts Avenue runs to the north and east and Brattle Street to the southwest, and under the surrounding streets. The main lobby is located under the square itself, and approximately matches its triangular shape. The glass-and-steel main headhouse is located in a sunken concrete plaza at the south end of the square. The plaza, locally known as &quot;the Pit&quot;, plays host to homeless people, street artists, skateboarders, and activists. Passengers descend eastward from the headhouse on a bank of stairs and elevators, then turn and descend northwest on a second escalator bank into the lobby. An elevator is located adjacent to the headhouse; the station is fully accessible.

The Red Line platforms are located on two stacked levels, north of the square under Massachusetts Avenue. The outbound (northbound) track is above and slightly east of the inbound track; both have side platforms on their west sides. These split platforms run from near the south end of Harvard University&#x27;s Straus Hall to the south part of Flagstaff Park near Garden Street. A pair of ramps lead from the main lobby— which has faregates on its north side— to the platforms. A secondary fare lobby is located above the middle of both platforms, with small brick headhouses on both sides of Massachusetts Avenue at Church Street near Johnston Gate.

===Bus tunnel===

Immediately west of the subway platforms is the -long Harvard bus tunnel, used by MBTA buses and formerly trackless trolleys. Like the Red Line, it is split into two stacked tunnel levels; the northbound level is above and slightly east of the southbound level. Both levels have platforms on their east side, located under Brattle Street southwest of the main lobby. A pair of ramps connect the main station lobby to the platforms; a small set of stairs also connects the lower platform to the west side of the lobby. A headhouse and an elevator to the upper level are located at Eliot Square at the southwest end of the platform.

The south portal of the tunnel is located on Mount Auburn Street; it runs slightly west of Brattle Street to Harvard Square, then northward along the west side of Massachusetts Avenue. The north portal is located inside Flagstaff Park near the south end of Cambridge Common, with an incline to the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Cambridge Street. Bennett Alley, a private alley south of Mount Auburn Street, is used for layovers and for northbound buses to access the tunnel from Bennett Street.

The platform is located on the left side for southbound buses (all of which terminate at Harvard). Because buses using the tunnel do not have left-hand doors, passengers must alight next to the wall and cross in front of the bus. MBTA trolleybuses were equipped with an additional left-hand door for boarding on this level; because this door did not have a farebox, passengers instead paid while alighting from routes 71 and 73 (the only routes that boarded southbound in the tunnel).

Harvard is a major transfer point for MBTA bus routes. routes— — use the Harvard bus tunnel. All board on the upper level; all use the lower level for alighting except the 71 and 73 (which use the upper level for alighting) and the southbound 66, 86, and 109. routes – – stop at street level at several locations in Harvard Square. (Routes 66, 86, and 109 run northbound in the tunnel and southbound on the surface.) Southbound buses on routes 66 and 86, and terminating buses on route 77, also serve a stop on Eliot Street at Bennett Street.
== History ==
===Original station===

Horse-drawn omnibus service between Harvard Square in Cambridge and downtown Boston began in 1826. The hourly service soon increased to ten-minute headways to meet demand. In late 1849, the Fitchburg Railroad opened the Harvard Branch Railroad, with a Harvard Square station near where Austin Hall is now located. With only six daily round trips, the branch failed to compete with the omnibus service and was closed in 1855. On March 26, 1856, the Cambridge Railroad began horse-drawn tram service between Harvard Square and Bowdoin Square— the first such service in the Boston area. Following the opening of its Beacon Street line earlier that year, the West End Street Railway began electric streetcar service on the North Cambridge–Bowdoin Square line on February 16, 1889. Murray Street Carhouse was built for the new electric cars. The West End (which was acquired by the Boston Elevated Railway in 1897) rapidly expanded its electric operations, including other lines meeting at Harvard Square.

After the success of the 1897-opened Tremont Street Subway, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) planned an elevated system with lines to Cambridge, South Boston, Charlestown, and Roxbury. The latter two lines opened in 1901 as the Charlestown Elevated and Washington Street Elevated, while the South Boston line was determined to be infeasible. After debate about running an elevated line above business districts in Cambridge, the BERy agreed in late 1906 to built a line under Beacon Hill in Boston, over a new West Boston Bridge, and under Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge to Harvard Square. Construction began on May 24, 1909. The Cambridge Subway opened from Harvard Square to Park Street Under on March 23, 1912, with intermediate stations at Central Square and Kendall Square.

The two-level underground Harvard Square station largely matched the triangular shape of Harvard Square. The subway platforms were oriented east-west under Massachusetts Avenue at the east end of the station, with the outbound (unloading) platform above and slightly north of the inbound platform. The outbound platform was long and at least wide; the inbound platform was long and at least wide to accommodate passengers waiting for trains. West of the platforms, the tracks merged onto a single level, with a pocket track between them. This three-track tunnel ran southwest under Brattle Street to a maintenance facility known as ”Eliot Shops”; outbound trains could reverse direction at the pocket track or continue to the yard.

A two-level streetcar tunnel formed the west part of the station, with platforms long. The southbound (lower) level was for streetcars running on Mount Auburn Street, while the northbound level was for streetcars running on Massachusetts Avenue and Garden Street. The streetcar platforms were divided into unloading and loading sections for the through-routed streetcar lines, allowing separation of passenger flows in opposite directions. This philosophy was used throughout the station, with dedicated one-way transfer passages between trains and streetcars in all directions. All passages were level or sloped downwards for ease of movement, and stairs were only necessary for entering or exiting the station at the surface. The platforms and floors were made of granolithic. Station walls were tiled with white enamel, with a red tile band above the floor and white plaster above. The exit to Harvard Yard also had dark granite inside and black marble at the surface.

Early plans called for a monument-like headhouse in Harvard Square matching that of Scollay Square station. However, a one-story, oval-shaped brick and stone entrance/exit structure was constructed instead. Like the rest of the Cambridge Subway, it was designed by a committee of architects led by Robert Peabody. Additional entrances were located on the south side of Massachusetts Avenue east of Holyoke Street, and inside a BERy waiting room on the south face of the square. Secondary exits were located on the northeast side of the square (later in front of Lehman Hall) and on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue east of the square near the Wadsworth House. The original headhouse was replaced by a smaller structure in 1928. Otherwise, the station was little changed until the 1970s.

===Streetcar tunnel===
With an eight-minute running time between Harvard Square and Park Street, the Cambridge Subway was fifteen minutes faster than surface streetcars. No longer needing to run to downtown Boston, lines from the north and west were truncated to Harvard Square. The streetcar tunnel served lines to Watertown, Waverley Square, Belmont, Huron Avenue, and Arlington Heights via North Cambridge. Some lines were through-routed: Arlington Heights with Watertown, and North Cambridge line with Waverley and Belmont; the Huron Avenue line terminated at Bennett Yard. Lines to Lechmere Square, Kendall Square, and Boston continued to use surface tracks in the square. On May 4, 1912, Lexington and Boston Street Railway cars from Lowell began using the tunnel. This lasted until the line was replaced by buses (later becoming MBTA route 62) in 1924.

By 1922, 104 streetcars per hour (24 single cars and 40 two-car trains) ran northbound through the tunnel during the afternoon peak. In response to overcrowding, the BERy extended the loading section of the northbound platform from to and widened the existing portion, doubling its area. Construction work started in late 1922 and was finished in 1923. At that time, the BERy believed that Harvard would be the permanent terminus; the heavy ridership from the north was expected to be handled by extending rapid transit from Lechmere Square.

Bus routes added in the 1920s and 1930s (including the 1925 conversion of the Harvard-Kendall line) originally stopped on the surface. Trackless trolleys (trolleybuses) began to use the tunnel with the conversion of the Huron Avenue streetcar line (now route ) on April 2, 1938. (The Harvard–Lechmere line— now route — was converted in 1936, but it continued to run on the surface because of road geometry. Not until spring 1956 were wires reconfigured to allow the line to use the tunnel.) The busy Arlington Heights line (now route ) was converted to surface-stopping diesel buses on November 19, 1955.

In the late 1950s, the MTA (which had replaced the BERy in 1947) needed additional streetcars to run the new Riverside Line (which opened in 1959), but no domestic manufacturers were still producing PCC streetcars. The City of Cambridge also planned road work that would interrupt streetcar service, and wished to eliminate &quot;safety islands&quot; (where passengers boarded streetcars) from Massachusetts Avenue. The MTA replaced Arborway-based trolleybus lines with diesel buses, then transferred the trolleybuses to replace the Harvard-based streetcars. Some off-peak and Sunday service was replaced in 1956, followed by Cushing Square short turn service in 1957. On September 5, 1958, the Watertown () and Waverley () lines and the North Cambridge short turns (now route ) were replaced with trolleybuses, ending streetcar service through the tunnel.

The four trolleybus routes (sometimes considered three, as most trips on the 71 and 73 were through-routed with North Cambridge trips) continued to use the tunnel. As of 2006, it was one of only two urban trolleybus subways (tunnels with stations) in the world, following the end of trolleybus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel in 2005; the other was the South Boston Transitway. (The College Hill Tunnel, in Providence, Rhode Island, was used by trackless trolleys from 1948 to 1953, but had no stations. The use of the Essen premetro subway in Germany by trolleybuses ended in 1995, and the Kanden Tunnel and Tateyama Tunnel in Japan were non-urban trolleybus tunnels.)

On March 30, 1963, the MTA replaced all remaining trolleybus routes except for the Harvard-based routes with diesel buses. The Harvard tunnel was closed on Sundays, with trolleybuses replaced by diesel buses operating on the surface. Original plans had called for the trolleybuses to be replaced by diesel buses at all times, but this was delayed while the MTA investigated methods to ventilate the tunnel. Diesel buses equipped with early catalytic mufflers were tested from 1962 to 1964, with the hope of eliminating most surface bus traffic from Harvard Square. In January 1965, catalytic-muffler-equipped diesel buses on route 77 began using the tunnel, followed by route 96 in March 1966. However, the trolleybus lines were not replaced with diesel buses until 2022. In August 2024, northbound route buses began using the tunnel.

===Maintenance facilities===
The BERy constructed a pair of rail yards on a site to the southwest of Harvard Square, bordered by Eliot Street, Bennett Street, University Road, Charles River Road, and Boylston Street. Much of the site was occupied by BERy and West End Street Railway streetcar barns; the area had been used for horsecar facilities since at least 1871. The rest of the site, which had once been marshland, was occupied by private buildings. The west half of the site was occupied by Bennett Street Yard, a storage and maintenance facility for streetcars. It included a 16-track, carhouse that could hold 92 streetcars, plus an open-air storage yard. Bennett opened on March 30, 1911, replacing nearby Boylston Street and Murray Street carhouses.

The eastern half of the site housed the Eliot Square Shops, used for storage and maintenance of the Cambridge Subway rolling stock. It had a three-track machine shop and five covered maintenance tracks, plus open-air storage tracks. The whole facility covered , including the shop building and the -wide yard. Footings were built between the yard tracks to allow for future air rights development. On the west side of the shop building, a single track ran up a ramp to Bennett Yard. Nicknamed &quot;Bancroft Hall&quot; (after BERy president William Bancroft) by employees, the shop building was used to assemble the forty new subway cars. Eliot Square Shops cost $1.00 million (equivalent to $ million in ) out of the total $11.75 million cost of the Cambridge Subway.

On the east side of the yard, the BERy constructed a concrete platform for special service to events such as the Harvard football games at Harvard Stadium. Known as Stadium station, it had a main ramp entrance/exit at the south end, plus eight smaller stair entrance/exits along the east wall. It was not open for regular use and did not have turnstiles; instead, employees collected all fares. Fully staffing the station took 49 employees, including 24 ticket sellers and 12 ticket choppers. Stadium station could handle 26,000 passengers in 45 minutes after a game, with trains running every 1 minutes. The architecture of the station was designed by Robert S. Peabody. It first opened for a home game versus Brown on October 26, 1912; the last known use was on November 18, 1967, for the final home game of the 1967 Harvard football season.

BERy also constructed a brick division headquarters building, later known as the Conductor&#x27;s Building, in Bennett Alley between the yard and the streetcar tunnel. It was used by the BERy and its successors until around 2000; in 2014–2016, the building was renovated for use as a restaurant. It is the last remaining aboveground building from the 1912 construction of the Cambridge tunnel. The Harvard Square power station, which was built for streetcars in 1897, was located adjacent to Eliot Shops across Boylston Street. It had a substantial coal trestle for freight streetcars to deliver coal. A steam tunnel ran west from the power station under Eliot and Bennett yards, supplying steam power to both. After Widener Library was built in 1912, Harvard University built a steam tunnel to Harvard Yard and used excess steam to heat the new library and other buildings. The power station was largely unused by the time it was sold to the university in 1929. Harvard demolished the structure in 1930 in favor of purchasing steam from a Cambridge Electric Light Company plant. Eliot House opened on the site in 1931.

In April 1924, the BERy converted the East Boston Tunnel (later the Blue Line) from streetcars to high-platform metro rolling stock. A small maintenance facility was built underground near Maverick station, but more extensive work was performed at Eliot Shops. Cars were brought to the surface at a portal west of Bowdoin station, towed on surface tracks on Cambridge Street and the Longfellow Bridge, and transferred onto the Cambridge–Dorchester line tracks at a gate near the west end of the bridge. This was done until April 25, 1952, when the new maintenance facility at Orient Heights eliminated the need for the transfer. Beginning in 1956, Ashmont–Mattapan High-Speed Line streetcars were towed to Eliot Shops behind Cambridge–Dorchester line trains after the abandonment of surface lines severed the connection to Arborway Yard. This continued until a maintenance facility was built at Mattapan in 1971.

The BERy purchased a private garage adjacent to Bennett Yard in October 1931; it was reopened on July 28, 1932, as a garage for BERY maintenance trucks. Pavement was laid around several tracks in Bennett Yard in 1936 and 1938 for use by trolleybuses. Several yard tracks were removed in 1942 and 1949, the latter to accommodate trolleybuses for the conversion of the Harvard–Massachusetts line. Until it was reassigned to Reservoir Carhouse in 1940, the Lake Street line had been based out of Bennett Street, requiring a long deadhead move along Cambridge Street to Lechmere. After the last Bennett-based streetcar lines were replaced with trolleybuses in 1958, the facility was used solely by trolleybuses and diesel buses. All trolleybus maintenance was performed at Bennett, though some were also stored at North Cambridge Carhouse. In October 1958, the MTA sold the east part of Bennett Yard to the city of Cambridge, which used the paved area as public parking.

Around 1963, John F. Kennedy originally proposed to build his presidential library near Harvard, on the south side of the Charles River. In June 1964, then-city councilman Alfred Vellucci proposed to instead locate the library on the site of the Bennett and Eliot railyards, on the northern side of the river. The MTA had begun offering this site for sale the previous year, with Harvard University and several real estate developers developing bids, as the agency planned for a replacement maintenance facility either near South Station or as part of the planned northwestern Red Line extension. Shortly after being selected as architect in December 1964, I.M. Pei indicated an interest in the yard site, and it was chosen over a smaller southern site in mid-1965. In January 1966, governor John A. Volpe signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the yards from the now-renamed MBTA, and in turn to give the site to the federal government for the library. However, delays with the Red Line extension project caused corresponding delays with the purchase.

The MBTA ultimately purchased land near South Station for its new Red Line maintenance facility in December 1969. Cabot Yard opened in June 1974, freeing the Eliot Shops site for development. However, community opinion had by then turned against placing the library in Harvard Square because of concerns about traffic and crowding; in November 1975, the Kennedy Library Corporation voted to instead place the library at Columbia Point near UMass Boston. Eliot Shops closed in 1976, with demolition beginning on December 22. Bennett Yard closed on March 22, 1980, replaced by new maintenance facilities at North Cambridge and Watertown Yard.

In October 1978, the first building of a new John F. Kennedy School of Government complex opened on the southern half of the site. The new buildings were constructed on fill atop the concrete base of the yard. A single segment of wall reading &quot;BOSTON ELEVATED RAILWAY CO. 1911&quot; remained in the courtyard of the Kennedy School until a 2015-17 expansion project. The abandoned tunnel to Eliot Shops under Brattle Street is still extant and used for MBTA storage.

=== Former stations ===

There have been a total of five stations on the Red Line in and around Harvard Square. The original Harvard station was located just east of the current station, and some remains exist. The original station closed permanently on January 30, 1981. The surviving eastern end of the original outbound side platform, built to accommodate passengers alighting at the former terminus, is still visible from passing trains.

The 1945 Coolidge Commission report— the first major transit planning initiative in the region since 1926— recommended an extension from Harvard to Arlington Heights via East Watertown. The 1947 revision recommended an extension north to Porter Square instead, with branches along the Fitchburg Railroad to Waltham and the Lexington Branch to Lexington. The 1966 &quot;Program for Mass Transportation&quot; by the 1964-created MBTA called for an immediate extension to Alewife Brook Parkway via Porter Square, with possible future extensions to Arlington or Waltham.

During the construction of the current Harvard station, two temporary stations were built. &quot;Harvard/Brattle&quot;, a temporary station built of pressure-treated wood, consisted of two island platforms between three tracks in Eliot Yard, just outside the portal. A $1.4 million construction contract was approved on December 7, 1977, with a groundbreaking ceremony on January 23, 1978. The station was open from March 24, 1979, to September 1, 1983, and was the northern terminus of the Red Line during that period. The temporary station was completely demolished, and parts of the Kennedy School of Government now occupy the space.

&quot;Harvard/Holyoke&quot; station was located in the main Red Line tunnel east of the current station, at Massachusetts Avenue and Holyoke Street. Although it served inbound passengers only, the temporary station was fully built with tile walls and other durable details. It was open from January 31, 1981, to September 1, 1983. The abandoned side platform is still visible from inbound Red Line trains.

=== Current station ===

The Church Street secondary entrance to the new station opened on September 6, 1983. The main lobby and the new Harvard Square headhouse opened on March 2, 1985. (The reconstructed former headhouse had been returned to the square and occupied by Out of Town News in 1984.) The artworks at Harvard and the three new stations were dedicated on May 3, 1985.

The renovated busway opened on September 7, 1985, completing the $72 million construction project. The bus platforms had been moved to the south (occupying part of the former tunnel to Eliot Square Shops) and renovated during the six-year closure of the tunnel. The northern ramp of the tunnel was also rebuilt during the closure. In addition to the route previously using the tunnel, bus routes , , and were rerouted into the tunnel. (Route , which remained on the surface, began using the tunnel northbound only in 2008.) A memorial plaque honoring John H. &quot;Muggsie&quot; Kelly, a construction foreman who was killed by a crane collapse during construction in May 1982, was dedicated in October 1985. The One Brattle Square shopping complex, opened in 1992, was constructed partially on air rights over the south end of the bus tunnel.

Harvard Square was planned to be the terminus of a spur of the Urban Ring Project, a circumferential bus rapid transit line. Under draft plans released in 2008, northbound buses would have crossed the Lars Anderson Bridge and entered the bus tunnel via Eliot Street, Bennett Street, and Bennett Alley. Southbound buses would have started at the Dawes Island bus stop, then proceeded on the surface on Eliot Street and JFK Street back to the bridge. The project was cancelled in 2010 due to high cost.

The MBTA agreed to build a new elevator at the south end of the upper busway at Eliot Square, and to replace the Harvard Square elevator, as part of the 2006 settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;. Construction of the Eliot Square elevator began in mid-2010. The $4.1 million project, which provided redundant elevator access to the station, was completed in January 2012. The main elevator in Harvard Square was closed in 2018 for an 18-month replacement with a larger glass elevator. The new elevator, which has copper sheeting on the kiosk, opened on October 31, 2019.

A project to make repairs to the deteriorated pavement, replace the trolleybus wire, replace lighting, improve wayfinding, and add automatic doors to the main station area is taking place in 2019 and 2020. On June 23, 2019, the upper busway was temporarily closed; most buses used the lower busway for boarding and surface stops for alighting, while routes 71 and 73 ran on the surface only. The upper busway reopened and the lower busway closed on October 21. The lower busway reopened on November 22, with the upper busway again closed until December 21. Additional closures of the lower busway took place from March 31 to May 2 and June 21 to December 21, 2020, as decreased ridership during the coronavirus pandemic allowed for faster construction. The upper busway was again closed from June 20 to July 29, 2021, with the lower busway then closed until August 29. Improvements to wayfinding signage and lighting in the station began in 2020 but were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trolleybus service ended on March 13, 2022, with routes 71 and 73 rerouted to board in the upper busway.
== Public artwork ==

As a part of the Red Line Northwest Extension, Harvard was included as one of the stations involved in the pioneering Arts on the Line program. Arts on the Line was devised to bring art into the MBTA&#x27;s subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar arrangements to fund public art across the country.

Four of the original twenty artworks were located at Harvard station. The first two are located within the station interior, while the remaining two were located outdoors:
* &quot;Blue Sky on the Red Line&quot; by György Kepes— A large stained-glass wall composed of mostly cobalt blue glass, with the exception of a red band that runs the length of the work. It is mounted on the wall of the upper Harvard bus tunnel so that it is visible from the central atrium space of the station. The work was no longer lit by 1995 because the original light fixtures had expired. It required $40,000 of repairs in 1998. The backlighting for the artwork, which had not been functional for years, was restored in December 2019.
* &quot;New England Decorative Art&quot; by Joyce Kozloff— An long mosaic split up into 8 sections, each resembling a quilt.
* &quot;Gateway to Knowledge&quot; by Anne Norton— A high brick structure divided vertically down the center by a gap, but still attached at the top. One half is slightly forward of the other (located in Brattle Square).
* &quot;Omphalos&quot; by Dimitri Hadzi— A freestanding grouping of pillars made up of various shapes that intersect at odd angles using many different types and polishes of granite. Previously located just north of the news stand which is also north of the main station entrance, the sculpture was removed in 2013 due to deterioration, with plans to refurbish and relocate it elsewhere.

<text>In botany and agriculture, stunting describes a plant disease that results in dwarfing and loss of vigor. It may be caused by infectious or noninfectious means. Stunted growth can affect foliage and crop yields, as well as eating quality in edible plants. Stunted growth can be prevented through controlling quality of seeds, soil, and proper watering practices. Treatment will vary greatly depending on the root cause of the stunting. 

== Infectious ==
A stunt caused by infection can either be prevented or treated. Anti-microbial peptides may offer generalized protection against plant diseases that cause stunted growth. 
== Noninfectious ==
Stunted growth not caused by infection may be due to a wide variety of environmental factors. Environmental factors that affect plant growth include light, temperature, water, humidity and nutrition. There may be water imbalance, poor planting practices, poor nutrition, or physical injury to the plant. Using high quality seed and soil may mitigate stunted growth.

<text>Virginia Wesleyan University (VWU) is a private university in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The university is nonsectarian but historically affiliated with The United Methodist Church. It enrolls 4,632 learners in all locations: 1,676 students annually in undergraduate and graduate programs, 2,601 in VWU Global Campus (online and continuing education), and 355 students at LUJ/VWU Global (Japan). Virginia Wesleyan transitioned from a college to a university in 2017. 

The Virginia Wesleyan University campus is also home to the Chesapeake Bay Academy, an educational institution that educates and guides students with learning disabilities, including attention disorders (ADHD), dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and the Tidewater Collegiate Academy, an innovative laboratory for teaching and learning that extends from the primary grades through high school.

Through academic collaboration with local arts and sciences partners, on-site learning experiences are also provided at the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center and Brock Environmental Center in Virginia Beach; The Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk; Sentara College of Health Sciences in Chesapeake; and the Norfolk Botanical Garden.

In July 2023, Virginia Wesleyan and the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art announced their collaboration on the construction of a $25 million facility to be built on the University’s Virginia Beach campus. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in August 2024, celebrating the facility’s donors: Jane Batten, Joan Brock, and Susan and David Goode.

VWU collaborates with Virginia Beach Economic Development for a work development center, The Hive, in Virginia Beach. Approximately 3,000 continuing education learners benefit from joint programs at The Hive. In 2025, the University opened VWU-Chesapeake, a comprehensive program for those incarcerated at St. Brides Correctional Center and Indian Creek Correctional Center. 

==History==
The school was chartered in 1961 as Virginia Wesleyan College under the initiative of Methodist minister Joseph Shackford Johnston, later the college&#x27;s first president. It became a university in 2017.
==Academics==

=== Colleges and schools ===
Virginia Wesleyan University consists of four schools devoted to specific areas of study: the Susan S. Goode School of Arts and Humanities, the Joan P. Brock School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Birdsong School of Social Science, and the D. Henry Watts School of Professional Studies.

===Batten Honors College===
The Batten Honors College, named for Virginia Wesleyan Trustee Emerita Jane Batten and her late husband Frank Batten, Sr., was founded in 2017 with a mission to &quot;inspire, engage, and prepare academically talented students to become leaders, environmental stewards, and impactful citizens in the global community.&quot;

===VWU Global Campus===
Founded in 2017, VWU Global Campus enrolls 2,601 students in early enrollment, evening and weekend, online (undergraduate, graduate, and non-credit) and at LUJ/VWU Global (Japan). VWU Global Campus operates all for-credit programs outside of the traditional undergraduate program, the campus in Japan, and also supports non-credit, continuing-education offerings. In 2024, Lakeland University (WI) and VWU announced the joint establishment of the Jane P. Batten and David R. Black School for International Studies. Virginia Beach Economic Development, Tidewater Community College, and VWU share a workforce development center, The Hive, in Virginia Beach. Approximately 3,000 continuing education learners benefit from joint programs at The Hive. 

===Westminster/Wesleyan Lifelong Learning Institute===
The Westminster/Wesleyan Lifelong Learning Institute, a component of VWU Global Campus, was launched in 2017. Several courses will be taught during each of two regular semesters, and roughly half will be on faith-related topics. The University offers a wide variety of courses throughout the year for the nearly 1,000 residents of the Westminster-Canterbury on the Chesapeake Bay campus and roughly half are on faith-based topics. Over 1,100 learners enroll in Institute courses in 2024.

== Diversity and inclusion ==
Virginia Wesleyan often states its commitment to inclusivity and one of the institution&#x27;s core values within its &quot;Forging our Future: Building on Strength 2020-2030&quot; strategic plan reads, &quot;Inclusive and Caring Community that empowers members to form meaningful relationships through listening, understanding, and communication.&quot;

The university is regularly ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; among the top 25 institutions in Campus Ethnic Diversity for National Liberal Arts Colleges. According to the university profile, students represent 34 states and 10 countries, with 43 percent from underrepresented populations.

Virginia Wesleyan&#x27;s campus is the South Hampton Roads home for the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities. The 83-year-old organization opened a satellite office at VWU in December 2018.

Business leader and known civil rights advocate Harvey Lindsay made a $250,000 gift to Virginia Wesleyan in 2019 to enable the university to begin expanding the study of African-American history and traditions in Virginia.

==Campus==

Situated on in Virginia Beach, the university is separated into five villages. Bray Village (Village I) and Allen Village (Village II) offer combined living-learning environments built on the Jeffersonian model, with multi-purpose buildings. Brock Village (Village III) and Honors Village (Village IV) are solely housing units. Coastal 61 was added as a fifth village in 2020.

The Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; T. Williams Trail, leading from the Blocker Youth Center to Lake Taylor, was dedicated in October 2019 in memory of the 1975 graduate who was killed in the Virginia Beach Municipal Center shooting in May 2019.

The Greer Environmental Sciences Center, dedicated in 2017, received the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s National Conservationist of the Year Award in 2018. The facility is a state-of-the-art center for teaching and research. The 18-acre Wilson Arboretum was established in 1995 in memory of William M. Wilson, dean of the university from 1971 to 1994. Since 1997, retiring faculty members have chosen a tree to be planted within the arboretum to honor their service to the institution

The 12-acre Beech Forest, a rare example of an old-growth stand of beech trees, was designated a Natural Heritage Resource by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1992. The campus features over 13 miles of biking and hiking paths and trails.

==Athletics==

Virginia Wesleyan University sports teams are known as the Marlins. The university participates in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) and is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. VWU added supplemental conference membership with the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC). 

Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor/outdoor track and field, and volleyball. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor/outdoor track and field, and volleyball. VWU added co-ed Esports in 2019. In 2025, they announced the addition of women’s flag football.

In 2024, through a contract with the City of Virginia Beach, VWU added the new indoor track facility at the Virginia Beach Convention Center as its home site. The 2024 NCAA Division III National Indoor Track and Field Championship was hosted there. The University and Virginia Beach were awarded the 2028 hosting of the same event.

The university maintains an Athletic Hall of Fame honoring those who have made lasting contributions to Virginia Wesleyan&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic program through outstanding achievements or service.

In recent years, Virginia Wesleyan University has earned recognition as one of the top NCAA Division III programs in the country. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the national championship in 2006, and the following year returned to the championship game, which they lost. The women&#x27;s soccer team made it to the final four in 2006 after winning the ODAC tournament for the first time in program history. In 2016, Evan Cox was the Individual NCAA National Champion for Men&#x27;s Golf. The Virginia Wesleyan softball team won the 2017 NCAA Division III National Championship with a record 54 wins. Head Coach Brandon Elliott was named ODAC Coach of the Year and State Coach of the Year, while his coaching staff earned Regional and National Coaching Staff of the Year honors. Freshman pitcher Hanna Hull earned 2017 Schutt Sports/NFCA Division III National Freshman of the Year and honors as the first National Player of the Year in program history. In 2018, they repeated as NCAA Division III champions. Hull was again named National Player of the Year, and Elliott&#x27;s staff again earned National Coaching Staff of the Year honors. Despite a 42–6 overall record, and number one regular season rating in the NFCA Division III poll, the Marlins lost to the University of Lynchburg in the 2019 NCAA Regional Finals. In 2021, the VWU Softball team won its third national title in four (complete) season defeating the Texas Lutheran University in the NCAA Division III Championship best of three series with the Marlins claiming a 9–1 win in five innings in the deciding third game.

<doc id="966290" wikidata="Q2662845" url="?curid=966290" title="Plant disease">
<text>Plant diseases are diseases in plants caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Not included are ectoparasites like insects, mites, vertebrates, or other pests that affect plant health by eating plant tissues and causing injury that may admit plant pathogens. The study of plant disease is called plant pathology.

== Plant pathogens ==
=== Fungi ===
Most phytopathogenic fungi are Ascomycetes or Basidiomycetes. They reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soil borne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living saprotrophically, carrying out the role of their life cycle in the soil. These are facultative saprotrophs.

Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of fungicides and other agricultural practices. However, new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides.

Biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. Necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. 

Significant fungal plant pathogens include:

==== Ascomycetes ====
* &quot;Fusarium&quot; spp. (Fusarium wilt disease)
* &quot;Thielaviopsis&quot; spp. (canker rot, black root rot, &quot;Thielaviopsis&quot; root rot)
* &quot;Verticillium&quot; spp.
* &quot;Magnaporthe grisea&quot; (rice blast)
* &quot;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&quot; (cottony rot)

==== Basidiomycetes ====
* &quot;Ustilago&quot; spp. (smuts) 
* &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot; spp.
* &quot;Phakospora pachyrhizi&quot; (soybean rust)
* &quot;Puccinia&quot; spp. (severe rusts of cereals and grasses)(fungus)|rusts]].
* &quot;Armillaria&quot; spp. (honey fungus species, virulent pathogens of trees)

=== Fungus-like organisms ===
==== Oomycetes ====
The oomycetes are fungus-like organisms among the Stramenopiles. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens, such as the causal agents of potato late blight root rot, and sudden oak death. 

Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies, using effector proteins to turn off a plant&#x27;s defenses.

==== Phytomyxea ====
Some slime molds in Phytomyxea cause important diseases, including clubroot in cabbage and its relatives and powdery scab in potatoes. These are caused by species of &quot;Plasmodiophora&quot; and &quot;Spongospora&quot;, respectively.

=== Bacteria ===
Most bacteria associated with plants are saprotrophic and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, cause disease, especially in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. 

Most plant pathogenic bacteria are bacilli. &quot;Erwinia&quot; uses cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause soft rot. &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; changes the level of auxins to cause tumours with phytohormones. 

Significant bacterial plant pathogens include:
* Burkholderia
* Pseudomonadota
** &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; spp. 
** &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; spp.
* Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato causes tomato plants to produce less fruit, and it &quot;continues to adapt to the tomato by minimizing its recognition by the tomato immune system.&quot;

==== Mollicutes ====
&quot;Phytoplasma&quot; and &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; are obligate intracellular parasites, bacteria that lack cell walls and, like the mycoplasmas, which are human pathogens, they belong to the class Mollicutes. Their cells are extremely small, 1 to 2 micrometres across. They tend to have small genomes (roughly between 0.5 and 2 Mb). They are normally transmitted by leafhoppers (cicadellids) and psyllids, both sap-sucking insect vectors. These inject the bacteria into the plant&#x27;s phloem, where it reproduces.

=== Viruses ===
Many plant viruses cause only a loss of crop yield. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, except when they infect perennial species, such as fruit trees.

Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded RNA genomes. Some also have double stranded RNA or single or double stranded DNA. These may encode only three or four proteins: a replicase, a coat protein, a movement protein to facilitate cell to cell movement through plasmodesmata, and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector.

Plant viruses are generally transmitted by a vector, but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vectors are often insects such as aphids; others are fungi, nematodes, and protozoa. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the beet leafhopper that transmits the curly top virus causing disease in several crop plants.

=== Nematodes ===


Some nematodes parasitize plant roots. They are a problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Potato cyst nematodes (&quot;Globodera pallida&quot; and &quot;G. rostochiensis&quot;) are widely distributed in Europe and the Americas, causing worth of damage in Europe annually. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction, whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

=== Protozoa ===
A few plant diseases are caused by protozoa such as &quot;Phytomonas&quot;, a kinetoplastid. They are transmitted as durable zoospores that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant viruses. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium which invades the roots.

== Physiological plant disorders ==
Some abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. 

== Epidemics ==
Plants are subject to disease epidemics.

=== Port and border inspection and quarantine ===
The introduction of harmful non native organisms into a country can be reduced by controlling human traffic (e.g., the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service). Global trade provides unprecedented opportunities for the introduction of plant pests. In the United States, even to get a better estimate of the number of such introductions would require a substantial increase in inspections. In Australia a similar shortcoming of understanding has a different origin: Port inspections are not very useful because inspectors know too little about taxonomy. There are often pests that the Australian Government has prioritised as harmful to be kept out of the country, but which have near taxonomic relatives that confuse the issue.

X-ray and electron-beam/E-beam irradiation of food has been trialed as a quarantine treatment for fruit commodities originating from Hawaii. The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), USDA APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service), producers, and consumers were all accepting of the results - more thorough pest eradication and lesser taste degradation than heat treatment.

The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) anticipates that molecular diagnostics for inspections will continue to improve. Between 2020 and 2030, IPPC expects continued technological improvement to lower costs and improve performance, albeit not for less developed countries unless funding changes.

=== Chemical ===
Many natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat plant diseases. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from &quot;organic&quot; status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.

=== Biological ===
Crop rotation is a traditional and sometimes effective means of preventing pests and diseases from becoming well-established, alongside other benefits.

Other biological methods include inoculation. Protection against infection by &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, which causes gall diseases in many plants, can be provided by dipping cuttings in suspensions of &quot;Agrobacterium radiobacter&quot; before inserting them in the ground to take root.

== Economic impact ==

Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnose plant health and metabolism.

<doc id="966299" wikidata="Q2254080" url="?curid=966299" title="Atcham">
<text>Atcham is a village, ecclesiastical parish and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It lies on the B4380 (once the A5), 5 miles south-east of Shrewsbury. The River Severn flows round the village. To the south is the village of Cross Houses and to the north-west the hamlet of Emstrey.

==Local governance==
Atcham once belonged and gave its name to Atcham Rural District, before the village merged into the Borough of Shrewsbury in 1974 and came under Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. From 2009, Shrewsbury and Atcham joined the other districts of non-metropolitan Shropshire under Shropshire Council. The Parliamentary constituency covering the borough remained as Shrewsbury and Atcham until under constituency boundary changes in 2024 it was redesignated as Shrewsbury, dropping the Atcham name. In population (243 in 2001), Atcham was the smallest village to be named in a UK Parliamentary constituency.

==History==
The village has the only church in England dedicated to Saint Eata, Bishop of Hexham. The reason for the dedication is unclear, as there is no written record of Eata coming so far south. However, there is a crop photograph from the 1970s of a field in Attingham Park showing the site of a Saxon palace identical to one excavated near Hexham. &quot;Atcham&quot; is a contraction of &quot;Attingham&quot;, meaning &quot;the home of Eata&#x27;s people&quot;. The church building dates from the 11th century.

The local airfield RAF Atcham, now returned to agriculture and light industry, was held by an American training unit for much of World War II. It used P-47 Thunderbolts and later P-38 Lightnings for operational training of fighter pilots posted in from the United States. Almost 50 pilots were lost in accidents flying from there.

The A5 London–Holyhead road once crossed the village, but now runs to the north on a dual-carriageway.

==Notable people==

In order of birth:
*Ordericus Vitalis (1075 – c. 1142), chronicler and Benedictine monk, was baptised in the village.
*Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, convenor of the Geneva Bible translation, possible inspiration for the character Old Sir Rowland in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like&quot; built the first stone bridge over the river here as part of his wider civic projects across London and Shropshire. 
*Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick (1745–1789), politician and landowner, builder of Attingham Park, was buried at the village church.
*Anna Kingsford (1846–1888), first female English medical graduate and vegetarian, was buried at the village church.
*Marjorie Chibnall (1915-2012), eminent medieval historian and editor of Orderic Vitalis&#x27; &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;.
*Digby Tatham-Warter (1917–1993), Second World War British Army officer famed for carrying an umbrella.
*Dick Sale (1919–1987), first-class cricketer and school headmaster, was born in the village.

==Features==
Landmarks at Atcham include Attingham Park, seat of the Berwick barons until the title became extinct in 1953. The hall at Attingham Park is now the regional headquarters of the National Trust. Also on the estate is the Shropshire office of Natural England. Adjacent to Attingham Park is Home Farm, Attingham. Now separate from the hall that it traditionally supplied, it is a family-run organic farm and tearoom open to the public.

The older of the two bridges at Atcham, built in 1769–1771 by John Gwynn, is commonly known as Atcham Bridge. It is both Grade II* listed and a scheduled monument. Its replacement, opened in 1929, carries the old A5 (B4380) road over the River Severn.
The village has a public house, the &quot;Mytton &amp; Mermaid&quot;, owned at one time by Clough Williams-Ellis as a staging post to his iconic Italianate village of Portmeirion. The school closed half a century ago. The post office and petrol station, located adjacent to the old school, have also closed. The old school buildings and adjacent house were sold to Mr and Mrs Caswell in 1982, who have since run a small car sales and repair business.

Atcham has a timber-framed village hall, the Malthouse, built in the 17th century as such, but after disuse converted in the 19th century into a carpenter&#x27;s shop for the Attingham estate. It was opened after restoration in 1925 as the village hall and dedicated to the memory of the men of Atcham who had died in First World War. It has a sprung floor bought from a dance hall in Shrewsbury.

Outside the parish to the east, is the village of Wroxeter, formerly a Roman town and currently the site of one of Shropshire&#x27;s commercial vineyards. Also there is the Atcham Business Park/Industrial Estate on the site of the old airfield. Despite its name, it lies in the neighbouring civil parish of Wroxeter and Uppington, although after the Diocese of Lichfield made some boundary changes, it is now in the ecclesiastical parish of Atcham.

<text>Franklin Pierce Adams (November 15, 1881 – March 23, 1960) was an American columnist known as Franklin P. Adams and by his initials F.P.A. Famed for his wit, he is best known for his newspaper column, &quot;The Conning Tower&quot;, and his appearances as a regular panelist on radio&#x27;s &quot;Information Please&quot;. A prolific writer of light verse, he was a member of the Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s and &#x27;30s.

==New York newspaper columnist==
Adams was born Franklin Leopold Adams to German Jewish immigrants Moses and Clara Schlossberg Adams in Chicago on November 15, 1881. He changed his middle name to &quot;Pierce&quot; when he had a bar mitzvah at age 13. Adams graduated from the Armour Scientific Academy (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1899, attended the University of Michigan for one year and worked in insurance for three years.

Signing on with the &quot;Chicago Daily Journal&quot; in 1903, he wrote a sports column and then a humor column, &quot;A Little About Everything.&quot; The following year he moved to the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;, where he worked from 1904 to 1913 and began his column, then called &quot;Always in Good Humor,&quot; which used reader contributions.

During his time on the &quot;Evening Mail&quot;, Adams wrote what remains his best known work, the poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon,&quot; a tribute to the Chicago Cubs&#x27; double play combination of &quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot;. In 1911, he added a second column, a parody of Samuel Pepys&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot;, with notes drawn from F.P.A.&#x27;s personal experiences. In 1914, he moved his column to the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, where it was famously retitled &quot;The Conning Tower&quot; and was considered to be &quot;the pinnacle of verbal wit&quot;.

During World War I, Adams was in the U.S. Army, serving in military intelligence and also writing a column, &quot;The Listening Post,&quot; for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; editor Harold Ross. While serving in the army, he became a captain. After the war, the so-called &quot;comma-hunter of Park Row&quot; (for his knowledge of the language) returned to New York and the &quot;Tribune&quot;. He moved to the &quot;New York World&quot; in 1922, and his column appeared there until the paper merged with the inferior &quot;New York Telegram&quot; in 1931. He returned to his old paper, by then called the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, until 1937, and finally moved to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, where he ended his column in September 1941.

During its long run, &quot;The Conning Tower&quot; featured contributions from such writers as Robert Benchley, Edna Ferber, Moss Hart, George S. Kaufman, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John O&#x27;Hara, Dorothy Parker and Deems Taylor. Having one&#x27;s work published in &quot;The Conning Tower&quot; was enough to launch a career, as in the case of Dorothy Parker and James Thurber. Parker quipped, &quot;He raised me from a couplet.&quot; Parker dedicated her 1936 publication of collected poems, &quot;Not So Deep as a Well&quot;, to F.P.A. Many of the poems in that collection were originally published in &quot;The Conning Tower&quot;.

Much later, the writer E. B. White freely admitted his sense of awe: &quot;I used to walk quickly past the house in West 13th Street between Sixth and Seventh where F.P.A. lived, and the block seemed to tremble under my feet—the way Park Avenue trembles when a train leaves Grand Central.&quot;

Adams is credited with coining the term &quot;aptronym&quot; for last names that fit a person&#x27;s career or job title, although it was later refined to &quot;aptonym&quot; by Frank Nuessel in 1992.

==Satires==
*&quot;No Sirree!&quot;, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called &quot;La Chauve-Souris&quot; directed by Nikita Balieff. Robert Benchley is often credited as the first person to suggest the parody of Balieff&#x27;s group.

:&quot;No Sirree!&quot; had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin. Acts included: &quot;Opening Chorus&quot; featuring Woollcott, Toohey, Kaufman, Marc Connelly, Adams, and Benchley with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; &quot;He Who Gets Flapped,&quot; a musical number featuring the song &quot;The Everlastin&#x27; Ingenue Blues&quot; written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert Sherwood accompanied by &quot;chorus girls&quot; including Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Ruth Gillmore, and Lenore Ulric; &quot;Zowie, or the Curse of an Akins Heart&quot;; &quot;The Greasy Hag, an O&#x27;Neill Play in One Act&quot; with Kaufman, Connelly and Woollcott; and &quot;Mr. Whim Passes By - An A. A. Milne Play.&quot;

* F.P.A. often included parodies in his column. His satire of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was later collected in his book, &quot;Something Else Again&quot; (1910):
: &quot;Soul Bride Oddly Dead in Queer Death Pact&quot;
: &quot;High-Born Kinsman Abducts Girl from Poet-Lover—Flu Said to Be Cause of Death—Grand Jury to Probe&quot;
:Annabel L. Poe of 1834 3rd Ave., the beautiful young fiancee of Edmund Allyn Poe, a magazine writer from the South, was found dead early this morning on the beach off E. 8th Street. Poe seemed prostrated and, questioned by the police, said that one of her aristocratic relatives had taken her to the &quot;seashore,&quot; but that the cold winds had given her &quot;flu,&quot; from which she never &quot;rallied.&quot; Detectives at work on the case believe, they say, that there was a suicide compact between the Poes and that Poe also intended to do away with himself. He refused to leave the spot where the woman&#x27;s body had been found.

==Radio==
As a panelist on radio&#x27;s &quot;Information Please&quot; (1938–48), Franklin P. Adams was the designated expert on poetry, old barroom songs and Gilbert and Sullivan, which he always referred to as Sullivan and Gilbert. A running joke on the show was that his stock answer for quotes that he didn&#x27;t know was that Shakespeare was the author. (Perhaps that was a running gag: &quot;Information Please&quot;&#x27;s creator/producer Dan Golenpaul auditioned Adams for the job with a series of sample questions, starting with: &quot;Who was the Merchant of Venice?&quot; Adams: &quot;Antonio.&quot; Golenpaul: &quot;Most people would say &#x27;Shylock.&#x27;&quot; Adams: &quot;Not in my circle.&quot;) John Kieran was the real Shakespearean expert and could quote from his works at length.

A translator of Horace and other classical authors, F.P.A. also collaborated with O. Henry on &quot;Lo&quot;, a musical comedy.

==Death and burial==

Adams died in Manhattan and was cremated at the Ferncliff Crematory in Hartsdale. The ashes were buried in Ferncliff Cemetery but have no marker.

==Film portrayal==
Adams was portrayed by the actor Chip Zien in the film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994).

==Quotes==
*&quot;I find that a great part of the information I have was acquired by looking up something and finding something else on the way.&quot;
*&quot;To err is human; to forgive, infrequent.&quot;
*&quot;Elections are won by men and women chiefly because most people vote against somebody rather than for somebody.&quot;
*”You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have, for instance.”

<text>Konstanty Iwanowicz Ostrogski ( – 10 August 1530; ) was a Ruthenian prince and magnate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He later had the title of grand hetman of Lithuania from 11 September 1497 until his death in 1530.

==Life==
He began his military career under John I Albert (&quot;Polish&quot;: Jan I Olbracht), King of Poland. He took part in successful campaigns against the Tatars and Grand Duchy of Moscow. For his victory near Ochakiv against Mehmed I Giray&#x27;s forces he was awarded with the title of Grand Hetman of Lithuania. He was the first person to receive this title. However, during a war with Muscovy he was defeated in the Battle of Vedrosha (1500) and held captive for three years. In 1503, he managed to escape and joined king Sigismund I the Old, who allowed him to resume his post as a hetman. As one of the main military leaders (alongside Polish generals Mikołaj Firlej and Mikołaj Kamieniecki) of the alliance he continued to wage war against the Grand Duchy of Moscow and in 1512 achieved a great victory against the Tatars in the Battle of Wisniowiec.

In 1514, another war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow started and he became the commander in chief of all the Polish and Lithuanian forces (amounting to up to 35,000 soldiers). Among his subordinates were Jerzy Radziwiłł, , Witold Sampoliński and the future Hetman of the Crown Jan Tarnowski. On 8 September 1514 he achieved a significant victory in the Battle of Orsha, defeating the army of Vasili III of Russia. However, in 1517, his attempt to besiege the Russian fortress of Opochka became a serious defeat that destroyed any hopes to reconquer Smolensk.

He died in 1530 as a well-respected military commander. Despite his steady loyalty to Catholic Poland as well as an old feud with an Orthodox Muscovy, Ostroh himself remained a devout Orthodox in traditions of his family. He gave generously for construction of Eastern Orthodox churches and sponsored the creation of many church-affiliated schools for the Orthodox children. As one of the wealthiest Orthodox nobles he was buried in the Dormition Cathedral of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra in Kyiv.

==Legacy==
He is one of the characters on the famous painting by Polish painter Jan Matejko, &quot;Prussian Homage&quot;.

The town of Starokostiantyniv still bears his name. The Lithuanian–Polish–Ukrainian Brigade is also named after him. For his wars against Crimea see Crimean-Nogai Raids, years 1508–1527, including Battle of Olshanitsa.

==Family==
He had two wives: Tatiana Koretska and Aleksandra Słucka. He had two sons: Illia Ostrogski with Koretska, and Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski with Słucka.

<doc id="966307" wikidata="Q2707355" url="?curid=966307" title="Kevin Kelly (editor)">
<text>Kevin Kelly (born 1952) is the founding executive editor of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and a former editor and publisher of the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;. He has also been a writer, photographer, conservationist, and student of Asian and digital culture.

==Life==
Kelly was born in Pennsylvania, United States, in 1952, and graduated from Westfield High School, Westfield, New Jersey, in 1970. Through his father, an executive for &quot;Time&quot; who used systems analysis in his work, Kelly developed an early interest in cybernetics. He attended the University of Rhode Island for one year, studying geology.

Kelly has traveled extensively, backpacking in Asia. While travelling in the Middle East, he had a conversion experience and became a born-again Christian. He was raised Catholic.

He lives in Pacifica, California, a small coastal town just south of San Francisco. He is married to the biochemist Gia-Miin Fuh and has three children: Kaileen, Ting, and Tywen.

Among Kelly&#x27;s personal involvements is a campaign to make a full inventory of all living species on earth, an effort also known as the Linnaean enterprise. He is also sequencing his genome and co-organizes the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup Group.

==Career==
Kelly began contributing freelance articles to &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; in 1980, while living in Athens, Georgia. Around this time, he was also editing his own start-up magazine called &quot;Walking Journal&quot;, and working in an epidemiology laboratory to support himself.

He was hired in 1983 by Whole Earth founder Stewart Brand to edit some of the later editions of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;, and &quot;Signal&quot;. With Brand, Kelly helped found the WELL, an influential virtual community. As director of the Point Foundation, he co-sponsored the first Hackers Conference in 1984.

In 1992, Kelly was hired by Louis Rossetto to serve as executive editor of &quot;Wired&quot;, which was launched in March 1993. He brought to the magazine the cybernetic social vision of the Whole Earth publications and their networked style of editorial work, while also recruiting writers and editors from the WELL. He stepped down as executive editor in 1999; his current job title at &quot;Wired&quot; is Senior Maverick. Partially due to his reputation as &quot;Wired&quot;″s editor, he is noted as a participant in and an observer of cyberculture.

Kelly&#x27;s writing has appeared in many other national and international publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Veneer Magazine&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. His photographs have appeared in &quot;Life&quot; and other American national magazines.

As well as serving as editor on many publications, Kelly has written many novels surrounding his interest in cybernetics and all things tech. He is known for coining the term &quot;The Technium,&quot; the accumulation of all technologies and inventions as a working, living system. Much of his work revolves around technology as a &quot;living organism.&quot; He even refers to &quot;The Technium&quot; as the seventh kingdom of nature, that is self-organizing and autonomous. Kelly&#x27;s book-length publication, &quot;Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot; (1992), presents a view on the mechanisms of complex organization. The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organisations, intelligent computers, and to the human brain.

He helped found the All Species Foundation. He was a futurist adviser on the Steven Spielberg-directed movie &quot;Minority Report&quot;.

Kelly has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27;s book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

<text>Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World () is a 1992 book by Kevin Kelly. Major themes in &quot;Out of Control&quot; are cybernetics, emergence, self-organization, complex systems, negentropy and chaos theory. The book can be seen as a work of techno-utopianism.

==Summary==
The book&#x27;s central theme is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but is much more like a beehive composed of small, simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organizations, intelligent computers, and the human brain.

==Reception==
Although the book was not widely reviewed upon its initial release in 1992, it gained visibility, was reviewed, and was extensively cited in subsequent years. Reviews often discussed Kelly&#x27;s hive-mind analogy as a metaphor for the New Economy.

Reviewers have called the book a &quot;mind-expanding exploration&quot; (&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;) and &quot;the best of an important new genre&quot; (&quot;Forbes ASAP&quot;).

Critics of the book have contended that its position precludes a critical approach to politics and social power.

Located at Porter Square at the intersection of Massachusetts and Somerville Avenues, the station provides rapid transit access to northern Cambridge and the western portions of Somerville. Porter is 14 minutes from Park Street on the Red Line, and about 10 minutes from North Station on commuter rail trains. Several local MBTA bus routes also stop at the station.

A series of commuter rail depots have been located at Porter Square under various names since the 1840s. The modern station with both subway and commuter rail levels was designed by Cambridge Seven Associates and opened on December 8, 1984. At below ground, the subway section is the deepest station on the MBTA system. The station originally had six artworks installed as part of the Arts on the Line program. Five of these remain, including &quot;Gift of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Glove Cycle&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
There has been a railroad station at Porter Square since the Fitchburg Railroad began operations in the early 1840s. The first station, built in 1843–1845, was called Porter&#x27;s Station. A new station building was constructed in 1854. Later stations at the site were known as North Cambridge, then later simply as Cambridge. In 1869, the original station was moved to the North Avenue (now Massachusetts Avenue) bridge over the tracks.

===B&amp;M era===

A new station was built in 1897, slightly to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937–38, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the waiting room and platforms below. The new station opened on May 2, 1938; the old station was demolished to make room for a parking lot for the adjacent Sears, Roebuck and Company store. As passenger traffic declined, the B&amp;M sold and leased disused station buildings; the Cambridge station was converted to office use by 1968.

===MBTA era===
By the time the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing northside commuter rail operations in the late 1960s, both the Lexington Branch and the Central Mass Branch had been reduced to single rush hour round trips on poorly maintained track. The South Sudbury run on the Central Mass was terminated on November 26, 1971. The Bedford round trip on the Lexington Branch ended after a major snowstorm on January 10, 1977, leaving the Fitchburg Line (with multiple daily round trips) as the only rail service at Cambridge station.

===Adding the Red Line===

In the late 1970s, Cambridge station was renamed to Porter when it became certain that the Red Line Northwest Extension would include a stop there. (&quot;Cambridge&quot;, while sufficient for a commuter rail station, would have been confusing for a rapid transit station, because the Red Line has multiple stations—five in total—in the City of Cambridge.) The Red Line platforms were built in a deep-bore tunnel, while the commuter platform was rebuilt with an accessible mini-high platform. During construction, commuter trains were accessed via a staircase from Somerville Avenue. On September 30, 1980, construction worker Paul Leone was killed when a retaining wall collapsed.

A new glass and concrete headhouse was built around 1982, and the complete new transfer station opened on December 8, 1984, along with . The new station, designed by Cambridge Seven Associates, won awards from the American Institute of Architects and the American Consulting Engineering Council of New England. Porter and Davis were the first MBTA stations made accessible during initial construction, rather than by renovation. A second entrance on the west side of Massachusetts Avenue was added in the late 1980s.

Because of its Red Line connection, Porter Square can serve as a temporary inbound terminus for the Fitchburg Line service when commuter rail service is disrupted between Porter and Boston&#x27;s North Station. It served this role during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when North Station was closed for a week for security purposes, and during Green Line Extension construction in 2015 and 2019–20. Additional weekday short turn service was operated between Porter and North Station from July 15–26, 2024, providing half-hour headways between those points while the Red Line was closed for maintenance work.

The staircase from Somerville Avenue was removed in 2020 during retaining wall reconstruction; a new staircase may be added later. An extension of the Union Square Branch of the Green Line Extension from to Porter has been proposed by local officials.
==Station layout==

Porter station has a glass-covered headhouse located on the east side of Massachusetts Avenue just south of Somerville Avenue. The station has four below-ground levels.. The Fitchburg Line runs approximately east-west in an open cut, with a single island platform between the two tracks. Most of the platform is low, with a raised mini-high platform at the west end under Massachusetts Avenue. Direct stair entrances to the platform are located on both sides of Massachusetts Avenue.

A mezzanine, partially under Somerville Avenue east of White Street, is one level deeper. It contains fare machines, faregates for the Red Line, a convenience store, and – unusually for the MBTA system – public restrooms. Stairs, escalators, and elevators connect the mezzanine to the platforms and the surface. MBTA bus routes serve the station.

South of Porter Square, the Red Line runs north-south under Massachusetts Avenue. North of the square, the avenue turns to the northwest, while the Red Line runs north in a deep-bored tunnel to Davis Square. The Red Line platforms are mostly north of the headhouse, partially under the Porter Square Shopping Center. The subway tracks and platforms are enclosed in a single cylindrical concrete shell. The two platforms are at different levels, with the inbound (southbound) platform above and laterally offset from the outbound platform. The platforms are near the center of the shell, with the outbound track on the east side and the inbound track on the west side.

At below ground level, the outbound platform is the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter&#x27;s unusual depth is due to the MBTA&#x27;s decision to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is , the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled in the bottom of the escalator.

===Accessibility===

Porter is fully accessible; elevators lead from street level to the mezzanine with its accessible bathrooms, to the commuter rail platform, and to both Red Line platform levels. Although most of the commuter platform is low, there is a &quot;mini-high platform&quot; – a one-car-length high section – that allows level boarding.

The station was originally built with three elevators: from Elm Street to the fare lobby, from the lobby to both Red Line platforms, and from the lobby to the commuter rail platform. The MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations as part of the settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;. The three existing elevators were overhauled, and two redundant elevators were added, in a $12 million project.

The elevator to the Red Line platforms was out of service for construction from March 21, 2011, to June 22, 2012; an accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and . The elevator to the commuter rail platform was also taken out of service from December 9, 2011, to July 2012; a shuttle bus ran between , Porter, and . An elevator from Massachusetts Avenue to the lobby opened later that year, followed by an overhaul of the existing street elevator; the redundant Red Line platform elevator was completed in 2013.
==Arts on the Line==
As a part of the Red Line Northwest Extension, Porter was included as one of the stations involved in the Arts on the Line program, devised to bring art into the MBTA&#x27;s subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.

Six works, five of which remain, were placed at Porter:
* &quot;Gift of the Wind&quot; by Susumu Shingu, a tall kinetic sculpture with three large red &quot;wings&quot; that rotate the structure in response to the wind
* &quot;Ondas&quot; by Carlos Dorrien, a tall piece of undulating granite affixed to the station wall both inside the station and outside
* &quot;Glove Cycle&quot; by Mags Harries, a large number of bronze gloves of varying types and sizes scattered inside the station, including alongside one of the escalators
* &quot;Untitled&quot; by William Reimann, six granite bollards with various ethnic designs carved into them
* &quot;Porter Square Megaliths&quot; by David Phillips, four boulders with large &quot;slices&quot; removed and replaced with bronze casts of the missing pieces
* &quot;The Lights at the End of the Tunnel&quot; by William Wainwright, a large reflective mobile in the station&#x27;s mezzanine. It was removed in 1993 after a lead weight fell off.

<text>Ahlam Mosteghanemi (; born 13 April 1953, Tunisia) is an Algerian poet and writer. She was the first Algerian woman to write poetry and fiction in Arabic. She has published four novels and six anthologies, and is best known for her 1993 novel &quot;Memory of the Flesh&quot;. In 2007 and 2008, she was ranked #96 and #58 respectively as the most influential Arab by the Arabian Business magazine.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Mosteghanemi&#x27;s family was originally from Constantine in eastern Algeria. Her father, an Algerian nationalist, was imprisoned following the 1945 Sétif riots in which two of his brothers were killed. He was released in 1947 and the family relocated to Tunis, Tunisia, where Mosteghanemi was born in 1953. Her father continued his activism and support of Algerian independence. After Algeria gained independence in 1962 he took prominent positions in the government of Ahmed Ben Bella. In 1965, the Boumediene coup d&#x27;état removed Ben Bella from power, and her father suffered a mental breakdown and was sent to a hospital in Algiers. His mental struggles and the continued political turmoil in Algeria left him resentful, confused, and disillusioned.

In the absence of her father, Mosteghanemi, as the eldest sibling, provided for her family by working as a radio host. At the age of seventeen, she became popular in Algeria with a poetic daily show, &quot;Hammassat&quot; (Whispers). In 1973, she became the first woman to publish a compilation of poetry in Arabic when she published &quot;Ala Marfa al Ayam&quot; (To the Day&#x27;s Haven). This was followed in 1976 by &quot;Al Kitaba fi Lahdat Ouray&quot; (The Writing in a Moment of Nudity). Mosteghanemi belonged to the first generation in Algeria that was able to study and write in Arabic, after more than a century of prohibition by the French.

Mosteghanemi received her first degree in Literature from the University of Algiers. Following involvement in women&#x27;s rights activism, she was then denied enrolment in a Master&#x27;s programme at the same university, with the board of directors stating that her freedom of expression would have a negative effect on the other students. She was also expelled from the Union of Algerian Writers for not conforming to the established political line. Mosteghanemi consequently pursued her doctoral studies in France, earning a PhD in sociology from Sorbonne University with her thesis, later published as &quot;Algérie, femmes et écritures&quot; (Algeria, Women, and Writings) in 1985, about the representation of women in both Francophone and Arabic literature.

== Literary career ==
It was during Mosteghanemi&#x27;s fifteen years she spent in Paris writing for various magazines and fragments of what would, after four years, become a novel that she transitioned from poetry to prose, stating that &quot;When we lose a love, one writes a poem, when we lose our homeland, one writes a novel&quot;. She said Algeria was never far from her mind. &quot;There are countries that we live in and countries that live in us&quot;.

In 1993, Mosteghanemi settled in Lebanon and her first novel, &quot;Zakirat el Jassad&quot; (Memory of the Flesh), was published. The editor of publishing house &quot;Dar Al Adab&quot;, described the novel as a poetic love story, told with political bravado, that echoed the disappointment of a generation of Arabs, and predicted that it would be a success throughout the Arab world. In a letter to the author, contemporary Arab poet Nizar Qabbani said, &quot;This novel gave me vertigo.&quot; President Ben Bella said from exile, &quot;Ahlam is an Algerian sun that illuminates the Arab world&quot;.

&quot;Memory of the Flesh&quot; earned Mosteghanemi the Naguib Mahfouz Prize in 1998, the Arabic equivalent of the Goncourt, and the Nour Prize for the best female work in the Arabic language. The jury for the &quot;Ahlam is a light that shines in darkness. She was able to break out of the linguistic exile into which French colonialism had relegated Algerian intellectuals.&quot; By 2008, &quot;Memory of the Flesh&quot; had entered its 19th edition and had sold over 130,000 copies.

Mosteghanemi continued her literary career with two sequels: &quot;Fawda el Hawas&quot; &quot;(&quot;The Chaos of Senses&quot;)&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Aber Sareer&quot;” &quot;(&quot;Bed Hopper&quot;)&quot; in 2003.

In 2010, she published &quot;Nessyan.com&quot; &quot;(&quot;The Art of Forgetting&quot;)&quot;, a break-up manual for women, which brought her closer to a female audience.

In 2012, her novel, &quot;El Aswad Yalikou Biki&quot; &quot;(&quot;Black Suits You So Well&quot;)&quot;, was published. The story described the struggle of a young Algerian teacher whose father, a singer, had been killed by terrorists opposed to any form of art and joy in society. The novel addresses the challenges of standing up not only to terrorism, but also to the power of money and the media.

In 2001, Mosteghanemi established the Malek Haddad Literary Prize to encourage more Algerians to write in Arabic.

Since June 2008, she has been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations.

== Personal life ==
Mosteghanemi married Lebanese journalist Georges El Rassi in Paris in 1976. They have three sons together and live in Beirut, Lebanon.

<text>Flight sergeant (commonly abbreviated to Flt Sgt, F/Sgt, FSGT or, currently correctly in the RAF, FS) is a senior non-commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and several other air forces which have adopted all or part of the RAF rank structure. It is equivalent to a staff sergeant or colour sergeant in the British Army, a colour sergeant in the Royal Marines, and a chief petty officer in the Royal Navy, and has a NATO rank code of OR-7. In the RAF, flight sergeant ranks above chief technician and below warrant officer.

==History==
The rank was introduced into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1912 and passed to the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918. RFC flight sergeants wore a four-bladed propeller between the chevrons and the crown.

On 1 July 1946, aircrew flight sergeants were redesignated &quot;aircrew I&quot; and replaced their chevrons with three six-pointed stars within a wreath and surmounted by an eagle and a crown. This proved unpopular however, and in 1950 they reverted to their old rank and badge, although flight sergeants aircrew wear an eagle between chevrons and crown.

Between 1950 and 1964, the rank of chief technician was equivalent to flight sergeant and was held instead of that rank by technicians, but now chief technician is a junior rank (still held only by technicians), although classified by NATO in the same grade.

==Current usage==
Apart from the RAF, the rank of flight sergeant is also used by many Commonwealth air forces, including the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the Sri Lanka Air Force, the Ghana Air Force, the South African Air Force, the Air Force of Zimbabwe and the Royal Thai Air Force. It was also used in the former Royal Rhodesian Air Force. In Canada, since the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, this rank has been replaced by warrant officer. It is also used in the Irish Air Corps, where it is equivalent to the Irish Army rank of company sergeant. The flight sergeant rank in the Indian Air Force was replaced with the rank of junior warrant officer (JWO), which ranks below a warrant officer and above a sergeant.

In the RAF, the rank insignia is three downward pointing chevrons below a crown.

Flight sergeant is also used in many cadet organisations around the world, such as the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, Australian Air Force Cadets, and Royal Canadian Air Cadets.

<doc id="966347" wikidata="Q313647" url="?curid=966347" title="Ron McGovney">
<text>Ronald J. McGovney (born November 2, 1963) is an American semi-retired musician, best known as the original bass guitarist in the thrash metal band Metallica from October 1981 to December 1982.

Having previously played with guitarist James Hetfield in the garage band Leather Charm, McGovney was a member of Metallica during its first year of gigging and appeared on their early demos before departing late in 1982. After a period of inactivity, he played in the thrash metal band Phantasm. He later played with Metallica at their 30th anniversary show.

==Career==

===Leather Charm and Metallica===

In June 1981, McGovney formed his first band, Leather Charm, with his childhood friend Hetfield and guitarist Hugh Tanner of Hetfield&#x27;s previous band, Phantom Lord. Tanner soon left Leather Charm to pursue a career in music management; the subsequent lineup featured guitarist Troy James and drummer Jim Mulligan. The group rehearsed a set of New Wave of British Heavy Metal covers and original material for a period of months, but Mulligan&#x27;s departure later that year led to the band&#x27;s demise.

Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich established their new project, Metallica, in October 1981. With the addition of McGovney and guitarist Dave Mustaine early the next year, the first gigging lineup of the band was completed. After their debut performance on March 14, the band spent 1982 rehearsing in McGovney&#x27;s parents&#x27; long-since-demolished rental property near the 605 freeway and building a local following in the Los Angeles and Orange County heavy metal scenes. They recorded several demos during this time, including one recorded in McGovney&#x27;s garage, the &quot;Power Metal&quot; demo and the &quot;No Life &#x27;Til Leather&quot; demo. A recording of the song &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; with McGovney playing bass was featured on a repressing of the &quot;Metal Massacre Vol. 1&quot; album.

McGovney&#x27;s time in Metallica was reportedly tumultuous, as he often clashed with Ulrich and Mustaine. He felt that, aside from using his connections made as an amateur photographer, his role was that of monetary and transportation provider, rather than a respected member of the band. He ultimately quit on December 10, 1982, due to growing tensions, and was replaced by Cliff Burton. After leaving Metallica, McGovney became uninterested in playing music and sold most of his equipment.

===Phantasm===
In 1986, Hirax vocalist Katon W. De Pena persuaded McGovney to return to music. The two formed the thrash metal band Phantasm with guitarist Rodney Nicholson and several other musicians, briefly including Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan. Phantasm released a demo but never recorded a proper album, and disbanded in 1988 due to disagreements between members. In 2001, the thrash label Deep Six Records released the &quot;Wreckage&quot; CD, packaging a remastered version of the band&#x27;s demo of the same name with a live set from 1987.

===Later activity===
McGovney ceased his musical career after the demise of Phantasm, but gave sporadic interviews and appeared at Metallica-related events. Phantasm discussed a possible reunion in 2007, but this ultimately failed to materialize.

He performed publicly for the first time in 23 years on December 10, 2011, playing two songs (&quot;Hit the Lights&quot; and &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot;) onstage with Metallica, Mustaine, and early studio guitarist Lloyd Grant, among others, at The Fillmore as a part of the celebrations surrounding the end of the group&#x27;s third decade. Two years later, he joined Mustaine&#x27;s band Megadeth onstage in Charlotte, North Carolina, on December 5, 2013, sharing the lead vocal on a cover version of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;.

McGovney has said that, although his time in Metallica came to an acrimonious end, he now gets along with his former bandmates and speculates that, given his disposition and skills, he might have been better able to contribute to the band had he worked as road manager rather than bass guitarist.

<text>Chief technician (Chf Tech or formerly C/T) is a senior non-commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force which is only held by aviators in technical trades and by musicians. It is between sergeant and flight sergeant and, like the latter has a NATO code of OR-7. Aviators in non-technical trades progress directly from sergeant to flight sergeant. Along with junior technician this is a survivor of a separate ranking system for technicians introduced in 1950 and abolished in 1964. During that period it was equivalent to flight sergeant, but was made junior to that rank in 1964. Chief technicians are usually addressed as &quot;Chief&quot;.

The rank of Chief Technician falls into Supplement 3 Pay Scales, an exception is Weapons Technician, which falls into Supplement 2 Pay Scales.

This enhanced pay rewards those who wish to take on a technical trade. It is quite normal for a Trade Group (TG1) Supp 3 C/T (airframes/avionics) to be paid more than a TG17 Supp 1 Flight Sergeant (admin). 

To mitigate the extra ranks, a Chief Technician is said to receive a &#x27;Flight Sergeants pension&quot; after 2 years in rank and are currently receiving an extra uplift in pay (daily), due to holding &quot;technical status&quot;, as part of the DERR Policy set out on NEM2016.

==Rank insignia==
The rank badge is three chevrons below a four-bladed propeller which is essentially the same badge as Royal Flying Corps sergeants wore. Between 1950 and 1964 the badge was three point up chevrons below a crown.

<text>Bobby Muller (born 1946) is an American peace advocate.

He was born on Long Island, and grew up in Great Neck, New York. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1967, during the Vietnam War. His commission with the Marines began the same day he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Hofstra University in 1968, and by September of that year he was a combat lieutenant leading a marine infantry platoon. In April 1969, while leading an assault in Vietnam, a bullet entered his chest and severed his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.

After returning from Vietnam, Muller became a staunch advocate for veterans&#x27; rights and a peace activist. In 1974, he earned his J.D. degree from the Hofstra University School of Law. In the same year, he appeared in the anti-war documentary film &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, speaking about his life before, during, and after the Vietnam War. He founded Vietnam Veterans of America in 1978 and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) in 1980. The VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won a 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.

In 2004, Muller founded Alliance for Security. He is currently serving as an advisory board member for a group called Operation Truth and for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation.

Muller is president of Veterans for America (formerly known as the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation). Veterans for America is uniting the new generation of veterans with those from past wars to address the needs of veterans, service members and their families and their larger concerns about the impact of war. It is an advocacy and humanitarian organization. Veterans for America is committed to advancing policy and elevating public discourse on the causes, conduct and consequences of war.

Muller is a friend of Bill Wieman, Mark Clevinger, and Ron Kovic. He has lectured about his experiences on over 100 college campuses.

== Appearances==
In 1994, Muller was the subject of an ABCNews magazine story called, Muller&#x27;s Mission. The piece, which aired on DayOne, focused on Muller&#x27;s life story, his experience in a Vietnam Vet&#x27;s hospital system, and building the Vietnam Vets of America movement in the 1970s. It also documented his work with landmine victims in Cambodia and included the first ever network news interview with his friend and supporter Bruce Springsteen. The piece would go on to win an EMMY award the following year.

In a 1997 MSNBC &quot;NewsChat&quot; segment, Muller debated Ann Coulter. Muller attempted to explain to Coulter that &quot;In 90 percent of cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up—Ann, are you listening?—they were our own mines.&quot; She interrupted Muller&#x27;s point about the role that landmines played in the Vietnam War with the statement &quot;No wonder you guys lost.&quot; Muller responded to Coulter&#x27;s remark with an incredulous &quot;Say that again,&quot; while moderator Felicia Taylor sharply rebuked the in-house pundit: &quot;OK, we&#x27;re not going to get into that conversation. Ann, that was unnecessary! Mr. Muller, please continue...&quot;

<doc id="966394" wikidata="Q1723278" url="?curid=966394" title="Michigan International Speedway">
<text>Michigan International Speedway (formerly named as the Michigan Speedway from 1997 to 2000) is a D-shaped oval superspeedway in Brooklyn, Michigan. It has hosted various major auto racing series throughout its existence, including NASCAR, CART, and IndyCar races. The speedway has a capacity of 56,000 as of 2021. Along with the main track, the facility also features three road course layouts of varying lengths designed by British racing driver Stirling Moss, which utilizes parts of the oval, parts located within track&#x27;s infield, and parts located outside of the track&#x27;s confines. The facility is owned by NASCAR and is led by track president Joe Fowler. 

In the 1960s, Windsor Raceway owner Lawrence LoPatin ordered the construction of Michigan International Speedway to expand his recreational holdings. The facility was completed in 1968, running its first races in October of the same year. Soon after, the track fell into financial trouble after a series of business decisions by LoPatin to expand his auto racing company, American Raceways, sunk the company into major amounts of debt. In 1973, American Raceways sold ownership of the speedway to motorsports businessman Roger Penske, who saved the facility from financial ruin. Under Penske&#x27;s leadership, the facility was expanded extensively. In 1999, the facility was sold off to the France family-owned International Speedway Corporation (ISC). MIS underwent major downsizing in the 2010s in efforts to modernize the facility, with capacity decreasing to more than half of its peak. Track ownership again changed hands in 2019, when NASCAR merged with ISC.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
The track in its current form is measured at , with 18 degrees of banking in the turns, 12 degrees of banking on the frontstretch, and five degrees of banking on the backstretch. Numerous road track layouts exist within the track&#x27;s infield and outside the track&#x27;s confines. As part of the original construction plan, a road course designed by British racing driver Stirling Moss was made. The road course is split into three different layouts made to cater to different abilities of racers. Different layouts of , , and were reported by the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot;. 

=== Amenities ===
Michigan International Speedway is served by U.S. Route 12 and M-50, and covers over 1,400 acres according to &quot;The Daily Telegram&quot;. As of 2021, MIS has a capacity of 56,000 according to &quot;Autoweek&quot;. At its peak, the track boasted a seating capacity of 137,243 in 2006 according to &quot;Autoweek&quot;. MIS contains three luxury seating options: the Acceleration Club in the track&#x27;s fourth turn, the Champions Club located underneath the track&#x27;s press box, and the Victory Lane Club near the track&#x27;s pit road.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===
In March 1966, treasurer of the newly-built horse racing track Windsor Raceway, Lawrence LoPatin, expressed hopes of expanding the raceway into a &quot;resort complex&quot;. After a visit to the Florida-based Sebring International Raceway, he decided that the first phase of expansion would include the construction of a &quot;Grand Prix type auto-racing track, from 2.5 to 2.9 miles in length.&quot; After studying several markets, he decided to build a racetrack that would serve the Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago areas. Four months later in July, LoPatin announced initial plans to build the Michigan Motor Raceway, a , 100,000-seat track on the intersection between Interstate 94 and U.S. Route 23 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Although groundbreaking was scheduled to start on October 1, the plan was killed that same month due to mounting opposition from local residents. Another site approximately south of the original location was then considered. In April 1967, the site was revealed to be in Lenawee County in Cambridge Township, with LoPatin later stating in a press conference the following month that he hoped to start construction on the track in the next 90 days pending the formation of a financing plan for a budget of $4 million. By September, local media reported that the now , $4.5 million facility was set to open sometime in 1968. To finance the facility, track officials filed a registration statement in October to publicly offer common stocks and debentures that totaled approximately $3 million.

Groundbreaking on the Michigan International Speedway (MIS) occurred on September 27, 1967, with British racing driver Stirling Moss commencing construction. Initial plans for the facility included a oval designed by Charles Moneypenny and an &quot;extension&quot; road course layout designed by Moss, with Moss stating that the road course was split into three layouts meant to accommodate different skill levels of racers; one at , one at , and one at . An opening date for MIS was set for October 6, 1968, with a IndyCar-style race inaugurating the facility; the date was later pushed back a week. For MIS&#x27; first race, two grandstands seating 12,500 were constructed, putting seating capacity at 25,000. In September, Gordon Johncock and Wally Dallenbach Sr. ran the first testing laps at the facility, with Johncock setting a fastest lap of .

=== Turbulent American Raceways years ===
MIS opened as scheduled on October 13, 1968, with Ronnie Bucknum winning the first ever race at the facility amidst a crowd of 55,108. Although the race was seen as a success, the facility experienced major traffic problems, with traffic jams on the two-lane U.S. Route 12 being reported as long as . Three days after its inaugural race, NASCAR signed a 10-year contract to run two NASCAR Grand National Series races annually. In the following months, LoPatin striked numerous business deals to grow what would eventually become American Raceways, Inc. (ARI). In December, LoPatin announced a merger with the Atlanta International Raceway (AIR). Within the first couple months of 1969, he announced the construction of the Texas International Speedway and the purchase of controlling interest of the Riverside International Raceway. Later in the year, LoPatin stated his intents of building another facility in Burlington County, New Jersey. LoPatin&#x27;s business endeavors were seen as a response to the rising popularity of auto racing in the United States in the 1960s, with LoPatin being a key figure in said expansion. The first NASCAR Cup Series race at MIS was ran on June 15, with Cale Yarborough winning the event. In November, the track&#x27;s first general manager, Frank Cipelle, was appointed. 

By the end of the 1969 racing season, although the racing at MIS was praised, weather problems during all four major races in the season affected attendance and in turn, the facility&#x27;s profits. American Raceways&#x27; troubles were soon publicized after their director of operations, Les Richter, left the company. MIS lacked a United States Auto Club (USAC) event after 1968 due to MIS disagreeing with USAC for the amount of purse money needed for a USAC race, depriving fans of promised major IndyCar racing. In addition, LoPatin entered into a dispute with NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. over how stock car racing should expand its popularity. In January 1970, ARI merged with the STP Corporation; by this point, ARI had amassed over $15 million in debt. Weather and subsequent attendance declines that year further compounded ARI&#x27;s financial issues. Throughout the first half of 1970, LoPatin faced criticism for his handling of the Atlanta International Raceway, with AIR track officials leading campaigns to sack LoPatin after several executives either left or were fired by LoPatin. 

==== Short-lived leadership of Les Richter ====
LoPatin was fired from his position as chairman of ARI on July 30, 1970, on the condition that the company continue its commitments to running the remaining events at ARI-owned tracks the following month. Les Richter, who had left the company a few months earlier, was appointed as the new chairman of ARI. Although MIS track officials stated optimistic hopes of revitalizing ARI by ending its mass expansion and cancelling the proposed New Jersey project, in October, Manufacturers National Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings to pay off over $1 million in overdue mortgage payments, with local Michigan law stating that the speedway had to be sold at a sheriff&#x27;s auction in order to pay off the overdue payments. Despite the law, MIS general manager Frank Cipelle stated that the chances of the auction ever happening were &quot;very little&quot;. After the auction was delayed twice, on January 10, 1971, the &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that MIS&#x27; financial problems were resolved, with ARI selling its 48% interest of Riverside International Raceway worth $425,000 to avoid the auction. However, a year later, although Richter admitted that they were able to make a profit in the 1971 racing season, it was not enough to pay off the facility&#x27;s debentures. As a result, MIS submitted a bankruptcy petition, entering receivership. The ousted LoPatin was asked by Richter to create a financing plan to save the track from liquidation in March; however, all plans fell through, and the track was ordered to be sold at a sheriff&#x27;s auction in December. 

=== Roger Penske era ===

==== Early Penske years ====

Initially, an offer was made by the Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit for $1.458 million was made in December, with oil businessman Pat Patrick and car dealership owner James S. Gilmore Jr. taking over the facility if the purchase went through. By March 1973, Patrick along with two other businessmen agreed to buy out the facility for $2.5 million, with the sale effective on June 14. However, on May 26, motorsports businessman Roger Penske announced that he had taken over the option to purchase the facility from Patrick, with Penske stating that the announcement of Patrick buying the facility &quot;was a bit premature.&quot; Penske&#x27;s purchase was approved by judge David Patton on June 1, with Penske paying $2.7 million for the facility. 

Upon the purchase&#x27;s approval, Penske stated in a press conference that he aimed to renovate the garage area and numerous spectator amenities along with repaving the oval&#x27;s surface. He also cautioned that the track&#x27;s schedule may be cut down depending on how races in June and July of that year did. General manager Frank Cipelle left his position soon after Penske&#x27;s purchase, being replaced by John LeFere. Official attendance estimates of the next two races reached 88,500, being seen as a success in local Michigan media. As a result, Penske approved the running of a doubleheader IndyCar race, revitalizing the track. By the next year, Penske proclaimed in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; that MIS had the &quot;greatest potential of any track in the U.S.&quot;, with Penske stating in an interview with the &quot;Free Press&quot;&#x27; Joe Falls that he aimed to expand seating capacity if attendance remained high. Penske later stated that year that he hoped to eventually expand the facility to seat more than 100,000.

Renovations and incidents under Penske&#x27;s early leadership remained slow. Initially, Penske sought to construct a roval-style road course contained within the infield of MIS to replace the original road course layout, but the plans were postponed due to a contractor&#x27;s strike. In 1977, a resurfacing of MIS&#x27; track surface was announced in August and completed approximately two months later. In the early 1980s, MIS added seating capacity a total of three times, adding in 1981, 1982, and 1985. In 1986, MIS underwent another resurfacing that was completed in time for the 1986 Miller American 400. That same year, MIS oversaw its first driver fatality when NASCAR driver Rick Baldwin crashed during a qualifying session on June 16, dying 11 years later in a coma due to complications from the crash. The following year, track officials planned to add a dog-leg chicane on the track&#x27;s backstretch to slow down speeds for IndyCar races; however, the idea was scrapped after testing. In 1988, MIS expanded grandstand seating capacity to &quot;over 40,000.&quot; In 1992, Clifford Allison became the second fatality to occur at the facility when he crashed during a practice session for a NASCAR Busch Series race. 

Numerous leadership changes occurred until the mid-1980s. In 1978, LeFere resigned from his position as general manager, being replaced by Citibank executive Jim Melvin. Melvin left soon after to become the president of Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), being replaced by United Airlines executive Rick Nadeau in November 1979. Nadeau left track leadership three years later to become a sports marketer for a printing company, with Darwin Doll replacing Nadeau. Doll held the position until 1986, when he was replaced by Gene Haskett when Doll left to serve as the general manager of Sears Point International Raceway.

==== Mass expansion in twilight Penske years, CART incident ====
In the 1990s, MIS underwent mass expansion to accommodate a growth of popularity in NASCAR. In 1990, Haskett announced further renovations to the facility, including the addition of 5,779 seats, additional bathrooms, and a new backstretch concrete wall. Two years later, 11,700 seats were added to increase the seating capacity to &quot;about 70,000&quot; along with a new tall scoreboard. By 1993, with the addition of 6,700 seats, track attendance for races began to rival the Michigan state record for attendance at a sporting event. Amidst criticism of the track surface for being too bumpy, the track surface was repaved in the winter of 1995. Additional seats were added in 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1999, increasing the grandstand seating capacity to over 125,000. In 1996, MIS renamed itself to Michigan Speedway in order to be named similar to other tracks Penske owned. On July 26, 1998, three fans were killed and a further six were injured during a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) event when a crash involving Adrián Fernández sent a tire into the grandstands. In response to the incident, the protective catchfence around the track was increased by four feet.
=== International Speedway Corporation and NASCAR eras ===

==== Purchase by ISC, renovations ====
In May 1999, Penske, who by this point owned numerous tracks under the Penske Motorsports Inc. name, including Michigan Speedway, agreed to merge the company with the France family-owned International Speedway Corporation, officially merging approximately two months later. The following year, the speedway reverted back to its original Michigan International Speedway name, revealing a new logo in the process. At the end of 2000, Haskett retired after 14 years of service, being replaced by W. Brett Shelton as general manager. In 2004, the track&#x27;s walls were replaced with SAFER barriers in response as part of an effort to make the track safer in the wake of the death of Dale Earnhardt. That same year, Shelton announced the construction and renovation of numerous amenities, including the construction of a &quot;multi-level sky lounge&quot; built behind the frontstretch grandstands. In 2006, Shelton retired from his position, giving the position up to Roger Curtis, California Speedway&#x27;s vice president of marketing and sales. Renovations to the first turn grandstands were announced in 2008. The following year, track officials announced the demolition of the track&#x27;s old media center, replacing it with a two-story, solar-powered media center. In 2011, further renovations were announced to the facility&#x27;s tram system and the track&#x27;s scoreboard. The following year, the track was repaved for the fourth time in its history.

==== Capacity decline, change to NASCAR ownership ====
In the 2010s, MIS underwent a mass capacity decrease. In 2010, track officials announced the removal of 12,000 seats in the track&#x27;s third turn in an effort to modernize the track. In 2012, MIS track officials also announced the construction of a luxury campsite complex, in the process tearing down grandstands in the track&#x27;s third and fourth turns. By 2014, after another set of grandstands in the track&#x27;s third turn were torn down, capacity was recorded to be as low as 71,000. In 2016, Curtis resigned from his position, being replaced by minor league baseball executive Rick Brenner. In 2018, seating capacity went down further to 56,000 to build a new campground area. In 2019, the ownership of MIS switched hands to NASCAR when ISC and NASCAR merged in a $2 billion buyout. That same year, a new care center was built in the track&#x27;s infield. In October 2021, NASCAR&#x27;s director of marketing for the American Midwest, Joe Fowler, replaced a resigning Rick Brenner to become the track&#x27;s general manager.

== Events ==

=== Racing ===

==== NASCAR ====
As of 2024, MIS runs one annual NASCAR weekend: the Firekeepers Casino 400, held in August. For most of its existence, it ran two annual Cup Series events a year: one in June, and one in August. Both events held their inaugural events in 1969. With the exception of 1973 when the August race was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts, the tradition continued until 2021, when NASCAR removed the June race from their annual schedule. Along with its Cup Series races, MIS also currently hosts third-tier NASCAR Truck Series support races for the Cup Series with the Henry Ford Health System 200. Before 2025, MIS also held second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series support events.

==== Open-wheel racing ====
Until the early 2000s, open-wheel racing was commonplace at the facility. Major open-wheel races at MIS were primarily sanctioned by three organizations: the United States Auto Club (USAC), Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), and the Indy Racing League (IRL). USAC held its first event at the speedway in October 1968; the speedway&#x27;s inaugural event. After failing to renew the following year, USAC was able to return to the facility in 1970. Starting in 1973, USAC sanctioned a second event at the track that took place in the fall. USAC continued to race at MIS until 1978, when CART took over both dates.

The track&#x27;s summer date was extended to a race in 1981. The race was sanctioned by CART until 2002, when the IRL officially took over the sanctioning rights for the race. With the IRL taking over, the race distance was decreased to . IRL raced annually at the track until 2007, when the IRL failed to renew a deal to keep racing at the facility; the IRL remains the last open-wheel series to have raced at the facility. 

The latter fall date ran until 1986, when the date was dropped from CART&#x27;s schedule in efforts to eliminate instances of CART racing at a venue twice per year. In the midst of the CART–IRL split in the mid-1990s, CART organized a second event in 1996 that was made to rival the Indianapolis 500: the U.S. 500, which ran on the same day as the Indianapolis 500. However, after one iteration of the event, the race was scrapped.

==== Other racing events ====
*Starting in 1974, the International Race of Champions (IROC) raced at the facility. The series raced there annually until 1979. IROC returned annually in 1984, and with the exception of 1986, the facility became a fixture on the IROC schedule. IROC ran its final race at the facility in 2001.
* Since 1996, MIS has hosted the cross country finals for the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA).

=== Other events ===
* Starting in 2012, MIS was the ending point for the Wish-A-Mile bike charity ride organized by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It last appeared on the ride&#x27;s itinerary in 2017.
* Since 2013, the facility has played host to the Faster Horses Festival, a country music festival.

<text>The River Clun runs mostly through Shropshire, England and joins the River Teme at Leintwardine, Herefordshire. The Clun Valley is part of the Shropshire Hills AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty).

==Course==
The River Clun has its source near the hamlet of Anchor (in a marshy area near the public house), close to the border of Wales. It flows east through the small town of Clun until Aston on Clun where it flows roughly southwards — the river flows around the north of Clunbury Hill. The river enters the lower valley — which widens and has a flatter floor (an extensive flood plain).

The Folly Brook joins the Clun at Newcastle, and the River Unk flows into the Clun near Clun Castle, whilst the River Kemp flows into the river at Oaker near Aston. Near the end of the river&#x27;s course, the River Redlake joins at Jay.

Just south of Broadward (a Site of Special Scientific Interest for a stretch south of Broadward Bridge) the river flows into Herefordshire where it joins the River Teme.

==Features==
Many settlements along the course of the river incorporate the river&#x27;s name, including Clun, and the villages of Newcastle-on-Clun, Clunton, Clunbury, Aston on Clun, and Clungunford. In Clun, the historic Clun Bridge still takes the A488 road over the river. A number of other historic crossings — bridges and fords — exist over the river, including Broadward Bridge.
==Ecology==
The River Clun is an ideal habitat for otters, salmon, white-clawed crayfish, European bullhead, grayling and brook lamprey. The river is also noted as a habitat for the freshwater pearl mussel. The Clun and one of its tributaries, the Unk, have suffered pollution and sediment build up, undermining the mussel&#x27;s habitat. The catchment area of the river is mostly rural and produces beef, lamb, potatoes and maize.

The Clun is one of only eleven watercourses in England that is home to the mussel and one of three English rivers that has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation.

A citizen science project, the River Clun Monitoring Group, has been established to monitor, and track changes in, the river&#x27;s ecological condition.

<text>Davis station is an underground Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Red Line rapid transit station located at Davis Square in Somerville, Massachusetts. The accessible station has a single island platform for the Red Line, as well as a dedicated busway on the surface. It opened in 1984 as part of the Red Line Northwest Extension project.

==Station design==

The station has a single underground island platform, oriented approximately east-west under Davis Square. It has two brutalist concrete headhouses – at College Avenue on the east side of the square, and at Holland Street on the west side. A fare mezzanine running the length of the station connects the two headhouses and the platform. A skylight in the plaza provides natural light to the mezzanine. The station is accessible, with elevators connecting the mezzanine to the platform and the College Avenue headhouse.

An off-street busway served by MBTA bus routes – – is located next to the east headhouse. Inbound buses on routes that do not terminate at Davis do not use the busway; they instead stop on surface streets near the station entrances. A &quot;Pedal and Park&quot; bicycle cage is located east of the east headhouse.
==History==
===Railroad station===
The first transit service to what would become Davis Square was a horsecar line to Union Square, Somerville via Elm Street and Somerville Avenue, which was opened by the Somerville Horse Railroad (later part of the Cambridge Railroad) in 1858 and extended to Lechmere Square in 1864. Its carhouse was located on Dover Street just west of Elm Street. A second route to Lechmere Square was opened in 1888 by successor West End Street Railway and electrified on July 14, 1894; the Elm Street route was electrified on November 23, 1895. Clarendon Hill Carhouse opened on August 8, 1896, replacing the Dover Street facility. The two routes were converted to trolleybus on November 8, 1941, and to bus on March 31, 1963; the Elm Street line is now route 87 and the Highland Avenue line route 88.

When opened in 1846, the Lexington Branch split from the Fitchburg Railroad at West Cambridge. In 1870, the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&amp;L) bought the Lexington Branch to prevent it from becoming a competitor. The B&amp;L built a cutoff from to Somerville Junction, which opened on December 1, 1870. Among the stations on the line was Elm Street, located in the triangle between Elm Street (now College Avenue) and Holland Street. In January 1876, William Robinson installed one of the first test applications of his track circuit signaling system on the line between Elm Street and North Avenue. On June 14, 1876, Pedro II of Brazil travelled to Elm Street station to view the system.

The Massachusetts Central Railroad began service on October 1, 1881; it used most of the 1870-built cutoff to reach Boston. Operations were suspended from 1882 to 1884; it was leased by the B&amp;L in 1886. The station was renamed to West Somerville in the mid-1880s. The B&amp;L was acquired by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) in 1887. The streetcar and railroad service stimulated substantial development in the 1870s and 1880s as Davis Square quickly grew into an active commercial center. A boom in residential construction followed in the 1890s.

The city proposed to eliminate the grade crossings on the line, including the pair of College Avenue and Holland Street at Davis Square, in the early 1900s. Most grade crossings on the Fitchburg Railroad mainline were eliminated over the next decade, but those on the Lexington Branch cutoff were not. On January 31, 1915, the West Somerville station building was moved west of Holland Street at the request of the mayor to improve conditions in the square. By this time, the station was often called Davis Square, though its official name remained West Somerville. The B&amp;M discontinued ticket and baggage service at the station in 1924.

In 1926–27, as part of construction of a new centralized freight yard in Somerville, the B&amp;M built two new sections of track which allowed the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad to use the Fitchburg mainline east of Alewife Brook Parkway. On April 24, 1927, passenger service was rerouted over the rebuilt line; North Cambridge, West Somerville, and Somervile Highlands stations were closed. Although residents were opposed to the closures, the B&amp;M wished to avoid the grade crossings on the line, which had seen 70 crashes in the past six years. The old line through Davis Square became the freight-only Fitchburg Cutoff; it was rebuilt with heavier rails to handle heavy freights headed to and from the new Somerville freight yard. The abandoned station was damaged by fire on June 12, 1929, and again during a riot on July 4, 1938. It is no longer extant. In 1935, the city requested that the line be grade-separated as part of a Works Progress Administration-funded grade crossing elimination program. However, the grade crossings were not eliminated; crashes and stalled freight trains continued to be a problem in the square.

===Red Line station===

In the 1970s, local officials and citizen groups successfully petitioned the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to create a Red Line subway stop in Somerville at Davis Square. Freight service over the Fitchburg Cutoff through Davis Square, which had been reduced in the mid-1970s, ended entirely in April 1980. Davis station opened on December 8, 1984, spurring major development and revitalization of the area.

Davis and Porter were the first MBTA subway stations made accessible during initial construction, rather than by renovation. In June 1993, Margaret McCarthy, a blind woman, fell off the platform and was killed by electrocution by the third rail. McCarthy was an advocate for adding tactile warning strips to the edges of station platforms; her death prompted the MBTA to finally install warning strips at all subway stations.

A $6.6 million design contract was awarded in April 2020 for accessibility improvements at Davis and . Initial plans called for two new surface elevators and two new platform elevators, and to add new walkways on the mezzanine level to connect the elevators. Design reached 30% in 2021; by that time, the project scope had been changed to add replacement of two existing elevators, and to only add one new platform elevator. Design work reached 75% completion in 2022 and was nearly complete by November 2023.
==Arts on the Line==

As a part of the Red Line Northwest Extension, Davis was included as one of the stations involved in the Arts on the Line program. Arts on the Line was devised to bring art into the MBTA&#x27;s subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.

Four of the original twenty artworks are located at Davis station. These works are:
* &quot;Ten Figures&quot; by James Tyler – Life-size people created out of cement, placed in areas around Davis Square
* &quot;Children&#x27;s Tile Mural&quot; by Jack Gregory and Joan Wye – Many tiles created by children placed on the brick wall of the station mezzanine. In 2009, a group of local artists attempted to find as many of the tile-makers as possible. The schoolchildren are now 35–45 years old.
* &quot;Poetry&quot; by various poets – Lines of poems are embedded into bricks on the station platform floor
* &quot;Sculpture with a D&quot; by Sam Gilliam – A large scale, brightly colored, abstract work

Nine panels of community art were added on the platform level in May 2008.

<doc id="966410" wikidata="Q118004" url="?curid=966410" title="Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev">
<text>Cyprian (c. 1336 – 16 September 1406) was a prelate of Bulgarian origin, who served as the Metropolitan of Kiev, Rus&#x27; and Lithuania (2 December 1375–12 February 1376) and the Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus&#x27; (12 February 1376–16 September 1406) in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. During both periods, he was opposed by rival hierarchs and by the Grand Prince of Moscow. He was known as a bright opinion writer, editor, translator, and book copyist. He is commemorated by the Russian Orthodox Church on May 27 and September 16 (by the Old style).

==Early life==
Cyprian was a clergyman of Bulgarian origin. He is supposed to have been born in aristocratic family of Tsamblak family from the capital Tarnovo. After his upbringing, education, and worldview, he was a hesychast. As a young man Cyprian studied at Kilifarevo, just south of Tarnovo, where he possible accepted his monastic vows and where a disciple of Gregory of Sinai named Theodosius of Tarnovo, who had founded a Hesychast monastery. In Kilifarevo monastery Cyprian met with future Bulgarian patriarch (between 1375 and 1393) Euthymius, who also was studying hesychasm and was later regarded as one of the most important figures of medieval Bulgaria. In 1363 along with Euthymius, Theodosius, and two of Theodosius&#x27;s followers, Cyprian arrived in Constantinople where he was introduced to Patriarch Callistus I and for a few months studied at the Monastery of Stoudios. Following the death of Theodosius (27 November 1363), Cyprian continued his studies at Mount Athos, becoming a Hesychast. On the other hand, according to Dimitri Obolensky, Cyprian only became a monk in the early 1370s in Constantinople. At Mount Athos Cyprian befriended Philotheus Kokkinos. In the beginning of the 1370s, after the return of Philotheus to the patriarchal throne, Cyprian became &quot;his closest monk&quot;.

==Background==
In 1356, after diplomatic struggles, Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople united the Metropolis of Halych with the Metropolis of Lithuania under the leadership of Metropolitan Roman. Callistus also confirmed that Alexius remained in possession of the &quot;Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;&quot;. All eparchies of the Halych metropolis were transferred to the jurisdiction of a united &quot;Metropolis of Lithuania-Volhynia&quot; (also known as &quot;Lithuania–Halych&quot;). The rivalry between Roman and Alexius continued until Roman&#x27;s death in 1362, when Lithuania–Halych was placed under the control of Alexius. In 1371, the united metropolis was officially lowered to the rank of a bishopric and placed under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;. However, it did not end the political rivalry for religious influence in Rus&#x27;.

==Career==
===Hostilities between Lithuania and Muscovy===
The Grand Duke of Lithuania — Algirdas — attacked Muscovy on three occasions between 1368 and 1372 as part of the Lithuanian–Muscovite War. This was in support of his ally, Mikhail II, Prince of Tver. It may also have been motivated by a desire to advance his calls for a separate metropolis for the Grand Duchy that was independent of Moscow. Cyprian was sent by the Patriarch as a trustee (envoy) to the Rus&#x27; princes in the Lithuanian and Muscovite lands with the goal to reconcile the Lithuanian and Tverite princes with Metropolitan Alexius and to prevent the total division of the Church between Wilno and Moscow. In winter of the same year, it is possible that Cyprian visited Kiev for the first time along with other cities of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 9 March 1374 he visited Tver on the consecration of the Bishop of Tver, Euthymius. Later, with Metropolitan Alexius, he left for Pereslavl-Zalessky. Cyprian returned to Constantinople from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania carrying a letter from Orthodox Christian Lithuanian-Ruthenian with a request to the patriarch to consecrate him as the Metropolitan of Lithuania.

Hostilities between Moscow and Lithuania resumed; in August 1375 Muscovite troops captured Tver. Patriarch Philotheus I was aware of the threat of Catholization of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He therefore agreed to satisfy the petitions of the previous Grand Duke of Lithuania —Algirdas — to create a separate metropolis in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Philotheus also listened to the petitions of the Eastern Orthodox princes to have Cyprian as their metropolitan. On 2 December 1375 at the Council of Constantinople, Philotheus consecrated Cyprian as &quot;Metropolitan of Kiev, Rus&#x27; and Lithuania&quot;, under a condition that &quot;upon the death of Alexius, Cyprian should become the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&quot;.

===Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;===
On 6 June 1376, Cyprian arrived at his residence in Kiev. He attempted, but failed, to get recognition of his rights in the metropolitan diocese from the Grand Duke of Moscow — Dmitri Donskoi. In fear of his life both from the Grand Duke as well as the approaching armies of Tokhtamysh, Cyprian chose to live either in Lithuania or at Constantinople. On 12 February 1378, Alexius died; by the terms of the agreement with the patriarch, Cyprian was entitled to rule the religious affairs of all Rus&#x27;. Instead, the Grand Prince deposed him without seeking the permission of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In his place, the Grand Prince appointed Pimen (1380–1384). Later, the Grand Price also deposed Pimen. He next appointed Dionysius (1384–1385), again without the permission of Constantinople. In February 1389, Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople convened a council that restored the unity of the metropolis by finally recognizing Cyprian as &quot;the true bishop of all Rus&#x27;&quot;. In 1390, Cyprian returned to Moscow and was recognised as the legitimate Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; by the new Grand Prince — Vasili II. Cyprian held this title until his death in 1406. During his term, his main objectives were to preserve a unified metropolis in Rus&#x27; and to secure peace with Lithuania.

==Achievements==

Cyprian is remembered as a wise and experienced church administrator who fought for the unity of the Russian church. In fact, he is mainly responsible for uniting the Church in the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He faced serious opposition during his metropolitanate; Dmitry Donskoy and his advisors were excommunicated for opposing Cyprian&#x27;s efforts to take up his place in Moscow, and Novgorod the Great – especially Archbishops Aleksei and Ioann II – also opposed his efforts to adjudicate ecclesiastical cases there, which would have allowed him to gain the court fees from Novgorod during the time he sat in judgement there.

Cyprian was an erudite person and alumnus of Tarnovo Literary School. He oversaw the copying and creation of a number of important works, including the &quot;Troitskaia Chronicle&quot; (or &quot;Troitskaya letopis&quot;) and, probably, the &quot;Metropolitan Justice&quot; (also known as the &quot;Pravosudiye metropolich’ye&quot; or Правосудие митрополичье). He also rewrote the &quot;Life of Metropolitan Peter,&quot; originally written around 1327. He also corrected biblical books and translated a number of ecclesiastic works from Greek into Old Church Slavic.

The Book of Degrees (&quot;Stepénnaya kniga&quot;), which grouped Russian monarchs in the order of their generations, was started by Cyprian in 1390 (but completed only in 1563).

==Death==
He died on 16 September 1406. Cyprian is buried in the Assumption Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin. He was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in the 15th century. St. Kiprian Peak on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Cyprian.

<text>Clun Bridge is a historical bridge in the small town of Clun, Shropshire, England dating from 1450 which crosses over the River Clun.

The bridge is still an important bridging point over the River Clun and carries the A488 and B4368 roads over it, despite being a stone packhorse bridge.

Alternatively, there is a ford to cross the River Clun at Clun. Recently the local authorities have been looking into an alternative route for the A488 main road through Clun, as neither the ford nor the ancient bridge are adequate in meeting the demands of modern heavy traffic. Satellite navigation systems used by some lorry drivers are making the problem worse, as they are currently directing traffic down the A488, without giving warning of the narrow bridge.

Some remedial work was carried out on the approaches to the bridge in 2006 to mitigate the effects of long and heavy vehicles using it. During the carrying out of these works there was much disruption in the wider area due to the closing of this important bridging point to traffic.

The bridge is at above sea level.

<text>The reporter of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States is the official charged with editing and publishing the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States, both when announced and when they are published in permanent bound volumes of the &quot;United States Reports.&quot; The reporter is responsible for only the contents of the &quot;United States Reports&quot; issued by the Government Publishing Office, first in preliminary prints and later in the final bound volumes. The reporter is not responsible for the editorial content of unofficial reports of the court&#x27;s decisions, such as the privately published &quot;Supreme Court Reporter&quot; and &quot;Lawyers&#x27; Edition&quot;.

By federal statute, the reporter is appointed by the Supreme Court. The office is currently held by Rebecca Anne Womeldorf.

==History==
The first two reporters acted in an unofficial capacity. Only in 1817 did Congress create the statutory office of reporter, with a $1,000 a year salary. The early reporters profited from selling the printed volumes of the reports of decisions. In 1874, Congress for the first time appropriated funds to publish the volumes of the court&#x27;s opinions; from that time the report was known as the &quot;United States Reports&quot; and numbering began as if the first volume by the first reporter, Alexander J. Dallas, was number one. The Government Printing Office took over publication of the &quot;United States Reports&quot; in 1922. The title of court&#x27;s reporter was changed to &quot;Reporter of Decisions&quot; in 1953, to clarify the duties of the office.

==List of reporters==
The 16 reporters of decisions are listed here with their tenures and the volumes of the &quot;United States Reports&quot; they edited. Through volume 90, the volumes were also known by the name of the reporter and the numbers of those &quot;nominative reports&quot; are listed after the &quot;United States Reports&quot; numbers.

<doc id="966415" wikidata="Q5136615" url="?curid=966415" title="Clun Castle">
<text>Clun Castle is a medieval ruined castle in Clun, Shropshire, England. Clun Castle was established by the Norman lord Robert de Say after the Norman invasion of England and went on to become an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th century, with an extensive castle-guard system. Owned for many years by the Fitzalan family, Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack until it was gradually abandoned as a property in favour of the more luxurious Arundel Castle. The Fitzalans converted Clun Castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th century, complete with pleasure gardens, but by the 16th century the castle was largely ruined. Slighted in 1646 after the English Civil War, Clun remained in poor condition until renovation work in the 1890s.

Today the castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument. It is owned by the Duke of Norfolk, who also holds the title of Baron Clun, and is managed by English Heritage.

==Architecture==
Clun Castle is located on a bend in the River Clun, overlooking the small town of Clun and its church (on the other side of the river). The river provides natural defences from the north and west, whilst the main keep of the castle stands upon a large motte or mound. Most historians conclude that this is primarily a natural elevation of rock, which has then been cut and scarped into its current, although others argue that it is mostly artificial. Three similar, but less dramatic mounds around the main motte provide the basic structure for the castle defences.

The remains of the tall, four-storey rectangular great keep are still standing on the north side of the motte. In large part this a typical late Norman keep, wide, similar to those locally at Alberbury, Bridgnorth and Hopton, featuring pilaster buttresses and round-headed Norman windows. Unusually the keep is off-centre, probably to allow the foundations greater reach and avoid placing excessive pressure on the motte – a similar design can be found at Guildford Castle. The ground floor was used for storage, with the upper three storeys for the family&#x27;s residential use. Each floor had its own large fireplace and five windows. The great keep appears powerful, but was built as a compromise between security and comfort – the building has relatively few arrowslits – many of the externally visible arrowslits are fakes and the building as a whole could easily have been undermined.

On the highest point of the main motte are the remains of one wall of what appears to have been an earlier small square keep, probably dating from the 11th or 12th century. The remains of a bridge, linking the main motte with the south-west mound, can just be seen to the south of this; this bridge would have formed the main route to the town. South of the bridge is the site of the gatehouse, while the foundations of a great round tower can be seen to the south-west. Along the west front are the remains of two solid turrets, built in possible imitation of Château Gaillard. A number of domestic buildings once stood inside the main bailey, including a grange, a stable and a bakehouse. The earthworks of two further bailey walls can be seen on the east side of the castle.

The surrounding grounds around Clun Castle have been extensively developed in the past and a pleasure garden can still be made out in the field beyond the River Clun to the west. To the north-east lies the remains of a fish pond, with a sluice connecting this to the river.

==History==

===11th–12th centuries===
Before the Norman invasion, the manor of Clun was owned by Eadric the Wild. The area around Clun was rugged, thinly populated and covered in extensive forests in early medieval times. Clun Castle was originally established by Robert de Say, also known as Picot, an early Norman baron who seized the territory from Edric; Robert built a substantial motte castle with two baileys. Robert held the castle and district from the Earl of Shrewsbury until 1102. After the Shrewsbury rebellion of that year, Robert and his descendants held their castle directly from the Crown.

Picot&#x27;s daughter married the local Welsh lord, Cadwgan ap Bleddyn. In 1109 Cadwgan was forced out of Powys and it is possible that he lived at Clun Castle during this time. The couple had a son, Owain ap Cadwgan. Picot&#x27;s son Henry de Say inherited the castle in 1098, with his son, Helias de Say controlling the castle until his death in 1165. Under Helias, the barony of Say was divided in two, with Helias&#x27; daughter Isabella de Say receiving an expanded estate centred on Clun, and the more easterly elements of the de Say land, including the future Stokesay Castle, being given to Theodoric de Say.

At around the same time, Henry I established a new castle-guard system at Clun, probably in response to the succession of Welsh attacks in the decades following the rebellion of Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1094. Under the castle-guard system, protecting Clun Castle was undertaken by knights from a group of fiefs stretching eastwards away from Clun and the Welsh frontier, linked in many cases by the old Roman road running alongside the river Clun. Each knight had to conduct forty days of military service each year, probably being called up in a crisis rather than maintaining a constant guard, and were supplemented when required by additional mounted or infantry sergeants. Henry II continued the royal focus on Clun as the regional centre for protecting the border, investing heavily in the castle during 1160–64. The castle could also draw on Welsh feudal service, with twenty-five local Welsh settlements owing the castle military duty.

The area surrounding the castle was now declared a Marcher Barony, known in the 13th century as the Honour of Clun, which meant it was governed by its own, rather than English law, and the Marcher Lord who controlled this section of the Welsh Marches. In particular, the lord of Clun Castle was known for having the right to execute criminals on his own behalf, rather than as the representative of the king; criminals would be taken from as far as Shrewsbury for this punishment to be carried out.

Isabella married William Fitz Alan, the lord of Oswestry. William was another powerful regional lord, and was appointed the High Sheriff of Shropshire by Adeliza of Louvain, the second wife of Henry I. After Henry I&#x27;s death during the Anarchy, in which England was split between the rival claimants of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, William declared for the Empress Maud and in 1138 held Shrewsbury Castle for four weeks against Stephen. William escaped before the fall of the city, spending the next fifteen years in exile before the return of Henry II in 1153.

Isabella married twice more after William&#x27;s death, with her husbands Geoffrey de Vere and William Botorel being lords of Clun Castle by virtue of marriage, but on her death in 1199 the castle passed to her son from her first marriage, the second William Fitz Alan. In doing so, Isabella created the combined lordship of neighbouring Oswestry and Clun, the beginnings of what would become a powerful noble family. William built the tall, off-centre Norman keep that dominates the site today, blending a defensive fortification with the beginnings of a more luxurious style of living. William had been with King Richard I during the building of Château Gaillard in Normandy and it would seem that the distinctive circular towers William built to defend the new keep at Clun were based on those at Gaillard. The result was echoed in Shropshire, on a smaller scale, in the fortified tower-houses at Upper Millichope and Wattlesborough, whilst several generations later the trend would result in Stokesay Castle.

===13th century===
In the 13th century, Shropshire was in the front line of attempts by Prince Llywelyn the Great to reassert the power of the Welsh principality, aided by the difficult relations that King John enjoyed with the local barons. For many years there was an erroneous story that in 1196 the castle was besieged by the Welsh under Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, a Prince of the Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth. This story is a confusion of Colwyn Castle in Radnorshire, which was attacked in 1196, and the Welsh rendition of Clun, &quot;Colunwy&quot;.

William died in 1210, leaving the castle to his eldest son, another William Fitz Alan. King John, however, demanded a huge fee of 10,000 marks for William to inherit his lands; unable to pay, Clun Castle was assigned to Thomas de Eardington instead. William died shortly afterwards at Easter, 1215, and his brother, John Fitz Alan, a close friend of Llywelyn the Great, promptly took up arms against the king, immediately seizing Clun and Oswestry from royal control. In 1216, King John responded militarily, his forces attacking and burning Oswestry town, before besieging and taking Clun Castle in a surprise attack. John came to an understanding with King John&#x27;s successor, Henry III in 1217 after finally paying a fine of 10,000 marks.

In 1233–34 during the conflict between King Henry III, the Earl Marshal, and Llywelyn the Great, suspicions were raised again over the loyalty of John Fitzalan, and Clun Castle was garrisoned with royal troops in 1233 to ensure its continued reliability as a key fortress. The castle successfully resisted the attack by Llywelyn that year, although Clun itself was destroyed.

In 1244 John FitzAlan inherited the castle from his father; John also became the &quot;de jure&quot; Earl of Arundel. The Welsh border situation was still unsettled, and security grew significantly worse in the next few years, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffydd conducted numerous raids into English territories. John&#x27;s son, another John Fitzalan inherited the castle, marrying Isabella, one of the neighbouring and powerful Mortimer family. In 1272 John died leaving a young son, Richard; during his minority the castle was controlled by Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. A group of commissioners, called in to examine the castle as part of the inquest, noted that the castle was described as &quot;small but strongly built&quot;, but in some need of repair, with the bridge and the roof of one of the towers needing particular work.

===14th–17th centuries===
The invasion of North Wales by Edward I in the 1280s significantly reduced the threat of Welsh invasion and the long-term requirements for strong military fortifications such as Clun Castle. Meanwhile, the FitzAlan family had acquired Arundel Castle by marriage in 1243; their new castle proved to be a much more amenable location for the Earls of Arundel and became their primary residence. By the 14th century Clun Castle had been transformed into a hunting lodge complete with pleasure gardens by the FitzAlan family, who kept a large horse stud at the castle, along with their collections at Chirk and Holt castles.

Richard II made an attempt to break the power of the Arundel family in the area, removing Clun Castle from the Fitz Alan family with the execution of Richard FitzAlan in 1397, granting it to the Duke of York with the intent that it became part of the Earldom of Chester; with the fall of Richard II and the return to favour of Thomas FitzAlan, the castle was restored to the family. There was a resurgence of interest in Clun Castle during the Glyndŵr Rising of 1400–15, with Thomas playing a key role in suppressing the revolt; the castle was refortified and saw some service against the Welsh rebels led by Owain Glyndŵr.

By the 16th century, the antiquarian John Leland observed the increasingly ruined nature of Clun Castle. Philip Howard, the 20th earl of Arundel, died in 1595 whilst under attainment, and James I gave Clun Castle to Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. The castle was abandoned by the time of the English Civil War of 1642–46 and saw no military action; it was slighted by Parliament, however, in 1646 to prevent any possible use as a fortress. The castle passed through several hands in the coming years, including a period in which it was owned by Clive of India. The 19th century author Sir Walter Scott used Clun Castle as the model for the castle &quot;Guarde Doleureuse&quot; in his medieval novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; in 1825.

==Today==

In 1894, the site was purchased by the Duke of Norfolk, a descendant of the original FitzAlan family. The Duke undertook a programme of conservation on the castle, stabilising its condition. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument. The site is open to the public, managed by English Heritage.

<text>Gerard Piel (1 March 1915 in Woodmere, N.Y. – 5 September 2004) was the publisher of the new &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine starting in 1948. He wrote for magazines, including &quot;The Nation&quot;, and published books on science for the general public. In 1990, Piel was presented with the &quot;In Praise of Reason&quot; award by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP).

==Education and career==
Piel graduated from Harvard University, magna cum laude, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. He was the science editor of &quot;Life&quot; magazine from 1939 to 1945. In 1946 and 1947, he worked at the Henry Kaiser Company as assistant to the president. In 1948, in association with two colleagues, he launched a new version of &quot;Scientific American&quot; to promote science literacy for the general public in the postwar era. In January 1957 Piel hired the then unknown Martin Gardner to write the Mathematical Games column, a feature that became one of the most popular parts of the magazine, lasted for 25 years, and produced almost 300 columns.

Piel was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He held a number of honorary degrees and awards, including the UNESCO Kalinga Prize in 1962.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constitutional Convention convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<text>Grantchester Grind is a novel written by British novelist Tom Sharpe. It follows on from the story in &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; of the fictitious Porterhouse College, Cambridge.

==Plot==
Porterhouse is a college which had an incident involving a bedder and the college&#x27;s only research graduate student which caused the Bull Tower to be severely damaged. Since the college&#x27;s funds were exhausted by a previous bursar with a tendency to gamble, one of the story&#x27;s central themes is guided by the Senior Members&#x27; attempts to acquire funds for the college.

The new Master, Skullion, the previous Head Porter of the college, is frail after a stroke (or a &quot;&#x27;Porterhouse Blue&quot;&#x27;, hence the previous book&#x27;s title) and the issues surrounding the death of the previous Master, Sir Godber Evans, prompt his widow to instigate a plan to investigate the death through a planted Fellow, backed by a large, anonymous donation to the college.

Meanwhile, the Dean of the college takes it upon himself to visit prosperous Old Porterthusians (previous members of Porterhouse) in the hope that one is willing and able to become Master if and when Skullion cannot continue. At the same time, the current Bursar is contacted by an American media mogul who seems to be interested in supporting the college without clarifying what it is he wants in return. At the end of the novel the alcoholic Lord Jeremy Pimpole is appointed as Master of the college.

Incidents from &quot;Ancestral Vices&quot;, another Tom Sharpe novel, are mentioned in crossover.

== Reception ==
Wayne Moriarty, writing for the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, called &quot;Grantchester Grind&quot; &quot;a wondrously inventive book that rings as funny as anything Sharpe has written in the past&quot;. He found the books&#x27; protagonists to be &quot;typical of all Sharpe characters -- basically good people who opt to cut corners, cheat a little bit, maybe practise modest deceit. The end result of their cheating and deception is always disaster -- some of the blackest mayhem ever written.&quot;

<doc id="966430" wikidata="Q123436624" url="?curid=966430" title="Metropolis of Moscow and all Rus'">
<text>The Metropolis of Moscow and all Rus″ () was a metropolis that was unilaterally erected by hierarchs of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the territory of the Principality of Moscow in 1448. The first metropolitan was Jonah of Moscow; he was appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The metropolis split from the Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; because the previous metropolitan — Isidore of Kiev — had accepted the Union of Florence. Seventeen prelates succeeded Jonah until Moscow&#x27;s canonical status was regularised in 1589 with the recognition of Job by the Ecumenical Patriarch. Job was also raised to the status of patriarch and was the first Patriarch of Moscow.
The Moscow Patriarchate was a Caesaropapist entity that was under the control of the Russian state. The episcopal seat was the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow.

==Background==
An Ecumenical council of the Church — the Council of Florence — took place from 1431 to 1449. Although he resisted at first, the Grand Prince of Moscow — Vasily II of Moscow — eventually permitted the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; — Isidore of Kiev — to attend the council on condition that Isidore should return with &quot;the rights of Divine law and the constitution of the holy Church&quot; uninjured. The council healed the Great Schism by uniting the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. The union was proclaimed on 6 July 1439 in the document &quot;Laetentur Caeli&quot; which was composed by Pope Eugene IV and signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and all but one of the bishops present. Some Greek bishops, perhaps feeling political pressure from the Byzantine Emperor, reluctantly accepted the decrees of the council. Other Eastern bishops, such as Isidore, did so with sincere conviction. Sylvester Syropoulos and other Greek writers charge Isidore with perjury because he accepted the union, despite his promise to Vasili II.

Following the signing of the bull, Isidore returned to the Principality of Moscow. In the Kremlin&#x27;s Dormition Cathedral, Isidore read the decree of unification aloud. He also passed a message to Vasili II from the Holy See, containing a request to assist the metropolitan in spreading the Union in Rus&#x27;. Three days later, Isidore was arrested by the Grand Prince and imprisoned in the Chudov Monastery. He arranged for certain Rus&#x27; clergy to denounce the metropolitan for refusing to renounce the union with Rome. As a result, the Great Prince of Moscow voided the union in his lands and imprisoned Isidore for some time. Having adjudged Isidore to have apostatized to Catholicism, he was deposed by a local synod.

==Establishment==


After the metropolitan throne lay vacant for seven years, the secular authorities replaced him with the Bishop of Ryazan and Murom — Jonah of Moscow. Like his immediate predecessors, he permanently resided in Moscow, and was the last Moscow-based primate of the metropolis to keep the traditional title with reference to the metropolitan city of Kiev. He was also the first metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm. This signified the beginning of the &quot;de facto&quot; independence (autocephaly) of the Moscow (north-eastern) part of the Church.

The struggle for ecumenical union at Ferrara and Florence, while promising, never bore fruit. While progress toward union in the East continued to be made in the following decades, all hopes for a proximate reconciliation were dashed with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Following their conquest, the Ottomans encouraged hardline anti-unionist Orthodox clerics in order to divide European Christians. Afterwards, the Muscovite principality and metropolis began to promote Moscow as the &quot;Third Rome&quot; and as the sole, legitimate successor to Constantinople.

Notwithstanding these events, the Ecumenical Patriarch continued to appoint metropolitans for the united Catholic and Eastern Orthodox (&quot;Uniate&quot;) dioceses in those Ruthenian lands that were not controlled by the Tsardom of Moscow. In the Polish and Lithuanian lands, the next uniate hierarch was Gregory the Bulgarian. He was consecrated by a Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1469, his appointment was also approved by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople — Dionysius I. The episcopal see of the new hierarch was located in Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the appointment of Gregory, the title was changed to Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia and all Rus&#x27;.

==Ecclesiastical structure==

Jonah was unable to exercise any pastoral control beyond the borders of Muscovy. In the lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the rulers rejected Jonah and continued to recognise Isidore as metropolitan. The metropolis was effectively split in two; Jonah ruled from Moscow in the east while Isidore and his successors ruled the western part from Novogrudok.
Dioceses:
* Urban Diocese of Moscow
* Diocese of Novgorod
* Diocese of Rostov
* Diocese of Yaroslavl
* Diocese of Smolensk
* Diocese of Kazan
* Diocese of Saratov
* Diocese of Tver
* Diocese of Vladimir

==Changes and reforms==
The reign of Ivan III and his successor was plagued by numerous heresies and controversies. One party, led by Nil Sorsky and Vassian Kosoy, called for secularisation of monastic properties. They were opposed by Joseph of Volotsk, who defended ecclesiastical ownership of land and property. The sovereign&#x27;s position fluctuated, but eventually he gave his support to Joseph. New sects sprang up, some of which showed a tendency to revert to the Mosaic law: for instance, the archpriest Aleksei was influenced by Zechariah the Jew and converted to Judaism.

Monastic life flourished, with two major strands co-existing until the definitive defeat of the non-possessors in 1551. The disciples of St. Sergius left the Trinity monastery near Moscow to found dozens of monasteries across northeastern Rus&#x27;. Some of the most famous monasteries were located in the Russian North, in order to demonstrate how faith could flourish in the most inhospitable lands. The richest landowners in 15th-century Muscovy and 16th-century Russia included Joseph Volokolamsk Monastery, Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery and the Solovetsky Monastery. In the 18th century, the three greatest monasteries were recognized as lavras, while those subordinated directly to the Synod were labelled stauropegic.

In the 1540s, Metropolitan Macarius convened a number of church councils, which culminated in the Hundred Chapter Council of 1551. This assembly unified Church ceremonies and duties in the whole territory of the Russian tsardom. At the demand of the Church hierarchy the government cancelled the tsar&#x27;s jurisdiction over ecclesiastics.

==Disestablishment==

When traveling across eastern Europe from 1588 to 1589, Patriarch Jeremias II of Constantinople visited Moscow. He confirmed the &quot;de facto&quot; autocephaly of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Tsardom of Russia. For the first time since 1448, an Ecumenical Patriarch consecrated a metropolitan in Rus&#x27; lands — Job of Moscow. At the same time, in raising the metropolis to a patriarchate — as the &#x27;Patriarchate of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; — he effectively disestablished the metropolis. The Patriarchate was abolished by the Church reform of Peter the Great in 1721 and replaced by the Most Holy Synod, and the Bishop of Moscow came to be called a Metropolitan again.

<text>Nancy Allan (born July 25, 1952, in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments of premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger.

Allan was raised in MacGregor, Manitoba, and was educated at MacGregor Collegiate. From 1990 to 1994, she was director of development for the Canadian Diabetes Association. She worked for the Manitoba Motion Picture Industries Association from 1994 to 1995, and then as a consultant for small business and non-profit organizations from 1995 to 1999. She has also taught two continuing education courses at the University of Winnipeg.

Allan began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Norwood School Division from 1995 to 1998 and the St. Boniface School Division from 1998 to 1999. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Shirley Render in the south-central Winnipeg riding of St. Vital by 5218 votes to 3699.

In 2003 she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

In the 2003 election Allan was re-elected with over 63% of the popular vote. On November 4, 2003, she entered cabinet as Minister of Labour of Immigration, with responsibility for Multiculturalism, Status of Women and administration of the Workers Compensation Act. Allan was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

After Greg Selinger succeeded Gary Doer as premier of Manitoba, he appointed Allan as the Minister of Education on November 3, 2009.

During her term as education minister, Allan introduced anti-bullying legislation: Bill 18, the public schools amendment act (safe and inclusive schools). Religious organizations criticized the legislation, claiming it infringed on freedom of religion by requiring faith-based schools to support the creation of gay–straight alliances if initiated by students. The federal Minister of Public Safety at the time, Vic Toews, said that he believed the bill violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The bill passed into law in September 2013.

On October 18, 2013, Nancy Allan was removed from the post of education minister by Premier Greg Selinger.

<text>Central station (also called Central Square station) is a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) rapid transit station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It serves the Red Line and has a street-level terminal for the MBTA bus system. It is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue with Western Avenue, Prospect Street, and Magazine Street at Central Square.

==Station design==
Central station has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the Red Line, which runs northwest–southeast through Central Square under Massachusetts Avenue. Each platform has three sets of stairs, an escalator, and an elevator along its length. The station is accessible. MBTA bus routes – – stop near the station. The station has two works of public art, which were installed in 1988 as part of the Arts on the Line program:
*&quot;East Indian&quot;, by Elizabeth Mapelli, seven fused glass tile murals behind benches on the platforms
*&quot;Circle Square&quot; by Anne Storrs and Dennis Cunningham, 100 ceramic tile reliefs mounted above the station columns

==History==

After the success of the 1897-opened Tremont Street Subway, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) planned an elevated system with lines to Cambridge, South Boston, Charlestown, and Roxbury. The latter two lines opened in 1901 as the Charlestown Elevated and Washington Street Elevated, while the South Boston line was determined to be infeasible. After debate about running an elevated line above business districts in Cambridge, the BERy agreed in late 1906 to build a line under Beacon Hill in Boston, over a new West Boston Bridge, and under Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge to Harvard Square. Construction began on May 24, 1909. The Cambridge Subway opened from Harvard Square to Park Street Under on March 23, 1912, with intermediate stations at Central Square and Kendall Square.

Kendall Square and Central Square stations had very similar designs, each with two side platforms long. The station had one exit and one entrance stairway at each end of each platform; all were wide except for one -wide pair. The platforms and floors were made of granolithic. Station walls were tiled with white enamel, with a buff tile band above the floor and white plaster above. Several original tile mosaics displaying the station name are still in place above the platforms.

===Renovations===

On January 26, 1978, heavy rains flooded the station. In the mid-1980s, the platforms were extended at many early-built Red Line stations, allowing six-car trains to be run beginning in January 1988. The platforms at Central were extended to the northwest (contrary to original plans for the southeast) beginning on April 25, 1985, with new entrances placed west of Prospect Street. (Extension to the northwest had been previously proposed in 1927 to add the additional entrances.) The $11.2 million project was completed on March 9, 1988.

The MBTA agreed to replace the inbound elevator as part of the 2006 settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;. Notice to proceed was given in June 2017. The elevator was closed on April 9, 2018; due to issues with conduits and a standpipe, completion was delayed by over a year to April 2, 2020.

The MBTA also plans to add two additional elevators to the station, and to replace the outbound elevator. Design was completed by May 2022. , construction is expected to last from early 2025 to mid-2027.

<doc id="966463" wikidata="Q1017288" url="?curid=966463" title="Busch Gardens">
<text>Busch Gardens is the name of two amusement parks in the United States, owned and operated by United Parks &amp; Resorts. The original park is in Tampa, Florida, and the second park is in Williamsburg, Virginia. There were also previously Busch Gardens parks in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California (1964–1979) and Houston, Texas (1971–1973). The &quot;Busch Gardens&quot; name was earlier used to refer to the gardens developed by Adolphus Busch near his home in Pasadena, California, which were open to the public from 1906 to 1937.

The Busch Gardens amusement parks were initially developed as marketing vehicles for Anheuser-Busch and featured hospitality houses with samples of Anheuser-Busch products. They also included stables that housed many of the company&#x27;s Clydesdale horses, which have been associated with Anheuser-Busch since 1933. Eventually, rides and attractions were added to the parks and over time were developed into full theme parks while still promoting Anheuser-Busch. Busch Entertainment Corporation, now called United Parks &amp; Resorts, was created as a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch Companies to run the various parks in 1959.

In 2009, AB InBev, formed from the purchase of Anheuser-Busch by InBev, sold the amusement parks to the Blackstone Group. Blackstone has kept some of the popular traditions including a stable with Clydesdales; however, the Clydesdales are not affiliated with the beer company.

==Locations==

===Busch Gardens Tampa Bay===
Busch Gardens Tampa Bay opened on March 31, 1959, and has an African theme. The park was originally tagged &quot;The Dark Continent.&quot; The theme park is one of America&#x27;s largest zoological institutions, with and more than 2,700 animals. Attractions include: Montu, Kumba, Scorpion, Edge of Africa, Jungala, Sand Serpent, Congo River Rapids, Saga, Tanganyika Tidal Wave, Stanley Falls, Serengeti Railway, Phoenix, Sesame Street and SheiKra, a vertical dive coaster which opened in 2005. In 2011, the park added Cheetah Hunt, a triple launch roller coaster. In 2014, the park added Falcon&#x27;s Fury, an Intamin drop tower. In 2016, the park constructed Cobra&#x27;s Curse, a steel roller coaster created by Mack Rides. In 2019, the park opened Tigris, a steel launched roller coaster constructed by Premier Rides. In 2022, the park opened Iron Gwazi, which is a hybrid conversion of Gwazi by Rocky Mountain Construction. The park is some distance away from downtown, in central Tampa, near the limits of the city of Temple Terrace to the east of Tampa.

===Busch Gardens Williamsburg===

Busch Gardens Williamsburg opened May 16, 1975. With its European theme, the park was originally tagged &quot;The Old Country.&quot; Attractions at this park include Alpengeist, Escape from Pompeii, Apollo&#x27;s Chariot, Loch Ness Monster and Griffon. Added in 2007, the Griffon coaster had bragging rights as the tallest dive coaster in the United States. The park is divided into seven sections, each themed to a different European country. On July 25, 2009, Busch Gardens announced that the Big Bad Wolf roller coaster would be retired September 7, 2009, after 25 years of operation due to its &quot;meeting the end of its service life&quot;. and was replaced with Verbolten - a New Multiple Launch Coaster that opened in 2012. Newly added in 2009 was Christmas Town, A Busch Gardens Celebration, with many themed holiday attractions and shows with eight million lights and a 50-foot Light Animated Christmas Tree. Also in 2010, the 3-D ride Corkscrew Hill was replaced by Europe in the Air, which itself was replaced by a new VR action ride called Battle for Eire in 2018. Also new for 2010 was illumiNights: A Busch Garden Encore, with many mini nightly country shows and nightly fireworks set to a special soundtrack which is available during the special event in many gift shops. In 2010, Busch Gardens announced a drop tower called the Mäch Tower which was set to open in late spring 2011 but was delayed due to train problems from Italy and opened in August 2011. It was announced in late 2022 that the tower was to give its final rides on January 8, 2023. The ride closed permanently on that same day. Tempesto opened in May 2015, as it was part of an addition to the park&#x27;s Italy section. InvadR, the first ever wooden coaster at Busch Gardens, opened in 2017. Pantheon opened March 25, 2022.

===Busch Gardens in California===
====Pasadena (1906–1937)====
Long before the current Busch Gardens amusement parks, the name referred to the personal gardens of Adolphus Busch, co-founder of Anheuser-Busch. After becoming wealthy in the beer business, Busch purchased a winter home in Pasadena, California. He landscaped the around his home with thousands of plants, as well as statues, waterfalls and walking paths. He opened these &quot;Busch Gardens&quot; to the public in 1906. The gardens became a major tourist attraction, even after Busch&#x27;s death in 1913 and prompted the Pacific Electric Railway to establish a stop for the gardens&#x27; visitors. The nearby Hollywood film industry used the gardens in many films, including &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (archery scene, 1938), and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (Twelve Oaks barbecue, 1939). Busch&#x27;s widow offered the gardens to the city of Pasadena on multiple occasions for use as a public park, but the city never accepted the offer. Busch Gardens closed in 1937 and the land was later subdivided. The area is now a residential neighborhood, though some of the landscape features of the Busch Gardens era remain.

====Van Nuys (1966–1979)====
In 1954, a new brewery was opened in Van Nuys. The company opened one of the modern Busch Gardens parks at this site in 1966 that included boat rides, a 10-minute monorail tour of the brewery, and free beer. (Circa 1974, there was a second monorail &quot;which passes through an enormous aviary&quot;.) The park expanded by in 1972 to a total of . &quot;The new section includes an exciting barrel flume ride; a huge, walk-through flight cage; a magic show; a special show place for otters; penguin and sea lion programs; and an individual boat ride popular with young skippers.&quot; The amusement park was renamed Busch Bird Sanctuary in 1977 and closed in 1979. The birds were moved to the nearby Los Angeles Zoo and the Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Williamsburg locations. The site of the Van Nuys theme park is currently a Bud Light facility and one of the remnants of the park is the footbridge connecting to the 1972 expansion.

===Busch Gardens Houston===
Houston&#x27;s Busch Gardens opened in May 1971 and was closed within a few years. It was located adjacent to the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which opened in 1966. The park had an Asian theme except for an ice cave with a temperature controlled environment for several varieties of penguins, polar bears and sea lions. It also had its own narrow gauge railway.

===Catalonia, Spain===
Anheuser-Busch and Grand Tibidabo, S.A., owners of Tibidabo Amusement Park, in Barcelona, along with other Spanish investors, made plans to build a Tibi Gardens outside of Barcelona, Spain, in the late 1980s. During construction, several of the Spanish investors backed out, and investors from The Tussauds Group stepped in. The park was renamed Port Aventura and when it opened in 1995 in Salou, Spain, Anheuser Busch had a 20% investment in the park while The Tussauds Group had 40%. In 1998 the majority of Tussauds Group&#x27;s shares in the park were sold to Universal.

==Unbuilt parks==

===Busch Gardens Dubai===
In 2008, Busch Entertainment Corporation announced plans to open a new park in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2012. It was going to be placed on a man-made island shaped like Shamu in Dubai with SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica also being built on that island. The Dubai park would have added on a third park to the Busch Gardens brand. The plans have been shelved because of financial issues. On February 4, 2009, Busch Entertainment announced that the Dubai plans had been canceled due to the global recession.

==Free beer samples==
After InBev sold the amusement parks in 2009 to Blackstone, many beer-affiliated traditions ended, including the tradition of offering free beer samples in their Hospitality Centers, and &quot;Brewmaster Clubs&quot; would come to an end in the parks. Also announced was that workers would not get two cases of beer a month for free, which they would receive under old parent Anheuser-Busch. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay has again begun offering free samples in conjunction with limited-time promotions, most recently in 2019 as part of the park&#x27;s year-long 60th anniversary celebration. Each guest may sample two seven-ounce servings of beer.

<doc id="966470" wikidata="Q158509" url="?curid=966470" title="Lolium">
<text>Lolium is a genus of tufted grasses in the bluegrass subfamily (Pooideae). It is often called ryegrass, but this term is sometimes used to refer to grasses in other genera.

They are characterized by bunch-like growth habits. &quot;Lolium&quot; is native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, as well as being cultivated and naturalized in Australia, the Americas, and various oceanic islands. Ryegrasses are naturally diploid, with 2n=14, and are closely related to the fescues (&quot;Festuca&quot;).

Ryegrass should not be confused with rye, which is a grain crop.

==Species==
 the species of &quot;Lolium&quot; listed by Plants of the World Online include:
; Formerly included
Several former &quot;Lolium&quot; species now regarded as part of other genera: &quot;Castellia&quot;, &quot;Enteropogon&quot;, &quot;× Festulolium&quot;, &quot;Hainardia&quot;, &quot;Lepturus&quot;, &quot;Melica&quot;, and &quot;Vulpia&quot;.


==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;Lolium&quot; contains some species which are important grasses for lawns, and as pasture and for grazing and hay for livestock, being a highly nutritious stock feed. Ryegrasses are also used in soil erosion control programs. It is the principal grazing grass in New Zealand where some 10 million kilograms of certified seed are produced every year. There is a large range of cultivars. The primary species found worldwide and used both for lawns and as a forage crop is perennial ryegrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;). Like many cool-season grasses of the Poaceae, it harbors a symbiotic fungal endophyte, either &quot;Epichloë&quot; or its close relative &quot;Neotyphodium&quot;, both of which are members of the fungal family Clavicipitaceae.

Some species, particularly &quot;L. temulentum&quot;, are weeds which can have a severe impact on the production of wheat and other crops. Annual ryegrass (&quot;L. rigidum&quot;) is one of the most serious and costly weeds of cropping systems in southern Australia, and herbicide resistance is a frequent problem. Ryegrass pollen is also one of the major causes of hay fever. Tennis courts, including those at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the venue for Wimbledon, are planted with ryegrass.
Glyphosate-resistant &quot;Lolium&quot; has been reported from Mississippi in 2006.

<text>The term &quot;bedder&quot; is short for &quot;bedmaker&quot; and is the official term for a housekeeper in a college of the University of Cambridge. The equivalent at the University of Oxford is known as a &quot;scout&quot;. The equivalent at Trinity College, Dublin was known as a &quot;skip&quot;, until the practice was abandoned in the early 1970s. The colleges of the University of Durham have also replicated the Oxbridge model and refer to housekeeping staff as bedders. There is no equivalent at the vast majority of other British or American universities, though the universities of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have previously offered similar positions to care for their students&#x27; needs.

==History==
In early times, bedders were often employed directly by students and fellows rather than the college, but they are now part-time college employees. An edict of the University of Cambridge issued in 1635 banned bedders aged under fifty, although this policy has long since been abandoned. Until the late Victorian age, women could not become undergraduates, and there were even regulations preventing Fellows from marrying, so the edict may have been intended to leave bedders beyond suspicion of any impropriety. Rumours persist that there was once a broader &quot;Bedder Test&quot;, but there is no evidence that colleges ever preferred women of unappealing mien.

Historically, a gyp (undergraduate&#x27;s manservant) supplemented the role of the bedder at Cambridge, Durham, and other institutes of education.

==Development==
Even in the early 20th century, before modern utilities were installed in the colleges, the role required heavier labour, cleaning coal fires and carrying water for washing. Nowadays, bedders often change bed linen, vacuum the rooms, empty bins and perform other domestic services, although their role varies from college to college. Some do not make beds at all, but others go so far as to wash students&#x27; dishes.

==Conditions==
The job earns more than the minimum wage, but it is sometimes hard to fill vacancies as the role appears demeaning to modern British women, and staff from other countries are also recruited. The role requires a high degree of trust. Some bedders see their role as including a pastoral element, looking out for the needs of young people far from home.

Perks of the job include discount cards (at Cambridge), Christmas presents from students, and occasional more generous gifts from delegates staying in the rooms for corporate conferences in between University terms.

<text>Delfshaven () is a borough of Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the right bank of river Nieuwe Maas. It was a separate municipality until 1886.

The town of Delfshaven grew around the port of the city of Delft. Delft itself was not located on a major river, so in 1389 a harbour was created about due south of the city, to be able to receive seafaring vessels and avoid tolls being levied by the neighbouring and competing city of Rotterdam. This settlement was named Delfshaven (&quot;Port of Delft&quot;).

On 1 August 1620 the Pilgrim fathers left Delfshaven with the &quot;Speedwell&quot;. Since then, the town&#x27;s Oude Kerk has also been known as the Pelgrimskerk, or in English, the &quot;Pilgrim Fathers Church&quot;.

Fishing, shipbuilding and the distillery of jenever were the main sources of income. The Dutch East India Company had important wharves and warehouses in Delfshaven, and one of the Dutch West India Company&#x27;s most famous commanders, Piet Hein, was born here.

Delfshaven belonged to the city and municipality of Delft until 1795, when it declared itself to be an independent municipality, under protest from Delft. In 1825 it got city rights. Delfshaven was annexed by Rotterdam in 1886 at its own request. The current borough has about 73,000 inhabitants. Its small historic centre has been carefully preserved. It features modest local museums, a brewery and various dining and drinking facilities.

Delfshaven escaped the bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe on 14 May 1940. Later during the Second World War, the area around the &quot;Visserijplein&quot; and other parts of the western city of Rotterdam were destroyed by Allied bombing on 31 March 1943.

<doc id="966483" wikidata="Q533238" url="?curid=966483" title="Kendall/MIT station">
<text>Kendall/MIT station (signed as Kendall) is an underground rapid transit station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is served by the MBTA Red Line. Located at the intersection of Main Street and Broadway, it is named for the primary areas it serves - the Kendall Square business district and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Opened in March 1912 as part of the original Cambridge subway, Kendall/MIT has two side platforms serving the line&#x27;s two tracks. The &quot;Kendall Band&quot;, a public art installation of hand-operated musical sculptures, is located between the tracks in the station with controls located on the platforms. Kendall/MIT station is accessible. With 17,018 weekday boardings by a FY2019 count, Kendall/MIT has the fourth highest ridership among MBTA subway stations.

==Station design==
Kendall/MIT station has two underground side platforms serving the two tracks of the Red Line, which runs approximately east–west under Main Street. The main headhouses are located midblock between Broadway and Ames Street, with smaller entrances further east near Broadway. The main headhouses have elevators for accessibility. The main inbound headhouse has two angled glass entrances and a pair of glass elevators, with an angular canopy supported on thin columns.

The station is served by MBTA bus routes: . The CT2 stops on Ames Street northwest of the station, while the other routes stop on Main Street adjacent to the main headhouses. The EZRide Cambridge–North Station shuttle service also stops on Main Street. The CambridgeSide Galleria provides a free shuttle bus from Kendall/MIT.

===&quot;Kendall Band&quot;===
Between 1986 and 1988, artist Paul Matisse installed &quot;Kendall Band&quot;, an interactive musical sculpture, at Kendall/MIT. Located between the Red Line tracks at the station, it cost $90,000 to construct under the Arts on the Line program. It consists of three musical devices - &quot;Pythagoras&quot;, &quot;Kepler&quot;, and &quot;Galileo&quot; - controlled by levers located on both subway platforms. Although Matisse maintained it for several decades, it ultimately fell into disrepair. A group of MIT students began restoration in 2010, with &quot;Pythagoras&quot; rendered partially functional in May 2011.

==History==
The Cambridge subway opened from Park Street Under to on March 23, 1912, with intermediate stops at Central and Kendall. From the early 20th century through the 1970s, the MBTA operated a powerhouse above ground in Kendall Square, including rotary converters (also called cycloconverters) to transform incoming AC electrical power to 600 volts DC power fed to the third rail to run the subway. An old-fashioned cycloconverter consisted of an AC motor coupled to a huge, slowly rotating flywheel coupled to a DC generator, hence the name. Despite the development of compact low-maintenance semiconductor-based power rectifiers, the long-obsolete electromechanical technology still occupied prime real estate in the heart of Kendall Square. The MBTA powerhouse was demolished, and replaced with an office building located at the convergence of Broadway and Main Street.
===Name changes and reconstructions===

The MBTA renamed the station three times in a seven-year period. On August 7, 1978, the station was renamed as Kendall/MIT to indicate the nearby presence of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On December 2, 1982, Columbia station was renamed , and Kendall/MIT was renamed as Cambridge Center/MIT after the adjacent Cambridge Center development, although most station signs were not changed. There were many complaints that the MBTA had suddenly changed the name without public input, and that the new name would be confused with the next Red Line station at Central Square. On June 26, 1985, the name was reverted to Kendall/MIT as part of a series of station name changes.

During the 1980s, the MBTA rebuilt Kendall/MIT and other Red Line stations with longer platforms for six-car trains and with elevators for accessibility. The rebuilt station was dedicated in October 1987 and six-car trains began operation on January 21, 1988. Temporary artworks, including an entire fake cafe, were hosted at the station during the renovation as part of the Arts on the Line program.

The main southbound headhouse was reconstructed as part of the Kendall Square Initiative development project. Utility work began in July–August 2020, with excavation beginning in October. Part of the old headhouse was closed in November 2020 for construction of the interim headhouse. The temporary southbound headhouse opened on January 22, 2022. The permanent headhouse opened on February 11, 2023.

The main northbound headhouse is also being reconstructed as part of the adjacent 325 Main Street project. The new glass headhouse will also have redundant elevators, and the roof will be part of an elevated public plaza. Work on the headhouse began in July 2022. A temporary outbound headhouse, located inside 325 Main Street, was completed in June 2024. The old headhouse was demolished, and steel for the new headhouse assembled, in July 2024. The temporary headhouse includes an art installation by Mount Holyoke College professor Ligia Bouton entitled &quot;25 Variable Stars: A Temporary Monument for Henrietta Swan Leavitt&quot;. It consists of lenticular prints honoring Henrietta Swan Leavitt&#x27;s discovery of the period-luminosity relation for Cepheid variable stars. , the new permanent headhouse is anticipated to be completed in August 2025.

===Circumferential service===

Kendall/MIT was a proposed stop on the Urban Ring – a circumferential bus rapid transit (BRT) line designed to connect the existing radial MBTA rail lines to reduce overcrowding in the downtown stations. Under draft plans released in 2008, new surface-level BRT platforms would have been constructed on Main Street at Kendall/MIT. The project was cancelled in 2010

In 2012, the state studied the feasibility of sending some Framingham/Worcester Line trains to North Station via the Grand Junction Railroad, including the possibility of a new commuter rail station at Kendall. The possible station would have consisted of a single platform between Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and was estimated to cost $7.5 million. After objections from the City of Cambridge over potential traffic problems due to the grade crossings on the Grand Junction, the MBTA declined to pursue implementation of the proposed service. In 2014, it was revealed by the state that the stop would be part of the proposed Indigo Line system with frequent DMU service, but that plan was canceled in 2015 for financial reasons.

A 2019 report indicated that daily boardings at the station would double to 30,000 by 2040, increasing the need for relief service on the Grand Junction and other corridors.

<doc id="966488" wikidata="Q4040512" url="?curid=966488" title="Hector (musician)">
<text>Heikki Veikko Harma (born 20 April 1947) is a Finnish singer-songwriter who has also distinguished himself as a translator of song lyrics, but has written popular lyrics of his own too. To the public he is better known by the name Hector, which he has used since the release of his 1965 debut single &quot;Palkkasoturi&quot;, a Finnish translation of Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;. His 1974 album &quot;Hectorock I&quot; became the fastest-selling record in Finnish history, selling 50,000 units within a few months. Hector was at the height of his popularity in the first half of the 1970s, but his steady string of recordings provided occasional hits well into the 1990s. In the 2000s he made a strong return to popularity with &quot;Ei selityksiä&quot;, which became one of his most successful albums. In 2007 he made a farewell tour on big arenas, but has performed occasionally after that too. In 2011 he made a massive comeback tour and released a new album &quot;Hauras&quot; (Fragile) in 2014, ten years after his previous album.

Hector&#x27;s work is very diverse in its musical styles. He is mainly known for his folk rock songs, but he has also made progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal songs. He has translated into Finnish works by Don McLean, Procol Harum, King Crimson, Neil Young, David Bowie and several other artists. Today he is considered, due to his extremely long and distinguished career, as first a pioneer and later a mainstay of Suomirock. His lyrics have often a political and/or social component.

Some of Hector&#x27;s songs are considered classics of Finnish popular music, such as &quot;Lumi teki enkelin eteiseen&quot; (&quot;Snow made an angel in the lobby&quot;), &quot;Mandoliinimies&quot; (&quot;Mandolin man&quot;) and &quot;Olen hautausmaa&quot; (&quot;I am a graveyard&quot;), and he can be considered a primary contributor to Finnish rock music of the 1970s. He has also written song lyrics for other Finnish singers. His song &quot;Juodaan Viinaa&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s drink spirits&quot;) was covered by Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani on their 2009 album &quot;Karkelo&quot;. Hector is the Finnish voice actor of The Muskrat in the Finnish-British animated television family drama &quot;Moominvalley&quot; (2019–).

In addition to his music career, Heikki Harma has also worked as a music journalist on radio.

<text>The mountain tapir, also known as the Andean tapir or woolly tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), is the smallest of the four widely recognized species of tapir. It is found only in certain portions of the Andean Mountain Range in northwestern South America. As such, it is the only tapir species to live outside of tropical rainforests in the wild. It is most easily distinguished from other tapirs by its thick woolly coat and white lips.

The species name comes from the term &quot;La Pinchaque&quot;, an imaginary beast said to inhabit the same regions as the mountain tapir.

==Description==
Mountain tapirs are black or very dark brown, with occasional pale hairs flecked in amongst the darker fur. The fur becomes noticeably paler on the underside, around the anal region, and on the cheeks. A distinct white band runs around the lips, although it may vary in extent, and there are usually also white bands along the upper surface of the ears. In adults, the rump has paired patches of bare skin, which may help to indicate sexual maturity. The eyes are initially blue, but change to a pale brown as the animal ages. Unlike all other species of tapir, the fur is long and woolly, especially on the underside and flanks, reaching or more in some individuals.
Adults are usually around in length and in height at the shoulder. They typically weigh between , and while the sexes are of similar size, females tend to be around heavier than the males.

Like the other types of tapir, they have small, stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot, each with large nails and supported by a padded sole. A patch of bare skin, pale pink or grey in colour, extends just above each toe.

==Reproduction==
Female mountain tapirs have a 30-day estrous cycle, and typically breed only once every other year. During courtship, the male chases the female and uses soft bites, grunts, and squeals to get her attention, while the female responds with frequent squealing. After a gestation period of 392 or 393 days, the female gives birth to a single young; multiple births are very rare.

Newborn mountain tapirs weigh about and have a brown coat with yellowish-white spots and stripes. Like adults, baby mountain tapirs have thick, woolly fur to help keep them warm. Weaning begins at around three months of age. The immature coloration fades after about a year, but the mother continues to care for her young for around 18 months. Mountain tapirs reach sexual maturity at age three and have lived up to 27 years in captivity.

==Ecology==

Tapirs are herbivores, and eat a wide range of plants, including leaves, grasses, and bromeliads. In the wild, particularly common foods include lupins, &quot;Gynoxys&quot;, ferns, and umbrella plants. It also seeks out natural salt licks to satisfy its need for essential minerals.

Mountain tapirs are also important seed dispersers in their environments, and have been identified as a keystone species of the high Andes. A relatively high proportion of plant seeds eaten by mountain tapirs successfully germinate in their dung, probably due to a relatively inefficient digestive system and a tendency to defecate near water. Although a wide range of seeds are dispersed in this manner, those of the endangered wax palm seem to rely almost exclusively on mountain tapirs for dispersal, and this plant, along with the highland lupine, declines dramatically whenever the animal is extirpated from an area.

Predators of mountain tapirs include cougars, spectacled bears, and, less commonly, jaguars. Attacks by invasive domestic dogs have also been reported.

==Behavior==
When around other members of their species, mountain tapirs communicate through high-pitched whistles, and the males occasionally fight over estrous females by trying to bite each other&#x27;s rear legs. But for the most part, mountain tapirs are shy and lead solitary lives, spending their waking hours foraging for food on their own along well-worn tapir paths. Despite their bulk, they travel easily through dense foliage, up the steep slopes of their hilly habitats, and in water, where they often wallow and swim.

Mountain tapirs are generally crepuscular, although they are more active during the day than other species of tapirs. They sleep from roughly midnight to dawn, with an additional resting period during the hottest time of the day for a few hours after noon, and prefer to bed down in areas with heavy vegetation cover. Mountain tapirs forage for tender plants to eat. When trying to access high plants, they will sometimes rear up on their hind legs to reach and then grab with their prehensile snouts. Though their eyesight is lacking, they get by on their keen senses of smell and taste, as well as the sensitive bristles on their proboscises.

Males will frequently mark their territory with dung piles, urine, and rubbings on trees, and females will sometimes engage in these behaviors, as well. The territories of individuals usually overlap, with each animal claiming over , and females tend to have larger territories than males.

==Distribution and habitat==
The mountain tapir is found in the cloud forests and &quot;páramo&quot; of the Eastern and Central Cordilleras mountains in Colombia, Ecuador, and the far north of Peru. Its range may once have extended as far as western Venezuela, but it has long been extirpated from that region. It commonly lives at elevations between , and since at this altitude temperatures routinely fall below freezing, the animal&#x27;s woolly coat is essential. During the wet season, mountain tapirs tend to inhabit the forests of the Andes, while during the drier months, they move to the &quot;páramo&quot;, where fewer biting insects pester them.

The mountain tapir has no recognised subspecies.

In Peru, it is protected in the National Sanctuary Tabaconas Namballe. The species needs continuous stretches of cloud forest and &quot;páramo&quot;, rather than isolated patches, to successfully breed and maintain a healthy population, and this obstacle is a major concern for conservationists trying to protect the endangered animal.

==Evolution==
The mountain tapir is the least specialised of the living species of tapir, and has changed the least since the origin of the genus in the early Miocene. Genetic studies have shown that mountain tapirs diverged from its closest relative, the Brazilian tapir, in the late Pliocene, around three million years ago. This would have been shortly after the formation of the Panamanian Isthmus, allowing the ancestors of the two living species to migrate southward from their respective points of origin in Central America as part of the Great American Interchange. However, the modern species most likely originated in the Andes, some time after this early migration.

Molecular dating methods based on three mitochondrial cytochrome genes found &quot;T. pinchaque&quot; to be within a paraphyletic &quot;T. terrestris&quot; complex.

==Vulnerability==

The mountain tapir is the most threatened of the five &quot;Tapirus&quot; species, classified as &quot;Endangered&quot; by the IUCN in 1996. According to the IUCN, there was a 20% chance the species could have been extinct as early as 2014. Due to the fragmentation of its surviving range, populations may already have fallen below the level required to sustain genetic diversity.

Historically, mountain tapirs have been hunted for their meat and hides, while the toes, proboscises, and intestines are used in local folk medicines and as aphrodisiacs. Since they will eat crops when available, they are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their produce. Today, deforestation for agriculture and mining, and poaching are the main threats to the species.

There may be only 2,500 individuals left in the wild today, making it all the more difficult for scientists to study them. Also, very few individuals are found in zoos. Only a handful of breeding pairs of this species exists in captivity in the world — at the Los Angeles Zoo, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, and, as of 2006, the San Francisco Zoo. In Canada, a mating pair is kept in Langley, BC, at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre. The nine individuals in captivity are descendants of just two founder animals. This represents a distinct lack of genetic diversity and may not bode well for their continued existence in captivity.

<text>Wintour&#x27;s Leap is a noted rock climbing location and viewpoint. It is located near the village of Woodcroft in Gloucestershire, on the English side of the Wye Valley, north of Chepstow.

== History ==
Wintour&#x27;s Leap is named after Royalist Sir John Wintour who, hotly pursued on his horse by Parliamentary forces, according to local myth survived a leap off the cliff and, landing safely in the Wye below, swam to safety in the nearby Chepstow Castle. In fact, Wintour did escape from the Roundheads by using the river nearby on two separate occasions, but from less spectacular positions at Lancaut and Sedbury.

== Ownership ==

Wintour&#x27;s Leap is owned by Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and forms part of the Lancaut SSSI Nature Reserve. The cliffs of Wintour&#x27;s Leap are frequent nesting grounds for Peregrine Falcons and provide niches for rare Whitebeam trees. Climbing access is by permission of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust negotiated and supervised in consultation with the British Mountaineering Council. Climbing restrictions may apply.

== Rock climbing ==

The area around Wintour&#x27;s Leap is a very popular limestone rock climbing area. It contains over 300 recorded routes most of which are multi-pitch. It has a high proportion of quality climbs up to 100-meters in length with something to offer all levels of climber. From south to north, the climbing areas are &quot;Woodcroft Quarry&quot;, &quot;Fly Wall&quot;, &quot;GO Wall&quot;, &quot;South Bay&quot;, &quot;Far South Bay&quot;, &quot;North Wall&quot;, and &quot;Far North Wall&quot;. Woodcroft Quarry is behind Fly Wall and is the most recently developed area; routes are still being added (2009). The majority of the routes in the quarry are bolt-protected sport routes of varying degrees of quality. The Fly Wall is the most convenient traditional climbing route area with a small number of well-travelled (often polished) routes at HS &amp; VS (See Grade (climbing)), and some good HVS to E5 routes. These two areas have recently (2009) come under the threat of development into a land fill site.

Great Overhanging (GO) Wall is the largest cliff at Wintour&#x27;s and contains 4 and 5-pitch extremes. The routes here are multi-pitch&#x27; trouser fillers&#x27; all of which are technical and steep. Many break through the massive overhangs near the top of the wall. The routes are in the range E2 - E6, but also includes the iconic &#x27;must do&#x27; route &#x27;Burning Giraffe&#x27; at HVS. The southern bays contain a number of easier and very good multi-pitch routes in the grade range of Mod - E2. The north wall consists again of rather steep multi-pitch routes. Although there are 2 HS routes and a number of very good VS routes. The far end of the north wall is again very steep with stepped overhangs. The rock is also very compact, not lending itself to traditional protection. There is a lot of fixed gear here.

<text>Junior technician (Jnr Tech or J/T) was a junior non-commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and is also used in the Pakistan Air Force. In the RAF, it ranked above senior aircraftman and below corporal and had a NATO rank code of OR-2. In 2000, the RAF replaced it with Senior aircraftman technician, although junior technicians promoted before this date retained their rank.

==Pakistan==
Junior technician is also a rank in the Pakistan Air Force, where it ranks between corporal technician and senior aircraftman. Since 2006 it has been represented by single chevron beneath an eagle with outstretched wings.

==United Kingdom==

The rank of junior technician was only held by airmen in technical trades and by those who joined as apprentices (both technical and administrative) and by musicians. Airmen in non-technical trades always progressed directly from senior aircraftman to corporal. Junior technicians were qualified to work alone and supervise untrained airmen working within their area of responsibility. The rank was introduced in 1950 as part of a new grading system for technicians, wearing a single point up chevron. In 1964, when the grading system was abolished, the rank of junior technician was retained, with the badge changing to a four-bladed propeller. The last administrative apprentices (the 46th entry) passed out from RAF Hereford in 1963.

<text>Silvestre &quot;Silver&quot; Reyes (born November 10, 1944) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , serving from 1997 to 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he was Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence between 2007 and 2011. In the Democratic Primary election on May 29, 2012, Reyes lost by a margin wide enough to avert a runoff election to former El Paso city councilman Beto O&#x27;Rourke.

In 2008 Reyes served as the Southwest Co-Chairman for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign along with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Then U.S. Senator Clinton praised Reyes saying he was &quot;one of our wisest and most experienced leaders on national security and the particular issues that affect Americans living along the border and throughout the Southwest. I am proud to have his support and grateful for his advice.&quot;

==Early life, education, and career==
Reyes was born in Canutillo, an unincorporated suburban community west of El Paso, and is the oldest of 10 children. He graduated from Canutillo High School and received his associate degree from El Paso Community College. He attended the University of Texas at Austin before serving in the United States Army in 1966. In 1967, Reyes served as a helicopter crew chief in the Vietnam War. In 1968, Reyes suffered complete hearing loss to his right ear when mortar landed near his foxhole during combat.

In 1969, Reyes joined the U.S. Border Patrol where he served for over 26 years. From 1984 - 1995 Reyes served as the Sector Chief for the McAllen and El Paso Sectors of the Border Patrol. In 1993, while serving as the Chief Patrol Agent of the El Paso Border Patrol Sector, Reyes led the Border Patrol to strategically position agents on the border to intercept illegal immigrants in a strategy later termed &quot;Operation Hold the Line&quot;. This operation was the predecessor to a similar operation dubbed &quot;Operation Gatekeeper&quot; in Southern California. Such tactics were not without controversy, as placing Border Patrol Agents in high visibility positions placed them at tremendous risk from rock and firearms assaults from the Mexican side of the border. Immigrant-rights groups also protested the strategy, as it was effective in deterring illegal immigrants from crossing in protected urban areas such as El Paso and San Diego, California, and as such forced them to cross through desolate and more dangerous parts of the Southwestern United States, such as the deserts of the Imperial Valley in California and the Sonora desert in Arizona. Reyes gained enormous popularity in the 16th Congressional District due to the Operation&#x27;s success, along with other factors, in reducing illegal immigration.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
As a senior member of both the Armed Services and (formerly) Select Intelligence Committees, Reyes was a key player in developing military and defense policy. He is credited with the recent success of Fort Bliss and White Sands military bases in the most recent Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions by the Department of Defense. On December 1, 2006, Reyes was tapped by Pelosi, the prospective Speaker of the House, to be the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Reyes was a key player in the 109th Congress because of his Immigration and Border Patrol experience. He was instrumental in leading the opposition to the House immigration proposal proposed by James Sensenbrenner, H.R. 4437. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi selected Reyes to present and lead the debate on a Democratic substitute to replace the Sensenbrenner legislation, which was voted down on a party line vote.

Reyes has served as chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. In 2002, he considered running for the United States Senate, but decided against such a move. In 2005 he missed 94 votes in the House, the ninth most of any member.

On March 27, 2009, Reyes was tapped by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to lead a high-level Congressional Delegation to meet with President Felipe Calderón of Mexico. Reyes led the delegation and was accompanied by Ike Skelton, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Howard Berman, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The three high-ranking Chairman discussed Mexico&#x27;s efforts to combat drug-related violence and assessed U.S. efforts to assist the Mexican government.

In his role as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Reyes was a deciding factor in whether legislation on the floor of the House extending provisions of the FISA would include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies which participated in the NSA&#x27;s warrantless wiretap program. Although he initially supported immunity for telecommunications companies, saying that immunity was necessary and the companies hadn&#x27;t done anything illegal, eventually after being contacted by pressure groups, the version of the legislation he introduced did not contain provisions for telecom immunity, despite Republican threats to torpedo any bill that did not contain telecom immunity.

In the same interview, Reyes said he favored sending more troops to Iraq: &quot;on a temporary basis, I&#x27;m willing to ramp them up by twenty or thirty thousand ... for, I don&#x27;t know, two months, four months, six months – but certainly that would be an exception.&quot; Yet, a month later, when President George W. Bush proposed sending approximately 21,500 more troops, Reyes said to the &quot;El Paso Times&quot;, &quot;we don&#x27;t have the capability to escalate even to this minimal level.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Readiness
*United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence(Chair)

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Arts Caucus
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Chair)

===Awards===

In 2006, Reyes was also selected as the &quot;El Pasoan of the Year&quot; by the El Paso, Inc. for his successful efforts in Congress to expand the role and mission of Fort Bliss. He is also the recipient of the League of United Latin American Citizens &quot;Lucy G. Acosta Humanitarian Award,&quot; and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce &quot;President&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.&quot;

In 2008, the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) presented Reyes with the &quot;Outstanding Legislator Award,&quot; calling him as a &quot;great [friend] of the Army as an institution and [supporter] of soldiers and their families.&quot; Reyes established the Congressional USO (United Service Organizations) Caucus. That same year ASME honored Reyes with the ASME President&#x27;s Award on April 3, 2008. ASME President Sam Zamrik presented the award in recognition of Reyes&#x27; &quot;outstanding contributions in promoting diversity in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields&quot; as the co-founder of the Congressional Diversity and Innovation Caucus.

The Frontera Land Alliance presented Reyes with the organization&#x27;s &quot;Rock Award&quot; in 2010 for his efforts to preserve Castner Range in Northeast El Paso for conservation purposes. As a senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee, Reyes worked to transfer ownership of Castner Range from the Department of Defense to preserve the 7,000-acres of undeveloped desert, foothills, and mountains in Northeast El Paso.

In 2012 The Minority Business Development Agency presented Reyes with their Venable Legacy Award for Lifetime Achievement ABE during their National Minority Enterprise Week Conference.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute honored Reyes known on the hill for his humor by naming their annual stand up comedy event the &quot;Reyes of Comedy&quot; in 2000. The event seeks to promote a positive image of Latinos while raising critical funds for CHCI&#x27;s programs that empower Latino youth through educational attainment and leadership development programs. In 2013 the Institute chose Reyes as the inaugural inductee into the Reyes of Comedy Hall of fame.

On October 29, 2012 the Canutillo Independent School District Board of Trustees voted unanimously to name a school after Reyes and his wife Carolina. The school which is to be open by the 2014-15 school year will serve students in grades pre-kindergarten through eighth.

==Political campaigns==
In 1995, Reyes retired from the U.S. Border Patrol and announced his candidacy for the U.S. Congress against Ron Coleman in the Democratic primary, but Coleman later retired. Reyes finished first in a five-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He then defeated Jose Luis Sanchez in the runoff by just over 1,000 votes. He won the general election with little trouble, taking 70 percent of the vote. Although the 16th has long since become a Latino-majority district, Reyes was the first Latino to represent the district.

He was reelected seven times with no substantive Republican opposition. He only faced a Libertarian challenger in 1998 and 2008, and was completely unopposed in 2000.

In 2012, Reyes lost the Democratic primary to former El Paso City Council member Beto O&#x27;Rourke, taking 44.4 percent of the vote—just a few hundred votes short of forcing a runoff. Reyes&#x27; campaign received endorsements from incumbent President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, with the latter appearing at a rally for him.

<doc id="966515" wikidata="Q437852" url="?curid=966515" title="Pete Sessions">
<text>Peter Anderson Sessions (born March 22, 1955) is an American politician who serves in the United States House of Representatives for Texas&#x27;s 17th congressional district as a member of the Republican Party. He chaired the House Rules Committee from 2013 to 2019 and is a former chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 

Sessions previously served in Congress from 1997 to 2019, representing districts based in Dallas. He was defeated for reelection by Democrat Colin Allred in 2018. On October 3, 2019, Sessions announced that he was running for Congress again in 2020. He was elected to the 17th district, based in Waco, on November 3, 2020.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Pete Sessions was born in Waco, Texas, on March 22, 1955, to Alice June Lewis and William S. Sessions, who served as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He attended Winston Churchill High School and graduated from Southwestern University in 1978. He worked at Southwestern Bell for sixteen years and rose to become a district manager for marketing in Dallas. The Boy Scouts of America recognized Sessions as a &quot;Distinguished Eagle Scout.&quot; He holds a position on the Circle Ten Council of the BSA. His two sons are also active in scouting.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====1997–2019====
In 1991, Sessions finished sixth in a special election for the House of Representatives. In 1993, he left his job with Southwestern Bell to again run for Congress, against 5th District incumbent Democratic representative John Bryant. He toured the district with a livestock trailer full of horse manure, claiming that the Clinton Administration&#x27;s health care plan stank more than the manure. He lost by 2,400 votes. He subsequently became vice president for public policy at the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), a Dallas-based conservative public policy research institute.
In 1996, when Bryant ran for a Senate seat, Sessions was elected to succeed him in the 5th District, defeating Democratic nominee John Pouland with 47% of the vote. He was reelected in 1998, defeating schoolteacher Victor Morales with 56% of the vote. In 2000, he defeated Regina Montoya Coggins with 54% of the vote. When redistricting after the 2000 census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District, in which he ran in the 2002 election and defeated Pauline Dixon with 68% of the vote.

In 2004, Sessions defeated 13-term Democratic incumbent Martin Frost, who had moved to the 32nd after redistricting in 2003 eliminated Frost&#x27;s former district. Sessions won 54–44% in what was considered the most expensive U.S. House race in the nation. According to the Associated Press, &quot;The race also was one of the nastiest, with Frost unearthing a decades-old streaking incident by Sessions in his college days and questioning his commitment to security with an ad featuring the World Trade Center towers in flames. In response, he criticized Frost for booking Peter Yarrow of the 1960s group Peter, Paul and Mary for a fundraiser. Yarrow had faced an indecency with a child charge years earlier.&quot;

In 2010, Sessions faced Dallas businessman and attorney Grier Raggio and Libertarian John Jay Myers. The election was initially considered one of the top dark-horse battles in the country, but Sessions was reelected. In 2012, he faced Democratic candidate Katherine Savers McGovern and independent candidate Seth Hollis. Sessions was endorsed by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; and was reelected. In the 2014 Republican primary, Sessions defeated conservative Katrina Pierson, an African American aligned with the Tea Party movement, polling 28,954 votes (63.6%) to her 16,560 (36.4%). Pierson, originally allied with U.S. senator Ted Cruz, later joined Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign staff.

In 2016, Sessions polled 49,632 votes (61.4%) to gain renomination in the Republican primary, which had a much greater turnout than in 2014. The runner-up, Russ K. Ramsland of Dallas, received 19,105 votes (23.6%). Paul M. Brown of Richardson received 9,488 (11.7%), and Cherie Myint Roughneen received 2,601 (3.2%).

Sessions lost his bid for reelection in 2018 to Democrat Colin Allred, a lawyer and former professional (NFL) football player.

==== 2020 ====

In October 2019, Sessions announced his candidacy for the 2020 election in Texas&#x27;s 17th congressional district. While the 17th is about from his former district, it is based in his boyhood home in Waco. Sessions sold his home in Dallas and bought a home in Waco soon after announcing his candidacy. Sessions&#x27;s bid received a chilly reception from some Republicans in the district, including the retiring five-term incumbent, Bill Flores. Despite this, Sessions led the field in a crowded 12-way Republican primary–the real contest in this heavily Republican district. He then defeated healthcare executive Renee Swann in a runoff, securing the Republican nomination and all but assuring his return to Congress.

===Tenure===

Through August 2017, Sessions voted with his party in 98.8% of votes in the 115th session of Congress and voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 97.5% of votes.

In November 1997, Sessions was one of 18 House Republicans to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. That scandal led to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Sessions voted for legislation to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, he voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

Sessions voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol. He also was among 147 congressional Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 election results.

In October 2021, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Sessions had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose the purchase of stock in Amazon. Sessions again violated the STOCK Act when, in February 2022, he was late in reporting seven stock trades that he had made during 2021 worth between $7,001 and $105,000.

Sessions unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election.

====Republican Party leadership positions====
In the 2010 election, while he was chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party gained control of the House with a net gain of 63 seats and 89 new freshman members.

In 2014, Sessions was originally a candidate for the post of House majority leader, to replace Eric Cantor, but withdrew from the internal House Republican Conference election, leaving the field clear for Kevin McCarthy of California.

===Committee assignments===
117th Congress:

*Committee on Financial Services
*Committee on Oversight and Reform

Formerly: Committee on Science, Space, and Technology

113th-115th Congress:

* House Committee on Rules, chair

In 2012, Sessions was named chair of the House Rules Committee for the 113th Congress by Speaker of the House John Boehner. He retained his chairmanship into the 115th Congress.
* Subcommittee on Rules and the Organization of the House

====Party leadership and caucus memberships====
* National Republican Congressional Committee, former chairman
* Results Caucus
* Malaysia Trade, Security and Economic Cooperation Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* Congressional Hispanic Conference
* Tea Party Caucus
* Congressional Cement Caucus
*Congressional Western Caucus

==Political views==
===Foreign policy===
In 2017, Sessions, as chair of the House Rules Committee, stalled a bill imposing additional sanctions against Russia and Iran from moving to the floor, saying that some parts of the bill, which passed the Senate on a 98–2 vote, could create &quot;huge problems to companies in Dallas, Texas, that I represent&quot; and place them at a competitive disadvantage.

In July 2018, Sessions argued that it was unnecessary to increase federal funding for election security. The U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that it was continuing to interfere in election systems as of July 2018.

Sessions and Rudy Giuliani were involved in back-channel talks attempting to persuade Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to leave office in 2018. The effort was backed in part by private interests. The negotiations were opposed by White House officials including then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported.

===Economic policy===
In late 2001 and early 2002, Sessions cosigned letters to two Cabinet members asking them to shut down casinos operated by several Native American tribes. Within 18 months of sending the letters, he received a total of $20,500 from tribes associated with Jack Abramoff. In response to criticism, his office said that he wrote the letters because he believed that gambling is a local issue, falling under his long-held support for federalism.

In 2008, Sessions added a $1.6 million earmark for dirigible research to an appropriations bill. The earmark benefited a Chicago company, Jim G. Ferguson &amp; Associates, that had no experience in government contracting or dirigible research. Former Sessions aide and convicted felon Adrian Plesha was a lobbyist for the firm. In September, Plesha sued Jim G. Ferguson &amp; Associates for non-payment of fees and expenses connected with his lobbying effort on their behalf.

In 2022, Sessions was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

Sessions was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

===Magic===
In March 2016, Sessions introduced a House resolution to &quot;recognize magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure.&quot;

===Cannabis===
In 2024, Sessions called THC; “addictive” and “dangerous to the health and growth of every American.”
Sessions opposed allowing states to determine their own policies regarding the legality of cannabis and the regulation of legal cannabis markets. As chair of the House Rules Committee, he repeatedly stifled proposed amendments relaxing federal laws against cannabis, including one that would have allowed medical marijuana access to veterans in states where the drug is legal. VSOs such as the DAV are active lobbyists for cannabis.

===Military and police===
Sessions supported the 1033 program, under which the U.S. military transfers surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies; the program is controversial because of its association with militarization of police. In 2015 and 2017, he cosponsored Republican legislation to reverse the Obama administration&#x27;s restrictions on the 1033 program.

=== Hurricane aid ===
In 2012, Sessions voted against disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. In August 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, he called for disaster relief for its victims.

===Ethics===
In 2016, Sessions criticized the independent, nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), calling it &quot;a political witch hunt&quot; and &quot;an outside process that&#x27;s very controversial, is not working well and is highly unpopular because of its original mandate and jurisdiction is hugely flawed.&quot; In 2017, he publicly defended a House Republican plan to dismantle the OCE; the plan was abandoned after a public uproar. Sessions is opposed to banning members of Congress from trading stocks.

===Environment===
In 2017, Sessions sponsored a bill to delay for nine years the full implementation of 2015 ozone standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration; the bill passed the House, largely on party lines.

Sessions supported the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014, a bill that would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) from prosecution under the Lacey Act for transferring water containing invasive species from Oklahoma to Texas. The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders. Sessions argued that the bill was necessary to prevent &quot;more than 1.5 million customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District&quot; from facing &quot;restricted access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in Lake Texoma.&quot;

===Orlando shooting===
Sessions drew controversy in 2016 when he asserted that the site of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the scene of a terrorist mass shooting, was not a gay club.

=== Healthcare ===
Sessions opposes abortion and supports defunding Planned Parenthood.

Sessions favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;). He supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act, the House Republicans&#x27; replacement for the ACA. On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the ACA and pass the American Health Care Act.

===Race===
In September 2010, Sessions remarked after watching the Princeton University men&#x27;s basketball team, &quot;How often can you go see a bunch of white guys play basketball?&quot; He also reportedly said that the players stayed entirely below the rim. The comments were described as an allusion to the phrase &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot;, and were called inappropriate by New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell.

Less than two weeks after his &quot;white guys&quot; comments, Sessions made controversial comments about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) giving money to and supporting &quot;African Americans like Sanford Bishop. And when you have to retreat back to ... your hard base you&#x27;re having to make tough decisions.&quot;

=== Immigration and citizenship ===
Sessions voted against the DREAM Act in 2010.

Sessions supported Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order imposing a temporary ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying, &quot;Just as President Obama suspended the refugee program in 2011 for six months, the Trump administration is working to protect national security by making adjustments in the refugee vetting process. It is critical that we address the threat of individuals who come to our country to create chaos and threaten our freedom.&quot;

In 2017, Sessions suggested that Congress could appropriate funds for part of construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall demanded by Trump as part of &quot;a Republican-only bill&quot; to continue funding the government.

===Ties to Allen Stanford===
Sessions came under scrutiny for his personal ties to disgraced banker Allen Stanford, who in 2012 was convicted of orchestrating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. Sessions received over $44,000 in political contributions from Stanford and his associates. He also took multiple trips to Fire Island and to the Caribbean to attend Stanford-sponsored events; these trips included private travel on Stanford&#x27;s fleet of jets and accommodations. In 2014, VICE News obtained records from Stanford&#x27;s internal files that indicated that in 2007 and 2008, before the scandal came to light, Sessions had intervened on Stanford&#x27;s behalf with the Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, allowing Stanford to bypass certain Cuban embargo restrictions. Also, in 2004, Sessions and two other Republican representatives, Bob Ney and John E. Sweeney, wrote to Venezuelan banking regulators, &quot;vouching for Stanford&#x27;s character when Stanford was trying to obtain a charter to open a bank in the country, at a time when regulators there were reluctant because of reports they had received that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme and engaged in money laundering.&quot;

===Legislative strategy===
In early February 2009, Sessions made the following comment about the Republican Party legislative strategy in the House of Representatives: &quot;Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban. And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person&#x27;s entire processes.&quot; He continued: &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban... I&#x27;m saying an example of how you go about [it] is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their front-line message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with.&quot;

===Countrywide Financial loan===
In January 2012, it was reported that Sessions received a so-called &quot;VIP&quot; or &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; loan in 2007 from troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which was granted at a lower interest rate than was available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo created the program to boost the company&#x27;s standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. Sessions received a $1 million loan from Countrywide at below-market rates, which he never declared in financial disclosures. His name and those of other legislators who received similar loans subsequently appeared in a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform&#x27;s ethics investigation into improper gifts. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform when its investigation found he did not receive any preferential treatment or a below-market interest rate on his mortgage from Countrywide.

===Other===
In 2008, Sessions introduced legislation that created a commemorative silver dollar coin celebrating the centennial of the Boy Scouts of America. The bill passed the House on a 403–8 vote and the Senate unanimously; it was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

==Connection to Ukraine influence investigation==
On October 10, 2019, the &quot;Texas Tribune,&quot; among other news outlets, reported that Sessions was identifiable as &quot;Congressman-1&quot; in an indictment by the Southern District of New York charging Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with illegal campaign contributions aimed at removing former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch. In 2018, after meeting with Parnas and Fruman, Sessions authored a letter in his capacity as House Rules Committee chair calling for Yovanovitch&#x27;s removal. On October 15, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the grand jury investigating the matter had issued subpoenas to Sessions, with which his spokesperson said he would cooperate. Sessions denied that he took any action as a result of his meetings with Parnas and Fruman.

==Personal life==
In February 1984, Sessions married Juanita &quot;Nete&quot; Diaz; the couple had two sons. In August 2011, they divorced after 27 years of marriage. In August 2012, Sessions married Karen Diebel, a 2010 congressional candidate in Florida and a first Trump administration appointee to the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

Sessions is descended from Richard Sessions, who owned 96 slaves in Chicot County, Arkansas. Richard&#x27;s land was valued at $75,000 and with inflation his personal wealth was around $113 million. His house was raided during the American Civil War and was financially unsuccessful after the war.

Pete Sessions is not related to former Senator and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

<text>Senior aircraftman (SAC) or senior aircraftwoman (SACW) was a rank in the Royal Air Force, ranking between leading aircraftman and senior aircraftman technician (SAC(T)) (although SACs in non-technical trades progressed directly to corporal) and having a NATO rank code of OR-2. The rank, which was non-supervisory, was introduced on 1 January 1951. The rank badge was a three-bladed propeller. The rank was renamed Air Specialist (class 1) (AS1) in the Royal Air Force in July 2022.

==Senior aircraftman (technician)==
From March 2005, SACs in technical trades who had attained the Operational Performance Standard were promoted to Senior aircraftman technician SAC Tech and given a new badge of rank, consisting of the three-bladed propeller inside a circle. This new rank was introduced, to distinguish airmen trained to work unsupervised from those who were not, and is equivalent to the old junior technician rank.

<doc id="966518" wikidata="Q5293513" url="?curid=966518" title="Don Sherwood (politician)">
<text>Donald Lewis Sherwood (born March 5, 1941) is an American politician. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Pennsylvania&#x27;s 10th congressional district, from 1999 to 2007. He was defeated for reelection by Democrat Chris Carney in November 2006.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Born in Nicholson, Pennsylvania, Sherwood attended Lackawanna Trail High School and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1963, and spent the next two years in the U.S. Army. He opened a Chevrolet-Pontiac dealership in Tunkhannock and became well known in northeastern Pennsylvania through his ads in the area. He was also one of the original owner principals of Tunkhannock radio station WEMR, which first went on the air in 1986. Though he has since sold the radio station, the car dealership is still owned by his family. He is married and has three daughters.

Sherwood began his political career in 1975, when he was elected to the Tunkhannock Area School Board. He served on this panel for 23 years, the last six as board president.

===Congressional career===
In 1998, Sherwood won the Republican nomination to replace 10th District Congressman Joseph McDade, who was retiring after serving 36 years in Congress. He barely won the general election that year, edging out Democrat Patrick Casey, son of former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey, by 515 votes. Some believe McDade&#x27;s 11th-hour endorsement of Sherwood made the difference, even though Sherwood is considerably more conservative than McDade. He almost certainly got an additional boost from Governor Tom Ridge&#x27;s landslide reelection victory. Sherwood narrowly defeated Casey again in 2000, most likely helped by George W. Bush narrowly winning the district.

For the better part of half a century, the 10th had been a relatively compact district covering the northeastern corner of the state, stretching just far enough to the south to grab Scranton, by far its largest city. The 10th had long been considered a swing district, though Republicans had held the seat since 1961. Redistricting by the Pennsylvania legislature after the 2000 census made Sherwood&#x27;s district more Republican. Heavily Democratic Scranton, home to some 60 percent of the district&#x27;s population, was shifted to the Wilkes-Barre based 11th, already a Democratic stronghold. In its place, the legislature added some more rural territory that had previously been in the heavily Republican 5th District. Sherwood successfully ran for re-election from this new district against third-party candidate Kurt Shotko in 2002 and 2004, in both cases winning with over 80 percent of the vote.

In 2002, he was named to the PoliticsPA list of Best Dressed Legislators.

===Extramarital affair/report of abuse ===

On September 15, 2004, a woman locked herself inside the bathroom of Sherwood&#x27;s Washington, D.C. apartment, and called 911 to report she was assaulted. When police arrived, the woman, Cynthia Ore, accused Sherwood of choking her, though he maintained he was only giving her a backrub. No charges were filed because both Sherwood and Ore refused to provide any details. The report of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department stated, &quot;Both parties have left out significant information or are not willing to discuss in detail what actually happened.&quot;
The details of that incident went unnoticed until 2005, when Veronica Hannevig, who ran against Sherwood on the right wing Constitution Party ticket in 2004, distributed a copy of the police report to several newspapers and television stations. Sherwood initially contended that Ore was merely a &quot;casual acquaintance&quot;. He eventually admitted he had a five-year extramarital affair with Ore, but denied abusing her.
Ore later filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against Sherwood, accusing him of repeatedly assaulting her during their relationship. On November 8, 2005, Sherwood and Ore ended the lawsuit by reaching a settlement, the terms of which were not released.

On November 3, 2006, the Associated Press reported that a source had revealed the terms of Sherwood&#x27;s settlement with Ore. The story reports that Sherwood agreed to pay her about $500,000 but a confidentiality clause requires Ore to forfeit some of the money if she talks publicly about the case. It also reported that Ore had, as of November 3, received only about half of the money and that she would receive the other half after the November 7 election, giving Ore &quot;a powerful incentive for her to keep quiet until after Election Day.&quot; 
The Ore incident damaged Sherwood’s standing with some Republicans. In April 2006, Martha Rainville, a Republican running for the U.S. House seat in Vermont, announced that she would return a campaign contribution from Sherwood’s political action committee. She cited her belief in &quot;strong family values&quot;. But Sherwood received strong support from Republican leaders for the 2006 Republican primary in his district (see below).

===2006 re-election campaign===

====Primary====
In the Republican primary on May 15, 2006, Sherwood was held to 56 percent of the vote against political newcomer Kathy Scott. Sherwood received 56% of the vote. &quot;CQPolitics&quot; reported that his &quot;mediocre showing&quot; could be attributed to the admitted affair. Scott did not file a report with the FEC, which indicates that she spent less than $5,000 in her campaign.

Prior to the primary, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum endorsed Sherwood and recorded an automated telephone call on Sherwood’s behalf, as did President George W. Bush. Sherwood also received campaign contributions from several political action committees of other Republican members of the House.

====General election====
In the general election in November, Sherwood lost to Democrat Chris Carney, a former Defense Department consultant and navy lieutenant commander.

Carney criticized Sherwood&#x27;s record on the issues, but also ran what the Associated Press described as &quot;a hard-hitting commercial focusing on the [extramarital] affair&quot;. The ad quoted a voter saying, &quot;This incident with Don Sherwood just cuts right at the core values of our district.&quot; The background displayed the text &quot;repeatedly choking&quot; and &quot;attempting to strangle plaintiff&quot;, taken from the lawsuit filed by Ore against Sherwood.

Sherwood countered with a television ad in which he apologized for his affair with Ore, but denied ever abusing her. Addressing viewers, Sherwood said, &quot;While I&#x27;m truly sorry for disappointing you, I never wavered from my commitment to reduce taxes, create jobs and bring home our fair share.&quot; He added, &quot;Should you forgive me, you can count on me to keep on fighting hard for you and your family.&quot;

Carney defeated Sherwood in the election, 53% to 47%.

<doc id="966520" wikidata="Q584412" url="?curid=966520" title="Charles/MGH station">
<text>Charles/MGH station is a rapid transit station on the MBTA Red Line, elevated above Charles Circle on the east end of the Longfellow Bridge in the West End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The station is named for Charles Circle and the adjacent Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) campus. It has two side platforms, with a glass-walled headhouse structure inside Charles Circle. Charles/MGH station is fully accessible.

The Cambridge subway opened in 1912; planning for an infill station at Charles Street began in 1924. After several false starts, construction of Charles station began in 1931. The Art Deco station, with cast stone headhouse and copper-sheathed platforms, opened on February 27, 1932. A pedestrian tunnel that provided station access was replaced by footbridges in 1961. The station was renamed Charles/MGH in 1973. From 2003 to 2007, the station was renovated for accessibility; a new glass entrance replaced the original structure. The proposed Red Blue Connector would extend the Blue Line to Charles/MGH, with a new underground platform level.

==Station design==

Charles/MGH station is located at Charles Circle at the west end of the West End and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The station is on a short elevated segment that connects tracks in the median of the Longfellow Bridge to the west with an incline into the Beacon Hill Tunnel to the east. The two elevated side platforms, above ground level, run west from Charles Circle onto the east end of the Longfellow Bridge.

At their east ends, the platforms widen into passageways that lead to elevators, escalators, and stairs to the surface-level fare lobby in the center of Charles Circle. The station entrance is on the west side of the fare lobby under the tracks, with crosswalks connecting to the sidewalks on both sides of Cambridge Street. The fare lobby and passageways are wrapped in a teardrop-shaped curved glass facade, while most of the platforms have a patinaed copper windscreen.
==History==
===Opening===

The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened its Cambridge Subway from Park Street Under to Harvard on March 23, 1912. The line ran in the median of the Longfellow Bridge to cross the Charles River. Like the Lechmere extension opened the same year and the Boylston Street subway opened in 1914, the Cambridge Subway originally had no station serving the area just outside downtown Boston, to speed travel time from farther stations. Although Bowdoin opened on an extension of the East Boston Tunnel in 1916, much of the West End and Beacon Hill neighborhoods were poorly served by the subway system.

On June 2, 1924, the Massachusetts General Court passed legislation authorizing the state Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to construct an infill station at Charles Street. Following a 1924 study by the Boston Transit Department (BTD), the DPU delegated the project to the BTD on January 12, 1925. That study also considered an extension of the East Boston Tunnel to Charles Street to provide a transfer between the lines. The project stalled in 1926 as the $600,000 appropriated by the legislature was only sufficient for four-car platforms, while the BERy insisted on six-car platforms at a cost of $850,000 to accommodate its future plans.

Despite pressure from the Massachusetts General Hospital, located adjacent to the proposed station site, the legislature again refused additional funding in 1927. Uncertainty over whether the station would be built delayed plans to construct a traffic circle at the intersection.

No further progress was made until 1930, when the BERy and BTD reached an agreement for a $350,000 station with four-car platforms. The cost reduction was achieved by having the platforms on the straight track west of Charles Street, rather than the curve to the east. Plans for the station were completed in July 1930. Bidding on the station opened in early July 1931, and a construction contract was awarded later that month. Charles Circle was completed in November 1931, by which time the steel structure of the station was in place in the center of the traffic circle. Charles station opened on February 27, 1932. The station was served by Bowdoin Square–Park Square and Charles station–Massachusetts station bus routes, though a Kendall Square–Bowdoin Square route was closed with the station&#x27;s opening.

Charles station was designed by H. Parker from the office of Richard Clipston Sturgis. The three-story headhouse structure, , was framed with steel and clad in cast stone. The first story had a rough finish, while the double-height second story and the third story (divided into two by the tracks) were smooth. The structure was Art Deco/Art Moderne in style, with decorative pilasters and a chevron panel. The platforms had copper windscreens, also in Art Deco style. A north-south pedestrian underpass crossed the traffic circle, with stairs leading from the underpass to the station entrance. Only the north half of the underpass was originally planned; public pressure resulted in the addition of the south half. A 14-story Art Deco tower over the station, designed by H. F. Kellogg, was proposed but never built.

===Modifications and the MBTA===

In 1961, the pedestrian underpass was replaced by a pair of footbridges, with the south footbridge forked to reach both sides of Charles Street. The second story was modified to serve as a fare mezzanine, with a low ceiling under the trackway. Openings were cut in the walls to accommodate the footbridges. Around half of pedestrian traffic on the footbridges was crossing the circle rather than using the station, which caused congestion in the mezzanine area.

On January 13, 1961, the MTA began operating &quot;modified express service&quot; on the line during the morning rush hour, following the introduction of similar service on the Forest Hills–Everett line the month before. Every other train bypassed Charles and three other stations. This was discontinued in September 1961 to reduce wait times at the skipped stations, most of which were outdoors. In 1964, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) replaced the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which had replaced the BERy in 1947. The MBTA designated the line as the Red Line in 1965.

The final bus service at the station, a Back Bay–Downtown circulator route, was discontinued in June 1971. In December 1973, the station was renamed Charles/MGH after the nearby Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Three southbound trains collided inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel just south of the station on August 1, 1975, injuring 132 passengers. In 1982, the platforms were extended west to allow for use of six-car trains, which began operation in 1988. Surveys in 1984 and 1987 found that the station was not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Reconstruction===

The MBTA renovated most Red Line stations for accessibility in the 1980s and 1990s. Planning began for modifications to Charles/MGH in the late 1990s. Although the station was determined to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register, it was in poor condition: the cast stone cladding was spalled and cracked, water infiltration had rusted steel and damaged plaster, and the mezzanine level was overcrowded. The platforms were pitted, columns were rusted, and paint was peeling. Three options were developed in a 2000 design report: rehabilitation of the existing station with added elevators, a new surface-level station entrance slightly to the east inside the traffic circle, and a surface-level entrance at Cedar Street with a footbridge above the tracks and ramps down to the platforms. The second option was recommended.

In June 2003, the MBTA began its $34.4 million reconstruction of the station – part of a $48.6 million project that also realigned Charles Circle. Temporary staircases directly to the platforms were opened in May 2004. The pedestrian bridges were removed, and the original headhouses were demolished in July 2004. The new glass headhouse was built slightly to the east of the former headhouse location. The copper platform enclosures were restored with new interior cladding to preserve some of the historic station architecture.

The new entrance opened on February 17, 2007, making the station fully accessible. Public art created by the community from recycled materials was installed in the fare lobby in June 2007. The renovations made the station no longer eligible for National Register inclusion. The renovation received the &quot;Honor Award&quot; from the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board in 2009.

Design began in October 2019 for rehabilitation of the viaduct spans around the station, as well as the station platforms. The project will also include a new accessible station entrance west of the existing headhouse. Project design was placed on hold in July 2024 at 30% completion pending funding for construction.
===Proposed Blue Line connection===

The Red–Blue connector is a proposed extension of the Blue Line from west under Cambridge Street, providing a direct transfer between the Red and Blue lines. The project was first proposed in 1924, and was returned to consideration in the 1978 update to the Program for Mass Transportation. In 1991, the state agreed to build the project by 2011 as part of the settlement of a lawsuit over auto emissions from the Big Dig project. This commitment was changed to design only in 2007–08 and lifted entirely in 2015.

Original plans for the connector in 1986 called for a cut-and-cover tunnel extension west from Bowdoin, with an underground stub-end terminal connected to the existing Charles/MGH station. Three configurations for the Blue Line level at Charles/MGH were considered: a three-track terminal with two island platforms, a two-track terminal with one island platform and pocket tracks to the east, and a three-track terminal with one island platform (one track not used for passenger service) and pocket tracks to the east. The 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report instead called for a pair of deeper tunnels bored by a tunnel boring machine (TBM); the Charles/MGH terminal would have a single island platform with tail tracks extended to the west.

A 2018 update which analyzed multiple tunneling methods maintained this station configuration. In April 2019, the MBTA indicated plans to spend $15 million to design the connector in a five-year spending plan. In April 2021, MGH released the Draft Project Impact Report for their expansion plans, which include space reserved for a new headhouse on the north side of Cambridge Street near North Anderson Street. MBTA conceptual designs created in 2020 and released in 2021 also maintained the station configuration, with the new MGH entrance incorporated. Potential designs not chosen included one with a below-grade fare mezzanine for both lines, and one with the Blue Line platform located on the north side of Charles Circle. Construction was planned to last from 2025 to 2030.

<text>Nadar (also referred to as &quot;Nadan&quot;, &quot;Shanar&quot; and &quot;Shanan&quot;) is a Tamil caste of India. Nadars are predominant in the districts of Kanyakumari, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. 
The Nadar community was not a single caste, but developed from an assortment of related subcastes, which in course of time came under the single banner Nadar. Nadar climbers were the largest subsect of today&#x27;s Nadar community. A few subsects of the Nadar community, such as the Nelamaikkarars, were traditionally wealthy landlords and money lenders. Historically, most Nadars were cultivators of palmyra trees and jaggery and a few were also involved in the toddy trade. Nadar climbers had faced discrimination from major upper castes in some regions. The martial art of Varma Kalai was historically practiced by the Nadars. 
The socio-economic development achieved by the Nadars in southern India has elicited academic interest. Nadars are classified and listed as an Other Backward Class by the governments of both Tamil Nadu and India.

==Etymology==
The community was previously known as &quot;Shanar&quot; but legally changed their name to &quot;Nadar&quot; in 1921. The title &quot;Nadar&quot; is believed to be derived from the Nelamaikkarars, the aristocrats of the Shanar community who had previously used it exclusively. Nadars claim that the original name of the community was &quot;Shantror&quot; or &quot;Shandrar&quot; (noble one) which, in course of time, was corrupted to Shanar. Channar is a title used by the Ezhava community of Kerala. However, there is no evidence to support these claims. 
==History==
The origin of Nadars as a social group is uncertain. Hardgrave stated that the Teri palmyra forests around today&#x27;s Tiruchendur must have been their original abode. In the late 19th century, some Nadar activists started claiming that the Nadars are the descendants of those who ruled the Pandyan kingdom and that when Nayak rulers captured the Pandya country, it was divided into several &quot;Palayams&quot; (divisions) for each of which Palaiyakkars were appointed as rulers. They also claimed that the Nayak rulers of Tamil Nadu imposed &quot;Deshaprashtam&quot; (ostracism) on the ancient Nadars to ensure that they would not rise. According to Hardgrave these claims were not completely baseless. The traditions followed by the Nelamaikkarars and the existence of the ruins beneath the Teri palmrya forests of Tiruchendur and the Pandyan capital city of Korkai, where the Nadar population is predominant, suggest they could very well be the heirs of the Early Pandyas. However, there is little evidence to support the community&#x27;s claim to be descendants of the later Pandya rulers. The identity or caste of the Pandyan kings remains a mystery. This belief, that the Nadars had been the kings of Tamil Nadu, became the dogma of the Nadar community in the 19th century. According to legendary accounts, some of the Nadars had migrated to Sri Lanka, but they had to return to India as they didn&#x27;t receive proper treatment in Sri Lanka. 
==Nadars of the 19th century==
In the early nineteenth century, the Nadars were a community mostly engaged in the palmyra industry, including the production of toddy. However, there were a few subsects comprising wealthy landlords and money lenders. At this time, the majority of Nadars lived south of the Thamirabarani River, and formed 80 – 90 per cent of the population between there and Cape Comorin. Although numerically dominant in the area, the Nadars had a minimal interaction with other communities and they were themselves divided by their various endogamous subcastes, and thus lacked communal cohesion. 
While the majority of the Nadar population in the south of Thamirabarani river were poor, landless palmyra climbers, there also existed a small endogamous sub group of aristocratic Nadars, known as the Nelamaikarrars or Nadans, who owned vast tracts of land. These Nadans either held their position directly under Nayak rulers in the Tiruchendur area or as petty lords under the Palaiyakkarar. They commanded high respect among the population, including from groups such as the Nadar climbers, the minority Vellalars and the Brahmins. Nadan men rode horses and their women rode in covered palanquins. 
Nadar climbers were also to be found in other regions of Tamil Nadu where a few palmyra trees grew. In areas where the Nadar climber population consisted of only a few families in a village, they faced discrimination from major upper castes. Due to their association with toddy, the Nadars were considered lower than other middle castes, but relatively higher than the low castes, and were also prohibited to enter temples built by higher ranked castes. Although associated with toddy, the Nadars did not themselves consume it. The Nadars were schismatic about their position in the caste hierarchy and firmly claimed that they were wrongly placed in the caste system due to the Nayak invasion. They were also very caste conscious. 
===Nadars of Travancore===
Hardgrave conjectures that the Nadars of Southern Travancore migrated there from Tirunelveli in the 16th century after the invasion of Tirunelveli by the Raja of Travancore. Like their Tirunelveli counterparts, the Nadars of Travancore were mostly palmyra climbers. However, a significant number of Nadars were subtenants to Nair or Vellalar landlords. These aristocratic Nadars called themselves Nadans and some of them had direct control over their lands. The Nadans enjoyed special privileges under the Raja and claimed that they were superior to the climbers. The climbers of Travancore fared a little better than their Tirunelveli counterparts but suffered severe social disabilities not found in Tirunelveli due to Travancore&#x27;s rigid caste hierarchy. As Swami Vivekananda stated, the Keralite hierarchy was a lunatic asylum of castes. One example of the social disabilities was that Nadar climber women were not allowed to cover their bosoms to punctuate their low status. However, the Nadan women of the region were exempted from this restriction. 
Discontented with their social status, a large number of Nadar climbers embraced Christianity and became upwardly mobile. Although they improved their status with the aid of Christian missionaries, the outcome of their conversion did not conform to the intent of those missionaries. Both the Christian and Hindu Nadar climber women wore the upper jacket in the manner of upper-class women, in order to improve their social status. In turn, upper-class men abused and discriminated against them. One Nadan family of Agastheeswaram, instead of supporting their depressed counterparts, supported the upper-class men and claimed that only their women had the right to wear an upper cloth. The situation became known as the Upper cloth controversy and became violent. Eventually, with assistance from the Travancore authorities, British Christian Missionaries and Vaikunta Swamy, the depressed Nadar climber women won the right to wear their upper cloth in the manner of their Nadan counterparts. 
===Northern Nadars===
Some petty Nadar traders migrated from southern Tirunelveli to northern Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. Over time they became commercially skilled and by the late 19th century were socially aspirant. Mercantilism played a crucial role in facilitating their upward mobility but religion was also perceived as a vehicle. Around 10 percent of the community converted to Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant. 
British rule in the southern districts introduced new opportunities for trade and commerce, of which the Nadars took advantage. They established sophisticated &quot;pettais&quot; (fortified compounds) and &quot;urvinmurais&quot; (local caste associations) to ensure safety for their goods. Members of the &quot;uravinmurai&quot;, who were known as &quot;muraikkarars&quot;, would contribute a portion of their income to the association as &quot;mahimai&quot; (literally, to glorify oneself), in order to use the facilities of the &quot;pettais&quot; and to improve the common good. As the wealth of the Northern Nadars increased they began also to adopt the customs of the North Indian Kshatriyas in order to improve their social status, in a process now known as Sanskritisation. Many tried to disassociate themselves from their Nadar climber counterparts and the term Shanar (the term generally used to call a Tamil palmrya climber). They adopted the title of &quot;Nadan&quot;, previously used only by the Nelamaikkarars. 
To demonstrate their wealthy and powerful social position, the Nadars of Sivakasi hired Maravar palanquin bearers. 
The upward mobility and kshatriya pretensions of the Nadars of the six towns of Ramanad caused resentment among both the Vellalar and the Maravar castes, who were ritually ranked above the Nadars. The outcome was a series of caste conflicts, including the Sivakasi riots of 1899. However, the Sankritisation movement was a failure initially and the Nadar climbers, who lived as minorities, were still discriminated by the majority castes. However these confrontations aided the community to protest for the required rights and privileges, with integrity, and also test how much other communities were willing to accept the Nadar claims of high status. The Northern Nadar leaders then sought to unite their community by encouraging intermarriages within the five major Nadar subcastes and also uplift the depressed palmrya Nadar climbers. They also sought to maintain amiable relationships with other communities. This led to the formation of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam in 1910. 
===Sri Lanka===
Some Nadars emigrated from South India to Sri Lanka during the British colonial era. 
==Nadars of the 20th century==
 
===Nadar Mahajana Sangam===
The separate Nadar associations of the six Ramanad towns were unable to support a community that was becoming more dispersed as many began to migrate to other parts of Madras Presidency. With the rise of the politically ambitious T. Rattinasami Nadar, a wealthy Nadar of Porayar in Thanjavur district, a new association was formed. This resulted from Rattinasami Nadar inviting prominent community leaders to attend a plenary session in February 1910, with the intent of establishing an organization to represent the entire community. Rattinasami Nadar&#x27;s uncle, V. Ponnusami Nadar, was elected to become the first president of the association, which was called the Nadar Mahajana Sangam. The association was open to any Nadar male of any subcaste or religion, and had as its general purpose the upliftment of the community. The early Sangam conferences were dominated by the Northern Nadars. 
===Against toddy===
The campaign against toddy was one of the first steps taken by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam to enhance the social advancement of the entire Nadar community. Though majority of the Nadar climbers were engaged in the production of jaggery, a significant number of Nadar climbers were also involved in the production of toddy. The Sangam urged the Nadar climbers to abandon their traditional occupation of toddy tapping and not to sell hard toddy. However many Nadar climbers were reluctant to give up their profitable occupation. The situation got out of hand when Nadar leaders tried to intimidate the climbers, by using tenets of their cult, to give up their occupation as toddy tappers. To ease the situation the district magistrate issued a proclamation restricting the climbers to sell hard toddy only in specific regions, where toddy can be legally drawn. However the Sangam&#x27;s campaign was effective for only about a year. 
===Prohibition of toddy act===
The Sangam then in order to aid the climbers, sought to abolish the tax levied on palmyra trees. After the establishment of the Prohibition (of toddy) act in the Northern districts of Madras Presidency, the Nadar Mahajana Sangam along with its sister association, Dakshina Mara Nadar Sangam of Tirunelveli, sought to remove it to aid the depressed climbers. The British advisor government in turn suspended the act. However, the prohibition act was reintroduced after the independence. Under the rules of the act, the climbers could only tap between 4 am to 2pm and sell sweet toddy between 6am and 2pm. These procedures can also only be practiced by climbers who have license. The rigid government rules pressurized the depressed climbers. The two prominent Nadars Sangams constantly pressurized the government and eventually the enforcement of these regulations gradually eased. By the mid-1950s, the government assigned cooperative societies to promote jaggery production. 
===Nadar educational institutions===
The Nadar community did not completely rely on the Backward Class Commission for educational advancement. In 1885, the Northern Nadars established the Kshatriya Vidhyasala High School in Virudhunagar by using the &quot;mahimai&quot; funds from the Nadar &quot;uravinmurai&quot;. Education was also the primary concern of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam from inception. In 1921, the Sangam began to provide scholarship loans to needy students, and by 1964 more than 3000 such loans were offered. Some students were given assistance for foreign studies. The Sangam also aided the establishment of village schools. Education formed the largest portion of expenditure by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam. The Nadar bank along with other cooperative societies gave 5 percent of their profit to the scholarship fund. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam also established a college, Senthilkumara Nadar College, in 1947. 
===Resolution of inter-caste conflicts===
In villages where there were few Nadar climbers, they were oppressed by those in the majority. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam acted in the interests of such climbers, using the strength and influence of the community at large. The climbers could ask the Sangam to intervene in inter-community issues, which would cause the Sangam to investigate the situation and determine the validity of any Nadar claims. Then, if necessary, the Sangam would request police intervention or support a claim in court. In situations where the matter went to court, the Sangam would not provide financial support for the Nadar claimant to contest the case, but would rather see that the claim is properly heard. After independence of India, the Sangam took advantage of the constitutional provisions encouraging a caste-less society and also supported government attempts to promote this vision. The support included urging their own community members to allow use of their schools, tanks, temples and wells by other communities. The name of the Nadar bank was changed to Tamilnad Mercantile Bank. These activities earned the Nadar community respect and recognition. 
==Politics==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Nadar Mahajan Sangam supported the non-Brahmin movement and Justice party. W. P. A. Soundrapandian Nadar as the president of Nadar Mahajana Sangam led the effort to ally the community with Periyar E. V. Ramasamy&#x27;s Self-respect movement. The Northern Nadars joined the Justice party in its attack against Brahmins on cultural and religious front. They also practiced self-respect marriages during the non-Brahmin movement. 
However, in the late 1940s the Nadars&#x27; support shifted to Indian National Congress, in part because of the political success of K. Kamaraj, whose opinions had originally been disliked by his own community. After the end of Kamaraj&#x27;s era, the Nadars&#x27; political support has become diffused across various parties and the Nadar Sangam has become less politicized. 
==Nadars today==
The social and economical development achieved by the Nadars have evoked academic interest. According to N.S.Ramnath, of Forbes, the Nadars are a close knit, powerful community. The Nadars, who were once predominantly not allowed to enter Hindu temples built by castes above them, now occupy respected positions as Trustees in many Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu. They are financially strong and are politically influential in the Southern districts of Tamil Nadu. A political observer points out that there is a Nadar leader in almost every political party. The community has influential Tamil media houses, such as Dina Thanthi. Crawford Young has said that: 
 
===Government classification===
Nadars are classified and listed as a Backward Class by the governments of both Tamil Nadu and India.

==Subcastes==
The legend of the origin of the Nadars tell of the birth of seven sons; with the death of two, the remaining five father the separate divisions of the community. There were five major divisions among the Nadars. The Nadar community was not a single caste, but developed from an assortment of related subcastes and classes of different origins, which in course of time, came under the single banner Nadar. Nadar climber was the largest subsect of today&#x27;s Nadar community. Nadars are predominant in the south Indian districts of Tuticorin, Kaniyakumari, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. 
===Karukkupattaiyathar===
The Karukkupattaiyathar are supposed to be the original inhabitants of the country around Manadu. This sub-division was later known as &quot;Mara Nadar&quot;. They claim to be the descendants of the Pandyans. It is the largest of the five subcastes and constitutes about 80 percent of the entire community, including the aristocratic Nelamaikkarars and the climbers beneath them. The Nelamaikarrars and the climbers are endogamous groups, forming sub-subcastes that each marry only among themselves. 
===Mel-nattar===
The term Mel-nattar comes from &quot;Mel-nadu&quot; (western country). Mel-nattars lived traditionally in the Southern Travancore and Western Tirunelveli districts. They claim to be descendants of the Chera kings who settled in the area of the Western Ghats after the fall of their dynasty. 
 
===Nattathi===
At the time that Robert Hardgrave conducted his study, in the 1960s, the Nattathis were predominant in the village of Nattathi near Sawyerpuram, Tuticorin district. There they were traditionally cultivators, traders and money lenders. Legendary accounts claim that the Nattathis are descendants born of the Pandyas and Cholas. The community was mostly Christian and remained an endogamous unit. The overlord of Nattathi was a retainer of the Kattabomma Nayaka. The Nattathi overlord was invested with Zamindari rights under the British. The last of the Nattathi zamindars, Tiruvarudi Vaihunda Nadan, died in 1892. The properties of the Zamindar were eventually divided among a number of claimants. 
===Kodikal===
They are traditionally palmrya climbers. They are supposed to have migrated to the Pandyan country from the banks of the Cauvery River in Tanjore to serve the Pandyan kings as their flag bearers. 
===Kalla===
The Kalla Shanars were considered as the lowest division of the Nadar community. They are also known as Servai. The term &quot;kalla&quot; means &quot;false&quot;. They are believed originally to have been palanquin bearers for the Pandyan kings or menial slaves of the Nelamaikkarar family, having descended from illegal unions within the Nadar community. They are traditionally toddy tappers. 
The subsect culture is not present today among the Nadars north of Tirunelveli but it still exists among those of southern Tirunelveli. The Karkuppatayathars, the endogamaous Nelamaikkarars and the Nadar climbers beneath them, are today known as &quot;A group&quot; or &quot;Mara Nadar&quot;, and the remaining four subcastes are known as &quot;B group&quot;. 
===Christian Nadars===
In 1680, the first congregation of Nadars was started at Vaddakankulam with the conversion of Nadar women and a church was built accordingly in 1685. A permanent mission was established in 1701. Some Nadars accepted Christianity through will and some accepted it due to their aversion to local beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Spirituality of Basic Ecclesial Communities in the Socio-religious Context of Trivandrum/Kerala, India: Reflections on a Distinctively Canonical Institution&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Christian Nadars numbered 150,000 as opposed to 1.5 to 2 million Hindu Nadars in Madras state. Nadar Christians, like Hindus, marry within their caste. 
==Religious customs==
The Hindu Nadars, like other Hindus, have a variety of religious rituals and ceremonies. These include procedures relating to birth, adulthood, marriage and death. Every Hindu Nadar belongs to a &quot;kuttam&quot; (assemblage) through patrilineal descent, and each &quot;kuttam&quot; has a common family deity. During migration, families would often take soil from their family temple and enshrine it at their new home. Traditionally, all the members of a &quot;kuttam&quot; would assemble at least once a year at the family temple. With the birth of a child, the family would traditionally go to the family deity temple, where the hair of the child is shaved for the first time and offered to the deity. At the time of marriage the first invitation is presented to the family deity. 
The Hindu Nadars are almost entirely Saivite (only one &quot;kuttam&quot; is Vaishnavite). Of the deities, Murugan has been widely popular among the Nadars. Goddess Bhadrakali is the tutelary deity of the Nadar community. The Nadars also claim that they are the descendants of Bhadrakali. A Bhadrakali temple is usually at the centre of almost every Nadar settlement. 
 
==Martial arts==
The Nadars, traditionally practised a Tamil martial art variously known as &quot;Adimurai&quot;, &quot;chinna adi&quot; and &quot;varma adi&quot;.

<text>Steven Jay Israel (born May 30, 1958) is an American political commentator, lobbyist, author, bookseller, and former politician. He served as a U.S. representative from New York from 2001 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected in until 2013 and until his retirement. At the time of his departure from Congress, his district included portions of northern Nassau County and Suffolk County on Long Island, as well as a small portion of Queens in New York City.

Israel chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2011 to 2015 and Democratic Policy and Communications Committee from 2015 to 2017. Prior to his election to Congress, he served on the Huntington Town Board, starting 1993. After leaving Congress in 2017, Israel joined CNN as a political commentator. In 2019, he was appointed the inaugural director of the Institute of Politics and Global Affairs at Cornell University. , Israel also serves on the Board of Advisors for lobbying firm Michael Best Strategies.

==Early life and career==
Israel was born in Brooklyn and raised in the Long Island community of Levittown, New York. He attended Nassau Community College and Syracuse University for one year before graduating from George Washington University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1982.

After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Israel became a staff member for U.S. Representative Richard Ottinger. He was later elected to the town council in Huntington, New York, in 1993.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
After Rick Lazio left his House seat to run for the United States Senate in 2000, Israel was elected to his seat, receiving 48% of the vote, defeating Republican Joan Johnson, who received 34%, and four independent candidates. He was reelected seven times with relatively little difficulty, despite representing a swing district on paper.

On January 5, 2016, Israel announced that he would not seek reelection in November 2016.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies

===Caucus membership===
* Co-chair and founder of Congressional Center Aisle Caucus
* House Cancer Caucus (Co-chair)
* Long Island Sound Caucus (Co-chair)

===Party leadership===
* Assistant Democratic Whip
* House Democratic Caucus Task Force On Defense and the Military (Chair)
* House Democratic Study Group on National Security Policy (Co-chair)

=== Tenure ===
Israel voted to authorize George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, even though more than 60 per cent of his Democratic colleagues in the House voted against the bill.

In his second term, Israel was tapped for a leadership position as Assistant Whip. In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 Democratic House members who reach out to the defense community and advise the House Democratic leadership on military policy.

In 2006, in response to Jimmy Carter&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, Israel said, &quot;I disagree with President Carter fundamentally. The reason for the Palestinian plight is the Palestinians.&quot;

Israel supported a study on the feasibility of switching from Tuesday to weekend voting.

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel&#x27;s support for Occupy Wall Street drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; elements. In response Israel pointed to his support for the nation of Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of Nancy Pelosi, Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to Chris Van Hollen, the chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was &quot;just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi.&quot;

It was reported that Pelosi&#x27;s selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where &quot;Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections.&quot; Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel is one of the few Democrats who has run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.

==Policy positions==
===Abortion===
Israel has said he supports legal abortions in cases of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the mother, though he does not support abortions being legal in all cases. He has voted against bills that would prohibit federal funding for abortions, against a bill that would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions, and against the Abortion Pain Act, which would have prevented abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Since 2004 he has consistently received 100% ratings from the pro-choice groups NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association, as well as a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

===Economics===
On July 4, 2013, Israel announced legislation that would require all U.S. national parks to sell merchandise that is Made in the USA.

===Gun control===
Israel supports increased gun control on gun ownership. He voted against several bills and amendments which would decrease federal regulation of safety precautions of guns and decrease federal regulations on the sale of firearms. He also cosponsored the 2009 &quot;No Fly, No Buy&quot; Act, stating &quot;Gun safety measures like the &#x27;No Fly, No Buy&#x27; Act should be a no-brainer for every member of Congress. It&#x27;s common sense legislation.&quot; He has received an &#x27;F&#x27; rating from the pro-gun rights NRA Political Victory Fund and 0% from the Gun Owners of America, as well as 100% ratings from the pro-gun control Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Israel was an original cosponsor of the bill To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress), which passed the House on December 3, 2013. The bill allowed for a ten-year extension of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, but did not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).

===Health care===
Israel voted for the 2010 Affordable Care Act and against several bills repealing it.

===LGBT rights===
Israel supports same-sex marriage. In a June 2009 press release he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m proud of what Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Vermont have done for marriage equality. I hope that my home state of New York will soon follow.&quot; New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011.

He voted for the repeal of Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell and for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

He has a 100% rating from the pro-LGBTQ rights Human Rights Campaign and a 0% rating from the Family Research Council.

===Social media===
In October 2022, Israel joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by Issue One to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts lieutenant governor Kerry Healey.

===Canada===
In February 2025, Israel advocated for Donald Trump&#x27;s efforts to coerce Canada into being the 51st state, believing that it would help the Democratic Party gain more voters. 

==J Street controversy==
Steve Israel was an honorary member of the gala host committee for a Gala dinner on October 27, 2009, by J Street, a liberal nonprofit lobbying group. In the weeks leading up to the Gala dinner, those aligned with the Likud, the political party of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, criticized Steve Israel and those supporting J Street. &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; blogger Michael Goldfarb called the J Street dinner an &quot;anti-Israel bash.&quot; In response, Steve Israel&#x27;s spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton state, &quot;It&#x27;s absurd that this has become a controversy [...] The Congressman agreed to be on the gala host committee. That doesn&#x27;t mean he agrees with every viewpoint of every speaker at the event&quot;.

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for fusion voting, where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000 Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also run as the candidate for the Independence Party and the Working Families Party. In 2000 the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the Conservative Party of New York.

<doc id="966524" wikidata="Q59981" url="?curid=966524" title="Shukri al-Quwatli">
<text>Shukri al-Quwatli (; 6 May 189130 June 1967) was a Syrian politician and statesman who was the first president of post-independence Syria, in 1943. 

He began his career as a dissident working towards the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Arab territories and was consequently imprisoned and tortured for his activism. When the Kingdom of Syria was established, Quwatli became a government official, though he was disillusioned with monarchism and co-founded the republican Independence Party. Quwatli was immediately sentenced to death by the French who took control over Syria in 1920, following the Franco-Syrian War. Afterward, he based himself in Cairo where he served as the chief ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, cultivating particularly strong ties with Saudi Arabia. Quwatli utilized his connections with Saudi Arabia to help finance the Great Syrian Revolt (1925–1927). In 1930, the French authorities pardoned Quwatli and thereafter, he returned to Syria, where he gradually became a principal leader of the National Bloc. He was elected president of Syria in 1943 and oversaw the country&#x27;s independence three years later.

Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a military coup in 1949 by Husni al-Za&#x27;im. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 to participate in the presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his political authority had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli&#x27;s jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli&#x27;s erstwhile ally, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Following months of unity talks, in 1958, Quwatli merged Syria with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic and stepped down for Nasser to serve as president. In gratitude, Nasser awarded Quwatli the honorary title of &quot;First Arab Citizen&quot;. However, Quwatli grew disenchanted with the union, believing it had reduced Syria to a police state subordinate to Egypt. He backed Syria&#x27;s secession in 1961, but plans for him to complete his presidential term afterward did not materialize. Quwatli left Syria following the 1963 Ba&#x27;athist coup, and he died of a heart attack in Lebanon weeks after Syria&#x27;s defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War. He was buried in Damascus on 1 July.

==Personal life==

===Family===
The Quwatlis were a Sunni Muslim mercantile family from Baghdad which moved to Damascus in the 18th century, establishing itself in the district of al-Shaghour. Their initial wealth in Damascus stemmed from trade with Baghdad and Arabia. After 1860 the family invested part of its wealth in large land tracts in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The first member of the family to own extensive tracts was Shukri&#x27;s granduncle Murad (d. 1908). The family&#x27;s notable status was owed to their wealth, rather than an aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.

Shukri&#x27;s grandfather Abd al-Ghani was involved in finance, as was his granduncle Ahmad, who was appointed the president of the Agricultural Bank of Damascus in 1894, and another granduncle, Hasan, president of the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, while Murad had become a member of the Administrative Council of the city in 1871 and was re-elected in the early 1890s. Shukri&#x27;s father&#x27;s wealth rested on the highly fertile lands he owned and later bequeathed to Shukri and his siblings in the Ghouta. His elder brother Hasan was elected President of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture. Despite the substantial wealth accrued toward the end of the 19th century, the family remained in the working class al-Shaghur and developed networks there which contributed to its future political ambitions.

In 1928, Shukri married Bahira al-Dalati, the 19-year-old daughter of nationalist Said al-Dalati, whom Quwatli met while in jail in 1916. Shukri and Bahira had five children; Hassan (the oldest, born in 1935), Mahmud, Huda, Hana and Hala. Bahira al-Dalati died in 1989.

===Childhood and education===
Shukri Quwatli was born in Damascus in 1891. He received his elementary education at a Jesuit school in the city, then studied at the preparatory high school of Maktab Anbar in the Jewish quarter of Damascus. He obtained his baccalauréat in 1908. He then moved to Istanbul where he studied political science and public administration. Quwatli graduated from the Mekteb-i Mülkiye in 1913. He returned to Damascus in 1913 after receiving his diploma, and started working for the Ottoman civil service.

====Early influences====
Quwatli was initially brought up in a pro-Ottoman environment, owing to his family&#x27;s connections in Istanbul. The restrictions of the Abdul Hamid II era, however, started to be felt around the Ottoman Empire, and discontent was brewing even among the empire&#x27;s elite. Following the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908, parliamentary elections were called in all provinces, and liberal Arab intellectuals like Shukri al-Asali, Shafiq Muayyad al-Azm, and Rushdi al-Shama&#x27;a secured seats as deputies (members of the legislature) representing Damascus. The liberal current that established itself through these figures, and the political dailies they established including &quot;al-Qabas&quot; (&quot;The Firebrand&quot;) and &quot;al-Ikha&#x27; al-Arabi&quot; (&quot;Arab Brotherhood&quot;), greatly influenced Quwatli and other Arab youths.

During the 31 March Incident, Quwatli strongly supported the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) against Abdul Hamid II. Nevertheless, after the failed countercoup, the CUP accused Arab provinces of supporting Abdul Hamid II and initiated a policy of Turkification, whereby all local officials were substituted by Turkish ones. Soon after, the parliament was dissolved, and the liberal Arab politicians were forced out in the following elections.

==Early nationalist activities==
Quwatli&#x27;s early involvement in the Arab nationalist movement came through the Arab Congress of 1913. Shortly after starting his career at the Ottoman civil service in Damascus, he received an invitation to attend the conference in Paris. However, the conference was strongly condemned by the Ottoman authorities, and Arab notables were forbidden from attending. Nevertheless, the congress had succeeded in rousing nationalist feelings in Arab provinces. Quwatli&#x27;s first confrontation with the Ottoman authorities came in February 1914 during a visit by Jamal Pasha, the governor of Syria at the time, to the offices of the Governorate of Damascus, where Quwatli worked. During the visit, Quwatli refused to follow the normal protocol—bending over and kissing Jamal Pasha&#x27;s right hand—and was promptly thrown in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. He was bailed out of prison a few days later through his family&#x27;s connections, but he lost his job at the civil service.

===Al-Fatat===

The growing hardships in the country during the early years of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the secret society of al-Fatat, which was facilitated by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri. Al-Fatat was an underground organization established in Paris in 1911 by Arab nationalists with the aim of gaining independence and unity of the various Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks.

In 1915, Sharif Hussein, trying to garner support for his planned uprising against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly with other members of the society, including Quwatli, in the house of Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al-Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was charged by the al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture and humiliation. Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of that experience, however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition.

In late 1916 he was approached by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli&#x27;s refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli&#x27;s life was saved at the last minute by fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.

==Kingdom of Syria==
On 1 October 1918, an Arab army under the leadership of Emir Faisal and British general T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, and by the end of October the rest of Ottoman Syria fell to the Allied Forces. Emir Faisal became in charge of administering the liberated territory. He appointed Rida al-Rikabi as prime minister, and Quwatli&#x27;s friend, Nasib al-Bakri became a personal adviser to the Emir. Quwatli, at the age of twenty-six, was appointed assistant to the governor of Damascus, Alaa al-Din al-Durubi.

However, many of Quwatli&#x27;s generation were unimpressed with Faisal&#x27;s leadership skills, and were drawn to a republican, rather than monarchist, view of governance. Furthermore, they were suspicious of Faisal, and his brother Abdullah&#x27;s ties with the British. On 15 April 1919 they founded a loose coalition under the name of al-Istiqlal Party (&quot;Independence Party&quot;). The party had a pan-Arab, secular, anti-British and anti-Hashemite outlook and attracted mostly youth activists from the elite classes. Well-known members, other than Quwatli, included Adil Arslan, Nabih al-Azmeh, Riad al-Sulh, Saadallah al-Jabiri, Ahmad Qadri, Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi. Although ostensibly working for the government, Quwatli devoted his efforts to nationalist activities outside the government&#x27;s auspices. In addition to al-Istiqlal, he was also a member of the Palestinian-led Arab Club&#x27;s Damascus branch.

In a meeting with the 1919 King–Crane Commission, sent by the United States (US) to gauge national sentiment in greater Syria, Quwatli rejected the notion of an American military presence in Syria, telling Crane that &quot;Reduction of sovereignty is non-negotiable&quot; and instead suggesting that the US help Syrians to &quot;build their state and live in peace on their land.&quot; Nevertheless, French forces had already started landing on the Syrian coast in 1919 to enforce the Sykes–Picot Agreement whereby France and the UK would divide up the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire between themselves. In March 1920, the League of Nations granted France a mandate over Syria and Lebanon, and in response Emir Faisal declared himself king of Syria on 8 March 1920. When King Faisal refused to accept the mandate, the French marched on Damascus. Yusuf al-&#x27;Azma, minister of defense at the time, led a small force and met the French at the Battle of Maysalun on 23 July 1920. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the French, and the next day French forces occupied Damascus. King Faisal was deported to Europe, and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon was officially declared.

==Leader in Syrian independence movement==

===Emissary of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress===
The French started their rule by sentencing 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, to death on 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent the bulk of his time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists in Europe and in the Arab world.

In Europe, he particularly frequented Berlin where he worked with the prominent Arab nationalist intellectual Shakib Arslan to proliferate anti-French sentiment, leading the French Mandatory authorities to label Quwatli one of the &quot;most dangerous&quot; Syrian exiles. He developed close ties with Ibn Saud, who by 1925 ruled much of Arabia, having overrun the Hashemites in the Hejaz. Quwatli had a prior relationship with the House of Saud, stemming from his own family&#x27;s commercial links with the Saudis and Quwatli&#x27;s friendship with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a Syrian adviser to Ibn Saud, who Quwatli had dispatched to Arabia during Faisal&#x27;s rule. Quwatli, strongly distrustful of the Hashemites, was impressed by Ibn Saud&#x27;s relatively quick conquest over much of Arabia and saw in the Saudis a strong potential ally against British and French colonial rule in the Middle East. By 1925, Quwatli had solidified his position as the intermediary between Ibn Saud and the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. His acquisition of Saudi funding put him at odds with the Congress&#x27;s chief financier Michel Lutfallah, however.

===Financing the Great Syrian Revolt===
In the summer of 1925 tensions between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli&#x27;s Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini to set up a financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt&#x27;s initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family&#x27;s extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.

===Role in the National Bloc===
In late 1927, Quwatli headed the Istiqlal-dominated Executive Committee of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, although Lutfallah headed a separate rival committee that also called itself the Congress&#x27;s Executive Committee. Both were based in Cairo. Locally known then as the &quot;apricot king&quot;, Quwatli used revenues from his agricultural lands to build up a network of support in the Old City of Damascus. In 1930, Quwatli was allowed to return to Syria under a general amnesty. Thereafter, he joined the National Bloc, the preeminent opposition movement in Syria—though tolerated by the French. Although he opposed the moderate stances of the Bloc&#x27;s Damascene leaders, he determined he could only remain a major political player by joining the group. He sought to steer it towards a more determined nationalist course and worked to expand his support base, relying on his relationships with residents in some of Damascus&#x27; traditionally nationalist neighborhoods (al-Midan and al-Shaghour) and among the city&#x27;s merchant and emerging industrialist classes. He also worked to draw support from the staunch pan-Arabists of the League of National Action (LNA) beginning in 1933. He managed to co-opt much of the LNA&#x27;s members by 1935–36 by financing its land development company (which aimed to prevent land sales to Zionist organizations in Palestine) and assigning some of its leaders to the director boards of companies affiliated with the Bloc.

In 1936, as a general strike was underway in the country to demand a renegotiation of the French role in Syria, Quwatli was appointed the Bloc&#x27;s vice president of internal affairs, but was not part of the treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established by the end of the month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks in Syria, convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc&#x27;s highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey. He was Minister of Finance from 1936 to 1938.

On 20 March 1941, during World War II, when the Vichy French were in control of Syria, Quwatli called for immediate Syrian independence amid a period of food shortages, high unemployment and widespread nationalist rioting in the country. Vichy troops in the country were defeated by the Allied forces in July and Quwatli left Syria during the campaign. He returned in 1942. France officially recognized Syria&#x27;s independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and national elections were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities.

==First presidential term==

===Election of 1943===
Prior to the 1943 national elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French authorities attempted to negotiate with Quwatli as head of the National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria&#x27;s alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli&#x27;s election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people would view such negotiations negatively. He was also confident that the National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria&#x27;s president on 17 August 1943.

===Syrian independence===
As president, Quwatli continued to press for Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning Syria with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response to French Mandatory rule led to French military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in Syria to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli&#x27;s request for intervention, British troops invaded Syria from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in Syria as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of communication in the region.

As French troops began a partial withdrawal from the country, Quwatli instructed Fares al-Khoury, his envoy to the US and head of the Syrian mission to the United Nations, to bring the issue of Syria&#x27;s independence to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), cabling Khoury to &quot;Go to [US President Harry] Truman and tell him the French have ploughed the land in Syria, over our heads!&quot; Khoury proceeded to petition the UNSC to force France&#x27;s withdrawal from Syria. The US and UK backed Syria&#x27;s request and informed Quwatli that British troops were in control of Syria, requesting Quwatli&#x27;s cooperation in enforcing an evening curfew in the country. Quwatli complied and expressed his gratitude to the British government. At a summit between France, the UK, the US, Russia and China, France agreed to withdraw from both Syria and Lebanon in return for British promises to withdraw its military from the Levant region as well. Quwatli was angered that Syria was left out of the conference and requested a summit with Truman and Winston Churchill, which was rebuffed.

The transfer of administrative powers to the Syrian government began on 1 August, the day in which Quwatli announced the establishment of the Syrian Army and his position as the commander in chief. Quwatli also asked Khoury to form a cabinet, which was established on 24 August. The French completed their withdrawal from Syria on 15 April 1946 and Quwatli declared Syria&#x27;s independence day on 17 April.

===Post-independence politics===
Following Syria&#x27;s independence, the National Bloc was dissolved and replaced by the National Party. Quwatli&#x27;s leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People&#x27;s Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party as well as the Baath Party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People&#x27;s Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli&#x27;s Aleppo-based ally.

In early 1947, Quwatli and the National Party, the largest party in parliament, made an amendment to the constitution to enable Quwatli to seek re-election. The move was met by strong disapproval from rival Syrian parties and opposition politicians, and a campaign to unseat Quwatli in the next presidential election was commenced. Quwatli&#x27;s allies won 24 out of 127 seats during the 1947 parliamentary election, the first in post-independence Syria, while the opposition won 53 seats and independents unaffiliated with any political party won 50. A number of Quwatli&#x27;s allies defected from the National Party and former president Atassi retired from politics because of his frustration at Quwatli&#x27;s handling of Syrian internal affairs. Quwatli tasked Jamil Mardam Bey to form a new cabinet in October, which included mostly pro-Western politicians.

Despite the heavy presence of pro-American figures in the cabinet and Quwatli&#x27;s initially warm ties with the US, relations between the two countries began to unravel amid the nascent Cold War and the view that Quwatli was becoming a detriment to US interests in the region. Quwatli developed close relations with the SCP and its head Khalid Bakdash, which was a contributing factor to the US Congress&#x27;s rejection of Quwatli&#x27;s arms request for the Syrian Army in late 1947. Quwatli also rejected the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline in Syria (to connect the oilfields of Saudi Arabia to Lebanon). Quwatli feared construction of the pipeline would threaten the mostly British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and upset the UK, as well as the Syrian public, who he believed would view the project &quot;as a new form of indirect foreign economic control&quot;, according to Moubayed. US support for Israel, particularly under Truman, and Quwatli&#x27;s adamant opposition to Zionism was a further source of tension.

==Second presidential term==

===Election of 1948===
With the constitution amended to allow for a president to seek more than one term, Quwatli ran against Khalid al-Azm for another five-year term and won by a slim majority on 18 April 1948.

===1948 Arab-Israeli War===

Quwatli opposed the proposed partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, arguing that the plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state, violated the rights of the Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and to take the place of Arab regular armies. The ALA&#x27;s establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.

The Syrian Army, which consisted of 4,500 soldiers, had been mostly repelled in their offensive during the first few days of the war, gaining control over a small area along the Syrian border. As a result of the army&#x27;s poor showing, Quwatli pressed defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati to resign his post, which Sharabati did on 24 May. He then replaced chief of staff Abdullah Atfeh with Husni al-Zaim during that same period of the war. Following the war, Quwatli accused Zaim of military incompetence and his officers of profiteering. In turn, Zaim accused Quwatli of mismanagement during the conflict. The Syrian public did not spare Quwatli blame for the army&#x27;s poor performance, causing his popularity, built on his nationalist reputation, to erode further. The Syrian press was also sharply critical of Quwatli and Prime Minister Mardam Bey, urging them to leave their positions. Mardam Bey resigned on 22 August 1948 and was replaced by Khalid al-Azm.

Mass demonstrations took place in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for recognizing Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. US officials were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations. When Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon signed armistice agreements with Israel between February and April 1949, Syria under Quwatli did not do so and refused to send a delegation to attend truce negotiations in Rhodes in March.

===Coup d&#x27;état of 1949===
On 29 March 1949, Zaim launched a coup d&#x27;état, overthrowing Quwatli. Zaim&#x27;s troops entered Damascus and raided Quwatli&#x27;s home. They disarmed his guard and confronted Quwatli in his night clothes before army officer Ibrahim al-Husseini arrested him. After being allowed to change his clothes, Quwatli was taken by the authorities to the city&#x27;s Mezzeh Prison. Prime Minister al-Azm was also arrested. The coup had been backed and allegedly co-planned with the US Central Intelligence Agency. The US was the first country to recognize Zaim&#x27;s government, followed by the UK, France, and the Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan. Quwatli&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack about a week after his overthrow.

==Exile in Egypt==
As a result of pressure from the Egyptian and Saudi governments to spare the life of their ally Quwatli, al-Zaim agreed to release Quwatli from prison in mid-April 1949. After officially resigning as President, Quwatli was exiled to Alexandria, Egypt. In Egypt he was respected as a guest of honor by King Farouk and after the July 1952 revolution, by the Free Officers who gained power. Despite his positive relationship with the ousted King Farouk, Quwatli developed a close friendship with the founder of the Free Officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became Egypt&#x27;s leader in 1954.

==Third presidential term==

===Elections of 1955===
Quwatli returned to Syria in 1955, following the ouster of President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, at the age of 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm&#x27;s 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli&#x27;s bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.

Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali resigned from his post on 6 September following the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s withdrawal from the cabinet. As a result, Quwatli attempted to nominate Lutfi al-Haffar as Prime Minister, but reneged after opposition from the Ba&#x27;athists. Afterward, Quwatli asked Rushdi al-Kikhiya to form a cabinet, but the latter refused, citing that influence from the Syrian Army would deprive his government of real power. President Nasser of Egypt recommended the reappointment of Asali, but Quwatli refused, instead opting for Said al-Ghazzi, an independent. Ghazzi agreed and subsequently presided over a national unity government.

===Adoption of neutralism===
Under Quwatli&#x27;s leadership, Syria increasingly moved towards a neutralist policy amid the Cold War, despite the conservative views held by Quwatli. However, on 10 September, Quwatli first opted to make an official request for arms from the United States, but was eventually rebuffed despite support from US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Starting in 1956, Quwatli began to look towards the Eastern bloc for economic and military assistance. During the tenure of his administration, Quwatli furthered Syria&#x27;s relations with other neutralist countries such as Yugoslavia, India and Egypt, but also with the Soviet Union (USSR) and the Eastern bloc. The pursuit of this policy was partially due to the support afforded to the leftist movements in Syria by the Saudi and Egyptian governments who viewed them as strong opponents of the Baghdad Pact, and the highly influential leftist factions of the Syrian Army. Quwatli and Nasser initiated the Egyptian-Syrian Agreement, a defense arrangement that would serve as a counterweight to the Baghdad Pact, in March 1955. The agreement stipulated that each country would assist the other in case of an attack, the establishment of numerous committees to coordinate joint military activities and the creation of a joint military command headed by Egyptian officer Abdel Hakim Amer. The agreement was concluded 20 October.

Increasingly concerned at the growing leftist trend in the country, Quwatli called for a national unity government that would include parties from across the political spectrum on 15 February 1956. Despite opposition from the Ba&#x27;athists, Quwatli managed to preside over a &quot;national covenant&quot; which entailed a foreign policy of opposition to Zionism and imperialism as well as the adoption of neutralism amid the Cold War. Nonetheless, and against Quwatli&#x27;s advice, Ghazzi resigned from his post in June 1956 as a result of pressure from the Ba&#x27;athists and the communists who had been leading protests against Ghazzi&#x27;s decision to lift the ban on wheat sales to Western Europe. Faced with few options, Quwatli reappointed Asali as Prime Minister. Asali moved to further strengthen ties with Egypt, including a pledge to start unity talks, and appointed Ba&#x27;athists to the ministerial positions of economy and foreign affairs.

Following the tripartite invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal by British, French and Israeli forces in October 1956, Quwatli severed ties with Britain. Quwatli sent hundreds of army recruits to aid the Egyptian defense and made an emergency visit to Moscow to request Soviet backing for Nasser from Premier Nikita Khrushchev, telling the latter that the tripartite forces &quot;want to destroy Egypt!&quot; In response to public pressure, in late December Prime Minister Asali reshuffled his cabinet, removing several fellow conservatives and strengthening leftist influence in the government.

===Confronting leftist influence===
In July 1957, relations between Quwatli&#x27;s ally Saudi Arabia and the governments of Iraq and Jordan, rivals of Syria, warmed considerably to the protestations of the leftist current in Syria, which viewed the growing ties between the region&#x27;s conservative monarchies with distress. After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets in Saudi Arabia and withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response to the crisis between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of some in the Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order to shut down the communist newspaper &quot;Al Sarkha&quot;.

On 6 August, Quwatli established a long-term agreement with the USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of a large portion of Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.

Leftist influence in Syria grew further in the immediate wake of the crisis; on 15 August, a high-ranking officer from Sidon, Lebanon with Marxist leanings, Afif Bizri, was appointed army chief of staff, and several mid-level officers were replaced with communist officers. Quwatli flew to Egypt amid apparent plans to resign from the presidency in favor of the Soviet-leaning Azm. However, he returned to Syria on 26 August. Tensions had been rising as rumors swept the region regarding a US-backed Turkish or joint Iraqi-Jordanian invasion of Syria to prevent a potential communist takeover. Quwatli&#x27;s earlier success in repairing ties between Syria and Saudi Arabia proved particularly useful during this period. Saud immediately lent his full support to Quwatli, whom he viewed as a significant counterweight to the leftist movement, by rebuffing President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s appeal to endorse the Eisenhower Doctrine, a policy aimed at containing communist and Arab nationalist influence in the Middle East. He also accepted an invitation to Damascus by Quwatli on 25 August, publicly stating that Saudi Arabia would support Syria in any aggression against it. Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Jawdat also proclaimed support for Syria when he visited on 26 August, in spite of support for an attack by the Iraqi monarchy. Both Saud and Jawdat privately criticized Syria&#x27;s leadership for increasing dependence on the Eastern bloc.

Nonetheless, the US and its allies in the Baghdad Pact genuinely feared that Syria was becoming a satellite of the Soviets and decided in a September meeting that Quwatli&#x27;s government had to be removed. That same month Turkish troops massed along the border with Syria. On 13 October, Nasser, who had launched a radio campaign denouncing the Baghdad Pact countries, dispatched 1,500 Egyptian troops, a mostly symbolic force, to the port of Latakia in northern Syria in a show of Arab strength against Turkey, to the acclaim of the Syrian and pan-Arab public. The leaders of Jordan and Iraq promptly reassured Quwatli that they had no intention to interfere in Syria&#x27;s internal affairs. Nasser had apparently bypassed his ally Quwatli, coordinating the deployment with officers Sarraj and Bizri instead. Quwatli related this fact to Saud, who had complained of not being consulted of the Egyptian move beforehand, an &quot;admission ... of Quwatli&#x27;s political irrelevance,&quot; according to contemporary historian Salim Yaqub.

Sarraj and Bizri wielded substantial influence in Syrian politics, checking the power of the political factions and purging Nasser&#x27;s opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba&#x27;ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.

===Unity with Egypt===
Amid the euphoria generated by Egypt&#x27;s military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards the end of October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus in a gesture of solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military&#x27;s habitual interference in the country&#x27;s political affairs and the stark difference in the countries&#x27; economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.

In December, the Ba&#x27;ath Party composed a proposal entailing federal unity with Egypt, prompting their communist rivals to propose a total union. While the communists were less eager to merge with Egypt, they sought to appear before the Syrian public as the group most dedicated to unity, privately believing Nasser would reject the offer as he had the first time. According to historian Adeed Dawisha, &quot;the communists ended up outmaneuvering themselves ... unprepared for the unfolding events spearheaded by a public driven to frenzy by all talk and promises of union.&quot; On 11 January 1958, the communist chief-of-staff, Bizri, led an officers delegation to press for unity with Cairo without consulting Quwatli beforehand. Instead, the Egyptian ambassador, Mahmud Riad, met and notified Quwatli of Bizri&#x27;s move. Quwatli was angered at the military&#x27;s move, telling Riad that it amounted to a coup and Egypt was complicit.

To assert his influence over the unity talks, Quwatli sent Foreign Minister al-Bitar to Cairo on 16 January to join the discussions. Nasser, while still hesitant at the Syrian proposal and discouraged by members of his inner circle, became increasingly concerned with the communists&#x27; power in Syria as testified by Bizri&#x27;s leadership and autonomy from Quwatli. He was further pressured by the Arab nationalist members of the delegation, including al-Bitar, who alluded to an impending communist takeover and urgently appealed to him not to &quot;abandon&quot; Syria.

Nasser ultimately agreed to the union, but insisted that it be formed strictly on his terms, stipulating a one-party system, a merged economy, and Syria&#x27;s adoption of Egyptian social institutions; in effect a full-blown union. Syria&#x27;s political leaders, particularly the communists, the Ba&#x27;athists and the conservatives, viewed Nasser&#x27;s terms unfavorably, but nonetheless accepted them in response to mounting popular pressure. Quwatli left for Cairo in mid-February to conclude the agreement with Nasser and on 22 February the United Arab Republic (UAR) was established. Quwatli resigned from the presidency and Nasser became the president of the new union. To honor Quwatli for his gesture and his longtime struggle in the Arab nationalist cause, Nasser accorded him the title of &quot;First Arab Citizen.&quot;

The announcement of the UAR was met with widespread jubilation and celebration throughout the Arab world, most prominently in Syria. Nasser arrived in Damascus on an unannounced visit on 24 February and went directly to Quwatli&#x27;s home. According to al-Hawrani, as Nasser met with Quwatli, &quot;a sea of colliding humanity gathered with astonishing speed&quot; as residents left their workplaces and homes to meet the leaders at Quwatli&#x27;s house. When the two decided to leave for the official guesthouse in an open-top automobile, it took them two hours to reach the destination, where it normally would have taken about five minutes. The commotion of the growing crowds surrounding the car caused Quwatli to nearly faint. Following the union&#x27;s establishment, Quwatli retired from politics.

==Later life==
By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser and criticized his policies in Syria. In particular, he condemned the institution of land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government as part of the socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria&#x27;s political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser&#x27;s hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.

On 23 October, he made a televised speech condemning the UAR and expressing his disappointment with Nasser, saying &quot;unity does not mean annexation and the presidential system does not mean the separation of the ruler from the ruled.&quot; He also accused the Egyptian authorities of establishing a system of rule dependent on &quot;1,001 spies&quot; and responsible for sowing division in the republic. Quwatli told the Syrian people they controlled their own destiny, saying &quot;Ranks and titles come and go, but you the people are immortal!&quot; He concluded his speech with self-criticism, stating &quot;I was able to serve your struggle as an ordinary citizen more than I was able to serve you when I was president.&quot;

The secessionist officers, pleased at Quwatli&#x27;s statements, discussed whether or not to have Quwatli serve another term as president or to finish the term he began in 1955, which was cut about one year short as a result of the UAR&#x27;s establishment. The proposal did not manifest, largely due to Quwatli&#x27;s relatively old age at the time. On 8 March 1963 a coalition of unionist officers consisting of Ba&#x27;athists, Nasserists and independent Arab nationalists overthrew the secessionist government of President Nazim al-Qudsi and Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm. Quwatli left Syria shortly after and moved to Beirut, Lebanon.

==Death==


Quwatli died of a heart attack shortly after the Six-Day War (5–10 June 1967). Feeling a pain in his chest he was taken to a hospital on 29 June. He died in Beirut on 30 June. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba&#x27;athist government refused to allow Quwatli&#x27;s body to be buried in Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July 1967.

==Legacy==
On the day of his funeral, Radio Damascus called Quwatli &quot;one of the sons of this homeland who has sacrificed and struggled for the advancement, liberation and unity of the Arab nation.&quot; He was proclaimed a founding father of the Syrian Arab Republic. Historians and the Syrian population generally consider Quwatli to be one of the most &quot;renowned Syrian leaders of the twentieth century,&quot; according to Moubayed.

<text>Alcoutim (; ) is a town and a municipality in southeastern Portugal near the Portugal–Spain border. The population in 2011 was 2,917, in an area of 575.36 km². It is the least densely populated municipality in Portugal. The municipality is limited on the north by Mértola Municipality, on the east by Huelva Province in Spain, on the southeast by Castro Marim Municipality, on the southwest by Tavira Municipality and on the west by Loulé Municipality and Almodôvar Municipality. The administrative center is the town of Alcoutim, located at the extreme eastern part of the municipality on the Spanish frontier, just across the Guadiana River from the Spanish town of Sanlúcar de Guadiana in Huelva Province. The Moorish Alcoutim Castle, located in the municipality, dates from the 14th century.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of Alcoutim - a wreath of &quot;zambujeiro&quot; (wild olive tree) and the slogan &quot;Aleo&quot; - is derived from the decorative motif of the tomb of Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real, found in the Igreja da Graça in Santarém. &#x27;Aleu&#x27; or &#x27;aleo&#x27; is an old Portuguese term for a &#x27;gaming stick&#x27; (as used in hockey or shuffleboard). It refers to a famous episode concerning Pedro de Menezes from shortly after the Conquest of Ceuta on September 2, 1415 (commemorated on Ceuta Day). Pedro de Menezes was engaged in an outdoor game in the king&#x27;s presence when a messenger arrived reporting an imminent Moroccan attack on Portuguese-held Ceuta. Menezes is said to have raised his gaming stick (&quot;aleo&quot;) and told the king that &quot;with that stick alone&quot; he could defend Ceuta from all the power of Morocco. Pedro&#x27;s descendants were later made Counts of Alcoutim. Similar design can be seen on the coat of arms of Vila Real.

==Parishes==
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Alcoutim e Pereiro
* Giões
* Martim Longo
* Vaqueiros

==Climate==
Alcoutim has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with very hot and dry summers and mild winters. Due to its location in the Guadiana River basin it has a climate that very much resembles that of relatively nearby Seville and Cordoba. With an average July high of around it is one of the hottest places in Portugal and Europe during the summer months.

<text>Mesrop Mashtots (; , &quot;&quot; 362February 17, 440 AD) was an Armenian linguist, composer, theologian, statesman, and hymnologist in the Sasanian Empire. He is venerated as a saint in the Armenian Apostolic Church.

He is best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet AD, which was a fundamental step in strengthening Armenian national identity. He is also considered to be the creator of the Caucasian Albanian and, possibly, the Georgian script, though it is disputed.

==Sources==
The chief sources for the life and work of Mashtots are Koriun, Ghazar Parpetsi, and Movses Khorenatsi. The &quot;Life of Mashtots&quot; (Վարք Մաշտոցի), a hagiography by Koriun, a disciple of Mashtots, is the primary and most reliable source. The oldest fragments of the incomplete &quot;The Life&quot; manuscript are dated 12th century and are kept in Paris&#x27;s Bibliothèque nationale (Arm. 178), two shorter versions of &quot;The Life&quot; dated to middle of the 14th century and one longer version of &quot;The Life&quot; is dated to the late 17th century&quot;.&quot; Hrachia Acharian, who authored the most comprehensive study on Mashtots and the Armenian alphabet, defended Koriun&#x27;s work as the only accurate account. It was commissioned by Catholicos Hovsep I, also a student of Mashtots, and written c. 443–450/451. The work has two versions: long and short. The former is considered by most scholars to be the original. Parpetsi and Khorenatsi largely relied upon Koriun&#x27;s work. The oldest extant manuscript of Koriun&#x27;s &quot;Life of Mashtots&quot; has been dated to the 12th century. It was first printed in Armenian by the Mekhitarists in San Lazzaro degli Armeni, Venice in 1833, and has been translated thrice into Modern Armenian and several foreign languages.

==Name==

While Koriun, his chief biographer, only refers to him as Mashtots, Movses Khorenatsi and later Armenian historiography predominantly calls him Mesrop. It was not until the 20th century that he came to be referred to by both names, sometimes spelled with a hyphen. Some scholars, including Malachia Ormanian, maintain that Mashtots was his birth name, while Mesrop was his ecclesiastical name by which he was ordained. Anton Garagashian believed the opposite to be true. According to James R. Russell, Mashtots was his primary name, while Mesrop a secondary one, &quot;possibly an epithet.&quot;

The etymologies of both Mesrop and Mashtots have been widely debated. In his authoritative dictionary of Armenian names, Hrachia Acharian described Mashtots to be of uncertain origin. Nicholas Adontz believed it stemmed from Iranian &quot;mašt&quot; (from &quot;mazd&quot;), which is also the origin of the name Mazdak. Asatur Mnatsakanian suggested an origin from the name of the Urartian goddess Bag-Mashtu. Russell argued that the original form of Mashtots may have been Maždoc‘, originated from Middle Parthian &quot;mozhdag&quot; and means &quot;bearer of good news or reward&quot;. Today, Mesrop (Mesrob) is a common male name and Mesropyan (Mesrobian) a common last name among Armenians.

There is more agreement about Mesrop. Acharian considered it to be of unknown origin, but noted that it is usually thought to have originated from &quot;serovbe&quot;, Armenian for &quot;seraph&quot;, a word of Biblical Hebrew origin. Russell described Mesrop a mysterious word, seemingly Syriac, &quot;perhaps an epithet meaning &#x27;seraphic&#x27;.&quot; Some scholars maintain that Mesrop is a blend of &quot;Mar&quot; (&quot;lord&quot; in Syriac) and &quot;Serob&quot;, a version of &quot;Serovbe&quot;.

==Background and early life==
The date of birth of Mashtots is not well-established, but recent scholarship accepts 361. Others give 361–364 as the likely range. He was born in the village of Hatsekats (Հացեկաց) in the canton of Taron, to a father named Vardan, who may have been a priest or a nobleman. Some scholars believe he was affiliated with the Mamikonian dynasty since Taron was their feudal domain. Others suggest he may have belonged to the lesser nobility or reject his noble origin at all. Leo believed he was the son of a peasant. According to Anania Shirakatsi, Vardan was an &quot;azat&quot;. Some scholars, including Stepan Malkhasyants, have identified Vardan with Vrik, mentioned by Pavstos Buzand. Vrik was the illegitimate son of Catholicos Pap (not King Pap), the grandson of Gregory the Illuminator (through Husik). Mashtots, thus, may have been a second cousin to Catholicos Sahak Partev. Acharian outright rejected this theory, but it has been cited by Elizabeth Redgate. Other scholars, including Ormanian, believed Mashtots was the son of Vardan Mamikonian (not the better known one), the older brother of &quot;sparapet&quot; Vasak Mamikonian. This theory has been rejected by Hakob Manandian and Garnik Fntglian. James R. Russell writes that Mashtots&#x27; father was &quot;probably a member of the Mamikonean clan.&quot;

Another point of contention is whether Mashtots was a student of Nerses the Great, first mentioned by Khorenatsi. Both Acharian and Leo rejected it. Acharian noted that Mashtots probably studied at the prominent Surb Karapet Monastery, not far from his birthplace. Koriun tells that Mashtots received &quot;Hellenic education,&quot; i.e. education in the Greek language. Besides his native Armenian, Mashtots knew Greek, Persian (Middle Persian), and Syriac (Aramaic).

In late 380s Mashtots moved to Vagharshapat, Armenia&#x27;s capital, where he began a career at the court of King Khosrov III. While Khorenatsi says that he worked as a royal secretary, both Koriun and Parpetsi assign him other positions as well, especially in the military. He was initially royal chancellor (&quot;ark’uni divanapet&quot;), then moved on to serve in the military after receiving training.

In c. 394 Mashtots became a clergyman and was ordained as a monk and lived in a monastery, in Goghtn. He, thereafter, became an ascetic hermit to live in the mountains and uninhabited areas. Mashtots then gathered a group of 40 disciples and began missionary work among Armenians, many of whom were still pagan. He begin his first mission in Goghtn around 395. He successfully spread Christianity in the area and expelled the pagans.

==Life==

Koryun, his pupil and biographer, writes that Mashtots received a good education and was versed in the Greek and Persian languages. On account of his piety and learning, Mesrop was appointed secretary to King Khosrov IV, in charge of writing royal decrees and edicts in Persian and Greek.

Leaving the court, Mashtots took the holy orders and withdrew to a monastery with a few companions, leading a life of great austerity for several years. In 394, with the blessing of Sahak Part&#x27;ev, Mashtots set out on a proselytizing mission. With the support of Prince Shampith, he preached the Gospel in the district of Goghtn near the river Araxes, converting many.

Encouraged by the patriarch and the king, Mesrop founded numerous schools in different parts of the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. He himself taught at the Amaras monastery of the Armenian province of Artsakh (located in the contemporary Martuni region of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). However, his activity was not confined to Eastern Armenia. Provided with letters from the Catholicos, he went to Constantinople and obtained from emperor Theodosius the Younger permission to preach and teach in his Armenian possessions. Having returned to Eastern Armenia to report to the patriarch, his first thought was to provide religious literature for his countrymen. He sent some of his numerous disciples to Edessa, Constantinople, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and other centers of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were John of Egheghiatz, Joseph of Baghin, Yeznik, Koriun, Moses of Chorene, and John Mandakuni.

The first monument of Armenian literature is the version of the Holy Scriptures. Isaac, says Moses of Chorene, made a translation of the Bible from the Syriac text about 411. This work was considered imperfect, for soon afterwards John of Egheghiatz and Joseph of Baghin were sent to Edessa to translate the Scriptures. They journeyed as far as Constantinople and brought back authentic copies of the Greek text with them. With the help of other copies obtained from Alexandria, the Bible was translated again from the Greek according to the text of the Septuagint and Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot;. This version, now in use in the Armenian Church, was completed about 434.

The decrees of the first three ecumenical councils—Nicæa, Constantinople, and Ephesus—and the national liturgy (so far written in Syriac) were also translated into Armenian, the latter being revised on the liturgy of St. Basil, though retaining characteristics of its own. Many works of the Greek Fathers were also translated into Armenian. The loss of the Greek originals has given some of those versions a special importance; thus, the second part of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle,&quot; of which only a few fragments exist in Greek, has been preserved entirely in Armenian. In the midst of his literary labors, Mashtots revisited the districts he had evangelized in his earlier years, and, after the death of Isaac in 439, looked after the spiritual administration of the patriarchate. He survived his friend and master by only six months. Armenians read his name in the Canon of the Liturgy and celebrate his memory on 19 February.

Mashtots is buried at a chapel in Oshakan, a historical village southwest from the town of Ashtarak. He is listed officially in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; of the Roman Catholic Church; his feast day is February 17.

== Alphabet ==
Armenia lost its independence in 387 and was divided between the Byzantine Empire and Persia, which received about four-fifths of its territory. Western Armenia was governed by Byzantine generals, while an Armenian king ruled as Persian vassal over eastern Armenia. The principal events of this period are the reinvention of the Armenian alphabet, the revision of the liturgy, the creation of an ecclesiastical and national literature, and the revision of hierarchical relations. Three men are prominently associated with this work: Mashtots, Part&#x27;ev, and King Vramshapuh, who succeeded his brother Khosrov IV in 389.

Armenians probably had an alphabet of their own, as historical writers reference an &quot;Armenian alphabet&quot; before Mashtots, but used Greek, Persian, and Syriac scripts to translate Christian texts, none of which was well suited for representing the many complex sounds of their native tongue. The Holy Scriptures and the liturgy were, to a large extent, unintelligible to the faithful and required the intervention of translators and interpreters.

Mashtots was assisted in inventing an Armenian writing system by Sahak and Vramshapuh. He consulted Daniel, a bishop of Mesopotamia, and Rufinus, a monk of Samosata, on the matter and created an alphabet of thirty-six letters; two more (long O (Օ, օ) and F (Ֆ, ֆ)) were added in the twelfth century.

The first sentence in Armenian written down by Mesrop after he invented the letters was the opening line of Solomon&#x27;s Book of Proverbs:
The reinvention of the alphabet around 405 was crucial for Armenian literature and was significant in the creation of a separate idea of Armenian language and what was connected to it. &quot;The result of the work of Isaac and Mesrop&quot;, says St. Martin, &quot;was to separate for ever the Armenians from the other peoples of the East, to make of them a distinct nation, and to strengthen them in the Christian Faith by forbidding or rendering profane all the foreign alphabetic scripts which were employed for transcribing the books of the heathens and of the followers of Zoroaster. To Mesrop we owe the preservation of the language and literature of Armenia; but for his work, the people would have been absorbed by the Persians and Syrians, and would have disappeared like so many nations of the East&quot;.

Medieval Armenian sources also claim that Mashtots invented the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets around the same time. Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia, a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli. The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III (326 or 337) and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of 430, contemporaneously with the Armenian alphabet.

==Legacy and recognition==
Modern Armenian scholarship recognizes Mashtots as the founder of Armenian literature and education and as the &quot;greatest enlightener and first teacher&quot; of the Armenian people. The figure of Mashtots has become a &quot;symbol that embodies the Armenian language, church, and school system, connecting each to one another.&quot; In Armenian narratives, Mashtots is portrayed as the key figure who preserved the national language and the nation against cultural absorption. James R. Russell describes Mashtots as &quot;the culture-hero of Armenian civilization.&quot; Anthony D. Smith noted that Mashtots, with his invention, helped &quot;convert and unite Armenians as a chosen people.&quot; Gerard Libaridian argued that Mashtots and the alphabet &quot;constitute the most important symbols of cultural identity and regeneration.&quot;

Koriun, his biographer, compared Mashtots&#x27; return to Armenia after the invention of the alphabet to Moses&#x27; descent from Mount Sinai. In another passage, Koriun compared the work of Mashtots and Sahak to the work of the Four Evangelists. Modern scholars have compared Mashtots to Gregory the Illuminator, often describing the former as the &quot;second illuminator.&quot; Russell argues that both were visionaries, found a champion for their program in the king, looked to the West, had very strong pro-Hellenic bias, trained the children of pagan priests and assembled their own disciples to spread the faith through learning.

===Historical assessment===
In his 1904 book on Mashtots, the historian Leo called him the greatest of all of Armenia&#x27;s historical heroes and contrasted the continued legacy of Mashtots with the legacy of Tigranes the Great&#x27;s brief empire. Similarly, historian Ashot Hovhannisyan described Mashtots as the &quot;greatest benefactor&quot; of the Armenian people, while the linguist Eduard Aghayan called him simply the &quot;greatest Armenian&quot;, a view that has been expressed by others as well. Aghayan further described Mashtots as the &quot;greatest linguist of his time in the broadest sense of the word.&quot; Catholicos Vazgen I stated that &quot;everything truly Armenian&quot; was born out of the vision and genius of Mashtots. Viktor Ambartsumian, the long-time president of the Armenian Academy of Sciences, stated in 1962։ &quot;The history of our culture has given many outstanding figures, but of all these figures, the Armenian people owe the most to Mashtots.&quot;

Soviet Armenian historiography portrayed Mashtots as a secular figure, in line with the official Marxist-Leninist interpretation of history. Hakob Manandian argued in a 1940 pamphlet that although the invention of the Armenian alphabet by Mashtots was primarily aimed at spreading Christianity, in the long-run it was also politically significant. Armenians entered the &quot;family of ancient cultured peoples&quot; and developed an original culture and rich literature. In a 1991 book Catholicos of Cilicia Karekin I complained that his work was being &quot;depicted with colours of purely political, nationalistic and secular nature.&quot;

At the height of the Karabakh movement in 1989, Rafayel Ishkhanian characterized Mesrop Mashtots as &quot;our most genuine, our greatest independentist [...] who, at the moment of the disintegration of the Armenian state, gave us the Armenian alphabet, language and literature, gave us Armenian schools and, as a result, although without political independence, we kept our moral and cultural sovereignty.&quot; Levon Ter-Petrosyan, philologist and Armenia&#x27;s first president, postulates that Mashtots and Gregory the Illuminator had the most influence on the course of Armenian history. Catholic Armenian Archbishop and scholar Levon Zekiyan further argued that Mashtots &quot;was our greatest political thinker.&quot; Zekiyan argues that Mashtots laid the foundations of a national ideology, &quot;which gave the Armenians a qualitatively new self-awareness [...] in the wider cultural-anthropological sense of a vision of the world, or &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;.&quot;

==Music==
Mashtots also produced a number of liturgical compositions. Some of the works attributed to him are: «Մեղայ քեզ Տէր» (&quot;Meġay k’ez Tēr&quot;, “I have sinned against you, Lord”), «Ողորմեա ինձ Աստուած» (&quot;Voġormea inj Astuac&quot;, “Have mercy on me, God”), «Անկանիմ առաջի քո» (&quot;Ankanim aṙaǰi k’o&quot;, “I kneel before you”) and «Ողորմեա» (&quot;Voġormea&quot;, “Miserere”), all of which are hymns of repentance.

==Veneration ==
Mashtots is a saint of the Armenian Apostolic and Armenian Catholic churches. He is sometimes referred to by Armenian churchmen as &quot;The Saint of Oshakan&quot; (Օշականի Սուրբը). There are at least two chants (&quot;sharakan&quot;) and several canticles (&quot;gandz&quot;) dedicated to Mashtots and Sahak. A number of churches in modern and historical Armenia and the Armenian diaspora are named after St. Mesrop, Sts. Mesrop and Sahak or the Holy Translators. He is regarded as the first great &quot;vardapet&quot;.

The Armenian Apostolic Church has two major days of feast dedicated to Mashtots. The first is the Feast of the Holy Translators (Սուրբ Թարգմանչաց, &quot;Surb T’argmanchats&quot;), which is celebrated on the second Saturday of October. It was declared a national holiday in 2001. Acharian postulates that it was established no earlier than the 12th century. It is dedicated to Mashtots, Yeghishe, Movses Khorenatsi, David the Invincible, Gregory of Narek and Nerses Shnorhali. Today pilgrimages to the grave of Mashtots in Oshakan are made on this feast. In the Soviet period it became a secular festival.

The second, the Feast of Sahak and Mashtots, is celebrated on the 33rd day after the Pentecost, on Thursdays, between June 11 and July 16. Acharian considered it the continuation of the original feast dedicated to Mashtots. It was on this feast that pilgrimages to Mashtots&#x27; grave in Oshakan were made until the mid-20th century. With the rise of national consciousness in the 19th century, it came to be celebrated in large Armenian communities in Tiflis and Constantinople.

==Commemorations==

The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrated the 1500th anniversary of the Armenian alphabet in 1912–13 and the 1600th anniversary of the birth of Mashtots in 1961.

In May 1962 the 1600th anniversary of the birth of Mashtots was marked with &quot;massive official celebrations&quot; in Soviet Armenia, which had a &quot;powerful impact on Armenian national pride.&quot; Vahakn Dadrian noted that Yerevan became an &quot;arena of nationalist fervor and outburst.&quot; The statue of Mashtots was ceremonially opened in front of the Matenadaran on May 26. The Matenadaran, established three years earlier, was named after Mashtots on that day according to a government decree.

In a speech at the Yerevan Opera Theater, Soviet Armenian Prime Minister Anton Kochinyan proclaimed that it was the Soviet government that made &quot;Mesropian literature the property of the whole nation and opened the alphabet for every Armenian child.&quot; Viktor Ambartsumian, president of the Armenian Academy of Sciences, declared that while Mashtots&#x27; invention formerly served Armenian national interests, it now serves communist ideas, fraternity of peoples, world peace and progress. It was also celebrated in Moscow&#x27;s House of the Unions where Armenian (Silva Kaputikyan and Nairi Zarian) and Soviet (Vadim Kozhevnikov, Marietta Shaginyan, Mykola Bazhan, Andrei Lupan) writers gave speeches. In 1962 the Soviets put into circulation a stamp commemorating Mashtots.

The Order of St. Mesrop Mashtots, awarded for &quot;outstanding achievements&quot; in science, education, healthcare, and culture, was established by the Armenian government in 1993. The St. Sahak-St. Mesrop award was established by the Armenian Church in 1978.

Mashtots and the Matenadaran were featured on the 1,000 Armenian dram banknote of the first series, put into ciculation in 1994.

The widest street in central Yerevan, called Stalin, then Lenin Avenue in the Soviet period, was renamed after Mashtots in 1990. Between 1985 and 1996, one of Yerevan&#x27;s eight districts, what are now the districts of Ajapnyak and Davitashen, was called Mashtots.

Institutions named after Mashtots include the Matenadaran, the central library of Stepanakert, the Mashtots Chair in Armenian Studies at Harvard University, the Mesrop Center for Armenian Studies at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, a number of schools and universities in Armenia, Artsakh and educational and cultural institutions in the Armenian diaspora.

==Artistic depictions==

===Paintings===
No contemporary portraits of Mashtots have been found. The first artistic depictions appeared in Armenian illuminated manuscripts (miniatures), primarily in &quot;sharakans&quot; and &quot;haysmavurks&quot;, starting from the 14th century. These manuscripts, around 20 in total were created in Constantinople, Etchmiadzin, Sanahin, Haghpat and elsewhere, depict Mashtots with a halo. In the 18th century Mashtots was portrayed by two Italian painters. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo portrayed Mashtots with a pseudo-Armenian alphabet on the frescoes on the ceiling above the staircase of the Würzburg Residence in Bavaria, while Francesco Maggiotto&#x27;s Italianate portrait of Mashtots hangs at the Armenian Catholic monastery of San Lazzaro degli Armeni near Venice.

Stepanos Nersissian&#x27;s 1882 painting of Mashtots, commissioned by a wealthy Armenian from Elisabethpol, is considered the most widely recognized artistic depiction of Mashtots. During the Soviet period, numerous Armenian artists portrayed Mashtots. Van Khachatur (Vanik Khachatryan) created a panel painting of Mashtots in 1958–59 for the entrance hall of the Armenian Academy of Sciences in Yerevan. Hovhannes Minasian and Henrik Mamian created a fresco, in 1961–64, for Saint Mesrop Mashtots Church in Oshakan, where he is buried. In 1981 a tapestry titled &quot;The Armenian Alphabet&quot;, where Mashtots is the central figure, was completed by French weavers based on a painting by Grigor Khanjyan. It is kept at the Pontifical Residence at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. In 1992–94 Khanjyan created a large mural of the same painting inside the Yerevan Cascade (now the Cafesjian Center for the Arts).

===Statues and sculptures===

The most recognizable statue of Mashtots, depicted with his disciple and biographer Koriun, is located in front of the Matenadaran and was erected by Ghukas Chubaryan in 1962. Although it was not immediately well-received, it is now a Yerevan landmark. A statue of Mashtots and Sahak, erected by Ara Sargsyan in the 1940s, was put up in front of the main campus of Yerevan State University in 2002. Yervand Kochar created two sculptures of Mashtots in gypsum (1952) and plasticine (1953). Ara Sargsyan created a bronze plaquette in 1957/59. A statue of Mashtots and Koriun, by Levon Tokmajyan (1978–79), was erected near the central square of Ejmiatsin (Vagharshapat).

Statues, busts and sculptures of Mashtots have been erected in the Armenian diaspora, including in historical communities such as at the seminary in Jerusalem&#x27;s Armenian Quarter, the library of the Vank Cathedral in New Julfa, Isfahan, Iran, the Melkonian Educational Institute in Nicosia, Cyprus and in newly-established communities, such as on the Armenian Cathedral of Moscow (2013) and in Alfortville, Paris (2015). In Akhalkalaki, the center of the Armenian-populated Javakheti (Javakhk) region of Georgia, the statue of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin was replaced with that of Mashtots in 1992.

===Literature and music===
Mashtots has featured prominently in Armenian poetry. In one poem («Սուրբ Մեսրովբի տոնին»), the mid-19th century poet Mikayel Nalbandian ranked him above Moses. In another, Nalbandian lamented the state of the church in Oshakan where Mashtots is buried. In his 1912 poem &quot;St. Mashtots&quot;, Siamanto compared him to Moses and called him &quot;God of Thought.&quot; In a 1913 poem, Hovhannes Tumanyan, Armenia&#x27;s national poet, praised Mashtots and Sahak as luminaries. Paruyr Sevak, a celebrated Soviet Armenian poet, characterized Mashtots as a great statesman who won a &quot;bloodless battle, which cannot be compared to any of the victories of our glorious commanders&quot; in a 1962 poem. It was set to stage in 2011. A popular poem by Silva Kaputikyan, &quot;Words for my Son&quot;, reads: &quot;By Mesrop&#x27;s holy genius, it [the Armenian language] has become letter and parchment; it has become hope, become a flag.&quot;

In the early 1970s, the popular song &quot;Glorious Nation&quot; («Ազգ փառապանծ»), written by Arno Babajanian and , and frequently performed by , included the line &quot;The powerful language of Mashtots is the bright hope of every Armenian.&quot;

<text>Leading aircraftman (LAC) or leading aircraftwoman (LACW) is an enlisted rank used by some air forces, with origins from the Royal Air Force. The rank is used by air forces of many countries that have historical British influence.

Leading aircraftman is usually immediately senior to aircraftman and immediately below senior aircraftman.
The rank was renamed air specialist (class 2) (AS2) in the Royal Air Force in July 2022.

== History ==
The rank originated in the Royal Air Force, when it was formed in 1918. It replaced the Royal Flying Corps rank of air mechanic 1st class (which wore the same badge). It was only a trade classification until 1 January 1951, when it became a rank, although it is non-supervisory.

== Australia ==
Leading aircraftman is a rank in the Royal Australian Air Force (which uses a single chevron rather than a propeller device) where it is the senior aircraftman rank.

== Canada ==
It was a rank until 1968 in the Royal Canadian Air Force being replaced by the army rank of private after unification, which then in 2015 was replaced by aviator (basic).

== New Zealand ==
In the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the rank is awarded after three years of service or completion of a senior trade course, whichever comes first.

Leading air cadet (LAC) in the New Zealand Air Training Corps also uses the propeller badge. It is not technically a rank (although many units regard it as a very junior NCO rank), and may be awarded to cadets who have attended a minimum of thirty parades, or completed one year in a unit. The rank is generally awarded to those cadets who show obvious leadership skill.

<text>Ron Lemieux, (born August 15, 1950) is a Canadian politician, who was an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2016, and a former professional ice hockey player.

== Biography ==
Born in Dauphin, Manitoba, Lemieux was an ice hockey defenceman and was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins 110th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft. Lemieux started with the Dauphin Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, helping the Kings to the Manitoba championship in 1971–72. He played for the Green Bay Bobcats in the United States Hockey League for the 1974–75 season (scoring seven goals and eighteen assists), but was never called up to the NHL. He later coached girls&#x27; hockey in Lorette, Manitoba and St. Adolphe.

After leaving hockey, Lemieux received degrees in Bachelor of Arts in 1979 and Bachelor of Education in 1985 from the University of Winnipeg. He completed post-baccalaureate work in education at the University of Manitoba. He worked as a teacher for several years, coaching various high school teams and holding positions in the teacher&#x27;s association.

In the provincial election of 1999, Lemieux was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the rural riding of La Verendrye, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Ben Sveinson by 3,533 votes to 3,367. Lemieux&#x27;s victory was something of an upset, as it occurred in a riding which had never before been won by the New Democratic Party or its social-democratic predecessors (despite having existed since 1879).

On October 5, 1999, Premier of Manitoba Gary Doer appointed Lemieux to be Minister of Consumer of Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act. He was relieved of the latter responsibility on July 4, 2000; after a cabinet shuffle on January 17, 2001, he was appointed Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism with responsibility for Sport.

Lemieux later served as Minister of Education and Youth from September 25, 2002, until he was reassigned as Minister of Transportation and Government Services on November 4, 2003. In the 2003 election, Lemieux was re-elected with 58% of his riding&#x27;s vote.

In September 2006 he was appointed Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation in Gary Doer&#x27;s new cabinet.

In November 2009, Premier Greg Selinger named Lemieux as Minister of Local Government. He served in this capacity until October 2013, when he became Minister of Tourism, Culture, Sport and Consumer Protection. He did not seek a fifth term as MLA at the 2016 provincial election.

Lemieux has described his political views as being closer to the &quot;New Labour&quot; philosophy espoused by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair than to traditional democratic socialism. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party. He was re-elected in the 2007 and 2011 provincial elections.

<text>Nina Cortlandt is a fictional character and one half of the Cliff and Nina supercouple on the long running ABC soap opera, &quot;All My Children&quot;. She has been most notably played by Taylor Miller who exited the role in 1996. Miller returned for a special cameo in 2010, following the death of her father Palmer Cortlandt. The character of Nina Cortlandt has been described as &quot;troubled&quot; and &quot;beloved&quot;.

==Storylines==
Nina Cortlandt was raised by her over-protective and controlling single father, Palmer. Palmer lied to Nina and told her that her mother died in childbirth. Palmer used Nina’s frail health and Juvenile-onset Diabetes as excuses for his “helicopter parenting.” He also concealed the fact that his housekeeper, Myra Murdock, was in fact her grandmother.

Nina was stressed by their move to Pine Valley and neglected her diabetic treatment regimen. At a party hosted in honor of the Cortlandts at the Tyler Estate, Nina fainted and was rushed to the hospital with acute appendicitis.

Nina woke up to see the handsome face of her doctor, Cliff Warner. It was love at first sight. They began dating despite Palmer’s disapproval of Cliff. Palmer considered Cliff unworthy of his precious daughter and was jealous of Nina’s love for him.

Palmer threw Nina a lavish 18th birthday party at Cortlandt Manor, with all Pine Valley’s elite society as guests.

Myra Murdock had phoned Nina&#x27;s mother, Daisy, and informed her about the party. Daisy had fled Palmer&#x27;s wrath when he discovered she was having an affair. Daisy grieved the loss of her daughter and stayed informed about her welfare via Myra. When Myra called to tell her Palmer was trying to interfere with Cliff and Nina, Daisy secretly moved to Pine Valley as “Monique Jonvil” to defend Nina’s romance. Myra conducted a seance where Nina was able to communicate with her &quot;dead mother&quot; who encouraged Nina to follow her heart. Daisy dressed up in a beautiful dress and mask for the costume ball and was able to see her daughter in person for the first time in years. Palmer sensed Daisy’s presence, pursued her to the stables and tried to flush her from hiding with his doberman guard dogs.

Nina and Cliff&#x27;s love grew despite Palmer’s jealous plots against them. When Nina was diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy he lied and told her no treatment could stop her from going blind. Palmer convinced Nina she would only burden Cliff and she broke their engagement. Cliff, heartbroken, got drunk and was seduced by nurse Sybil Thorne, who was secretly in love with Cliff and seized this opportunity to try and make him forget Nina and fall for her.

Nina began to spend time with Palmer&#x27;s employee, Sean Cudahy. They were taken hostage together in a sudden bank robbery. Deprived of her insulin, Nina fell into a diabetic coma. Sean and Brooke English&#x27;s efforts helped foil the robbery and save Nina’s life.

Nina became friends with the “new stable hand” Monique Jonvil, who was of course her disguised mother, and Brooke English.

Nina learned her eye condition was treatable with laser surgery. She traveled to Baltimore with Palmer to save her sight. Her surgery was successful and she reunited with Cliff and resumed their engagement. Daisy/Monique helped her with wedding plans and had a secret Mother-of-the Bride moment when Nina shopped for her wedding gown. Nina and Cliff married in a lavish horse-and-carriage ceremony on the grounds of Cortland Manor with her best friends Brooke and Monique in her bridal party.

Married bliss was disrupted when Nurse Sybil Thorne revealed she was pregnant from Cliff’s drunken one night stand with her. Heartbroken, betrayed and angry, Nina fled back to Cortlandt Manor and filed for divorce.

Nina believed she stood no chance for happiness while Sybil held her unborn child as a bargaining chip. Monique convinced Nina to give Cliff another chance. Nina fell back into his arms. They planned to announce their reconciliation at a dinner party in Cortlandt Manor.

Sybil arrived and disrupted the happy party. After a heated argument with Nina, she went into labor. Cliff helped Sybil give birth to their son, Bobby Warner.

Nina watched Sybil fumble with life as a single mother. She went to Sybil and tried to convince her to allow them to adopt her child and provide him with the privileged life Sybil could never give him. Sybil threatened Nina and declared she would give her child away to a stranger if Nina refused to leave Cliff. Enraged by her demands, Cliff stormed off to Sybil&#x27;s apartment. Instead Sybil was found dead.

Nina watched as Cliff fought for his innocence in court. His chances of acquittal seemed bleak until Monique entered the courtroom as an unexpected witness. Monique implicated Sean in Sybil&#x27;s murder. When the prosecutor demanded her relationship to Cliff and Nina, Monique stunned the court with her revelation that she was Nina&#x27;s mother. Nina stood up and fainted in the center aisle, shocked to know her mother had been alive all those years.

In prison, Sean implicated Palmer as mastermind of the entire plot. Palmer had been paying him and Sybil to keep Nina and Cliff apart. Nina rejected her father and hoped to build a relationship with the mother he had exiled from her life. When Palmer went missing in Center City, Nina realized she could not cut her father from her life forever.

Palmer was found alive as an amnesiac. Nina hoped for his recovery. At the end of the year, Nina reconciled with Cliff, called off the divorce, and they formally adopted Bobby.

While her father was away on his honeymoon with the much younger Donna Beck, Nina got a frantic call from the Cortlandt Electronics Board of Directors. She used part of her trust fund to solve their fiscal problem. When Palmer returned, he recognized his daughter&#x27;s acumen for business and gave her an executive position in his company. Cliff did not want Nina working the long hours necessary for the job. He felt she was beginning to neglect Bobby.

Nina&#x27;s coworker Steve Jacobi did not seem to understand that Nina was a married woman. At her Anniversary party, he planted a kiss on her. As much as Nina wanted to keep her relationship with Steve strictly business, things spiraled out of control. She began to fantasize about Steve while making love to Cliff.

A storm hit Pine Valley while Steve and Nina were working at Cortlandt Manor. They were alone in the dark by the roaring fireplace. Nina succumbed to temptation and slept with Steve.

Nina continued her torrid affair with Steve. Cliff went by his apartment one day to speak to Nina only to discover the lovers in a passionate embrace. Cliff filed for a quickie divorce. This time the divorce was finalized. Nina continued her life with Steve, but it was obvious his interest was waning. Nina wanted to talk marriage, while Steve was content with his life as is. Nina and Cliff continued their conflict and argued over Bobby&#x27;s welfare. Cliff’s antagonism and resentment vanished when he believed that Nina had been killed in a helicopter crash. Cliff rejoiced in her survival, but was now entangled in a relationship with Devon Shepherd. Nina knew she did not love Steve. She moved back in with her father at Cortlandt Manor. Devon stepped aside and left town.

Nina and Cliff reconciled and were remarried by a justice of the peace.

Nina was mesmerized by the healing powers of a conman named Zach Grayson. Daisy tried to break Nina out of her trance, but her mental state weakened.

Zach drugged and raped Nina, while Cliff&#x27;s sister, Linda Warner, took photos. Zach planned to blackmail Nina and threatened to show Cliff the photos. Nina turned to her mother for help. Nina was shocked when Daisy was discovered in Zach&#x27;s apartment, standing over his dead body with a bloody knife.

Zach&#x27;s many misdeeds were revealed during his murder trial. The strain on her mother, and the seeming end of her hopes for a future with Cliff, damaged Nina&#x27;s psyche. Donna, who served as a key witness for trial, became the target for Nina’s aggression. Although Donna exonerated Daisy for Zach&#x27;s murder, Nina focused hatred towards her. At Donna&#x27;s wedding to Benny Sago, Nina came with a gun. She tried to shoot Donna, but luckily missed.

Nina finally broke from reality. She regressed to a state of adolescence, forgetting her life as a mother and Cliff&#x27;s wife. It tore Palmer apart to commit his daughter to an asylum, but at least it kept her away from Cliff. Their second marriage ended in divorce.

Nina tried to re-piece her shattered life. She found solace in Benny&#x27;s arms. Benny was still very much married to Donna. Nina was convinced she was in love. Before things got out of hand, Daisy and Nina left on a long cruise.

When Nina returned to Pine Valley, she began dating Matt Connolly. The couple ran into Cliff on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Cliff&#x27;s new fiancée, Dr. Amy Stone, was delayed in her arrival. Nina decided to keep Cliff company until Amy&#x27;s train arrived. It was like no time had passed between the couple. When Nina saw Matt again, she knew their relationship was over.

Waiting for her train to take her back to Pine Valley, Nina was plagued with thoughts of Cliff, but she was not about to break up an engagement. At that very moment, she heard her name being called. Cliff was running on the platform, professing his love. Matt had told him that Nina still loved him. Nina got off the train as soon as she could, and the couple reunited.

That Christmas, in front of family and friends, Nina and Cliff married for the third time at the Tavern on the Green in New York City.

Nina anxiously awaited Cliff&#x27;s return from a humanitarian mission in Hong Kong. But her world was turned upside down when news came that Cliff had gone to South America and was killed by rebels. Nina returned to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to mourne her husband. Matt followed her, afraid that she would have another break from reality. Nina wanted to be alone, but Matt refused to leave. In her moment of weakness, Nina and Matt shared a night of passionate lovemaking. As Nina lay next to Matt, she realized she did not want to be alone. She proposed to Matt and they married the next morning.

Returning to Pine Valley, Nina got word that Cliff was alive. They had an emotional reunion where Cliff promised to never leave Nina again. Nina spent the night with Cliff. But, when Cliff learned about Nina&#x27;s marriage to Matt, he rejected her. He wanted nothing to do with Nina anymore. She turned to Matt, hoping he would take her back.

Nina found out she pregnant. She realized both Matt and Cliff could have been the child&#x27;s father. Still recovering from Cliff&#x27;s rejection, Nina told Matt the child was his. Matt got a new job in Chicago, and the Connolly&#x27;s left Pine Valley. Because Cliff had been declared dead, Nina&#x27;s marriage to him was dissolved.

Nina returned to Pine Valley with a medical emergency. Her youngest son, Mikey Connolly, had fallen ill with a mysterious disease. She could not trust anyone else&#x27;s diagnosis but Cliff&#x27;s. Cliff was able to save Mikey, but in the process he uncovered something that Nina had feared all along: Mikey was Cliff&#x27;s son, not Matt&#x27;s. Upon learning the truth, Matt returned to Chicago without Nina.

Nina and Cliff were drawn to each other again. Only, Cliff was now in a relationship with Angie Hubbard. When Nina admitted to Angie that she still loved Cliff, Angie stepped aside. Nina and Cliff married for the fourth and final time on the Cortlandt Manor grounds. The Warners then left for Denver to start their lives anew.

Nina returns to Pine Valley for the Martin family housewarming. She had something important to talk about with her father, but decided to hold off after catching him in a heated argument with her mother.

Nina sent Bobby to live with Palmer. He had grown up to be quiet the handful. Nina hoped that Palmer could instill the discipline that he was lacking.

Upon learning that Bobby had impregnated Kesley Jefferson, Nina comes back to Pine Valley. Palmer was ready to kick Bobby out of Cortlandt Manor. But Nina did not want Palmer to lose his relationship with his grandson because of one bad decision. Nina reminded Bobby how much she loved him, and that she would always support any decision he made.

Nina returns in 2010 to mourn the death of her father, Palmer.

<text>Billy Jack is a 1971 American action drama independent film, the second of four films centering on a character of the same name which began with the movie &quot;The Born Losers&quot; (1967), played by Tom Laughlin, who directed and co-wrote the script. Filming began in Prescott, Arizona, in the fall of 1969, but the movie was not completed until 1971. American International Pictures pulled out, halting filming. 20th Century Fox came forward and filming eventually resumed but when that studio refused to distribute the film, Warner Bros. stepped forward.

Still, the film lacked distribution, so Laughlin booked it into theaters himself in 1971. The film grossed $10 million in its initial run, but eventually added close to $50 million in its re-release, with distribution supervised by Laughlin.

== Plot ==
Billy Jack, a mixed-race Navajo, is a Green Beret Vietnam War veteran and a hapkido master. He defends the hippie-themed Freedom School (inspired by Prescott College) and its students from townspeople who do not understand or like the counterculture students. The school is organized by its director, Jean Roberts.

One of the troubled youths is a girl named Barbara, who became pregnant while in San Francisco and has an abusive father. A group of children of various races from the school goes to town for ice cream but are refused service. They are then abused and humiliated by Bernard Posner, the son of the county&#x27;s corrupt political boss Stuart Posner, and his gang. This prompts a violent outburst by Billy.

Billy undergoes a Navajo initiation in which he is deliberately bitten by a large rattlesnake, intending to become the blood brother to the snake. Meanwhile, Barbara loses her unborn child when the horse she is riding stumbles on a rock, leading to her falling off the horse.

Bernard attempts to sexually assault a woman in his car, but is stopped by Jean and Billy, who give Bernard a choice: either receive a dislocated elbow or drive his Corvette into the lake. Bernard chooses the latter. Later, Bernard kidnaps and rapes Jean, and also murders a Native American student, Martin.

Billy confronts Bernard, whom he catches in bed with a 13-year-old girl, and sustains a gunshot wound before killing him with a hand strike to the throat. After barricading himself following a climactic shootout with the police and pleading from Jean, Billy Jack surrenders to the authorities in exchange for a decade-long guarantee that the school will be allowed to continue running with Jean as its head.

As Billy is driven away in handcuffs, a large crowd of supporters raises their fists in a show of defiance and support.

== Box-office and critical reception ==
&quot;Billy Jack&quot; holds a &quot;Fresh&quot; rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, with an average grade of 5.4/10. The website The Grindhouse Database, and the book &quot;Search and Clear: Critical Responses to Selected Literature and Films of the Vietnam War&quot; list this movie as belonging to the vetsploitation subgenre.

Film critic Leonard Maltin at first gave &quot;Billy Jack&quot; 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;Uneven in spots but tremendously powerful.&quot; Later, he downgraded it to 1.5 stars, writing, &quot;Seen today, its politics are highly questionable, and its &#x27;message&#x27; of peace looks ridiculous, considering the amount of violence in the film.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and also saw the message of the film as self-contradictory, writing: &quot;I&#x27;m also somewhat disturbed by the central theme of the movie. &quot;Billy Jack&quot; seems to be saying the same thing as &quot;Born Losers&quot;: that a gun is better than a constitution in the enforcement of justice.&quot; Howard Thompson, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, agreed, calling the film &quot;well-aimed but misguided&quot; as he wrote, &quot;For a picture that preaches pacifism, &quot;Billy Jack&quot; seems fascinated by its violence, of which it is full.&quot; He added that &quot;some of the non-professional delivery of lines in the script by Mr. Frank and Teresa Christina is incredibly awful.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine opined that &quot;the action frequently drags&quot; and at nearly two hours&#x27; running length, &quot;The message is rammed down the spectators&quot; throats and is sorely in need of considerable editing to tell a straightforward story.&quot; Gene Siskel gave &quot;Billy Jack&quot; 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;a film that tries to say too many things in too many ways within an adequate story line, but it has such freshness, original humor and compassion that one is frequently moved to genuine emotion&quot;. Kevin Thomas, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, also liked &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, praising its &quot;searing tension that sustains it through careening unevenness to a smash finish. Crude and sensational yet urgent and pertinent, this provocative Warners release is in its unique, awkward way one of the year&#x27;s important pictures.&quot;

Gary Arnold, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, panned &quot;Billy Jack&quot; as &quot;horrendously self-righteous and devious&quot;, explaining, &quot;Every social issue is dramatized in terms of absolute, apolitical good and evil. The good guys... are next to angelic, while the bad guys are, according to the needs of the moment, utter buffoons or utter devils. Anyone with the slightest trace of skepticism or sophistication would tend to reject the movie out of hand and with good reason, since this kind of simplification is dramatically and socially deceitful.&quot; David Wilson, in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, wrote: &quot;If in the end &quot;Billy Jack&quot; is as much a sell-out as any glossier version of commercialized iconoclasm (Billy Jack is persuaded to accept guarantees which a hundred years of Indian history have repudiated), there is enough innocent sincerity in the film to demonstrate that Tom Laughlin at least has the courage of his convictions, even if those convictions are scarcely thought out.&quot;

Delores Taylor received a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcoming Actress. Tom Laughlin won the grand prize for &quot;Billy Jack&quot; at the 1971 Taormina Film Fest in Italy.

==Accolades==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

==Sequels==

==Soundtrack==
The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Mundell Lowe and the soundtrack album was originally released on the Warner Bros. label.

===Reception===
The AllMusic review states &quot;a strange and striking combination of styles that somehow is effective ... a listenable disc whose flaws only add to the warmth&quot;. A cover of Canadian band The Original Caste, the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot; was recorded by Jinx Dawson, of the band Coven, with session musicians providing the backing and later a re-recording, renamed as &quot;One Tin Soldier (The Legend of Billy Jack)&quot;, credited to the band Coven, became a Top 40 hit in 1971 and again in 1973.

== Influence ==
Marketed as an action film, the story focuses on the plight of Native Americans during the civil rights era. It attained a cult following among younger audiences due to its youth-oriented, anti-authority message and the then-novel martial arts fight scenes, which predate the Bruce Lee/kung fu movie trend that followed. The centerpiece of the film features Billy Jack, enraged over the mistreatment of his Native American friends, fighting racist thugs using hapkido techniques.

In 2019, it was revealed that writer-director Quentin Tarantino and actor Brad Pitt used the film and Laughlin&#x27;s performance as an influence while developing Pitt&#x27;s character Cliff Booth in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

<text>State Highway 310 (SH 310) is an north–south state highway located mostly within Dallas. It is a portion of the old route of U.S. Highway 75 (US 75) along the Central Expressway, which now ends in downtown Dallas. The road, located within Hutchins and South Dallas, has been replaced as the major through route by Interstate 45 (I-45). SH 310 is known as the South Central Expressway south of its intersection with Loop 12 and the S. M. Wright Freeway north of it.

==Route description==
SH 310 begins and ends at I-45. It begins at I-45 in Hutchins as an arterial road named the South Central Expressway and intersects I-20 before entering Dallas. Passing through South Dallas, SH 310 has an interchange with Loop 12, taking on the name of the S. M. Wright Freeway. At the intersection with Overton Road, SH 310 becomes an expressway and promptly crosses the Trinity River. Continuing on, SH 310 has an interchange with US 175. After intersecting a couple side roads just south of Elsie Faye Heggins Street, SH 310 becomes a full fledged freeway, having an interchange with the aforementioned arterial. Continuing on, SH 310 has interchanges at Pine Street, Metropolitan Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard before ending at an interchange with I-45, Cesar Chavez Boulevard, and the Good-Latimer Expressway near downtown Dallas.

SH 310 north of Loop 12 was co-named the S.M. Wright Freeway in 1995 by Governor George W. Bush after the Reverend S.M. Wright (1927-1994). Wright was a local pastor and civil rights leader from South Dallas. It is still technically also referred to as the Central Expressway, as it is a former portion of that road. In practice, Dallasites refer to the current US 75 (the portion north of downtown) as Central Expressway and the decommissioned US 75 (the portion south of downtown) as the S.M. Wright Freeway.

The southbound Trinity River bridge is the original simple steel girder bridge from abutment to abutment while the northbound is newer and largely precast concrete - the only steel girders are the longer spans directly over the river. The southbound bridge was repainted by CEKRA for TxDOT in late 2015.

Through southern Dallas, I-45 (also named the Julius Schepps Freeway) has replaced SH 310 as the through route. However, as I-45 is completely elevated between downtown and the Trinity River, during freezing rain events it is virtually impassable, whereupon it is closed and traffic is diverted onto SH 310.

==History==
An earlier SH 310 was designated on February 20, 1939 from SH 29 to the Lockhart Recreation Center. On September 26, 1939, SH 310 was cancelled and transferred to PR 10. The current SH 310 was designated on January 28, 1987, replacing part of US 75 from US 175 south to I-45. On April 29, 2013, SH 310 was extended north from US 175 to I-45, replacing part of US 175, which was designated to be rerouted on a more direct route west to I-45. The rerouting of US 175 was opened to traffic in 2020, with I-45 south to US 175 east opening in March and the other direction in early July 2020.

==Future==
The S.M. Wright Project is a highway project by TxDOT which seeks to bring improvements to the major highways in South Dallas. The project mainly seeks to convert the S.M. Wright Freeway into the S.M. Wright Parkway, a six-lane arterial with at-grade intersections. Phase I involved rerouting US 175 off the S.M. Wright Freeway onto a brand new extension of the C.F. Hawn Freeway which directly connects into I-45. In addition to this, improvements were made to I-45 directly north of said interchange. Phase I was completed in early June 2020. Phase II involves converting the S.M. Wright Freeway between US 175 and I-45 into an arterial. In addition to that, improvements with its interchange with I-45, Cesar Chavez Boulevard, and the Good-Latimer Expressway will be made. Phase II is scheduled for completion in fall 2023.

<doc id="966567" wikidata="Q4698576" url="?curid=966567" title="Aircraftman">
<text>Aircraftman (AC) or aircraftwoman (ACW) was formerly the lowest rank in the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and is still in use by the air forces of several other Commonwealth countries. In RAF slang, aircraftmen were sometimes called &quot;erks&quot;.

Aircraftman ranked below leading aircraftman and has a NATO rank code of OR-1. For some time in the RAF it had been a training rank only and no airmen in productive service held the rank. Aircraftmen do not wear any rank insignia. The rank was renamed air recruit (AR) in the Royal Air Force in July 2022.

==History==
The rank was introduced to the RAF in January 1919, replacing the ranks of &quot;air mechanic&quot;, &quot;private&quot; and &quot;clerk&quot; that had been introduced under Air Memorandum No. 1 in March 1918. There were three grades: leading aircraftman (LAC), aircraftman 1st class (AC1) and aircraftman 2nd class. A similar grading existed for junior ratings in the Royal Navy. The rank of senior aircraftman (SAC) was introduced on 1 January 1951.

The lowest grade was an AC2; also colloquially known as an &quot;AC plonk&quot;. With effect from 1 April 1964, the gradings of AC1 and AC2 were abolished, with &quot;aircraftman&quot; becoming the entry rank.

==Canada==
In the Royal Canadian Air Force, the rank is also known by the French term of &quot;aviateur&quot;. This was changed from private in spring 2015 when the RCAF changed the colour of its rank insignia from gold to pearl grey. It is the lowest rank in the RCAF. Prior to 1968 the rank of aircraftman was used in the RCAF as in other Commonwealth air forces. In August 2020, the rank was changed to aviator.

==New Zealand==
In the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the rank is known as &quot;aircraftman&quot;, regardless of the person&#x27;s sex, in line with &quot;seaman&quot; in the Royal New Zealand Navy.

In 2023 the RNZAF adopted the title of ‘aviator(s)’ rather than airman when describing Air Force personnel.

<doc id="966583" wikidata="Q600409" url="?curid=966583" title="T-VIS">
<text>Toyota Variable Induction System, or T-VIS, is a variable intake system designed by Toyota to improve the low-end performance of multi-valve engines.

T-VIS is intended to improve the low-end torque of high-performance, four-stroke internal combustion engines - by changing the geometry of the intake manifold according to the engine rotation speed. The system uses two separate intake runners per cylinder, one being equipped with a butterfly valve that can either open or close the runner. All valves are attached to a common shaft which is rotated by a vacuum actuator outside the manifold. T-VIS does not actually keep one of the intake valves from opening or seal off the port for one valve.

The engine control unit (ECU) allows vacuum into the actuator by powering a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system is that in the lower engine speed band, the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine&#x27;s airflow needs at higher revolutions and improving top end power. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine&#x27;s power output may do so by increasing airflow per engine revolution, resulting in a high airflow at a lower rpm.

In addition to providing more air at higher engine speeds, the system also creates a swirl in the combustion chamber at lower rpms. The swirl makes for more efficient combustion, and is due to the asymmetric nature of the airflow with one intake runner closed.

Applications:
* 1982.08-1990 1G-GEU/1G-GE
* 1983-1989 4A-GE
* 1986-1989 3S-GE (Both Rev 1 and Rev 2 of the 1st Generation 3S-GE)
* 1986-1993/95 3S-GTE (through 1995 in US market, 1993 everywhere else; 1st &amp; 2nd generation motors only)
* 1997-2000 7A-FE (lean burn models only)
