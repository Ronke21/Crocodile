<text>The fourth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on October 4, 1996, concluding on the same channel on May 18, 1997, and contained 24 episodes. Following the filming and airing of the season, production began on &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature film, which was released in 1998 following the show&#x27;s fifth season.

The fourth season of the series focuses heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder&#x27;s (David Duchovny) and his partner Dana Scully&#x27;s (Gillian Anderson) investigation of an alien conspiracy, which is protected by the mysterious Syndicate. Midway through the season, Scully is diagnosed with terminal cancer, a result of her previous abduction, and Mulder begins to lose his faith in the idea of extraterrestrials.
Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twentieth most watched television series during the 1996–97 television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it, at the time, the highest rated season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air. The season&#x27;s twelfth episode, &quot;Leonard Betts&quot;, was chosen as the Fox lead-out program following Super Bowl XXXI, and was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode in the series&#x27; run. Critical reception from television critics was mostly positive.

== Plot overview ==
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who work on cases linked to the paranormal called X-Files. When the Syndicate suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder&#x27;s mother as bait. X&#x27;s (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias&#x27; aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.

Having been diagnosed with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction (&quot;Ascension&quot;), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin&#x27;s face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully&#x27;s cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.

=== Writing ===

The season saw drastic changes to the series&#x27; alien mythology. In the premiere episode, &quot;Herrenvolk&quot;, Williams—the actor who played Mulder&#x27;s informant X—was written out of the show. He said that, &quot;Carter called me up personally [and said] &#x27;Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we&#x27;re gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you&#x27;re gonna take a bullet.&quot; The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder&#x27;s informant. Carter felt it would be &quot;more interesting for Mulder&#x27;s next contact to be a woman&quot;, noting that he &quot;wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; also introduced the killer bees, who would go on to play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as &quot;maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show.&quot;

The season is notable in that it introduced a story arc about Scully developing terminal cancer, which would not be resolved until the beginning of the fifth season. The show&#x27;s producers decided to give Gillian Anderson&#x27;s character Dana Scully cancer early in the season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully&#x27;s mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as &quot;a cheap TV thing&quot;. However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an &quot;obligatory&quot; move to have Scully follow suit.

Following the cancellation of the Fox television series &quot;&quot;, Carter called the series&#x27; creators Glen Morgan and Wong—who had previously been writers for the first two seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot;—and asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter that the two of them would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members from the cast of &quot;Space: Above and Beyond&quot;, so that &quot;the world can finally see them&quot;. Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes.

=== Filming ===
The season finale, &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, was notable in that an entire set created to emulate icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage; and required the use of truckloads of lumber and of Styrofoam. The set would become one of the most expensive and elaborate built during the series&#x27; history. The set required a constant temperature of in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors&#x27; breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to &quot;have a place that feels real&quot; to aid their acting. The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around Vancouver&#x27;s Mount Seymour, with weather conditions making shooting difficult enough to require an extra day of work.

Although the series&#x27; 1998 movie would take place after the events of the fifth season, the movie was actually filmed in the hiatus between the show&#x27;s fourth and fifth season and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show&#x27;s fifth season.

=== Crew ===
Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote eight episodes. Howard Gordon continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes for his final season on the series. Spotnitz was promoted to co-producer and wrote seven episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to co-producer and wrote five episodes. Former &quot;X-Files&quot; writers Glen Morgan and James Wong returned after a one-season absence from the series as consulting producers and wrote three episodes together, with Morgan writing an additional episode solo that Wong directed. John Shiban was promoted to story editor and wrote four episodes. David Greenwalt joined mid-season as co-executive producer and wrote one episode for his only season on the series. Writing team Valerie and Vivian Mayhew wrote one freelance episode. Executive producer and frequent series director R. W. Goodwin wrote his first and only episode for the series. Other producers included producer Joseph Patrick Finn, co-producer Paul Rabwin, and consulting producer Ken Horton, who joined the series with this season.

Producing-directors for the show included Rob Bowman and Kim Manners, who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Manners directed eight episodes, while Bowman directed seven. Executive producer R. W. Goodwin again directed the season premiere and finale. James Charleston directed three episodes, while Tucker Gates, Michael Lange, Cliff Bole, and series writer James Wong each directed one episode.

=== Ratings ===
The fourth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; on October 4, 1996. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 13.2, with a 23 share, meaning that roughly 13.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 23 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 21.11 million people, a marked increase from the third season&#x27;s finale, &quot;Talitha Cumi&quot;, which was viewed by 17.86 million viewers. &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; was, at the time, the highest-rated episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air, as well as the first episode of the series to be watched by over 20 million viewers. As the season continued, however, ratings began to drop slightly, stabilizing around approximately less than 20 million viewers-per-episode. The season hit a high with its twelfth episode, &quot;Leonard Betts&quot;, which had been chosen as the Fox lead-out program following Super Bowl XXXI. The episode was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode in the series&#x27; run. The season hit a low with the fifteenth and sixteenth episodes, &quot;Kaddish&quot; and &quot;Unrequited&quot;, respectively, which were both viewed by 16.56 million viewers. The season finale, &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, earned a Nielsen rating of 13.2, with a 19 share, and was viewed by 19.85 million viewers, marking a 5.9 percent drop in viewers when compared to the season premiere, but a 10 percent increase in viewers when compared to the previous season finale. The season ranked as the twelfth most watched television series during the 1996–97 year, with an average of 19.2 million viewers, making it, at the time, the highest-rated season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air.

=== Reviews ===
The fourth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; received largely positive reviews from television critics, although several critics noted that the season was not as good as its predecessors. The &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; noted that &quot;The X-Files&quot; during its fourth year was creatively good and &quot;always fascinating even when it&#x27;s frustrating.&quot; Rick Kushman Bee of the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; wrote that Fox&#x27; Sunday block of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; was televisions &quot;real &#x27;Must See TV&#x27;&quot;. Matt Roush of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the fourth season was not the series&#x27; best year, but &quot;when good, [&quot;The X-Files&quot; is] still shockingly great&quot;. Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave an overall positive review of the season and wrote that many of the episodes dabbled in existentialism. However, he also contended that many of the mythology episodes—especially the season finale—began to have &quot;a ring of familiarity to&quot; them and that &quot;the repetition is getting old&quot;.

Episodic reviews were diverse. Some episodes were praised. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book &quot;Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen&quot;, rated the episodes &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Unruhe&quot;, &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; five stars out of five. Paula Vitaris of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; also awarded &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; perfect scores of four out of four. Tom Kessenich named &quot;Memento Mori&quot; the fourth best episode of the series, writing that it was the definitive example of Mulder and Scully&#x27;s devotion for each other.&quot;. He also wrote highly of &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, Small Potatoes&quot;, and &quot;Never Again&quot;, ranking them as the fifth, eleventh, sixteenth, and twenty-fourth best episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, respectively. Other episodes were derided. Shearman and Pearson called &quot;El Mundo Gira&quot; an &quot;aching unambitious take on Latin American culture&quot; and &quot;rubbish&quot;. Vitaris summaried &quot;Unrequited&quot; as a &quot;slight story that collapses under the weight of its message&quot;.

&quot;Gethsemane&quot; created intense media speculation about whether or not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; discussed fan theories behind Mulder&#x27;s madness while a cartoon ran in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; a few weeks later surrounding Mulder&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;. Series creator Chris Carter noted that &quot;the whole plot line of &#x27;Gethsemane&#x27; revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it&#x27;s an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him&quot;. UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of &quot;TV&#x27;s Best Season Finales&quot;, noting that it &quot;rocked the core of the series&#x27; entire mythology&quot;.

In 2018 and 2019, in a ranking of all eleven seasons, the fourth season received critical acclaim and was named the second-best season by both &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot;. The episode, &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, was singled out as one of the best episodes of the series by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The fourth season earned the series twelve Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with three wins. Anderson won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, after being nominated the previous year. The episodes &quot;Memento Mori&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; won for Outstanding Art Direction for a Series and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, respectively. Notable nominations included its third consecutive nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, Duchovny&#x27;s first nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, James Wong nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, and Carter, Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz being nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for &quot;Memento Mori&quot;. Other nominations were Jim Gross and Heather MacDougall each being nominated for Outstanding Editing for a Series – Single Camera Production for the episodes &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; and &quot;Terma&quot;, respectively; Outstanding Makeup for a Series for &quot;Leonard Betts&quot;; Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series for &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;; and Mark Snow being nominated for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) for &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;. The series also won its second Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, while Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny won in the television series drama acting categories.

<text>Finland participated in the Second World War initially in a defensive war against the Soviet Union, followed by another, this time offensive, war against the Soviet Union acting in concert with Nazi Germany and then finally fighting alongside the Allies against Germany.

The first two major conflicts in which Finland was directly involved were the defensive Winter War against an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1939, followed by the offensive Continuation War, together with Germany and the other Axis Powers against the Soviets, in 1941–1944. The third conflict, the Lapland War against Germany in 1944–1945, followed the signing of the Moscow Armistice with the Allied Powers, which stipulated expulsion of Nazi German forces from Finnish territory.

The Soviet attempt to conquer Finland in the Winter War was thwarted, and by the end of World War II, Finland remained an independent country. However, Finland ceded approximately 10% of its territory to the Soviet Union, including Viipuri (Finland&#x27;s second-largest city [Population Register] or fourth-largest city [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data). Finland was also required to pay out a large amount of war reparations to the Soviet Union and to formally acknowledge partial responsibility for the Continuation War. Finnish political policy during the Cold War was aimed at appeasing the Soviet Union in order to maintain good relations.

==Background==
===Finnish independence===
In 1809, the Russian Empire seized Finland from Sweden in the Finnish War. Finland entered a personal union with the Russian Empire as a grand duchy with extensive autonomy.

On 6 December 1917, during the Russian Civil War, the Finnish parliament (&quot;Suomen Eduskunta&quot;) declared independence from Russia, which was accepted by the Bolshevik government of the Soviet Union on 31 December. In January 1918, the &quot;Eduskunta&quot; ordered General Carl Mannerheim to use local Finnish White Guards to disarm Finnish Red Guards and Russian troops throughout the country, a process which began on 27 January and led to the beginning of the Finnish Civil War.

After the Eastern Front and peace negotiations between the Bolsheviks and Germany collapsed, German troops intervened in the country and occupied Helsinki and Finland. The Red faction was defeated and the survivors were subjected to a reign of terror, in which at least 12,000 people died. A new government, with Juho Kusti Paasikivi as prime minister, pursued a pro-German policy and sought to annex Russian Karelia, which had a Finnish-speaking majority, despite never having been a part of Finland.

===Treaty of Tartu: 1920===

After the extinction of the Hohenzollern monarchy on 9 November 1918, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent, German troops left Finland, and British ships patrolled the Baltic Sea. Mannerheim was elected regent by the &quot;Eduskunta&quot;, and Finnish policy became pro-Entente as the western powers intervened in the Russian Civil War (7 November 1917 – 16 June 1923). Mannerheim favoured intervention against the Bolsheviks but suspicion of the White Russians who refused to recognise Finnish independence led to his aggressive policy being overruled; then, the Bolshevik victory in Russia forestalled Finnish hostilities.

Paasikivi led a delegation to Tartu, in Estonia, with instructions to establish a frontier from Lake Ladoga in the south, via Lake Onega to the White Sea in the north. The importance of the Murmansk railway, built in 1916, led the Soviet delegation to reject the Finnish border proposal, and the treaty of 14 October 1920 recognised a border agreement in which Finland obtained the northern port of Petsamo (Pechenga), an outlet to the Arctic Ocean, and a border roughly the same as that of the former Grand Duchy of Finland. Claims on areas of Eastern Karelia were abandoned and the Soviets accepted that the south-eastern border would not be moved west of Petrograd.

== Winter War ==

During the Interwar period, relations between Finland and the Soviet Union were tense. Some elements in Finland maintained the dream of a &quot;Greater Finland&quot; which included the Soviet-controlled part of Karelia, while the proximity of the Finnish border to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) caused worry among the Soviet leadership. On 23 August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which included a secret clause demarcating Finland as part of the Soviet sphere of influence.

On 12 October the Soviet Union began negotiations with Finland regarding the disposition of the Karelian Isthmus, the Hanko Peninsula, and various islands in the Gulf of Finland, all of which were considered by the Finns to be Finnish territory. No agreement was reached. On 26 November the Soviet Union accused the Finnish army of shelling the village of Mainila. It was subsequently found that the Soviets had in fact shelled their own village, in order to create a pretext for withdrawal from their non-aggression pact with Finland. On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland. The attack was denounced by the League of Nations, and as a result, the Soviet Union was expelled from that body on 14 December.
The aim of the invasion was to liberate the &#x27;Red Finns&#x27; and eventually annex Finland to the Soviet Union. To this end, a puppet government, the Finnish Democratic Republic, was established in Terijoki under the leadership of the exiled O. W. Kuusinen. Strategic goals of the Red Army included cutting Finland in half and capturing Petsamo in the north and Helsinki in the south.

The leader of the Leningrad Military District, Andrei Zhdanov, commissioned a celebratory piece from Dmitri Shostakovich, &quot;Suite on Finnish Themes&quot;, intended to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army paraded through Helsinki.

The Soviets had been building up their forces on the border during the earlier negotiations, and now fielded four armies composed of 16 divisions, with another three being brought into position; meanwhile, the Finnish army had just 9 smaller divisions. The Soviets also enjoyed overwhelming superiority in the number of armour and air units deployed. The Finns had to defend a border that was some 1287 km (800 miles) in length, putting them at a significant disadvantage.

===First offensive November 1939===
The Winter War was fought in two Soviet offensives, divided by a short lull. The war was fought mainly in three areas. The Karelian Isthmus and the area of Lake Ladoga were the primary focus of the Soviet war effort. A two-pronged attack was launched in this region, with one pincer engaging Finnish forces on the Isthmus while the other went around Lake Ladoga in an attempt at encircling the defenders. This force was then to advance to and capture the city of Viipuri. The second front was in central Karelia, where Soviet forces were to advance to the city of Oulu, cutting the country in half. Finally, a drive from the north was intended to capture the Petsamo region.

The first attack, on 30 November 1939, was an aerial bombardment of the city of Helsinki, with subsidiary attacks all along the Finnish-Soviet border. This had the effect of instantly unifying the once deeply-divided Finnish people in defense of their homes and country, without any referendums needing to be carried out.

By late December the Soviets had become bogged down, with the two main fronts at a standstill as the Finns counterattacked with greater strength than anticipated. With the failure of two of its three offensives by the end of December, Soviet headquarters ordered a cessation of operations. By 27 December, it was observed that the Soviets were digging in on the Karelian Isthmus. In the north, the Finns had been pushed back to Nautsi, but with reinforcements, had been able to take the higher ground and halt the Soviet advance south of Petsamo. During this period the Finns harassed supply columns and carried out raids against fortified Soviet positions.

A lull followed in January 1940, as the Soviet army reassessed its strategy, and rearmed and resupplied. On 29 January, Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the USSR was willing to negotiate peace.

===Second Offensive February 1940===
The last phase began in February 1940, with a major artillery barrage that began on the 2nd and lasted until the 11th, accompanied by reconnaissance raids at key objectives. The Soviets, using new equipment and materials, also began using the tactic of rotating troops from the reserve to the front, thus keeping constant pressure on the Finnish defenders. Relative to Finnish resources, the Red Army seemed to have inexhaustible amounts of ammunition and supplies, as attacks were always preceded by barrages, followed by aerial assaults and then random troop movements against the lines. Finnish military and government leaders came to feel that their only hope of preserving their nation lay in negotiating a peace treaty with Moscow.

The tenacity of the Finnish people, both military and civilian, in the face of a superior opponent gained the country much sympathy throughout the world; however, material support from other countries was very limited, as none of Finland&#x27;s neighbors were willing to commit their militaries to a war against the USSR.

The need for a diplomatic solution became even more apparent after Soviet forces broke through the Finnish defensive line on the Karelian Isthmus and moved on towards Viipuri.

A peace proposal authored by Molotov was sent to Helsinki in mid-February. It placed heavy demands on Finland, claiming more land for the USSR and imposing significant diplomatic and military sanctions. By 28 February, Molotov had made his offer into an ultimatum with a 48-hour time limit, which pushed the Finnish leadership to act quickly. On 12 March 1940, the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed, with hostilities ending the following day. By the terms of the treaty, Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the USSR. This was more territory than the Soviets had originally demanded.

== Interim peace ==
The period of peace following the Winter War was widely regarded in Finland as temporary, even when peace was announced in March 1940. A period of frantic diplomatic efforts and rearmament followed. The Soviet Union kept up intense pressure on Finland, thereby hastening the Finnish efforts to improve the security of the country.

Defensive arrangements were attempted with Sweden and the United Kingdom, but the political and military situation in the context of the Second World War rendered these efforts fruitless. Finland then turned to Nazi Germany for military aid. As the German offensive against the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) approached, the cooperation between the two countries intensified. German troops arrived in Finland and took up positions, mostly in Lapland, from where they would invade the Soviet Union.

== Continuation War ==

Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941. On 25 June the Soviet Union launched an air raid against Finnish cities, after which Finland declared war and also allowed German troops stationed in Finland to begin offensive warfare. The resulting war was known to the Finns as the Continuation War. During the summer and autumn of 1941 the Finnish Army was on the offensive, retaking the territories lost in the Winter War. The Finnish army also advanced further, especially in the direction of Lake Onega, (east from Lake Ladoga), closing the blockade of the city of Leningrad from the north, and occupying Eastern Karelia, which had many ethnic Finns living there, but had never technically been a part of Finland before.

This resulted with Stalin asking Roosevelt for help in restoring peaceful relations between Finland and the Soviet Union on 4 August 1941. Finland&#x27;s refusal of the Soviet offer of territorial concessions in exchange for a peace treaty would later cause Great Britain to declare war on Finland on 6 December (the US maintained diplomatic relations with Finland until the summer of 1944). The German and Finnish troops in Northern Finland were less successful, failing to take the Russian port city of Murmansk during Operation Silver Fox.

On 31 July 1941 the United Kingdom launched Operation EF to demonstrate support for the Soviet Union. These raids were unsuccessful.

In December 1941, the Finnish army took defensive positions. This led to a long period of relative calm in the front line, lasting until 1944. During this period, starting at 1941 but especially after the major German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, intermittent peace inquiries took place. These negotiations did not lead to any settlement. In September 1943, a few months after Stalingrad, Finland indicated its independence of Germany by not recognizing the puppet Italian Social Republic, proclaimed by the Germans in northern Italy.

On 16 March 1944, the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, called for Finland to disassociate itself from Nazi Germany.

On 9 June 1944, the Red Army launched a major strategic offensive against Finland, attaining vast numerical superiority and surprising the Finnish army. This attack pushed the Finnish forces approximately to the same positions as they were holding at the end of the Winter War. Eventually, the Soviet offensive was fought to a standstill in the Battle of Tali–Ihantala, while still tens or hundreds of kilometres in front of the main Finnish line of fortifications, the Salpa Line. However, the war had exhausted Finnish resources and it was believed that the country would not be able to hold against another major attack.

The worsening situation in 1944 had led to Finnish president Risto Ryti giving Germany his personal guarantee that Finland would not negotiate peace with the Soviet Union for as long as he was the president. In exchange, Germany delivered weapons to the Finns. After the Soviet offensive was halted, however, Ryti resigned. Due to the war, elections could not be held, and therefore the Parliament selected the Marshal of Finland Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the Finnish commander-in-chief, as president and charged him with negotiating a peace.

The Finnish front had become a sideshow for the Soviet leadership, as they were in a race to reach Berlin before the Western Allies. This, and the heavy casualties inflicted on the Red Army by the Finns, led to the transfer of most troops from the Finnish front. On 4 September 1944 a ceasefire was agreed, and the Moscow Armistice between the Soviet Union and United Kingdom on one side and Finland on the other was signed on 19 September.

=== Moscow armistice ===

The Moscow armistice was signed by Finland and the Soviet Union on 19 September 1944 ending the Continuation War, though the final peace treaty was not to be signed until 1947 in Paris.

The conditions for peace were similar to those previously agreed in the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty, with Finland being forced to cede parts of Finnish Karelia, a part of Salla and islands in the Gulf of Finland. The new armistice also handed the whole of Petsamo over to the Soviet Union. Finland also agreed to legalize communist parties and ban fascist organizations. Finally, the armistice also demanded that Finland expel German troops from its territory, which was the cause of the Lapland War.

== Lapland War ==
The Lapland War was fought between Finland and Nazi Germany in Lapland, the northernmost part of Finland. The main strategic interest of Germany in the region was the nickel mines in the Petsamo area.

Initially the warfare was cautious on both sides, reflecting the previous cooperation of the two countries against their common enemy, but by the end of 1944 the fighting intensified. Finland and Germany had made an informal agreement and schedule for German troops to withdraw from Lapland to Norway. The Soviet Union did not accept this &quot;friendliness&quot; and pressured Finland to take a more active role in pushing the Germans out of Lapland, thus intensifying hostilities.

The Germans adopted a scorched-earth policy, and proceeded to lay waste to the entire northern half of the country as they retreated. Around 100,000 people lost their homes, adding to the burden of post-war reconstruction. The actual loss of life, however, was relatively light. Finland lost 
approximately 1,000 troops and Germany about 2,000. The Finnish army expelled the last of the foreign troops from Finland in April 1945.

==Post-war==

The war caused great damage to infrastructure and the economy. From the autumn of 1944, the Finnish army and navy performed many mine clearance operations, especially in Karelia, Lapland and the Gulf of Finland. Sea mine clearance activities lasted until 1950. The mines caused many military and civilian casualties, particularly in Lapland.

As part of the Paris Peace Treaty, Finland was classified as an ally of Nazi Germany, bearing its responsibility for the war. The treaty imposed heavy war reparations on Finland and stipulated the lease of the Porkkala area near the Finnish capital Helsinki as a military base for fifty years. The reparations were initially thought to be crippling for the economy, but a determined effort was made to pay them. The reparations were reduced by 25% in 1948 by the Soviet Union and were paid off in 1952. Porkkala was returned to Finnish control in 1956.

In subsequent years the position of Finland was unique in the Cold War. The country was heavily influenced by the Soviet Union, but was the only country on the Soviet pre-World War II border to retain democracy and a market economy. Finland entered into the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (YYA Treaty) with the Soviet Union in which the Soviet Union agreed to the neutral status of Finland. Arms purchases were balanced between East and West until the fall of the Soviet Union.

==Assessment==

=== Finland and Nazi Germany ===
During the Continuation War (1941–1944) Finland&#x27;s wartime government claimed to be a co-belligerent of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, and abstained from signing the Tripartite Pact. Finland was dependent on food, fuel, and armament shipments from Germany during this period, and was influenced to sign the Anti-Comintern Pact, a less formal alliance than the Tripartite Pact seen as by the Nazi leadership as a &quot;litmus test of loyalty&quot;. The Finnish leadership adhered to many written and oral agreements on practical co-operation with Germany during the conflict. Finland was one of Germany&#x27;s most important allies in the attack on the Soviet Union, allowing German troops to be based in Finland before the attack and joining in the attack on the USSR almost immediately. The 1947 Paris Peace treaty signed by Finland stated that Finland had been &quot;an ally of Hitlerite Germany&quot; and bore partial responsibility for the conflict.

Finland was an anomaly among German allies in that it retained an independent, democratic government. Moreover, during the war, Finland kept its army outside the German command structure despite numerous attempts by the Germans to tie them more tightly together. Finland managed not to take part in the siege of Leningrad despite Hitler&#x27;s wishes, and refused to cut the Murmansk railway.

Finnish Jews were not persecuted, and even among extremists of the Finnish Right they were highly tolerated, as many leaders of the movement came from the clergy. Of approximately 500 Jewish refugees, eight were handed over to the Germans, a fact for which Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen issued an official apology in 2000. The field synagogue operated by the Finnish army was probably a unique phenomenon in the Eastern Front of the war. Finnish Jews fought alongside other Finns.

About 2,600–2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war held by the Germans. In November 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center submitted an official request to Finnish President Tarja Halonen for a full-scale investigation by the Finnish authorities of the prisoner exchange. In the subsequent study by Professor Heikki Ylikangas it turned out that about 2,000 of the exchanged prisoners joined the Russian Liberation Army. The rest, mostly army and political officers, (among them a name-based estimate of 74 Jews), most likely perished in Nazi concentration camps.

=== Finland and World War II overall ===

During World War II, Finland was anomalous: It was the only European country bordering the Soviet Union in 1939 which was still unoccupied by 1945. It was a country which sided with Germany, but in which native Jews and almost all refugees were safe from persecution. It was the only country that fought alongside Nazi Germany which maintained democracy throughout the war. It was in fact the only democracy in mainland Europe that remained so despite being an involved party in the war.

According to the Finnish records 19,085 Soviet prisoners of war died in Finnish prison camps during the Continuation War, which means that 29.6% of Soviet POWs taken by the Finns did not survive. The high number of fatalities was mainly due to malnutrition and diseases. However, about 1,000 POWs were shot, primarily when attempting to escape.

When the Finnish Army controlled East Karelia between 1941 and 1944, several concentration camps were set up for Russian civilians. The first camp was set up on 24 October 1941, in Petrozavodsk. Of these interned civilians 4,361 perished mainly due to malnourishment, 90% of them during the spring and summer of 1942.

Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact, but was aided in its military assault on the Soviet Union by Germany from the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, and in its defence against Soviet attacks in 1944 prior to the separate peace with the Soviet Union in 1944. Finland was led by its elected president and parliament during the whole 1939–1945 period. As a result, some political scientists name it as one of the few instances where a democratic country was engaged in a war against one or more other democratic countries, namely the democracies in the Allied forces. However, nearly all Finnish military engagements in World War II were fought solely against an autocratic power, the Soviet Union, and the lack of direct conflicts specifically with other democratic countries leads others to exclude Finnish involvement in World War II as an example of a war between two or more democracies.

Finnish President Tarja Halonen, speaking in 2005, said that &quot;For us the world war meant a separate war against the Soviet Union and we did not incur any debt of gratitude to others&quot;. Finnish President Mauno Koivisto also expressed similar views in 1993. However the view that Finland only fought separately during the Second World War remains controversial within Finland and was not generally accepted outside Finland. In a 2008 poll of 28 Finnish historians carried out by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, 16 said that Finland had been an ally of Nazi Germany, six said it had not been, and six did not take a position.

<doc id="940054" wikidata="Q2243531" url="?curid=940054" title="Welsh mythology">
<text>Welsh mythology (also commonly known as &quot;Y Chwedlau&quot;, meaning &quot;The Legends&quot;) consists of both folk traditions developed in Wales, and traditions developed by the Celtic Britons elsewhere before the end of the first millennium. As in most of the predominantly oral societies Celtic mythology and history were recorded orally by specialists such as druids (). This oral record has been lost or altered as a result of outside contact and invasion over the years. Much of this altered mythology and history is preserved in medieval Welsh manuscripts, which include the Red Book of Hergest, the White Book of Rhydderch, the Book of Aneirin and the Book of Taliesin. Other works connected to Welsh mythology include the ninth-century Latin historical compilation &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;History of the Britons&quot;) and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s twelfth-century Latin chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), as well as later folklore, such as the materials collected in &quot;The Welsh Fairy Book&quot; by William Jenkyn Thomas (1908).

==Cosmogony and creation==
As with other Insular Celts, no direct written accounts of the origins of the cosmos survive. We can assume that these Celts did have a complex cosmogony, given the accounts from classical authors about the depth of knowledge of the druids who passed down their knowledge via orature. 

However, scholars can find connections to the broader Proto-Indo-European system in both the names of the deities themselves and in the later written tales that likely preserve remnants of the earlier orally transmitted narratives (see the &quot;Pantheon&quot; section below). Legends were not written down until after the Christianization of Britain, however, so these accounts are rather indirect; additionally, they likely evolved quite a bit over time anyway, as narrative systems typically do. 

John T. Koch proposes that the name of the goddess Dôn, for instance, likely comes from &quot;ghdhonos&quot;, meaning &quot;the earth.&quot; In this sense she serves as the Welsh version of the &quot;dheghom&quot; figure from Proto-Indo-European mythology, i.e. the primordial Earth Goddess from which all other gods originate. According to this theory, the Children of Dôn would be comparable to the Greek Titans.

John Carey suggests that the Fourth Branch of The Mabinogi, along with the Taliesin poems (especially Cad Goddeu), contain hints of the cyclicality of cosmogonic progressions. 
With this in mind, the transformations of various characters (especially Lleu and Taliesin) hint not just at reincarnation but perhaps even reconfigurations of the cosmos itself (along the lines of the Norse concept of Ragnarok as not merely signaling the end of existence, but heralding the beginning of a subsequent existence for the cosmos).

===Realms of existence===
-Elfydd: The Earth; the realm of humans

-Annwn: The Otherworld; the realm(s) of the gods. Depending on the source, this could be a more typical Indo-European underworld (i.e. a realm below the earth), or the &quot;deep&quot; areas within the natural realm (e.g. deep within the woods, as with the First Branch of The Mabinogi, or within/near lakes, e.g. the Arthurian Lady of the Lake, Ceridwen in Hanes Taliesin, etc.). Rather than being separate from nature, the Celts likely saw the Otherworld as being a mysterious but essential aspect of nature and a parallel to Elfydd. 

While the sky and its celestial bodies are clearly separate from the earth, there does not seem to be an association between gods and the sky in extant Welsh myth (though as we see in the Pantheon below, there likely would have been at some earlier point).

Sharon Paice Macleod proposes that the ancient Celts had a concept of the World Tree that links the various realms of the world (akin to the Norse Yggdrasil), given the centrality of trees in Celtic knowledge, but there is no clear evidence for this.

==Theoretical pantheon== 

Pre-Christian deities in Wales would largely fall into the category of Genius loci, or local protector spirits. However, some scholars have proposed a theoretical pantheon that may have once existed for at least some of the Celtic Britons. 

===Origins of the pantheon in etymology and myth===

The simplified chart above can be complicated by the fact that, as with other mythological systems, figures that descend from Proto-Indo-European mythology can fragment and split into several individual characters over time. The House of Dôn and the House of Llŷr may have figures from each house that occupy a similar role, and other variations may occur as well. Such inconsistencies are common in Indo-European myths, however, given the natural evolutions and variations that occur over time. 

Dôn may originate from ghdhonos, meaning &quot;the earth&quot; (see above). 

Beli Mawr is one of her consorts and is associated with the sky and sun. Beltane is Irish festival of the start of summer, and the Gaulish god Belenus was associated with the Greek sun god Apollo. 

Aryanrhot (Arianrhod) means &quot;silver wheel&quot; and is associated with the moon; her one son, &quot;Lleu,&quot; means light (&quot;lleuad&quot; is the Modern Welsh word for moon), while her other son, Dylan ail Don, is associated with the waves/tides (which are, of course, connected to the moon). Lleu may be the light of the moon, though he has been associated with Mercury and the Sun as well. 

Euron (Gronw, Gwyronwy, Gwyron): gwron means &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;warrior,&quot; while the British &quot;wirowonos&quot; means &quot;man-slaying&quot;; as a &quot;First Man&quot; type, he slays the &quot;Twin&quot; figure of Lleu Llaw Gyffes in the Fourth Branch of The Mabinogi (note: while Gronw Pebr is not Lleu&#x27;s literal twin, they are foils in that Gronw persues Lleu&#x27;s wife, the flower-maiden Blodeuwedd). In Cad Goddeu, Gwron is paired with Madrud/Modron, the mother of the divine son Mabon. 

Manawydan may be cognate with &quot;Manu.&quot; 

Brân is the brother of Manawydan. His name means &quot;crow,&quot; and bird often associated with death. Hence, he may serve as a God of death, also given his connection to the Brittonic Brennos (associated with the Dis Pater of the Gauls and that he lives on after being decapitated and hosts the living in Gwales, an island realm outside of time, in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi. The Twin figure is often a god of death in other related Indo-European systems. He is also a protector god, as his head (buried in London) protects the Island of Britain from invasion. 

Efnisien is the brother of Nisien and half-brother of Manawydan and Brân. Efnesian sows death, chaos, and destruction, while Nisien is more peaceful. The connection to the opposite twins of Proto-Indo-European myth is overt here, but Efnesian&#x27;s destruction is not as productive as Manu&#x27;s, and Nisien is not a sacrificial character like Yemo. Alternatively, Nisien may be the Manu figure, since Efnisien is associated with death as Yemo sometimes is. 

Llŷr is likely a sea god, and may be cognate with the Irish god Lir (meaning &quot;sea&quot;; note that his son, Manannán son of Lir, may be cognate with Manawydan son of Llŷr).

==Legends==

Unlike the section above, we find the following legends in actual literary texts instead of etymological and mythical reconstructions by academic scholars. 

===The Four Branches of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;===


Four of the mythological stories contained in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; are collectively known as the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. They concentrate largely on the exploits of various British deities who have been Christianized into kings and heroes. The only character who appears in every branch is Pryderi fab Pwyll, the king of Dyfed, who is born in the first Branch, is killed in the fourth, and is probably a reflex of the Celtic god Maponos. The only other recurring characters are Pryderi&#x27;s mother Rhiannon, associated with the peaceful British prince Manawydan, who later becomes her second husband. Manawydan and his siblings Brân the Blessed ( or &quot;Blessed Crow&quot;), Branwen and Efnysien are the key players of the second branch, while the fourth branch concerns itself with the exploits of the family of Dôn, which includes the wizard Gwydion, his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, and his sister, Arianrhod.

====Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed====
The first branch tells of how Pwyll, prince of Dyfed, exchanges places for a year with Arawn, the ruler of Annwn (the otherworld), defeats Arawn&#x27;s enemy Hafgan, and on his return encounters Rhiannon, a beautiful maiden whose horse cannot be caught up with. He manages to win her hand at the expense of Gwawl, to whom she is betrothed, and she bears him a son, but the child disappears soon after his birth. Rhiannon is accused of killing him and forced to carry guests on her back as punishment. The child has been taken by a monster, and is rescued by Teyrnon and his wife, who bring him up as their own, calling him Gwri of the Golden hair, until his resemblance to Pwyll becomes apparent. They return him to his real parents, Rhiannon is released from her punishment, and the boy is renamed Pryderi.

====&quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot;====
In the second branch Branwen, sister of Brân the Blessed, king of Britain, is given in marriage to Matholwch, king of Ireland. Branwen&#x27;s half-brother Efnysien insults Matholwch by mutilating his horses, and in compensation Brân gives Matholwch new horses and treasure, including a magical cauldron that can restore the dead to life. Matholwch and Branwen have a son, Gwern, but Matholwch proceeds to mistreat Branwen, beating her and making her a . Branwen trains a starling to take a message to Brân, who goes to war against Matholwch. His army crosses the Irish Sea in ships, but Brân is so huge that he wades across. The Irish offer to make peace, and build a house big enough to entertain Bran, but inside they hang a hundred bags, telling Efnysien they contain flour, when in fact they conceal armed warriors. Efnysien kills the warriors by squeezing the bags. Later, at the feast, Efnysien throws Gwern on the fire and fighting breaks out. Seeing that the Irish are using the cauldron to revive their dead, Efnysien hides among the corpses and destroys the cauldron, although the effort costs him his life. Only seven men, all Britons, survive the battle, including Pryderi, Manawydan and Bran, who is mortally wounded by a poisoned spear. Brân asks his companions to cut off his head and take it back to Britain. Branwen dies of grief on returning home. Five pregnant women survive to repopulate Ireland.

====&quot;Manawydan fab Llŷr&quot;====
Pryderi and Manawydan return to Dyfed, where Pryderi marries Cigfa and Manawydan marries Rhiannon. However, a mist descends on the land, leaving it empty and desolate. The four support themselves by hunting at first, then move to England, where they make a living by making, successively, saddles, shields and shoes. Each time their products are of such quality that local craftsmen cannot compete, and drive them from town to town. Eventually they return to Dyfed and become hunters again. A white boar leads them to a mysterious castle. Against Manawydan&#x27;s advice, Pryderi goes inside, but does not return. Rhiannon goes to investigate and finds him clinging to a bowl, unable to speak. The same fate befalls her, and the castle disappears. Manawydan and Cigfa return to England as shoemakers, but once again the locals drive them out and they return to Dyfed. They sow three fields of wheat, but the first field is destroyed before it can be harvested. The next night the second field is destroyed. Manawydan keeps watch over the third field, and when he sees it destroyed by mice he catches their leader and decides to hang it. A scholar, a priest and a bishop in turn offer him gifts if he will spare the mouse, but he refuses. When asked what he wants in return for the mouse&#x27;s life, he demands the release of Pryderi and Rhiannon, and the lifting of the enchantment over Dyfed. The bishop agrees, because the mouse is in fact his wife. He has been waging magical war against Dyfed because he is a friend of Gwawl, whom Pwyll, Pryderi&#x27;s father, humiliated.

====Math fab Mathonwy====
While Pryderi rules Dyfed, in the south of Wales, Gwynedd in the north of Wales is ruled by Math, son of Mathonwy. His feet must be held by a virgin except while he is at war. Math&#x27;s nephew, Gilfaethwy, is in love with Goewin, his current footholder, and Gilfaethwy&#x27;s brother Gwydion tricks Math into going to war against Pryderi so Gilfaethwy can have access to her. Gwydion kills Pryderi in single combat, and Gilfaethwy rapes Goewin. Math marries Goewin to save her from disgrace, and banishes Gwydion and Gilfaethwy, transforming them into a breeding pair of deer, then pigs, then wolves. After three years they are restored to human form and return.

Math needs a new footholder, and Gwydion suggests his sister, Arianrhod, but when Math magically tests her virginity she gives birth to two sons. One, Dylan, immediately takes to the sea. The other child is raised by Gwydion, but Arianrhod tells him he will never have a name or arms unless she gives them to him, and refuses to do so. Gwydion tricks her into naming him Lleu Llaw Gyffes (&quot;Bright, of deft hand&quot;), and giving him arms. She then tells him he will never have a wife of any race living on Earth, so Gwydion and Math make him a wife from flowers, called Blodeuwedd (possibly &quot;Flower face&quot;, though other etymologies have been suggested). Blodeuwedd falls in love with a hunter, Gronw Pebr, and they plot to kill Lleu. Blodeuwedd tricks Lleu into revealing the means by which he can be killed, but when Gronw attempts to do the deed Lleu escapes, transformed into an eagle. Gwydion finds Lleu and transforms him back into human form, and turns Blodeuwedd into an owl, renaming her Blodeuwedd and cursing her. Gronw offers to compensate Lleu, but Lleu insists on returning the blow that was struck against him. Gronw pleads to be allowed to hide behind a rock when he attempts to kill him. Lleu agrees. He kills Gronw with his spear, which is thrown so hard it pierces him through the stone he is hiding behind.

=====Cad Goddeu=====
A large tradition seems to have once surrounded the Battle of the Trees, a mythological conflict fought between the sons of Dôn and the forces of Annwn, the Welsh Otherworld, and seemingly connected to the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi. Amaethon, one of the sons of Dôn, steals a white roebuck and a whelp from Arawn, king of the otherworld, leading to a great battle.

Gwydion fights alongside his brother and, assisted by Lleu, enchants the &quot;elementary trees and sedges&quot; to rise up as warriors against Arawn&#x27;s forces. The alder leads the attack, while the aspen falls in battle, and heaven and earth tremble before the oak, a &quot;valiant door keeper against the enemy&quot;. The bluebells combine and cause a &quot;consternation&quot; but the hero is the holly, tinted with green.

A warrior fighting alongside Arawn cannot be vanquished unless his enemies can guess his name. Gwydion guesses the warrior&#x27;s name, identifying him from the sprigs of alder on his shield, and sings two englyns:

:&quot;Sure-hoofed is my steed impelled by the spur;
:The high sprigs of alder are on thy shield

===Native tales===

====The Dream of Macsen Wledig====
This account is so different from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s account of Maximian (as Geoffrey calls him) in Historia regum Britanniae that scholars agree that the Dream cannot be based purely on Geoffrey&#x27;s version. The Dream&#x27;s account also seems to accord better with details in the Triads, so it perhaps reflects an earlier tradition.

Macsen Wledig, the Emperor of Rome, dreams one night of a lovely maiden in a wonderful, far-off land. Awakening, he sends his men all over the earth in search of her. With much difficulty they find her in a rich castle in Britain, daughter of a chieftain based at Segontium (Caernarfon), and lead the Emperor to her. Everything he finds is exactly as in his dream. The maiden, whose name is Helen or Elen, accepts and loves him. Because Elen is found a virgin, Macsen gives her father sovereignty over the island of Britain and orders three castles built for his bride. In Macsen&#x27;s absence, a new emperor seizes power and warns him not to return. With the help of men from Britain led by Elen&#x27;s brother Conanus (Welsh: Kynan Meriadec, French: Conan Meriadoc), Macsen marches across Gaul and Italy and recaptures Rome. In gratitude to his British allies, Macsen rewards them with a portion of Gaul that becomes known as Brittany.

====Lludd and Llefelys====
Another mythological story included in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; is the tale of &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;. Lludd is king of Britain, and his brother, Llefelys, is king of France. Lludd&#x27;s kingdom is beset by three menaces: the Coraniaid, a demonic people who can hear everything; a terrible scream that is heard every May Eve that terrifies the people; and the continual disappearance of the provisions of the king&#x27;s court. Lludd asks Llefelys for help, speaking to him through a brass tube so the Coraniaid can&#x27;t hear. Llefelys creates a potion of crushed insects in water which destroys the Coraniaid when sprinkled on them. The scream, he discovers, comes from two dragons fighting. He gets the dragons drunk on mead and buries them in Dinas Emrys in what is now North Wales. He then overcomes the wizard who is stealing all of Lludd&#x27;s provisions and makes him serve Lludd.

====Hanes Taliesin====
Guest included &quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot; in her translation of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, despite the absence of this tale from the White Book of Rhydderch and the Red Book of Hergest. Subsequent scholarship has identified the tale as post-medieval and it is left out of most modern editions of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Still, elements of the tale predate this presentation. The tale is distinct from the Book of Taliesin, which is a collection of poems attributed to Taliesin.

According to the story, Taliesin began life as Gwion Bach, a servant to the enchantress Ceridwen. Ceridwen had a beautiful daughter and a horribly ugly son named Avagddu (elsewhere known as Morfran). Ceridwen determines to help her son by brewing a magic potion, the first three drops of which will give him the gift of wisdom and inspiration (&quot;awen&quot;). The potion has to be cooked for a year and a day, so Ceridwen enlists a blind man named Morda to tend the fire beneath the cauldron, while Gwion Bach stirs. Three hot drops spill onto Gwion&#x27;s thumb as he stirred, and he instinctively puts his thumb in his mouth, instantly gaining wisdom and knowledge. The first thought that occurs to him is that Ceridwen will kill him, so he runs away.

Soon enough Ceridwen engages Gwion in a transformation chase in which they turn themselves into various animals – a hare and a greyhound, a fish and an otter, and a bird and a hawk. Exhausted, Gwion finally turns himself into a single grain of corn, but Ceridwen becomes a hen and eats him. Ceridwen becomes pregnant, and when she gives birth she throws the child into the ocean in a leather bag. The bag is found by Elffin, son of Gwyddno Garanhir, who sees the boy&#x27;s beautiful white brow and exclaims &quot;dyma dal iesin&quot; (&quot;this is a radiant brow&quot;) Taliesin, thus named, begins to recite beautiful poetry.

Elffin raises Taliesin as his son, and the two become involved in several adventures. In the presence of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, Elffin claims that his wife is as virtuous as the king&#x27;s wife, and that Taliesin is a better bard than the king&#x27;s. Maelgwn locks Elffin up and sends his boorish son Rhun to defile Elffin&#x27;s wife and steal her ring as evidence. However, Taliesin has Elffin&#x27;s wife replaced with a kitchen maid, thus preserving Elffin&#x27;s claim. Taliesin then humiliates Maelgwn&#x27;s bards with his skill, and frees his foster-father.

===Arthurian tales===

====Culhwch and Olwen====

While &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, also found in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, is primarily an Arthurian tale, in which the hero Culhwch enlists Arthur&#x27;s aid in winning the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden the Giant, it is full of background detail, much of it mythological in nature. Characters such as Amaethon, the divine ploughman, Mabon ap Modron, the divine son, and the psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd make appearances, the latter in an endless seasonal battle with Gwythyr ap Greidawl for the hand of Creiddylad. The conditions placed on Culhwch by his mother are similar to those placed on Lleu Llaw Gyffes by Arianrhod, and Culhwch&#x27;s arrival at Arthur&#x27;s court is reminiscent of the Irish god Lug&#x27;s arrival at the court of Nuada Airgetlám in &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;.

====Owain, or The Lady of the Fountain====

The hero of &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;, is based on the historical figure Owain mab Urien. He appears as Ywain in later continental tradition. The romance consists of a hero marrying his love, the Lady of the Fountain, but losing her when he neglects her for knightly exploits. With the aid of a lion he saves from a serpent, he finds a balance between his marital and social duties and rejoins his wife. The narrative is related to Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; French romance &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;.

====Peredur son of Efrawg====

The narrative corresponds to Chrétien&#x27;s romance &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, although, as with the other Welsh romances, scholars still debate the work&#x27;s exact relationship to Chrétien&#x27;s poem. It is possible that this romance preserves some of the material found in Chrétien&#x27;s source. The sequence of some events is altered and many original episodes appear, including the hero&#x27;s 14-year sojourn in Constantinople reigning with the Empress, which contains remnants of a sovereignty tale. The Holy Grail is replaced with a severed head on a platter. Despite the differences, however, the influence of the French romance cannot be discounted, particularly as its first part hardly matches the second.

The hero&#x27;s father dies when he is young, and his mother takes him into the woods and raises him in isolation. Eventually he meets a group of knights and determines to become like them, so he travels to King Arthur&#x27;s court. There he is ridiculed by Cei and sets out on further adventures, promising to avenge Cei&#x27;s insults to himself and those who defended him. While travelling he meets two of his uncles, the first plays the role of Percival&#x27;s Gornemant and educates him in arms and warns him not to ask the significance of what he sees. The second replaces Chrétien&#x27;s Fisher King, but instead of showing Peredur the Holy Grail he reveals a salver containing a man&#x27;s severed head. The young knight does not ask about this and proceeds to further adventure, including a stay with the Nine Witches of Gloucester and the encounter with the woman who was to be his true love, Angharad Golden-Hand. Peredur returns to Arthur&#x27;s court, but soon embarks on another series of adventures that do not correspond to material in Percival (Gawain&#x27;s exploits take up this section of the French work.) Eventually the hero learns the severed head at his uncle&#x27;s court belonged to his cousin, who had been killed by the Nine Witches of Gloucester. Peredur avenges his family, and is celebrated as a hero.

====Geraint son of Erbin====

This narrative corresponds to Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, in which the hero is Erec. The romance concerns the love of Geraint, one of King Arthur&#x27;s men, and the beautiful Enid. The couple marry and settle down together, but rumors spread that Geraint has gone soft. Upset about this, Enid cries to herself that she is not a true wife for keeping her husband from his chivalric duties, but Geraint misunderstands her comment to mean she has been unfaithful to him. He makes her join him on a long and dangerous trip and commands her not to speak to him. Enid disregards this command several times to warn her husband of danger. Several adventures follow that prove Enid&#x27;s love and Geraint&#x27;s fighting ability. The couple is happily reconciled in the end, and Geraint inherits his father&#x27;s kingdom.

====Preiddeu Annwfn====
&quot;The Spoils of Annwfn&quot; is a cryptic early medieval poem of sixty lines found in the Book of Taliesin. The text recounts an expedition to the Otherworld, led by King Arthur, to retrieve a magical cauldron. The speaker relates how he journeyed with Arthur and three boatloads of men into Annwfn, but only seven returned. Annwfn is apparently referred to by several names, including &quot;Mound Fortress,&quot; &quot;Four-Peaked Fortress,&quot; and &quot;Glass Fortress&quot;, though it is possible the poet intended these to be distinct places. Within the Mound Fort&#x27;s walls Gweir, one of the &quot;Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain&quot; known from the Welsh Triads, is imprisoned in chains. The narrator then describes the cauldron of the Chief of Annwn; it is finished with pearl and will not boil a coward&#x27;s food. Whatever tragedy ultimately killed all but seven of them is not clearly explained. The poem continues with an excoriation of &quot;little men&quot; and monks, who lack in various forms of knowledge possessed by the poet.

==Characters==
The Welsh had been Christian for several centuries before their former mythology was written down, and their gods had long been transformed into kings and heroes of the past. Many of the characters who exhibit divine characteristics fall into two rival families, the &quot;Plant Dôn&quot; (&quot;Children of Dôn&quot;) and the &quot;Plant Llŷr&quot; (&quot;Children of Llŷr&quot;).

===Children of Dôn===

Dôn, daughter of Mathonwy, was the matriarch of one family. Her husband is never specifically named.

* Gwydion: A skilled magician and warrior. Appears most prominently in the fourth branch of the Mabinogi, as well as in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;, the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; and several poems in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;.
* Arianrhod: Gwydion&#x27;s main antagonist; Lleu&#x27;s mother. According to one of the Welsh Triads, her father was Beli Mawr (see Family of Beli Mawr).
* Eufydd fab Dôn: A character of whom very little is known; probably a reflex of the Gaulish god Ogmios. Appears in two poems from the Book of Taliesin.
* Gilfaethwy: Appears in &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;, as well as in several French Arthurian tales under the name Griflet filz Do.
* Gofannon: A metalsmith considered to be, like the Irish Goibniu, a reflex of the Gallo-Roman deity Gobannus. He is mentioned in both &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; and &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;; in the latter, he is held responsible for the death of his nephew, Dylan.
* Amaethon: Presumed agricultural deity, mentioned in both &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; and more prominently in &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; in which he is the catalyst of a war between Gwynedd and Annwn.

Other figures associated with the Children of Dôn include:
* Math fab Mathonwy: Dôn&#x27;s brother, a skilled wizard and king of Gwynedd. Appears prominently in the fourth branch of the Mabinogi, as well as in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; and several instances of medieval Welsh verse.
* Dylan ail Don: Firstborn son of Arianrhod, who &quot;took on the nature of the sea&quot; and &quot;swam as well as the best fish that was within.&quot; He was killed by his uncle Gofannon. Appears in &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot; and in the &quot;Death Song of Dylan&quot;, found in the Book of Taliesin.
* Lleu: Arianrhod&#x27;s second son and Dylan&#x27;s twin brother. Appears prominently in the fourth branch of the Mabinogi, which describes his birth, marriage, death, resurrection, and ascension to the throne of Gwynedd, and is also mentioned in the Welsh Triads and in various medieval poems. He is a reflex of the Gaulish deity Lugus and cognate with the Irish god Lugh Lámhfhada.
* Blodeuwedd: A beautiful woman created by Math and Gwydion from flowers as a wife for Lleu, whom she betrayed for her lover, Gronw. Gwydion turned her into an owl for her crimes. Appears in &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;.
* Gronw &quot;the Radiant&quot;: The lord of Penllyn who plotted with Blodeuwedd to kill Lleu. Appears in &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;.
===Children of Llŷr===
Llŷr, the patriarch of the other family, is possibly a borrowing of the Irish sea-god Ler. A foreign origin is further suggested by his epithet &quot;Llediaith&quot; (&quot;half-speech&quot;). His wife was Penarddun. According to the Mabinogion she was the mother of his three children, plus two others by Euroswydd. The &quot;Mabinogi&quot; name her as a daughter of Beli Mawr, though this may be an error for sister. Penarddun and Llŷr&#x27;s children include:
* Brân the Blessed. He appears most prominently in &quot;Branwen ferch Llyr&quot;, in which is a giant and King of Britain. In the text he invades Ireland to come to the aid of his sister, who has suffered abuse at the hands of the Irish king Matholwch. He is killed in battle by a poisoned spear to the foot. His head was buried in London, and guarded Britain from foreign invasion until its unearthing by King Arthur some time later. Also appears frequently in medieval Welsh poetry, as well as in the Welsh Triads and &quot;Cad Goddeu.&quot; John T. Koch has suggested a number of parallels between Brân and the historical Gaulish chieftain, Brennus, who invaded the Balkans in the third century B.C.
** His son Caradog, who is left to defend Britain in his father&#x27;s absence. He is killed when his uncle Caswallawn seizes his father&#x27;s crown.
* Manawydan, Bran&#x27;s younger brother, who fights alongside him in Ireland. He is one of only seven men to survive the final battle, and returns to live in Dyfed with fellow survivor Pryderi. He refuses to make his claim on the British throne which has been usurped by his cousin Caswallawn. He marries Rhiannon in the Third Branch, and rescues Dyfed from the enchantment of the malignant wizard Llwyd ap Cil Coed. He is widely considered to be cognate with the Irish sea god Manannán mac Lir.
* Branwen, The family&#x27;s only daughter. Her abuse at the hands of her husband Matholwch is the catalyst for a catastrophic war between Britain and Ireland which eventually leads to the deaths of three of her brothers, her son and her husband. She dies of a broken heart after witnessing the battle.
** Her infant son Gwern, by Matholwch, who is murdered by his uncle Efnysien.

Other figures associated with the Children of Llŷr include:
* Euroswydd, the father of two other children by Pendarddun.
* His sons Efnysien and Nisien, the former twisted, ruthless and sadistic, and largely responsible for the mutually destructive war against the Irish, the latter kind and gentle. Both are killed in the final battle, Efnysien having sacrificed himself to destroy the Pair Dadeni or &quot;Cauldron of Rebirth&quot;, which was granting the Irish the temporary victory.
* Matholwch: King of Ireland, who married Branwen thus forging an alliance between his people and Bran&#x27;s. His mistreatment of his wife led to the British invasion and the eventual destruction of both nations. His death is never described in the narrative, but is implicit.

===Kingdom of Dyfed===
* Pwyll &quot;Head of Annwn&quot;: King of Dyfed and eponymous hero of the first branch of the Mabinogi. He swaps places with the otherworldly king Arawn for a year, earning his lifelong friendship, and later wins the lady Rhiannon from her suitor Gwawl.
* Rhiannon: Sometimes associated with the horse goddess Epona. Ronald Hutton states that a horse is the only thing they have in common. Following Pwyll&#x27;s death at the end of the first branch, she marries Manawydan, the rightful heir to the throne.
* Pryderi: Pwyll and Rhiannon&#x27;s son, and the king of Dyfed following his father&#x27;s death. He is the only character to appear in every branch, although with varying degrees of prominence. He fights under Brân in Ireland in the second branch, is imprisoned by the magician Llwyd ap Cil Coed, and later rescued by his stepfather Manawydan in the third, and is killed in single combat against Gwydion in the fourth following the theft of his otherworldly pigs at the magician&#x27;s hands. He is often equated with the divine son, Mabon ap Modron.
* Cigfa, wife of Pryderi.
* Teyrnon: The lord of Gwent in the service of Pwyll. He finds the infant Pryderi and raises him as his own, returning him to the Demetian court when he is of age. He is mentioned briefly in &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;.

===Family of Beli Mawr===
Beli Mawr is an ancestor figure mentioned in various sources. Though obscure as a character, several of the many descendants attributed to him figure strongly in Welsh tradition. Works derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; name him as a King of Britain. The Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; name Beli as the father of Penarddun, though this may be a mistake for brother. Beli&#x27;s more prominent children include:
*Arianrhod. Usually said to be a daughter of Dôn, Triad 35 gives Beli as her father. Though no other source connects Arianrhod or her family to that of Beli, Rachel Bromwich notes the triad does not necessarily contradict the Mabinogion tradition.
* Caswallawn fab Beli. In the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, he seizes the throne from Caradog ap Bran during Bran&#x27;s campaigns in Ireland. He appears briefly in the third branch when Manawydan, the rightful claimant, pays homage to him. A large tradition seems to have once surrounded Caswallawn, involving his wars against Julius Caesar and Rome, his love for the maiden Fflur and his eventual departure from Britain with 21,000 men, never to be seen again. Caswallawn is derived from the historical British king Cassivellaunus, who led an alliance of tribes against Caesar in the mid first century.
*Lludd Llaw Eraint and Llefelys, Kings of Britain and Gaul, respectively. In accounts derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth and the tale of &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;, Lludd becomes King of Britain following Caswallawn, and is responsible for rebuilding London and ridding the kingdom of three plagues that afflict the land with the help of his brother. He was probably the influence for Lud son of Heli, a British king who appears in the writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth. He is also known under the name Nudd Llaw Ereint and is a reflex of the Celtic god Nodens. As Nudd, he is the father of several notable figures in Welsh mythology including:
** Gwyn ap Nudd: The ruler of Annwfn, the Welsh otherworld and later Christianised into the king of the fairies, the &quot;tylwyth teg&quot;. He leads the hounds of hell, the Cŵn Annwn on the Wild Hunt, and is intimately associated with Glastonbury Tor. He appears as a member of Arthur&#x27;s court in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, in which he wages war against Gwythyr ap Greidawl for the hand of his sister Creiddylad, takes part in the hunt for Twrch Trwyth and accompanies Arthur to retrieve the blood of Orddu, the witch of the uplands of hell. He appears several times in the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym and is also mentioned in the Black Book of Carmarthen.
** Edern ap Nudd: A member of Arthur&#x27;s retinue. He is defeated by Geraint in &quot;Geraint ac Enid&quot; and command a Danish army in the Battle of Badon against the Saxons in &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy &quot;. He is also named as part of Arthur&#x27;s court in &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;.
** Creiddylad: She is betrothed to Gwythyr ap Greidawl, only to be abducted by her brother Gwyn, thus initiating a war between the two in which Gwyn is victorious. Arthur settles the feud by arranging a duel for her hand every Calan Mai (Kalends of May) until Doomsday.
** Owain ap Nudd: A member of Arthur&#x27;s court, mentioned fleetingly in &quot;Geraint ac Enid&quot;.

==King Arthur==
While Arthurian literature grew to become a broadly European phenomenon, the Welsh can claim the earliest appearances of Arthur. Before Arthur became an international figure, writings and oral tales concerning him were more or less restricted to the Brythonic nations of Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. These tales in turn are divided roughly into Pre-Galfridian Traditions and those of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Wales also contributed to the Arthur of the Romance Tradition after the titular heir became an international sensation.

===Pre-Galfridian texts===
* &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; includes a brief reference of a description of a warrior: &quot;he was no Arthur&quot;
*Several poems of Taliesin: (&quot;The Chair of the Prince&quot;), which refers to &quot;Arthur the Blessed&quot;, (&quot;The Spoils of the Annwn&quot;), which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld, and (&quot;The Elegy of Uthyr Pen[dragon]&quot;), which refers to Arthur&#x27;s valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uthyr that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.
* From The Black Book of Carmarthen: (&quot;What man is the gatekeeper?&quot;) This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei and Bedwyr.
* The Welsh prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection.
* Arthur is referenced numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition; Arthur&#x27;s court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; sometimes substituted for &quot;The Island of Britain&quot; in the formula &quot;Three XXX of the Island of Britain&quot;
* &quot;Historia Britonum&quot;: Chapter 56 discusses twelve battles fought and won by Arthur, here called dux bellorum (war leader) rather than king.
* &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; contains entries on Arthur, Medrod and Merlin (Myrddin): Year 72 (c. 516) The Battle of Badon, in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights and the Britons were victors; Year 93 (c. 537) The Strife of Camlann in which Arthur and Medraut fell [and there was death in Britain and in Ireland.] Text in brackets not in MSS. B or C.; Year 129 (c. 573) The Battle of Arfderydd (Armterid, A; Erderit, B; Arderit, C) [between the sons of Elifer, and Guendoleu son of Keidau; in which battle Guendoleu fell; and Merlin (Merlinus) went mad.] Text in brackets found only in MS. B.
* Several Saints&#x27;s Lives: Arthur features in a number of well known vitae (&quot;Lives&quot;) of post-Roman saints. Life of Saint Gildas, written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan; of Saint Cadoc, written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan; medieval biographies of Carannog, Padarn and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century; a less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the &quot;Legenda Sancti Goeznovii&quot;, which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century; William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;De Gestis Regum Anglorum&quot; and Herman&#x27;s &quot;De miraculis sanctae Mariae Laudunensis&quot;, which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return.

===Geoffrey of Monmouth===
* Prophetiae Merlini: Geoffrey presented a series of apocalyptic narratives as the work of the earlier Merlin who, until Geoffrey&#x27;s book came out, was known as &quot;Myrddin&quot;. The first work about this legendary prophet in a language other than Welsh, it was widely read — and believed — much as the prophecies of Nostradamus were centuries later; John Jay Parry and Robert Caldwell note that the Prophetiae Merlini &quot;were taken most seriously, even by the learned and worldly wise, in many nations&quot;, and list examples of this credulity as late as 1445.
* Historia Regum Britanniae: After the Romans leave, Vortigern comes to power, and invites the Saxons under Hengist and Horsa to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him, and Britain remains in a state of war under Aurelius Ambrosius and his brother Uther Pendragon, assisted by the wizard Merlin. Uther&#x27;s son Arthur defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, but his nephew Modred seizes the throne in his absence. Arthur returns and kills Modred, but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of Avalon, and hands the kingdom to his cousin Constantine. With Arthur gone, the Saxons return, and become more and more powerful. The line of British kings continues until the death of Cadwallader, after which the Saxons become the rulers of Britain.
* Vita Merlini: This is in part Geoffrey&#x27;s retelling of the earlier Myrddin legend from Welsh tradition, but includes numerous other source materials as well, and includes elements of the tradition of saints&#x27; lives as well as the sort of encyclopaedic knowledge of the natural world and the heavens then in vogue at Oxford. The work, Geoffrey&#x27;s only known poem, was written in Latin verse (hexameter).

===Welsh Arthurian romance===
Each of these tales are contained within the modern Mabinogion collection, and are likely based on the romances of Chrétien de Troyes (though it is possible that they may have had a common Celtic source). See the above section on &quot;The Three Romances&quot; in The Mabinogion for details on these tales.

* Owain, or The Lady of the Fountain
* Peredur Son of Efrawg
* Gereint Son of Erbin

==Folklore==

===Mythical creatures===
*Adar Llwch Gwin, giant birds that understand human languages
*Afanc, a lake monster (exact lake varies by the story)
*Bendith y Mamau, another term for the Tylwyth Teg or Welsh fairy folk, translated as Blessings of the Mothers (Mother Goddesses).
*Brenin Llwyd, a silent, ghostly and semi-corporeal figure found in mountainous locations across Wales. The Brenin Llwyd is described as being cloaked in mist and preying on unwary travellers and children.
*Bwbach (plural Bwbachod), a household spirit similar to a brownie or hobgoblin, industrious but mischievous. They are good-natured and expect only a nightly bowl of cream for their services. However, they have a dislike of clergymen and teetotalers, upon whom they will play relentless pranks.
*Bwca, a brownie that will perform housework in return for bread and milk, but if disrespected he may become angry and violent before abandoning the home. Tricking him into revealing his name will also cause him to leave. They are not normally mischievous, but in one tale the bwca had a human friend who was sent off to war and killed. The bwca became distraught and played disruptive pranks until a cunning-man (magician) was brought in to banish him from the house.
*Ceffyl Dŵr, a water horse similar to the Kelpie
*Cewri (Giants), such as Ysbaddaden Bencawr from &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, and Brân from the Four Branches of the Mabinogi.
*Coblynau, little people and mine spirits like the Knocker
*Coraniaid, a mysterious race of beings who plagued the Island of Britain
*Cŵn Annwn, hunting dogs of the Otherworld
*Cyhyraeth, death spirit
*Y Diawl (The Devil) who was said to have built various bridges in Wales (including Devil&#x27;s Bridge, Ceredigion), and to appear to sinners in the form of a horned, black-faced shepherd leading a pack of dogs. Sometimes associated with the bobtailed black sow known as &quot;Yr Hwch Ddu Gwta&quot;.
*Dreigiau (Dragons), the most famous being Y Ddraig Goch.
*Y Dyn Hysbys (The Wise Man), or wizard. These could be clerics, men who learned about medicine and black magic from books, and those who claimed to inherit power from their families and thus could foresee the future, particularly on an &quot;Ysbrydnos&quot;, and give charms to ward off evil.
*Gwiddonod (Witches), old women who could cast spells over people and animals, ride broomsticks through the air, tell fortunes, and use charms to heal and cause diseases. They could take the form of a hare, and could only be killed with a silver bullet. Only Y Dyn Hysbys (The Wise Man) could undo the harm they cause.
*Gwragedd Annwn, beautiful lake maidens.
*Gwyllgi, a large black dog that haunts lonely roads.
*Gwyllion, mountain spirits resembling hags.
*Llamhigyn y Dŵr, winged toad lake creature also known as a water leaper.

*Ysbrydion (spirits), which are more likely to come in contact with humans on an &quot;Ysbrydnos&quot; or &quot;spirit night&quot; (see Calan Gaeaf, Calan Mai)

===Folk narrative===
Includes folk tales, legends, traditions and anecdotes. The &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot; (singular: &quot;cyfarwydd&quot;, &quot;storyteller&quot;), were members of the bardic order in Wales. The only historical &quot;cyfarwydd&quot; known by name is Bledri ap Cydifor (&#x27;Bledericus Walensis&#x27;, &#x27;Bleherus&#x27;).

The &quot;cyfawyddiaid&quot; were considered a learned class with duties and an education that exceeded that of a common poet. They were court officials with extensive training in their art, and often had a close relationship with their lord. Their duties extended to the traditions involved in praising, celebrating and mourning their lord. Welsh folklore includes a number of tales that were preserved and told by the &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot;, who were also tasked with conserving the traditional historical material, the accepted myth of the Welsh past, and sharing the corresponding stories, being considered as historians themselves. Besides storytelling, the &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot; also had the task of protecting the genealogies of the powerful families.

The tales of Welsh lore were shared as proverbs and songs, in addition to simple spoken stories. The historical tales were told along with the non-historical fables, without significant distinction. This allowed culture and history to be explored and taught through the poetics of the time. In earlier periods, the &quot;penceirddiaid&quot; are believed to have narrated stories in the courts of princes and nobles. Later, the stories were told by the &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot; for audiences other than nobility.

The writing of medieval folklore had adopted and explored a set of rules and themes. It relied on the poetic triads of the time, poetics, old verse and knowledge of histories, which enabled the conception of well-crafted stories about the historical truths of the population. Additionally, regions would adopt their own guidelines in storymaking, such as the Triads of the Island of Britain, which led tales to be based on mythological, historical and heroic themes. The writing also followed structure, having a chronological series of events in short episodes, known as features, which reflect the oral origins of the tales for easy story-telling to the audiences.

Welsh folklore was often compared to Irish literature of similar value. They both consisted of similar structure and aimed to inform about the past, rather than to target the mistakes of their ancestry with satire. The form of these tales also mimicked that of early Irish sagas, being prose sprinkled with poetry. Moreover, the conservation of Irish tales was also performed by a class of gentry, much like the &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot; of Wales. However, even with other similar duties, the Irish bards were not story-tellers. That role was saved for the poets in Ireland.

This type of storytelling, in both Ireland and Wales, was believed to have arisen through spiritual inspiration. The poets spoke ‘through’ great knowledge, which was sometimes thought to be acquired only by the practice of divination, a concept known as &quot;ái&quot; in Irish, and &quot;awen&quot; in Welsh. The Welsh &quot;cyfarwyddiaid&quot; were thus considered &quot;awenyddion&quot;, able to deliver prophetic speech in a possessed state of &quot;awen&quot;. This is not the only ritual practice that evolved around Welsh folklore, as other customs have originated from the tales themselves.

Folk tales and legends have also survived through retellings by common people. Storytelling could and does occur in many different forms: &quot;gossip, games, dancing, and the reciting of riddles, tongue-twisters, nursery-rhymes, harp-stanzas, folk-songs and ballads.&quot;
Common occasions for telling folk narratives were the &quot;nosweithiau llawen&quot; (or &quot;merry evenings,&quot; similar to a céilidh), &quot;nosweithiau gwau&quot; (&quot;knitting nights&quot;), and &quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot; (Winter&#x27;s Eve).

====Tales about animals with human characteristics====
The most famous of these are the tales concerning the &quot;Oldest Animals,&quot; in which a character gathers information from different animals until the oldest animal is located.
&quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; lists the Blackbird of Cilgwri, the Stag of Rhedynfre, the Owl of Cwm Cowlyd, the Eagle of Gwernabwy, and the Salmon of Llyn Llyw. The Triad &quot;The Three Elders of the World&quot; lists several of the oldest birds.

====Formula tales====
Including cumulative tales and stories without end.

====Humour about actual persons or types====
Includes White Lie Tales, which are obviously and intentionally untrue. Common elements include the narrator&#x27;s experiences in America, adventures while being carried on wings of a large bird, growing enormous vegetables, prowess at shooting around corners, ability to see over great distances, buying a hare’s egg at Pwllheli Fair. Famous recent authors in this genre are James Wade (Shemi Wad), Daniel Thomas (Daniel y Pant), Gruffydd Jones (Y Deryn Mawr) and John Pritchard (Siôn Ceryn Bach).

====(Pseudo-)histories of notable figures====
*Arthur (see separate section above)
*Twm Siôn Cati, often called the Welsh Robin Hood
*The Lives of Saints, originally written in Latin, and usually stressing a male saint&#x27;s conception, birth and childhood, while emphasizing a female saint&#x27;s adolescence, virginity and sexual conflict (fleeing marriage or rape). These include the &quot;Life of St. David&quot; by Rhygyfarch, and the &quot;Life of Cadog&quot; by Lifris of Llancarfan. The MSS &quot;Cotton Vespasian&quot; Axiv, written around 1200, collects the lives of numerous saints. Another important collection is &quot;The Book of the Anchorite of Llanddewibrefi&quot;.

====Local legends of historical or pseudo-historical figures====
Includes Gwylliaid Cochion Mawddwy, a group of bandits who lived in Merioneth in the 16th century, mentioned in Thomas Pennant&#x27;s &quot;Tours of Wales&quot; and other sources.&lt;br&gt;

Also includes the legend of Gelert, the namesake of the town of Beddgelert (whose name means &quot;Gelert&#x27;s Grave&quot;) in the Gwynedd area of Wales. The folktale is said to take place in the 13th century, and acts as a moral story about making hasty and rash decisions. In the legend, Llywelyn the Great, then-Prince of North Wales returned from hunting to find his baby missing, the cradle overturned, and his faithful hound Gelert with blood-stained fur and teeth. Believing the dog had killed his child and heir, Llywelyn drew his sword and killed Gelert. After the dog&#x27;s dying yelp, Llywelyn heard the cries of his baby, unharmed and behind the cradle, along with a dead wolf which had attacked the child and been killed by Gelert. Llywelyn is overcome with sorrow and buries the dog, traumatised from its dying yelp. After that day, Llywelyn was said to never smile again.

====Place-name or topography tales====
Includes onomastic lore, which explains place-names. One notable example comes from the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot;, in which the name &#x27;Carn Cafal&#x27; is shown to come from a carn (or pile of stones) which mark the footprint of Arthur&#x27;s dog Cafal.

<text>This is a list of minor planets which have been officially named by the Working Group for Small Bodies Nomenclature (WGSBN) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The list consists of partial pages, each covering a number range of 1,000 bodies citing the source after each minor planet was named for. An overview of all existing partial pages is given in section .

Among the hundreds of thousands of numbered minor planets only a small fraction have received a name so far. , there are 24,795 named minor planets out of a total of more than 600,000 numbered ones . Most of these bodies are named for people, in particular astronomers, as well as figures from mythology and fiction. Many minor planets are also named after places such cities, towns, and villages, mountains and volcanoes; after rivers, observatories, as well as organizations, clubs and astronomical societies. Some are named after animals and plants. A few minor planets are named after exotic entities such as supercomputers or have an unknown origin.

The first few thousand minor planets have all been named, with the near-Earth asteroid (4596) 1981 QB currently being the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet. The first 3 pages in the below table contain 1,000 named entries each. The first 13 and 33 pages contain at least 500 and 100 named entries each, respectively. The first range to contain no entries is 307001–308000. There are also several name conflicts with other astronomical objects, mostly with planetary satellites and among themselves.

Following a proposal of the discovering astronomer, new minor planet names are approved and published by IAU&#x27;s WGSBN several times a year. The WGSBN applies a set of rules for naming minor planets. These range from syntax restrictions to non-offensive meanings. Over the years the rules have changed several times. In the beginning, for example, most minor planets were named after female characters from Greek and Roman mythology.

<text>Afgar, or the Andalusian Leisure is a musical with lyrics by Douglas Furber, music by Charles Cuvillier and a book by Fred Thompson and Worton David. It is based on Cuvillier&#x27;s 1909 French operetta of the same name, with words by André Barde and Michel Carré. 

The original West End production opened at the London Pavilion on 17 September 1919 and ran for 300 performances. It featured Marie Burke, Alice Delysia, Strafford Moss, John Humphries, Lupino Lane, Harry Welchman and Leon Morton, and its cast recording was the first original cast recording of a musical at the Pavilion. The Broadway production, directed by Frank Collins, opened on 8 November 1920 at the Central Theatre and ran for 168 performances. It starred Irving Beebee as Don Juan, Jr. and Delysia as Zaydee.

<text>The fifth season of the science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 2, 1997, concluding on the same channel on May 17, 1998, and contained 20 episodes. The season was the last in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; subsequent episodes would be shot in Los Angeles, California. In addition, this was the first season of the show where the course of the story was planned, due to the 1998 &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature film being filmed before it, but scheduled to be released after it aired.

The fifth season of the series focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder&#x27;s (David Duchovny) loss of faith in the existence of extraterrestrials and his partner, Dana Scully&#x27;s (Gillian Anderson), resurgence of health following her bout with cancer. New characters were also introduced, including agents Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) and the psychic Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka). The finale, &quot;The End&quot;, led up to both the 1998 film and the sixth season premiere &quot;The Beginning&quot;.

Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the eleventh most watched television series during the 1997–98 television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it the year&#x27;s highest-rated Fox program as well as the highest rated season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air. Critical reception from television critics was generally positive.

== Plot overview ==
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. At the end of the fourth season, Scully is dying of cancer. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin&#x27;s face to provide a decoy body. In the fifth season opener &quot;Redux&quot;, he uses the distraction to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully&#x27;s cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI. Due to the information he learns from Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), Mulder loses his belief in extraterrestrials.

Later, as a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens. Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his way up in the FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so. Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X-Files; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).

== Production ==

=== Writing ===
Due to the pending release of &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature film, this was the first season where the course of the season was planned in advance, as it had to set up for the film. Originally, the season was supposed to be the show&#x27;s last. In this manner, the finale was originally supposed to have segued the television series into a movie franchise. David Duchovny explained, &quot;we were saying, &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;re going to do five. We&#x27;ll get out of here at five.&#x27; And then five came around, and no one was going anywhere.&quot; The series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the season was created in a way to segue into the 1998 film, as well as the sixth season premiere, &quot;The Beginning&quot;.

=== Filming ===

Due to the necessity of filming reshoots for the upcoming movie, both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are absent in places throughout the season. For instance, the episodes &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot; and &quot;Travelers&quot;—both of which being flashback episodes—do not feature Anderson&#x27;s character Dana Scully at all. In fact, the former was written entirely as a stop-gap episode when the show&#x27;s producers were forced to start production of the fifth season in the last week of August in Vancouver, but still needed series stars Duchovny and Anderson for the filming of &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie in Los Angeles. The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen, and writing duties were assigned to Vince Gilligan. Other episodes such as &quot;Chinga&quot; and &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; feature minimal appearances by Duchovny&#x27;s character Fox Mulder.

The season&#x27;s fifth episode, &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot;, written and directed by Carter, was filmed entirely in black-and-white—in homage to James Whale&#x27;s 1931 film version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The director of photography, Joel Ransom, had to spend longer than usual lighting each scene because of the grayscale. The stormy skies in the episode, added to emulate the atmosphere of old &quot;Frankenstein&quot; movies, were a visual effect. Carter also used a wide-angle camera lens throughout the episode, which forced the actors to act directly to the camera, rather than to each other. According to Carter, it also enabled him to give scenes in the episode a more surreal staging than was usual for the show.

This season finale, &quot;The End&quot;, was the last episode of the series to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada prior to production moving to Los Angeles, although the second film in the franchise, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, released in 2008, was once more filmed in Vancouver. The move was influenced in part by Duchovny, who after five years of filming wanted to be closer to his wife. The audience at the chess match was made up of local fans as a &quot;thank you&quot; to the city for hosting the production during its first five years. The chess match was filmed at Rogers Arena—then known as GM Place—the home of the Vancouver Canucks as well as the Vancouver Grizzlies at the time. While the producers expected five thousand people to show up, twelve thousand appeared. Instructions were given to the crowd by director R. W. Goodwin using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard. During breaks between shooting concession stands, music and videos were made available to the attendees. Actors Duchovny and Anderson also answered questions for the audience and over $20,000 worth of equipment was raffled off. Series creator Chris Carter directed the second unit filming for the episode in order to be with the show&#x27;s Canadian crew members.

=== Crew ===
Carter served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote seven episodes. Frank Spotnitz and John Shiban were both promoted to co-executive producer and wrote seven and five episodes, respectively. Vince Gilligan was promoted to supervising producer and contributed six scripts. Tim Minear joined the series for his only season on the series as an executive story editor and wrote two episodes. Writing team Billy Brown and Dan Angel joined the series as story editors for this season only and provided the story for one episode. Writing team Jessica Scott and Mike Wollaeger wrote one freelance episode. Special guest writers for this season included author Stephen King, who co-wrote one episode with creator Chris Carter, and cyberpunk novelists William Gibson and Tom Maddox, who wrote their first of two episodes for the series. Other producers included producer Joseph Patrick Finn, producer Paul Rabwin, and co-producer Lori Jo Nemhauser who previously served as post-production supervisor.

Producing-director Kim Manners directed the most episodes of the season, directing seven. Producer Rob Bowman, executive producer R. W. Goodwin, and series creator Chris Carter, each directed two episodes. The rest of the episodes were directed by Brett Dowler, Peter Markle, Daniel Sackheim, Ralph Hemecker, Cliff Bole, William A. Graham and Allen Coulter, who each directed one episode.

=== Ratings ===
The fifth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;Redux I&quot; on November 2, 1997. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 16.1, with a 22 share, meaning that roughly 16.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 22 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 27.34 million people, a marked increase from the fourth season&#x27;s finale, &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, which was viewed by 19.85 million viewers. &quot;Redux I&quot; also marked a drastic increase from the fourth season debut, &quot;Herrenvolk&quot;, which garnered 21.11 million viewers. As the season continued, however, ratings began to drop slightly, stabilizing around approximately 20 million viewers-per-episode. The season hit a low with the seventeenth episode, &quot;All Souls&quot;, which was viewed by 13.44 million viewers. The season finale, &quot;The End&quot;, earned a Nielsen rating of 11.9, with an 18 share, and was viewed by 18.76 viewers, marking a 31.4 percent drop in viewers when compared to the season premiere, and a 5.5 percent drop in viewers when compared to the previous season finale. The season ranked as the eleventh most watched television series during the 1997–98 year, with an average of 19.8 million viewers. This made it the highest-rated season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air as well as the highest rated Fox program for the 1997–98 season.

=== Reviews ===
Michael Sauter of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the season an &quot;A−&quot;, writing that it &quot;proves the show was—even then—still at its creative peak (if only for another year or so) and full of surprises&quot;. He praised the new additions to the series&#x27; mythology and concluded that &quot;many stand-alone episodes now look like classics&quot;. Francis Dass, writing for the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, noted that the season was &quot;very interesting&quot; and possessed &quot;some [...] truly inspiring and hilarious&quot; episodes.&quot; Not all seasonal reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; called the season &quot;a mixed bag of episodes&quot;.

The episodes themselves received varied responses from critics. Several were culled out as highlights of the series. &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; was heralded as a classic by several reviewers and was called the finest stand-alone episode produced by the series by another. The episode &quot;Bad Blood&quot; was praised by critics for its mix of horror and comedy. Dass called the episode &quot;an absolute gem&quot; and &quot;the most hilarious &quot;X-Files&quot; episode I have ever seen.&quot; The episode has also appeared on various &quot;Best-Of&quot; lists of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Other episodes fared worse. &quot;Schizogeny&quot; was derided by critics: &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Emily VanDerWerff noted that the episode &quot;might be the very worst episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;&quot; &quot;Chinga&quot;, written by Stephen King, was criticized for having a poor story. Vitaris called the entry &quot;a major disappointment&quot; and wrote that it &quot;isn&#x27;t scary in the least&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The fifth season earned the series a record of sixteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most a single season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; received. It won two of the awards it was nominated for–Outstanding Art Direction for a Series for &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; and Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Series for &quot;Kill Switch&quot;. The series received its fourth consecutive nomination for Outstanding Drama Series. David Duchovny received his second consecutive nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, while Gillian Anderson received her third nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, which she won the previous year. Lili Taylor and Veronica Cartwright both received nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. The episode &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; received multiple nominations, with the exception of its single win, it was also nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Chris Carter), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Chris Carter), Outstanding Cinematography for a Series (Joel Ransom), Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Mark Snow), Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Series (Lynne Willingham), and Outstanding Makeup for a Series. Other nominations were for Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Series for &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series for &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;. The series also won its third and final Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, while Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny received nominations in the television series drama acting categories.

<text>The sixth season of the science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 8, 1998, concluding on the same channel on May 16, 1999, and consisted of twenty-two episodes. The season continued from the 1998 feature film and focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully&#x27;s (Gillian Anderson) separation from the X-Files Division and the demise of the Syndicate—a &quot;shadow government&quot; group attempting to cover up the existence of extraterrestrials—in the two-part episode &quot;Two Fathers&quot; and &quot;One Son&quot;.

The season was the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after production was moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This move was done largely at the behest of Duchovny, who wished to be closer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, although series director Kim Manners and Anderson approved of it, although to a less-vocal degree than Duchovny. The first half of the season also saw Mimi Rogers and Chris Owens&#x27; characters—Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender, respectively—become recurring characters.

Despite debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twelfth most watched television series during the 1998–99 television year, the season saw a slight decrease in ratings from the previous one, a trend that would continue until its final year. The season received mixed to positive reviews from television critics; some critics and fans were alienated by the show, due to the different tone taken by most standalone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the previous style of &quot;monsters of the week&quot;, they were often romantic, humorous, or a combination of both.

== Plot overview ==
In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica. Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that he and Scully have been denied reassignment to the division. Mulder goes to his former basement office, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned to the X-Files. Going against orders, Mulder and Scully track down an escaped alien in Phoenix, Arizona while Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) gives chase. Mulder and Scully eventually discover that Cigarette Smoking Man has been using Gibson Praise to locate the creature. Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood. Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner&#x27;s system in order to achieve his goals.

Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee and mother of Jeffrey Spender. Skinner takes Spender to the scene, where Cassandra asks for Mulder. She informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth. She claims that a rebel force of aliens are mutilating their faces to prevent infection by the black oil. Cigarette Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Cassandra later escapes from a hospital and arrives at Mulder&#x27;s apartment, demanding that he shoot her because she is the embodiment of fifty years of work by the Syndicate—an alien-human hybrid that will trigger colonization if the aliens learn of her existence.

Fowley arrives and forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a CDC facility at Fort Marlene. There, Mulder runs into Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Marita tells Mulder that she was subjected to Syndicate-run black oil vaccine tests. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a checkpoint, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra; Cigarette Smoking Man and Fowley escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by Cigarette Smoking Man.

Several months later, a metallic artifact with inscriptions is discovered on the beach of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder&#x27;s condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
After five successful seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, series creator Chris Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film: the 1998 &quot;X-Files&quot; movie. The film grossed US$83,898,313 in the US and $105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of $189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned $30,138,758 which was 35.9% of its total gross. Initially, the fifth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; was supposed to be the show&#x27;s last. However, the series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the sixth season of the show began filming.

=== Development ===

After five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, production of &quot;The X-Files&quot; moved to Los Angeles. &quot;The Beginning&quot; was the first episode of the series to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. The move was instigated by David Duchovny, who portrayed Mulder, in order to increase his opportunity to find movie work as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move; others, like series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move but were less vocal than Duchovny. Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California. According to Andy Meisler, &quot;The very first shot of the season, a long look directly into a bright sun shining on a barren desert, was designed to boldly announce the show&#x27;s arrival in Southern California.&quot; As a result of the move, the episode featured a largely new group of crew members, hired by Carter, Frank Spotnitz and new co-executive producer Michael Watkins; this necessitated the show&#x27;s new crewmembers spending five weeks, receiving, unpacking, and cataloging filming material from their Vancouver counterparts. Because of the shift from Vancouver to Los Angeles, some fans of the series were alienated. Many accused the show of &quot;Hollywood-izing&quot; the series by adding notable guest stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for larger audiences. According to Space.com, a number of fans of the show specifically loved &quot;the moody ambiance filming around Vancouver lent the series [during seasons 1–5]&quot;, which the sixth season reportedly lacked.

The move to Los Angeles also meant a drastic price increase for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, &quot;At the time, the exchange rate between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody told me that the cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved&quot;. In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained &quot;everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. […] It became apparent very quickly to me that we were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding in the middle of the woods&quot;.

=== Crew ===
Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote five episodes. Spotnitz was promoted to executive producer and wrote five episodes, and wrote the story for a further two episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote seven episodes. John Shiban was promoted to producer and wrote six episodes, and wrote the story for one other episode. New writers in the sixth season included David Amann who joined as executive story editor and wrote two episodes, and Jeffrey Bell who also wrote two episodes. Freelance episodes were written by Daniel Arkin and Jim Guttridge, and a further episode was written by Ken Hawryliw, who was the series&#x27; property master from 1993 to 1998. Duchovny also wrote his first episode solo, as he previously collaborated with various writers, including Chris Carter, on three other episodes. Other producers included producer Paul Rabwin, co-producer Lori Jo Nemhauser, and Bernadette Caulfield who joined as producer.

Producing-directors for the show included producer Rob Bowman, producer Manners, co-executive producer Michael Watkins, and consulting producer Daniel Sackheim, who together directed the bulk of the season&#x27;s episodes. Manners directed seven episodes, Bowman directed six, Watkins directed three, and Sackheim directed one. Series creator Chris Carter directed two episodes, while cast member David Duchovny directed his first episode of the series. The remaining two episodes were directed by Peter Markle and Bryan Spicer.

=== Ratings ===
The sixth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;The Beginning&quot; on November 8, 1998. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 11.9, with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 11.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was viewed by 20.34 million people, a marked increase from the fifth season&#x27;s finale, &quot;The End&quot;, which was viewed by 18.76 million viewers. However, the debut marked a drastic decrease from the fifth season debut, &quot;Redux&quot;, which garnered 27.34 million viewers. As the season continued, ratings continued to drop. The last episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to reach over 20 million viewers was &quot;The Rain King&quot;, which attracted 21.24 million. The season hit its nadir with the eighteenth episode, &quot;Milagro&quot;, which was viewed by 15.20 million viewers. The season finale, &quot;Biogenesis&quot;, earned a Nielsen rating of 9.4, with a 14 share, and was viewed by 15.86 million viewers, marking a 22 percent drop in viewers when compared to the season premiere, and a 15.5 percent drop in viewers when compared to the previous season finale. The season ranked as the twelfth most watched television series during the 1998–1999 season, with an average of 16.39 million viewers.

=== Reviews ===
The season received positive reviews from television critics. However some fans were alienated by the show in its sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the previous style of &quot;monsters of the week&quot;, they were often romantic, humorous, or a combination of both. Several episodes—&quot;Dreamland&quot; and &quot;The Rain King&quot; in particular—were criticized for their reliance on humor or for their lighter stories. Fans on the internet began calling the less-scary episodes &quot;&quot;X-Files&quot; Lite&quot;. Other episodes were derided for their mediocrity. Paula Vitaris from &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; called the episode &quot;Alpha&quot; a &quot;run-of-the-mill monster-of-the-week episode&quot;. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book &quot;Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen&quot;, called the episode &quot;Trevor&quot; &quot;&quot;The X-Files&quot; at its most generic&quot;.

However, not all the sixth-season episodes were poorly received. The season&#x27;s third episode, &quot;Triangle&quot; was largely lauded as a masterpiece by critics. The episode, which was shot in real time to look like it was filmed in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes, was called a &quot;classic&quot; standalone episode and one of the &quot;highlights of season six&quot;. The &quot;Two Fathers&quot;/&quot;One Son&quot; story-arc, which featured the destruction of the Syndicate, was called one &quot;of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series&#x27; run&quot; by one critic. Finally, the Duchovny-penned &quot;The Unnatural&quot;, which featured the story of an alien who fell in love with baseball, was praised by critics for its plot, directing, and originality. One review praised Duchovny&#x27;s directing &quot;excellence&quot; while another referred to its ending as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The sixth season earned the series eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with one win. It won for Outstanding Makeup for a Series for the episodes &quot;Two Fathers&quot; and &quot;One Son&quot;. Gillian Anderson received her fourth and final nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and Veronica Cartwright received her second consecutive nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Other nominations included Bill Roe for Outstanding Cinematography for a Series, Mark Snow for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore), Heather MacDougall for Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Series, Outstanding Art Direction for a Series, and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series. This was the final season the series received Golden Globe nominations, with Gillian Anderson, David Duchovny and the series as a whole receiving nominations.

<text>The seventh season of the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999, concluded on May 21, 2000, and consists of twenty-two episodes. This season marks the end of various story lines; during this season, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) learned the true fate of his sister, Samantha.

Before the broadcasting for the season began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his decision to leave the show. As a result, the season would be the last to feature Duchovny in a full-time capacity until the show&#x27;s tenth season (which aired in 2016), although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. Due to this eventual character change, this season would be the last to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the intro was updated for the eighth season in an attempt to renew and revive the series.

The seventh-season premiere &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot;, debuted with a Nielsen rating of 10.6 and was viewed by 17.82 million viewers, marking a noticeable drop in viewership since the sixth season. The series fell from number 12 to number 29 for the 1999–2000 television year. Critically, the show&#x27;s seventh season received mixed to positive reviews; many reviewers felt that the show still produced good episodes, but that it was the weakest of the Duchovny and Anderson seasons of the show.

== Plot overview ==
After the events of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately attempting to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley&#x27;s (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.

While investigating a bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder becomes obsessed with the number of children who have vanished in similar circumstances. Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister&#x27;s disappearance. At the same time it is revealed to him that his mother, Teena Mulder (Rebecca Toolan), committed suicide. He then tries to prove that his mother did not take her own life, but is ultimately forced to accept that his mother&#x27;s death was by her own hand. He is led by a man whose son disappeared years earlier to another truth—that his sister may be among the souls taken by &quot;walk-ins&quot;, saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. Together they locate evidence that proves that Samantha was abducted by Cigarette Smoking Man and was forced to live in a now-abandoned US Army base. It is later revealed that Samantha had become a &quot;walk-in&quot; spirit.

Mulder and Scully investigate a case which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together. With a series of Alien abductions taking place, Mulder and Scully are contacted by Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley). Scully falls ill during the investigation and returns to Washington, D.C. Cigarette Smoking Man contacts Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), in an attempt to revive the government conspiracy. With Covarrubias unwilling to assist, and Krycek seeking revenge, they contact Mulder after he visits an alien crash site. Skinner and Mulder return to Oregon, while Scully is hospitalized in Washington, D.C. Mulder becomes trapped by an alien device, and is abducted by an Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson) together with Miles and several others. Skinner returns to Washington, D.C., where Scully informs him that she is pregnant, though she does not tell him that Mulder is the father.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
After five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, production of &quot;The X-Files&quot; moved to Los Angeles. &quot;The X-Files&quot;″ sixth season was the first season of the show to be filmed in the new location. The move was instigated by Duchovny in order to facilitate his work in films as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California. Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew, both series director Kim Manners and Anderson supported the move, although less vocally than Duchovny. Many fans accused the show of &quot;Hollywood-izing&quot; by adding notable guests stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for mass audiences. Furthermore, the move to Los Angeles also meant a drastic increase in production costs.

=== Development ===

Originally, the mythology for season seven was supposed to continue from and show the ramifications of the &quot;Two Fathers&quot;/&quot;One Son&quot; story arc. Frank Spotnitz, in an interview, explained that the mythology episodes for season seven would feature &quot;characters you saw in &#x27;One Son&#x27; coming back&quot; and explore &quot;what happens now that the conspiracy has been destroyed, what are the politics of the new landscape that exists. […] There are aliens from outer space, two different races that are warring with each other.&quot; In addition, he said that the then-planned series finale would feature &quot;the big idea that Chris [Carter] had in the beginning.&quot; However, these ideas never came to pass, and the season finale, &quot;Requiem&quot;, segued directly into the eighth season premiere &quot;Within&quot;. Duchovny later revealed that, had the show ended, the final three episodes would have been devoted to the myth-arc.

While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, &quot;There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day.&quot; Because the show&#x27;s producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, &quot;Millennium&quot; was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, &quot;Closure&quot;, features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show&#x27;s producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show&#x27;s biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, &quot;It&#x27;s been seven years. I don&#x27;t think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away.&quot; As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, &quot;we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful.&quot;

The season also saw several of the show&#x27;s cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson directed and wrote her first episode of the series, &quot;all things&quot;. Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a &quot;deeply personal X-File, one which in [she] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her&quot;. Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote a majority of the story in one sitting. She explained, &quot;A certain concept began to form, [and] I just wrote the entire outline for &#x27;all things&#x27; right then and there. It all just kind of came together on the page&quot;. The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the &quot;personal and quiet&quot; characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, &quot;En Ami&quot;. Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the &quot;En Ami&quot; as &quot;the creepiest episode of the year.&quot;

=== Lawsuit ===
Before the season aired, David Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox. Duchovny claimed that Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Originally, in the contract, Duchovny was eligible for an estimated five percent, but, according to him, he &quot;had seen only a fraction&quot; of the money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about $20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny&#x27;s professional relationships. Although his lawsuit never called Chris Carter a defendant, their friendship was notably impacted. One anonymous source noted that &quot;the whole lawsuit thing revealed that Carter knew (Duchovny) was getting screwed and didn&#x27;t warn him. Carter proved where his loyalties lay with his actions.&quot;

Neither Carter nor Duchovny were contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of &quot;Requiem&quot;, Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, &quot;I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor.&quot; Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder&#x27;s place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess &quot;ridiculous.&quot;

=== Crew ===
Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote six episodes. Spotnitz continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes. Vince Gilligan continued as co-executive producer and wrote six episodes. John Shiban was promoted to supervising producer and wrote two episodes. David Amann was promoted to co-producer and wrote two episodes. Jeffrey Bell was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. Cyberpunk novelists William Gibson and Tom Maddox returned to write their second of two episodes for the series. Cast member Duchovny wrote two episodes in the season, while other cast members Anderson and Davis also wrote an episode each. New writers in the seventh season included Steven Maeda and Greg Walker, who wrote one episode; and Chip Johannessen who wrote a single freelance episode. Other producers included Paul Rabwin, Harry V. Bring and Bernadette Caulfield, and Michelle MacLaren who joined as co-executive producer.

Producing-directors for the show included producer Rob Bowman, supervising producer Manners, and co-executive producer Michael Watkins, who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Bowman directed two episodes for his final season on the series, Manners directed seven, and Watkins directed three. Cast members David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson each directed one episode. Series creator Chris Carter directed a single episode, while series writer Vince Gilligan made his television directorial debut. Other directors for the season included Thomas J. Wright who directed three episodes, with Robert Lieberman, Cliff Bole, and Paul Shapiro each directing one.

=== Ratings ===
The seventh season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; debuted with &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; on November 7, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.6, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned into the episode. The episode was viewed by 17.82 million people, an increase from the sixth season&#x27;s finale, &quot;Biogenesis&quot;, which was viewed by 15.86 million viewers. However, the debut marked a decrease from the sixth season debut, &quot;The Beginning&quot;, which garnered 20.34 million viewers. As the season continued, however, ratings began to drop. The season hit a low with the eighteenth episode, &quot;Brand X&quot;, which was viewed by 10.81 million viewers. The season finale, &quot;Requiem&quot;, earned a Nielsen rating of 8.9, with a 14 share, and was viewed by 15.26 million viewers, marking a 14 percent drop in viewers when compared to the season premiere, and a 4 percent drop in viewers when compared to the previous season finale. The series was ranked at number 29 during the 1999–2000 television season, finishing with an average of 14.2 million viewers.

During 2000, companies were paying Fox $225,000 for every 30-second spot that would air between acts of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Many Information technology (IT) companies were buying commercials during the show, largely due to the fact that &quot;many [&#x27;coders IT geeks&#x27;] get their weekly fix of science fiction from this prime-time show.&quot;

=== Reviews ===
The seventh season received moderately positive reviews from critics, although increasingly critical reviews were more common this season. While critics enjoyed many of the episodes, many also felt that, as a whole, the season was the weakest of the show&#x27;s original seven. Eric Mink of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised the season, noting that it was &quot;proof that &quot;The X-Files&quot; still has more than enough creative life in it to justify an eighth season&quot;. He called many of the stand-alone episodes &quot;wonderfully creepy&quot; and noted that the season possessed a &quot;terrific bunch of episodes&quot;. Thomas Doherty from &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; gave the season a mixed review and noted that the series was hurt by the partnership between Mulder and Scully &quot;settl[ing] into the comfortable groove of a modern two career marriage—supportive, professionally rewarding, and utterly sexless.&quot; Further, he noted that &quot;the most entertaining episode lately have been the self parodies, where killer cockroaches scurry and living dead roam, or where (in the Duchovny written and directed episode) Scully and Mulder are played by Téa Leoni and Garry Shandling in a motion picture only slightly more ludicrous than a 1998 motion picture called &quot;The X-Files&quot;.&quot; Doherty argued that the &quot;self-parody&quot; style of the series caused viewers to not take it seriously anymore, explaining that, &quot;No longer going for the big chill, Carter and company are winking at their audience, as if to say: even we can&#x27;t pretend to believe in this muddled mishmash anymore.&quot; Tom Kessenich, in his book &quot;Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files&quot;, was positive towards the first half of the season, but soon saw the episodes in more of a negative light. He wrote, &quot;A season that began with such hope ended with a sense of sorrow given the end result of the season-long backstage wheeling and dealing [a reference to David Duchovny&#x27;s lawsuit]. Not even the magnificent season finale […] could erase the nagging doubts I had that a series that had been so amazing for so long would soon embark upon a new course wrought with pitfalls and turmoil.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that while the first eight seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot; were &quot;good-to-great&quot;, the seventh season of the show was &quot;flagging&quot; and possessed &quot;significant problems.

The episodes themselves received a variety of reviews. Some were positively received: several reviews praised the episode &quot;X-Cops&quot;, the show&#x27;s highly promoted cross-over with the police reality show &quot;COPS&quot;. One review from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called the outing &quot;exceptionally clever&quot; whereas Starpulse named the episode the funniest of the series. The Duchovny-penned &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; was praised for its self-reflexive comedy by several reviews. Other episodes were more harshly received. Anderson&#x27;s writing debut, &quot;all things&quot; was critiqued for being &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;heavy-handed&quot;. &quot;Brand X&quot;, on the other hand, was called &quot;a waste of an episode.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The seventh season earned the series six Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with three wins. The episode &quot;First Person Shooter&quot; won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The episode &quot;Theef&quot; won for Outstanding Makeup for a Series. Other nominations included Mark Snow for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) for &quot;Theef&quot;, the episode &quot;First Person Shooter&quot; for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, and &quot;Rush&quot; for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The series, as well as Gillian Anderson, won a Teen.com Entertainment Award for Best Drama Series and Best Actress in a Series, respectively. Other nominations included two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, an Environmental Media Awards nomination for &quot;Brand X&quot;, and an International Monitor Award nomination for &quot;Rush&quot;.

<doc id="940070" wikidata="Q3469108" url="?curid=940070" title="The X-Files season 8">
<text>The eighth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing in the United States on November 5, 2000, concluded on May 20, 2001, and consisted of twenty-one episodes. Season eight takes place after Fox Mulder&#x27;s (David Duchovny) alien abduction in the seventh season. The story arc for the search of Mulder continues until the second half of the season, while a new arc about Dana Scully&#x27;s (Gillian Anderson) pregnancy is formed. This arc would continue, and end, with the next season. The season explores various themes such as life, death, and belief.

For this season, Duchovny elected to return only as an intermittent main character; he appears in twelve episodes, most of which take place in the second half of the season. Actor Robert Patrick was hired as a replacement for Mulder, playing John Doggett. The season also marked the first appearance of Annabeth Gish as Monica Reyes, who would become a main character in the ninth season. In addition to the cast change, series creator Chris Carter updated the opening credits, which had remained unchanged since the first season.

Season eight was received well by critics but was less warmly received by fans, many of whom were unhappy that Duchovny reduced his role and that Patrick took over as co-lead alongside Anderson. Ratings for the season were initially strong, but it eventually averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season&#x27;s 14.2 million. Concurrent with the airing of this season, Carter and &quot;The X-Files&quot; production team created and aired a short-lived spinoff titled &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;.

== Plot overview ==

At the end of the seventh season finale, &quot;Requiem&quot;, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) was abducted by aliens. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) meets Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to conduct a search for Mulder. Although the search ultimately proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X-Files and works with Scully to look for explanations to several cases. When Scully learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy and fears for her unborn child.

Doggett introduces Scully to Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder&#x27;s deceased body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder&#x27;s funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is threatened by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) that he must kill Scully&#x27;s baby before it is born. Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley), a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity.

Reluctantly accepting Krycek&#x27;s assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government has replaced several humans, including Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien &quot;Super Soldiers&quot;. Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonisation of Earth. They have learned that Scully&#x27;s baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be greater than them. They have only recently learned of the baby&#x27;s importance, which is why Krycek told Skinner to kill the unborn child earlier. When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes, who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after Skinner kills Krycek, Scully delivers an apparently normal baby, while the alien super soldiers surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment.

=== Themes ===
The eighth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; takes place in a science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy, in this case, the alien Colonists. The first episode of the season, &quot;Within&quot; explores &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;loneliness&quot; and &quot;pain&quot; after the disappearance of Mulder. &quot;Per Manum&quot; included basic themes common in the series, such as &quot;dark, foreboding terror&quot;, an &quot;overriding sense of paranoia&quot;, and &quot;the fear of the unknown&quot;, among others. Later on, death and resurrection emerged as a major sub-theme during the season, starting with &quot;The Gift&quot;, wherein John Doggett is killed and resurrected, and later in &quot;Deadalive&quot; when Mulder is brought back to life after apparently being dead for three months. This sub-theme would continue well into the ninth season. The main story arc of the season dealt with the idea that, at times, humanity is a greater danger to itself. This theme is made manifest by the Syndicate and the human conspiracy with the aliens.

== Production ==

=== Development ===

The series&#x27; original title sequence, crafted in 1993 during the show&#x27;s first season had remained unchanged for seven seasons. With the partial loss of Duchovny after the seventh-season finale, the decision was made to update the credits, which were first featured in the premiere episode of season eight, &quot;Within&quot;. The opening sequence now included new images, updated FBI badge photos for Duchovny and Anderson, and the addition of Patrick to the main cast. Duchovny&#x27;s badge features in the opening credits only when he appears in an episode. The opening contains images of Scully&#x27;s pregnancy and, according to Frank Spotnitz, shows an &quot;abstract&quot; explanation for Mulder&#x27;s absence in this season, with him falling into an eye.

After the partial departure of Duchovny, Carter decided to focus almost solely on the character of Doggett during the first half of the season. This led to some unhappiness from the cast and critics, most notably Duchovny and Anderson. According to Tom Kessenich in his book &quot;Examinations&quot;, Anderson reportedly &quot;wasn&#x27;t thrilled&quot; with the lack of attention her character was getting; instead, the writers were crafting episodes solely for Doggett because he was the show&#x27;s new &quot;voice&quot;. Duchovny, on the other hand, was unhappy because Mulder&#x27;s abduction was never properly examined. Reportedly, Duchovny offered to write and direct an episode based around the concept of Mulder being trapped in the alien spaceship, as seen in the season opener &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;Without&quot;. Carter, however, nixed the idea because &quot;it was not about Doggett.&quot;

Frank Spotnitz recalled that he and Chris Carter were enthusiastic about the storytelling opportunities offered by the changing line-up, saying: &quot;Suddenly it was this new toolbox, these new characters, these new actors, these new dynamics to play, and the storytelling really changed in those last two seasons and was really exciting for us to get to, to explore you know, your characters and the kinds of stories we could tell with you that we’d never could have or would have told with, with just Mulder and Scully in the show.&quot; He compared the tone to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

=== Casting ===

The show&#x27;s seventh season was a time of closure for &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Characters within the show were written out—including Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and Mulder&#x27;s mother (Rebecca Toolan)—and several plot threads were resolved, including the fate of Fox Mulder&#x27;s sister Samantha. Furthermore, after settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit the show. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny&#x27;s departure, and Carter penned &quot;Requiem&quot;, the finale episode of the seventh season, as a possible series finale. However, at the last minute, a new season was ordered and Duchovny agreed to star part-time, returning for 12 episodes instead of 21. Due to this change, the producers found it difficult to write Duchovny&#x27;s character out of the script, but also eventually explain Mulder&#x27;s absence if there were to be an upcoming season. Eventually, it was decided to have the character abducted by aliens.

Hoping to continue the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: John Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell (who played Wayne Weinsider in a previous episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;) were considered for the role, but the producers eventually choose Robert Patrick. The season also introduced Monica Reyes (portrayed by Annabeth Gish), who would become a main character in the following season.

=== Crew ===
Chris Carter, who also served as executive producer and showrunner during the season, wrote or co-wrote the bulk of the episodes for the season, with nine of the twenty one episodes. Of the nine, four were co-written with executive producer Frank Spotnitz. Carter also wrote five episodes solo, and Spotnitz wrote four episodes solo. The rest of the writing staff contributed one or two episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to executive producer and wrote one episode. John Shiban was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote one episode. David Amann was promoted to producer and wrote one episode. Jeffrey Bell was promoted to executive story editor and wrote one episode. Greg Walker was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. Steven Maeda was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. Daniel Arkin, who wrote a freelance episode for the series previously, returned to contribute to the story for one episode.

Kim Manners was promoted to co-executive producer and directed the most of episodes of the season with seven. Directors who directed multiple episodes for the season included Tony Wharmby who directed four, Rod Hardy directed three, and Richard Compton directed two. Peter Markle, Terrence O&#x27;Hara, and Barry K. Thomas each directed one episode. Carter directed a single episode, while writer Spotnitz made his directorial debut.

=== Ratings ===

Reportedly, Patrick was cast due to the hopes that his featured role in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. Early on, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick&#x27;s casting. &quot;Within&quot;, the season&#x27;s first episode, earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.5, meaning that it was seen by 9.5% of the nation&#x27;s estimated households. The episode was viewed by 15.87 million viewers, which marked an 11% decrease from the seventh season opener, &quot;The Sixth Extinction.&quot; The highest-rated episode of the season was &quot;This is Not Happening&quot;, which was viewed by 16.9 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode of the series, in terms of viewers, since &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot;. The season finale, &quot;Existence&quot;, earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.4, meaning that it was seen by 8.4% of the nation&#x27;s estimated households. The episode was watched by 14 million viewers, overall. The nine episodes of the season that did not feature Mulder averaged only 13 million viewers, whereas the twelve episodes that did feature Mulder averaged 13.93 million viewers, almost a difference of one million. The season averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season&#x27;s 14.2 million.

During 2000, companies were paying Fox $225,000 for every 30-second spot that would air between acts of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Many Information technology (IT) companies were buying commercials during the show, largely due to the fact that &quot;many [&#x27;coders IT geeks&#x27;] get their weekly fix of science fiction from this prime-time show.&quot;

=== Reviews ===
The show&#x27;s eighth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that the first eight seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot; were &quot;good-to-great&quot;, and that the eighth season of the show was &quot;revitalized by the new &#x27;search for Mulder&#x27; story-arc.&quot; John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions gave the season a favorable review, calling it &quot;great&quot; and describing its episodes as &quot;pretty strong&quot;. Collin Polonowonski of DVD Times said that the season included &quot;more hits than misses overall&quot; but was throughout negative about the mythology episodes claiming them to be the &quot;weakest&quot; episodes in the season. Many critics eventually accepted Doggett&#x27;s character. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that most fans had &quot;accepted&quot; the introduction of the character and further stated that he actually looked &quot;Like a Secret Service Agent.&quot; Carter commented on the character, saying &quot;Everybody likes Robert Patrick and the character&quot;, but further stating that the fans &quot;miss&quot; Duchovny&#x27;s character, Mulder. Dave Golder of &quot;SFX&quot; called Patrick &quot;superb&quot; and noted that his entrance in the series &quot;inject[ed] a sense of pragmatism and good old-fashioned plain-speaking in to the show which we didn&#x27;t realise was missing until we got it.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Ken Tucker said that Patrick&#x27;s portrayal of Doggett was &quot;hardboiled alertness&quot;, giving mostly positive reviews about his inclusion. Cynthia Littleton of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described the season as the show&#x27;s &quot;swan song&quot;.

Not all reviews were positive. Jesse Hassenger from PopMatters gave a negative review to the season, claiming that Patrick was mis-cast and calling David Duchovny&#x27;s appearances as Fox Mulder shallow. Golder criticized the season for &quot;recycling plots with gusto&quot; and for featuring Mulder falling into Scully&#x27;s eye in the opening credits, noting that it &quot;gives Duchovny too much of a lingering presence on the show, reinforcing prejudices against Patrick as some kind of &#x27;imposter&#x27;.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;This Is Not Happening&quot; was nominated for an American Society of Cinematographers award for cinematography. Robert Patrick won a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Television Actor&quot; in 2001 for his role as Doggett, that year Gillian Anderson was nominated in the category &quot;Best Actress on Television&quot; and the series itself was nominated in the category &quot;Best Network Television Series&quot; in the Saturn Awards, but failed to win. Anderson was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award the very same year in the category &quot;Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series&quot;. &quot;The X-Files&quot; won its last Emmy Award with &quot;Deadalive&quot;, and Bill Roe received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series&quot;.

<text>Abraham the Great of Kashkar was the father of the Assyrian monastic revival in the 6th century. He is a doctor and saint of the Church of the East.

He was born in Kashkar in Persia around 492. He left there to preach the Gospel at Al-Hirah, leaving there to study monastic life at Scetes.

Monasticism was very popular in early Syrian and Mesopotamian Christianity. Some held the view that only a life of celibacy could lead to salvation. Initially, all monks and nuns were hermits, but in about 350 Mar Awgin founded the first cenobitic monastery of Mesopotamia on Mount Izla above the city Nisibis, patterned upon the Egyptian model. Soon there were many monasteries.

But at the synod of Beth Lapat the Church of the East decided that all monks and nuns should marry.
Obviously, this was in order to please the Zoroastrian rulers, who held family life sacred.
The decision severely weakened the church. The decision was reverted in 553.

In 571 Abraham founded and governed a new monastery on Mt. Izla. This became the famous monastery called the &quot;Great Convent&quot;. The rules he established in 571 were published with those of Dadisho, his successor (588-604).

Abraham died in 586.

The third abbot of this monastery was his student Babai the Great (551–628), who succeeded Mar Dadisho. Born to a family of humble means, Abraham&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on the 6th Friday after Epiphany.

<doc id="940072" wikidata="Q1758366" url="?curid=940072" title="The X-Files season 9">
<text>The ninth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; commenced airing in the United States on November 11, 2001, concluded on May 19, 2002, and consists of twenty episodes. The season takes place after Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) goes into hiding, following the events of the eighth season finale, &quot;Existence&quot;. As such, the main story arc for the season follows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) on their hunt to reveal a government conspiracy involving the elaborate and malevolent creation of &quot;Super Soldiers&quot;.

After only appearing intermittently in the preceding season, Duchovny chose not to return; however, following the series&#x27; cancelation he appeared in the finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;. Anderson also intended to leave the show prior to its cancelation. Doggett and Reyes accordingly became the show&#x27;s central characters, and former recurring character Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) became a main character.

Season nine received mixed reviews from critics and garnered a negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers, partially due to Duchovny&#x27;s absence. During this year, ratings for the season fell dramatically. Critics blamed it on what they considered an increasingly incoherent story arc, while the cast and crew ascribed the drop in viewership to the September 11 attacks. Regardless, Fox eventually decided to cancel the series.

During the airing of season eight, Carter and &quot;The X-Files&quot; production team created and aired a spinoff titled &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;. The show was unsuccessful and was canceled before any story arcs were resolved, but &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; was written to give closure to the series. The &quot;X-Files&quot; storyline was continued with the 2008 theatrical film &quot;The X Files: I Want to Believe&quot; and later with a tenth season in 2016 and an eleventh season in 2018.

== Plot overview ==

After the eighth season finale &quot;Existence&quot;, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) goes into hiding. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) becomes John Doggett&#x27;s (Robert Patrick) new FBI partner in the X-Files office. Doggett asks Scully for help on a case involving an EPA official, Carl Wormus (Nicholas Walker), who died after his car was forced off a bridge by a woman he picked up. Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) travel to a reclamation plant, looking for links between Wormus&#x27; work and death. After doing an illegal autopsy on Wormus, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) sends Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) to locate Doggett. The investigation at the reclamation plant leads to an unknown woman, whose identity is later revealed to be Shannon McMahon (Lucy Lawless), one of Doggett&#x27;s former Marine associates. She reveals to Doggett that she is a &quot;Super Soldier&quot;. This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board a naval ship. They later find connections between the experiments on the ship and Scully&#x27;s child, William.

After Scully begins to miss Mulder, a complete stranger—the &quot;Shadow Man&quot; (Terry O&#x27;Quinn)—offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but unknowingly gets herself and Mulder in even more danger. The &quot;Shadow Man&quot;, is revealed to be a &quot;Super Soldier&quot; bent on killing Scully and Mulder. After a chase through a quarry, the &quot;Shadow Man&quot; is destroyed after being exposed to magnetite. Later, Scully, Doggett, and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has uncovered a second spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa three years ago. Misled by the FBI, the agents enlist the help of The Lone Gunmen to protect Scully&#x27;s son after they learn that the cult intends to kill the child. The cult, however, is successful in kidnapping the child. Concurrent with these events, Doggett is run over by a car, which sends him to the hospital. As Follmer and the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot; (Alan Dale) try to uncover the plans of the three agents, Scully and Reyes leave Washington, D.C. to find Scully&#x27;s son.

Doggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X-Files office; believing he is Mulder, Scully has his DNA tested, and the results reveal him to have the same pattern as Mulder. The disfigured man sticks a needle into William, which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind, but it is later revealed to be a cure for William&#x27;s powers. The unnamed man is later revealed to be Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), Mulder&#x27;s half-brother. In the season finale, Mulder returns from hiding in the attempts of finding classified information at an army base. He is caught, however, after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible &quot;Super Soldier&quot;, which causes him to be tried before a military tribunal. With the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), Mulder breaks out, and Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old &quot;wise man&quot;, later revealed to be the &quot;Cigarette Smoking Man&quot; (William B. Davis). He tells the two that aliens will begin colonizing the planet on December 22, 2012. Cigarette Smoking Man appears to be killed by a missile, launched under the command of Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin), who is revealed to be alive and well. Mulder and Scully escape, but become fugitives on the run from the FBI. The final scene of the season features the two in a motel room facing an uncertain—but possibly hopeful—future.

== Production ==

=== Development ===

Following the eighth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, David Duchovny announced that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged the other members of the crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new script ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series&#x27; new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.

With the news of the impending end of the series, the crew members decided to wrap up long-running plots. &quot;Jump the Shark&quot;, the final episode to feature the Lone Gunmen, served as a &quot;de facto&quot; series finale for the cancelled &quot;X-Files&quot; spin-off series &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;. Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz that they did not want to bring the characters back in any capacity, as Fox reportedly &quot;hated [the] characters&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Release&quot; was written to create closure to the story of the murder of Doggett&#x27;s son.

The show&#x27;s crew and actors had a range of opinions about the show&#x27;s finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;. Carter said of the finale, &quot;It&#x27;s the end—you don&#x27;t get another chance. So you&#x27;d better put everything you&#x27;ve ever wanted to put into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up.&quot; Gish said, &quot;It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back.&quot; Davis said, &quot;It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they found a way to get us all in again.&quot; Pileggi said, &quot;I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying &#x27;Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.&#x27; It was tough.&quot; Patrick said, &quot;It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter&#x27;s closing, and we&#x27;re all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other.&quot; Kim Manners called the final scene &quot;truly one of the most emotional experiences I&#x27;ve ever witnessed in my life.&quot; Former lead actor Duchovny said, &quot;In some ways, psychically I didn&#x27;t really leave. It was nice to be able to – I&#x27;m just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it.&quot;

=== Casting ===

With &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, the style of the opening credits was changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. In addition, Elwes was cast to portray the new recurring character, Brad Follmer, an Assistant Director at the FBI, and Alan Dale was also written into the show as a new &quot;villain&quot;, the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot;. Lucy Lawless was cast as the intended-recurring character Shannon McMahon, but she became pregnant after filming the season premiere, and—due to her high-risk pregnancy—had to leave the series.

After the departure of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, &quot;My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He&#x27;s still invested in it and certainly cares about [Mulder]. And I think he recognized that it was the best thing for the show and the audience [for him] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series.&quot; Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode &quot;William&quot;; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully&#x27;s eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;.

=== Crew ===
Chris Carter served as executive producer and showrunner for the season and wrote nine episodes, including the two-part season premiere and season finale, as well as important mytharc episodes. Spotnitz continued as executive producer and wrote seven episodes, plus receiving story credit for an additional episode. Vince Gilligan continued as executive producer and wrote three episodes. John Shiban was promoted to executive producer and wrote two episodes, plus receiving story credit for an additional episode. David Amann was promoted to supervising producer and wrote two episodes. Steven Maeda was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. A former writer for &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; Thomas Schnauz joined the writing staff as a story editor and wrote two episodes. Duchovny received story credit for a single episode.

Manners continued as co-executive producer and directed the most of episodes of the season with eight, including the two-part season finale. Tony Wharmby directed three episodes. Series creator Chris Carter directed two episodes. Co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren and series writer John Shiban each made their directorial debuts, directing one episode. Series writers Frank Spotnitz and Vince Gilligan each directed an episode, after previously directing their first episodes in the previous season. The remaining episodes were directed by Dwight Little, Cliff Bole, and cast member David Duchovny.

=== Ratings ===
The first episode of the season, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, gathered 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered 9.4 million viewers. On May 19, 2002, the series finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;, aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that &quot;The X-Files&quot; was not being renewed for a tenth season. When talking about the beginning of the ninth season, Chris Carter said, &quot;We lost our audience on the first episode. It&#x27;s like the audience had gone away, and I didn&#x27;t know how to find them. I didn&#x27;t want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back.&quot; &quot;The Truth&quot; received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.

=== Reviews ===
Sabadino Parker from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, when commenting on the series finale, said, &quot;It&#x27;s also for the good, because &quot;The X-Files&quot; has long been but a pale reflection of the show it once was.&quot; Brian Linder from &quot;IGN&quot; was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish&#x27;s character, which &quot;The X-Files&quot; crew did not do and continued what was seen by many critics as tiresome. Aaron Kinney from &quot;Salon&quot; magazine was more negative to the new season, even joking about the new female lead, calling her a &quot;peppy new female presence.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Ken Tucker said the show operated in what he called &quot;quaint territory&quot;, speculating that Chris Carter was the only one who seemed to understand the complex mytharc. Elizabeth Weinbloom from &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded with, &quot;shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship&quot;, between Mulder and Scully, ended remaining interest in what was a &quot;waning phenomenon&quot;. Another review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the show, &quot;The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; listed the ninth season and the 2008 film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; as the &quot;bad apple&quot; of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, describing the ninth season as &quot;clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called &#x27;super soldiers&#x27;&quot;. M.A. Crang, in his book &quot;Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11&quot;, noted that season nine &quot;does not have a great reputation among viewers&quot;. However he argued that the season contains a few &quot;hidden gems&quot; and praised those episodes which dealt with new material, while criticising other entries for focusing too heavily on &quot;plotlines and characters from years gone by&quot;.

<text>[[Mar (title)|Mar]] Awgin or Awgen (died 363 AD), also known as Awgin of Clysma or Saint Eugenios, was an Egyptian monk who, according to traditional accounts, introduced Christian monasticism to Syriac Christianity. These accounts, however, are all of late origin and often contain anachronisms. The historicity of Awgin is not certain.

The earliest source to mention him dates to the 7th century, about three hundred years after his death. The claim that Awgin introduced monasticism to the Syriac tradition is roundly rejected by modern scholars, who regard it as an indigenous development. The story of Mar Awgin, whether having a factual basis or not, was embellished in order to associate Syriac monasticism with the more illustrious Egyptian tradition of the Desert Fathers.

==Biography==

===In Egypt===
Originally, Saint Eugenios was a pearl-fisher from the island Clysma or Kolzum near Suez in Egypt. After having worked for 25 years, he joined the monastery of Pachomius in Upper Egypt, where he worked as a baker. He is reported to have possessed spiritual gifts and to have worked miracles, and he drew some following from among the monks.

===In Mesopotamia===
About 70 monks accompanied him when he left Egypt for Mesopotamia, where he founded a monastery on Mt. Izla above the city of Nisibis.

The location was well chosen, for Nisibis lay on the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, which had just embraced Christianity as the official religion. The rest of Mesopotamia was under Sassanid rule, which tried to revive the Zoroastrian religion and occasionally persecuted the Christian population.

The community on Mt. Izla grew rapidly, and from here other monasteries were founded throughout Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, Georgia, and even India and China.

A crisis occurred during the 6th century: to please the Zoroastrian rulers, the Assyrian Church decided all monks and nuns should marry. Many subsequently transferred into the Miaphysite Church that followed West Syriac Rite, and spiritual life declined in the Assyrian Church as a result. But the reforms were soon reverted. Abraham the Great of Kashkar founded a new monastery on Mt. Izla, and he and his successor Babai the Great revived the strict monastic movement. Married monks were driven out, the teaching of the church was set on a firm orthodox basis, and Assyrian monasticism flourished for another thousand years.

<text>Artemis is a tiny lunar impact crater located in the Mare Imbrium. Craters of this dimension typically form cup-shaped excavations on the surface of the Moon. It lies near the midpoint between the craters Euler to the west and Lambert to the east. Just a few kilometers to the southeast is the even smaller Verne.

It is named after Artemis, a Greek goddess who symbolizes the Moon and a Greek female first name.

<doc id="940088" wikidata="Q4838827" url="?curid=940088" title="Bachelor of Science in Nursing">
<text>The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN, BScN) also known in some countries as a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) or Bachelor of Science (BS) with a Major in Nursing is an academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by an accredited tertiary education provider. The course of study is typically three or four years. The difference in degree designation may relate to the amount of basic science courses required as part of the degree, with BScN and BSN degree curriculums requiring completion of more courses on math and natural sciences that are more typical of BSc degrees (e.g. calculus, physics, chemistry, biology) and BN curriculums more focused on nursing theory, nursing process, and teaching versions of general science topics that are adapted to be more specific and relevant to nursing practice. Nursing school students are generally required to take courses in social and behavioral sciences and liberal arts, including nutrition, anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, and English. In addition to those courses, experience in physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking is required for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. BSN programs typically last 2–4 years. Someone who holds a BSN can work in private or public medical and surgical hospitals, physician&#x27;s offices, home health care services, and nursing facilities. Having a BSN can result in more opportunities and better salary than just an associate degree.

The bachelor&#x27;s degree prepares nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study. Course work includes nursing science, research, leadership, and related areas that inform the practice of nursing. It also provides the student with general education in math, humanities and social sciences. An undergraduate degree affords opportunities for greater career advancement and higher salary options. It is often a prerequisite for teaching, administrative, consulting and research roles.

A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is not currently required for entry into professional nursing in all countries. In the US, there has been an effort for it to become the entry-level degree since 1964, when the American Nurses Association (ANA) advanced the position that the minimum preparation for beginning professional nursing practice should be a baccalaureate degree education in nursing. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) affirmed in 2010 that nurses should achieve higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression.

== In the United States ==

=== Accreditation ===
The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) are the accreditation bodies for Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs in the United States. Both Commissions are officially recognized as national accreditation agencies that ensure quality standards for undergraduate to graduate nursing programs by the United States Secretary of Education.

=== Accelerated BSN programs ===
Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs allow those who already have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a non-nursing field to obtain their nursing degree at an accelerated rate, which is why they are also commonly referred to as &quot;Second Degree Nursing Programs.&quot; These programs usually have strict prerequisites because the program coursework focuses solely on nursing. Accelerated BSN programs are typically anywhere from 12 to 24 months.

=== BSN Completion or &quot;RN to BSN&quot; Programs ===
These programs are intended specifically for nurses with a diploma or associate degree in nursing who wish to &quot;top-up&quot; their current academic qualifications to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. A majority of these RN to BSN programs are offered online through colleges, universities, or other e-learning providers. pro In order to keep the programs up-to-date and relevant to the current healthcare system, the course material is updated regularly with feedback from registered nurses, nurse managers, healthcare professionals and even patients.

=== BSN entry level into nursing in the future ===
In 2011, The Institute of Medicine recommended that by 2020, 80 percent of RNs hold a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. This was also noted in a report titled: Institute of Medicine&#x27;s report on the Future of Nursing, and has been followed by a campaign to implement its recommendations. In this report a 2nd recommendation was made to focus on increasing the proportion of registered nurses (RNs) with a baccalaureate degree to 80% by 2020. Towards that effort the report recommends that educational associations, colleges, delivery organizations, governmental organizations, and funders develop the resources necessary to support this goal. These recommendations are consistent with other policy initiatives currently underway; for example, legislation requiring that nurses receive a baccalaureate degree within 10 years of initial licensure has been considered in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

Many of these recommendations are being driven by recent studies regarding patient outcomes and nursing education. Hospitals employing higher percentages of BSN-prepared nurses have shown an associated decrease in morbidity, mortality, and failure-to-rescue rates. Increasing the percentage of BSN nurses employed decreases by 10 percent the 30-day inpatient mortality and failure-to-rescue rates. Studies that provide this type of evidence-based practice encompass the ultimate purpose of a higher level of educated nurse workforce. It adds to support the ultimate mission of the Texas Board of Nursing (BON or Board), which is to protect and promote the welfare of the people of Texas by ensuring that each person holding a license as a nurse in this state is competent to practice safely.

Many healthcare leaders and institutions have increased expectations for evidence-based practice (EBP). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) aim was for 90% of clinical decisions to be evidence-based by 2020 (IOM, 2010).

<doc id="940091" wikidata="Q6436038" url="?curid=940091" title="Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15">
<text>Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15, 395 U.S. 621 (1969), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court struck down a longstanding New York State statute requiring that to be eligible to vote in certain school district elections, an individual must either own or rent taxable real property within the school district, be the spouse of a property owner or lessor, or be the parent or guardian of a child attending a public school in the district. By a 5-to-3 vote, the court held that these voting requirements violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Background==

Morris H. Kramer was a 31-year-old unmarried man who lived with his parents in Atlantic Beach, New York, within Union Free School District No. 15, Town of Hempstead (now the Lawrence Union Free School District). Kramer, who was registered to vote in national and state elections, sought to register to vote in the school district&#x27;s annual school board election and school budget vote.

Kramer undisputedly met the age, citizenship, and residency requirements to vote in the election. However, he was not eligible to vote in school elections under Section 2012 of the New York State Education Law, which provided that to vote in school elections, a resident must either own or lease taxable real property within the school district, be the spouse of a property owner or lessor, or be the parent or guardian of one or more children enrolled in a public school within the district.

==Lower-court proceedings==
Kramer filed his complaint, seeking to enjoin the school district from enforcing Section 2012 against him, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He contended that the statute violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it had been construed in recent Supreme Court decisions such as &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot;. The school district argued that the statute validly limited the franchise in school elections to those primarily affected by the results of the election, namely property taxpayers in the school district and parents of children attending the district&#x27;s schools.

At the time, title 28 of the United States Code required that any federal lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a state statute must be heard by a specially convened three-judge panel of the District Court, composed of one circuit judge and two district judges, rather than by a single district judge, unless the constitutional challenge was deemed so insubstantial as to be &quot;frivolous.&quot; In a May 1966 opinion, District Judge Joseph Zavatt declined to convene a three-judge court. In rejecting Kramer&#x27;s constitutional claim, Judge Zavatt wrote that &quot;Plaintiff does not and cannot allege that his property is being taxed by the school district without his having a vote, since he owns no property in the district. Neither does nor can he allege that the education of his children is being affected without his having a vote, because he has no children.&quot; Judge Zavatt also observed that the constitutionality of the same statute had recently been upheld by the New York state courts. He concluded that the &quot;distinctions drawn by the legislature of the State in Section 2012 of the New York Education Law are so clearly reasonable and plaintiff&#x27;s claim so obviously without merit, that it can only be characterized as frivolous.&quot; The District Court dismissed Kramer&#x27;s complaint.

Kramer appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which reversed Judge Zavatt&#x27;s decision by a 2-to-1 vote and directed that a three-judge District Court be convened. Writing for the Second Circuit panel majority, Judge Paul R. Hays concluded that in light of then-recent Supreme Court caselaw applying the Equal Protection Clause to voter restrictions, Kramer&#x27;s constitutional challenge could not be considered frivolous. In a concurring opinion, Judge Irving R. Kaufman agreed that Kramer&#x27;s challenge &quot;cannot be said to be insubstantial on its face.&quot; Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard disagreed, in an opinion that began: &quot;I dissent. There is no need for three judges to consider a claim so patently without any merit.&quot;

On remand, the three-judge District Court upheld Section 2012 by a 2-to-1 vote. Writing for the court, Circuit Judge Leonard Moore held that even in light of recent equal protection jurisprudence, &quot;the selection of the parent and taxpayer groups [as authorized voters in school elections] would appear to be within the permissive limits of power still preserved by the state legislatures as specified by the Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals.&quot; District Judge John R. Bartels joined Judge Moore&#x27;s opinion. District Judge Jack Weinstein dissented, opinion that Section 2012 &quot;impose[d] a forbidden property qualification for voting&quot; in violation of the equal protection guarantee. Judge Weinstein observed that under Section 2012, the disqualification from voting in school elections applied not only to &quot;young adults living with their parents,&quot; such as Kramer, but also to &quot;older persons residing with their children, to boarders or lodgers, and to clergy, military and others living on tax exempt property.&quot;

The Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction of Kramer&#x27;s appeal. Oral argument was held on January 30, 1969. Osmond K. Fraenkel, long-time counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, argued the case for petitioner Kramer. John P. Jehu, Associate Counsel of the New York State Education Department, argued for the school district.

==Representation==
* Osmond K. Fraenkel argued the cause for appellant, with Melvin L. Wulf and Murray A. Miller
* John P. Jehu argued the cause and filed briefs for appellees; Louis J. Lefkowitz (Attorney General) pro se, Samuel A. Hirshowitz (First Assistant Attorney General), Daniel M. Cohen (Assistant Attorney General), filed a brief for appellee the Attorney General of New York

==Supreme Court decision==

The Supreme Court reversed the District Court and held that by depriving Kramer and other would-be school election voters of the right to vote based on their lack of property ownership or parenthood, New York had violated the Equal Protection Clause.

The Court&#x27;s decision was authored by Chief Justice Earl Warren and joined by Associate Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Byron White, and Thurgood Marshall. &quot;Kramer&quot; was one of Chief Justice Warren&#x27;s last opinions for the Court, handed down on June 16, 1969; Warren retired as Chief Justice one week later, following the conclusion of the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1968 Term and the confirmation of his successor, Warren E. Burger. The vote in the case was 5 to 3, as no replacement for Justice Abe Fortas, who had resigned the previous month, had yet been confirmed.

Chief Justice Warren&#x27;s opinion began by observing that under then-recent Equal Protection Clause caselaw, alleged infringements of the right to vote must survive careful judicial scrutiny, because &quot;any unjustified discrimination in determining who may participate in political affairs or in the selection of public officials undermines the legitimacy of representative government.&quot; Therefore, to be upheld, a statute restricting the right to vote must survive &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; by being necessary to serve a &quot;compelling state interest&quot;; the mere &quot;rationality&quot; of the statute is not sufficient. Justice Warren also concluded that neither the fact that New York could have chosen to appoint rather than elect its school boards, nor the fact that school boards do not have &quot;&#x27;general&#x27; legislative powers,&quot; affected the Court&#x27;s analysis.

The Court concluded that &quot;Section 2012 does not meet the exacting standard of precision we require of statutes which selectively distribute the franchise. The classifications of § 2012 permit inclusion of many persons who have, at best, a remote and indirect interest in school affairs and, on the other hand, exclude others who have a distinct and direct interest in the school [election] decisions.&quot;

==Justice Stewart&#x27;s dissent==

Justice Potter Stewart, joined by Justices Hugo L. Black and John Marshall Harlan, dissented. According to Justice Stewart&#x27;s dissenting opinion, a statute violates the Equal Protection Clause only if it rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to achieving the legislature&#x27;s objectives. Under &quot;Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections&quot;, Justice Stewart argued, states may impose restrictions on voting so long as they are reasonably designed to promote intelligent use of the franchise. Justice Stewart found that the requirements under Section 2012 were permissible under this standard, and asserted that the majority had not sufficiently explained why this case should be judged under a stricter standard.

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the decision, the New York State Legislature amended Education Law § 2012 to eliminate the restrictions that the Supreme Court had invalidated. Under New York law today, any United States citizen who has resided in a school district for more than 30 days is eligible to register and vote in the district&#x27;s elections (except for the residents of New York&#x27;s five largest cities, which do not have school board elections at all).

In the years after &quot;Kramer&quot; was handed down, the Burger Court cut back on the reach of the &quot;Kramer&quot; decision, though it has never been overruled. For example, in &quot;Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District,&quot; the Court held that California could constitutionally limit voting in elections for boards of directors of water districts to landowners within the districts, with votes apportioned based on the assessed value of their land. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that the water district exercised &quot;a special limited governmental function&quot; that had &quot;a disproportionate effect on landowners.&quot; In &quot;Ball v. James&quot;, a closely divided Court reached the same conclusion with respect to elections in Arizona water reclamation districts.

Morris Kramer, now in his 70s, still lives in the same house in Atlantic Beach, New York as he did when he sued the school district more than 40 years ago, according to a recent interview in a community newspaper discussing his career as a &quot;civic and environmental activist&quot; on Long Island.

<text>Aryabhata, named after Indian astronomer Aryabhata, is the remnant of a lunar impact crater located in the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis. The crater has been almost submerged by lava-flow, and now only an arc-shaped ridge formed from the eastern half of the rim remains above the lunar mare. This crater was previously identified as Maskelyne E before being named by the IAU in 1979. Maskelyne itself is to the southwest.

<text>The Museum of Glass (MOG) is a contemporary art museum in Tacoma, Washington, dedicated to the medium of glass. Since its founding in 2002, the Museum of Glass has been committed to creating a space for the celebration of the studio glass movement through nurturing artists, implementing education, and encouraging creativity.

== History ==
The idea for the Museum of Glass began in 1992 when Dr. Philip M. Phibbs, recently retired president of the University of Puget Sound, had a conversation with Tacoma native and renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly. Phibbs reasoned that the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s contributions to the studio glass movement warranted a glass museum, and he outlined a plan for the Museum of Glass to the Executive Council for a Greater Tacoma. The timing of his proposal corresponded with the idea to redevelop the Thea Foss Waterway, an industrial site. The chairman of the council, George Russel, concluded that the Museum of Glass would be the perfect anchor for the renewed waterway.

The site for the museum, directly adjacent to the Thea Foss Waterway, was secured in 1995. The Museum of Glass was established as a nonprofit organization in 1996. Canadian architect Arthur Erickson was chosen to design the museum&#x27;s building in 1997. Construction of the museum began in June 2000, and the steel frame of the iconic hot-shop cone was completed in 2001. Shortly thereafter construction began on the Chihuly Bridge of Glass to link the museum to downtown Tacoma. The museum opened on July 6, 2002, to thousands of visitors and worldwide accolades.

Since its opening, the Museum of Glass has become a collecting institution, and has introduced a mobile hot-shop.

In 2024, the Museum of Glass made history with its first permanent installation of a functional glass pipe, &quot;Triceratops&quot; by Ryan (Buck) Harris, known as Buck Glass. The &quot;Triceratops&quot; was donated to the museum by an anonymous private collector. The Museum of Glass took to Instagram breaking the news and stating in a post: &quot; “Triceratops” is an example of this complex, and once taboo, art form. It bridges the gap between functional and fine art and is the first example of functional glass pipes to be accepted into the Museum&#x27;s Permanent Collection, the tip of an iceberg of innovative and avant garde glassmakers. &quot;

== Architecture ==

The Museum of Glass was designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson and was his first major art museum in the United States. The museum totals in area, featuring in gallery space and a hot shop. This hot shop, shaped as an angled cone, is the museum&#x27;s most striking architectural feature. The cone, inspired by the wood &quot;beehive burners&quot; of the sawmills that once dotted the waterway, is composed of 2,800 diamond-shaped stainless steel panels and is in diameter at its base. Also featured in the Museum of Glass’ architecture are a sweeping concrete stairway that spirals around the exterior of the building, and three rimless reflecting pools featured on the museum&#x27;s terraces. Connected to the museum is the Chihuly Bridge of Glass, designed by Arthur Erickson in collaboration with artist Dale Chihuly, to connect the Museum of Glass to downtown Tacoma.

== Hot shop ==
The Museum of Glass features a hot shop amphitheater that provides seating for 145 guests to watch live glass blowing demonstrations. The hot shop contains both a hot glass studio for blowing and casting glass and a cold working studio. Hot shop activity is streamed live through the Museum of Glass’ website and is also archived online. The Museum of Glass hot shop also provides residencies for both visiting and featured artists.

=== Visiting Artist Program ===

The Museum of Glass hosts internationally acclaimed and emerging artists through its Visiting Artist Residency Program. The residencies range in length from one day to several weeks, and a piece is selected from each residency for inclusion in the Museum&#x27;s collection. Most residencies are streamed online through the museum&#x27;s website and conclude in a Conversation with the Artist lecture. Since its opening, the Museum of Glass has partnered with Pilchuck Glass School to produce the Visiting Artist Summer Series in which artists who attend or work at Piilchuck are invited to a residency at the Museum of Glass. The first ever visiting artist to the Museum of Glass was Dale Chihuly at the museum&#x27;s opening in 2002.

<text>Banting is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater located near the middle of the Mare Serenitatis on the Earth&#x27;s moon.

Originally named Linné E, in 1973 the crater was renamed for Sir Frederick Banting in honour of his outstanding medical contributions – the most famous being his discovery of insulin. Linné itself, named after the 18th-century Swedish botanist Carl von Linné, lies to the west-northwest.

&quot;Banting&quot; was one of approximately fifty new names for lunar craters adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1973. Choosing the names was the first step in the adoption of a new policy that involved broadening crater nomenclature.

The policy was created because of photographs taken by the Apollo spacecraft, which provided an extremely detailed and crater-populated lunar map, essentially proving that a greater variety of names would be needed. The practice that had previously been used was to name one large crater after a selected individual and to name the small craters around it with the same name followed by different letters of the alphabet.

The new policy allowed deceased scientists who had contributed to biological knowledge, like Dr. Banting – as well as scientists from other fields and contributors to culture and knowledge, such as writers, composers, and artists – to have craters named after them. Previously, only the names of astronomers, others who had made important contributions to astronomy, and historical philosophers had been used.

== Description ==

Banting is a &quot;simple&quot; impact crater. It is located in the Sea of Serenity, which is also known as Mare Serenitatis, a large patch of lunar mare. Maria like Mare Serenitatis are dark, smooth areas created by lava pooling on the surface and then cooling, covering up any previously existing craters. They were originally called &quot;maria&quot; (&quot;seas&quot;) because astronomers believed they were bodies of water.

Banting is flanked by two U.S. lunar landing sites – those of Apollo 15 and 17 – which lie several hundred miles on either side of the crater.

== Viewing ==

Mare Serenitatis is frequently perceived to be the eastern eye of the Man in the Moon. The Man in the Moon is on the near side of the Moon, which constantly faces Earth because of its tidally locked orbit. This makes Sir Frederick&#x27;s crater fairly central, since Mare Serenitatis is so easily viewed.

Despite its location, Banting is a very small crater and can be difficult to see. A telescope must be used, and viewing during certain lunar phases is crucial to seeing such small craters, as well. It is recommended that, while it is waxing, the moon be viewed around the time of its first quarter; while it is waning, it should be viewed just before its last quarter. Craters may also be conspicuous during a moon, when it is between quarter and full. These phases all provide just enough shadow to outline the details of the lunar surface without its being too dark, whereas the full moon is too bright, washing out all details.

<text>Dangerous Curves is a 1988 American comedy film directed by David Lewis and starring Tate Donovan and Grant Heslov.

The movie also featured brief appearances by Debbe Dunning and Cynthia Geary, early in their respective careers. Both actresses were cast as participants in a bikini contest.

==Plot==
Chuck (Tate Donovan), an uptight college student in Los Angeles, is hired by a successful businessman to deliver a Porsche to his daughter in Lake Tahoe, with the promise of a job if the delivery is successful. His fun-loving, girl-obsessed friend and roommate, Wally (Grant Heslov) convinces Chuck to drive him to San Diego first. The Porsche is stolen, and Chuck decides to try to get it back with Wally&#x27;s help but without involving the police so that the businessman does not find out. Meanwhile, Blake (Valerie Breiman), a fun-loving Texan, has convinced her naive friend Michelle (Danielle von Zerneck) to participate in a beauty pageant. The car thief is a successful local businessman, Greg Krevske (Leslie Nielsen), who pledges the stolen Porsche as part of the grand prize in the contest; Chuck and Wally meet Blake and Michelle, who are initially skeptical of the boys&#x27; story. Rival pageant contestant Shawn (Karen Lynn Scott)has a controlling stage mother who tricks Blake and Michelle into going to a party on Krevske&#x27;s boat to try to get them out of the way for the next round of the pageant so that they will be disqualified. Chuck and Wally sneak onto the boat in order to get evidence of the theft. Chuck finds a briefcase full of incriminating evidence, including the Porsche&#x27;s original license plate. The four flee on WetBikes, steal Krevske&#x27;s Ferrari, and agree to work together to steal back the Porsche. Chuck and Michelle spend the night together on a catamaran on the beach. The next day, with Michelle&#x27;s help, Chuck and Wally steal back the Porsche. They present Krevske&#x27;s Ferrari to the pageant as a replacement grand prize, and give the police the incriminating evidence from Krevske&#x27;s boat. Wally suggests leaving in order to make it to Lake Tahoe on time, but Chuck refuses to leave without talking to Michelle again. Shawn wins the beauty pageant, Blake invites Wally to stay in San Diego with her to have fun, and Chuck and Michelle get ready to drive to Lake Tahoe.

<text>The Flyvefisken&quot;-class patrol vessels(&quot;[[Flying fish]]&quot; in [[Danish language|Danish]]) are warships of the [[Royal Danish Navy]]. The class is also known as theStandard Flex 300orSF300class. The five vessels sold to the [[Portuguese Navy]] are locally referred as Tejo&quot; class.

==Containerised weapon systems==
The &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; ships were constructed using an innovative modular design known as StanFlex: they have a standard hull in which containerised weapons or systems can be placed. This allows them to rapidly change roles, typically in 48 hours. This enables the ships to be configured to perform the following roles:

* Surveillance/pollution control
* Combat
* Mine countermeasures/minehunter (MCM)
* Minelayer

The containers measure . One container is situated on the foredeck; the other three go on the quarterdeck behind the superstructure and funnel. Furthermore the ships are built using the sandwich principle - a layer of fiberglass either side of a core of PVC cell foam. This forms the structure from keel to top of mast. This building method reduces maintenance costs - so much so that 20 years later the new &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;-Holm&quot; class have been built using the same materials.

== Replaced three different vessels ==
The &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class replaced three different vessels in the Danish Navy: Six torpedo boats of the &quot;Søløven&quot; class (1965–90), six coastal minesweepers of the &quot;Sund&quot; class (1955–99) and eight seaward defence craft of the &quot;Daphne&quot;-class (1961–91). It was possible because of the containerised systems and modern technology.

The replaced vessels used World War II (or World War I) tactics: The &quot;Søløven&quot; boats were light plywood boats propelled by three turboshafts, which attacked the enemy ships with torpedoes in hit-and-run attacks. The &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class is not that fast, but their Harpoon missiles are sufficient for the task.

The &quot;Sund&quot;-class minesweepers were built of wood, bronze and other non-magnetic materials. They swept mine fields by trawling through the area with paravanes on tow separating magnetic and acoustic generators for the bottom mines, and chain cutters for the horned mines. The &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class is a minehunter and locates the mines with side-scan sonar and neutralizes them one by one with a ROV.

The &quot;Daphne&quot; class attacked submarines by dropping depth charges to a preselected depth, while sailing past the submarine. The &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class fights submarines with anti-submarine homing torpedoes.

== Vessels in Portuguese Service ==
Four vessels of the class (&quot;Glenten&quot;, &quot;Ravnen&quot;, &quot;Skaden&quot; and &quot;Viben&quot;) were acquired by the Portuguese Navy in 2010 and re-named &quot;Mondego&quot;, &quot;Douro&quot;, &quot;Guadiana&quot; and &quot;Tejo&quot;. A fifth vessel, &quot;Gribben&quot;, was also acquired by the service as a spare parts hull. After a period of upgrade and reconfiguration, &quot;Mondego&quot; and &quot;Tejo&quot; were specifically tasked to police Portugal&#x27;s exclusive economic zone around Madeira.

In 2023, 13 sailors assigned to &quot;Mondego&quot; were relieved of their duties when they refused to board the ship claiming her to be unseaworthy. The navy rejected the claim, which was made after the vessel had been tasked to monitor a Russian ship sailing in the vicinity of Madeira.

==Ships in class==
A total of 14 ships were built in the class, in three series:

The difference between the series is mainly in the configuration of the propulsion system. Series 2 is not equipped with hydraulic propulsion, but instead has an additional auxiliary engine, and Series 3 has one further auxiliary engine.

<text>Beer is a relatively small lunar impact crater located on the Mare Imbrium, to the east of the crater Timocharis. It was named after German astronomer Wilhelm W. Beer. Just to the northwest is the matching twin Feuillée. 

Beer is a circular, cup-shaped crater with a sharp-edged rim that has not been significantly eroded. The interior has a higher albedo than the surrounding lunar mare, which is usually an indication of a relatively young crater. A string of craters arc away from the rim to the southeast, which then grade into a straight rille, and were once known as Fossa Archimedes or Archimedes Rille, but now are officially unnamed.

The mare to the east has a higher albedo than the surrounding surface, and this lighter-hued surface reaches to the base of the Montes Archimedes. To the southeast of Beer is a lunar dome that is of comparable diameter to the crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Beer.

<text>The Berkel () is a river in the Netherlands and Germany. It is a right tributary of the IJssel.

The river rises in Billerbeck, near the German city of Münster in North Rhine-Westphalia, and crosses the border with the Netherlands near Vreden (Germany) and Rekken (Netherlands). From there, it flows through the province of Gelderland to join the IJssel at Zutphen after about 115 kilometres.

Before the coming of the railway, the Berkel was a major shipping route for goods from Münster to Eibergen, Borculo, and Zutphen, transported in flat-bottomed boats called &quot;Berkelzompen&quot;. In the 1950s, the Dutch stretch of the river was channelized to prevent flooding and to improve drainage. Recently old bends have been reconnected to the straightened lengths of the river.

Towns along the course of the Berkel include:
*in Germany: Billerbeck, Coesfeld, Gescher, Stadtlohn, Vreden
*in the Netherlands: Eibergen, Borculo, Lochem, Almen, Warnsveld, Zutphen

<text>The term kopis () in Ancient Greece could describe a heavy knife with a forward-curving blade, primarily used as a tool for cutting meat, for ritual slaughter and animal sacrifice, or refer to a single edged cutting or &quot;cut and thrust&quot; sword with a similarly shaped blade.

== Etymology ==
The term derives from the Greek word κοπίς (kopis), plural &quot;kopides&quot; from κόπτω – &quot;koptō&quot;, &quot;to cut, to strike&quot;. Alternatively a derivation from the Ancient Egyptian term &quot;khopesh&quot; for a cutting sword has been postulated.

==Characteristics==
The kopis sword was a one-handed weapon. Early examples had a blade length of up to 65 cm (25.6 inches), making it almost equal in size to the spatha. Later examples of the kopis from Macedonia tended to be shorter with a blade length of about 48 cm (18.9 inches). The kopis had a single-edged blade that pitched forward towards the point, the edge being concave on the part of the sword nearest the hilt, but swelling to convexity towards the tip. This shape, often termed &quot;recurved&quot;, distributes the weight in such a way that the kopis was capable of delivering a blow with the momentum of an axe, whilst maintaining the long cutting edge of a sword and some facility to execute a thrust. Some scholars have claimed an Etruscan origin for the sword, as such swords have been found as early as the 7th century BC in Etruria. 

The &quot;kopis&quot; is often compared to the contemporary Iberian falcata and the more recent, and shorter, Nepalese kukri. The word itself is a Greek feminine singular noun. The difference in meaning between kopis and makhaira (&quot;μάχαιρα&quot;, another Greek word, meaning &quot;chopper&quot; or &quot;short sword&quot;, &quot;dagger&quot;) is not entirely clear in ancient texts, but modern specialists tend to discriminate between single-edged cutting swords, those with a forward curve being classed as &quot;kopides&quot;, those without as &quot;makhairai&quot;.

==Use==
The Ancient Greeks often used single-edged blades in warfare, as attested to by art and literature; however, the double-edged, straight, and more martially versatile xiphos is more widely represented. Greek heavy infantry hoplites favored straight swords, but the downward curve of the kopis made it especially suited to mounted warfare. The general and writer Xenophon recommended the single edged kopis sword (which he did not distinguish from the &quot;makhaira&quot;) for cavalry use in his work &quot;On Horsemanship&quot;; saying, &quot;I recommend a &quot;kopis&quot; rather than a &quot;xiphos&quot;, because from the height of a horse’s back the cut of a &quot;machaira&quot; will serve you better than the thrust of a &quot;xiphos&quot;&quot;. The precise wording of Xenophon&#x27;s description suggests the possibility that the kopis was regarded as a specific variant within a more general class, with the term makhaira denoting any single-edged cutting sword.

Greek art shows Persian soldiers wielding the kopis or an axe rather than the straight-bladed Persian akinakes.

It has been suggested that the yatagan, used in the Balkans and Anatolia during the Ottoman Period, was a direct descendant of the kopis.

<text>Chinchiná is a town and municipality located in the department of Caldas in Colombia, southwest of Manizales. Founded in 1857 by Antioquian colonists, Chinchiná is settled in a valley surrounded by coffee plantations, called &quot;fincas&quot;, in the Central Cordillera of the Andes. Known as Colombia&#x27;s &quot;coffee heart&quot;, the town is home to the Buendía coffee factory and Cenicafé, a coffee research center.

Because of its close association with coffee production, the municipality was named part of the &quot;Coffee Cultural Landscape&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011. 

An active volcano, Nevado del Ruiz, lies approximately to the east.

Chinchiná is situated at . Its elevation is 1,360 meters (4,462 feet), and has a mean temperature of approximately 20 degrees Celsius.

<text>A kolinsky sable-hair brush (also known as &quot;red sable&quot; or &quot;sable hair brush&quot;) is a fine artists&#x27; paintbrush.

The hair is obtained from the tail of the kolinsky (&quot;Mustela sibirica&quot;), a species of weasel, rather than an actual sable. The &quot;finest&quot; brushes are made from the male hair only, but most brushes have a mix of about 60/40 male-to-female hair. Kolinsky bristles tend to be pale red in colour with darker tips. The weasel is not an animal that is raised well in captivity, and is generally isolated to the geographical region of Siberia. Due to this difficulty in harvesting the hair, and the fact that other natural and artificial bristles are not comparable in quality, these bristles are rare and expensive.

Kolinsky sables are usually used in watercolour brushes. Lesser grades of kolinsky sables are also frequently used in oil painting, and sometimes for glazing in acrylics.

The brushes are also often sought after in figure painting for their ability to hold a fine tip and an appropriate amount of paint and moisture. 

Due to their exceptional ability to be finely shaped, kolinsky sable brushes are highly prized in the dental ceramics industry, where they are used to hand-tint the ceramic appliances for a realistic appearance.

Beginning in 2013, shipments to the U.S. of kolinsky hair brushes were halted and in some cases seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service due to the kolinsky&#x27;s inclusion in the international CITES agreement, although kolinsky is neither threatened nor endangered.

<text>The Synod of Beth Lapat was a local council of the Church of the East, that was held in 484, in the Persian city of Gundeshapur (&quot;Bēth Lapaṭ&quot;, in the Syriac language). The council was headed by Metropolitan Barsauma of Nisibis (d. 491), who was involved in a long conflict with Patriarch Babowai of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (d. 484). No acts of this synod have been preserved, but fragmentary data from other sources suggest that various ecclesiological issues had been discussed, and that disciplinary canons against simony were adopted. Since Metropolitan Barsauma was involved in christological disputes, it is believed that several doctrinal questions were also discussed, and some later sources (acts of the synod held in 605) suggest that synod of 484 adopted a resolution in support of theological teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 428). Since no creeds or theological decisions of this council have been preserved, its outcome has been the subject of various assumptions among scholars.

In older scholarly works, the Synod of Beth Lapat was often regarded as a defining council, that marked the official acceptance of Nestorianism by the Church of the East. Such views have been criticized by modern scholars, who pointed out that theological works of Nestorius (d. 450), who was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, were not translated into Syriac language before the 6th century, long after the synod of 484, that regarded works of Theodore of Mopsuestia as source for theological guidance.

<doc id="940151" wikidata="Q808307" url="?curid=940151" title="Barksdale Air Force Base">
<text>Barksdale Air Force Base (Barksdale AFB) is a United States Air Force (USAF) base in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, in northwest Louisiana. Much of the base is within the city limits of Bossier City, Louisiana, along the base&#x27;s western and northwestern edge. Barksdale AFB occupies more than east of Bossier City and along the southern edge of Interstate 20. More than 15,000 active-duty and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) members serve at Barksdale.

The host unit at Barksdale is the 2nd Bomb Wing (2 BW), the oldest bomb wing in the U.S. Air Force. It is assigned to the Air Force Global Strike Command&#x27;s (AFGSC) Eighth Air Force (8 AF). Equipped with about 44 B-52H Stratofortress bombers, 2 BW provides flexible, responsive global combat capability and trains all AFGSC and AFRC Boeing B-52 Stratofortress crews.

The base was established in 1932 as Barksdale Field, named for World War I aviator and test pilot Lieutenant Eugene Hoy Barksdale (1896–1926).

== Role and operations ==

Units at Barksdale include the oldest bomb wing in the USAF, the 2nd Bomb Wing (2 BW). The 2nd participated in Brig Gen Billy Mitchell&#x27;s 1921 off-shore bombing test (as the 2nd Bomb Group).F

The base is closed to the public. However, the base is home to the Barksdale Global Power Museum, which hosts static displays of numerous aircraft including a Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan bomber, Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, North American P-51 Mustang, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, and multiple versions of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. There is an annual open house when non-Department of Defense visitors are allowed. Visitors may also tour the museum from 9:30 am to 4 pm every day except official holidays.

==History==
Barksdale Field was named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Eugene Hoy Barksdale (1895–1926) on 2 February 1933. Lieutenant Barksdale received his wings in Great Britain in 1918 and flew with the British Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Barksdale died on 11 August 1926, over McCook Field near Dayton, Ohio, when testing a Douglas O-2 observation airplane for spin characteristics. He did not recover from a flat spin, and while parachuting out of the plane his parachute was caught in the wing&#x27;s brace wires, causing Barksdale to fall to his death. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.
The name of the airfield was changed to Barksdale Air Force Base on 13 February 1948, concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate military branch.

Airships were still in use when field construction began, so Hangars One and Two were built large enough to accommodate them. No airships were ever assigned, but each hangar was large enough to accommodate two Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers wingtip to wingtip, which proved invaluable for &quot;Big Belly&quot; and &quot;Pacer Plank&quot; modifications managed by Boeing&#x27;s Wichita plant between 1965 and 1973. Half of the B-52Fs were deployed from Barksdale, but never returned as they were replaced by B-52Gs after the Vietnam War.

===Origins===
As early as 1924, the citizens of Shreveport became interested in hosting a military flying field. In 1926, Shreveport citizens learned that the 3rd Attack Wing stationed at Fort Crockett, Texas, would be enlarged by 500 percent and would require at least to support aerial gunnery and a bombing range. The efforts to procure the government&#x27;s commitment to build the facility in the Shreveport metropolitan area were spearheaded by a committee co-chaired by local civic leaders Andrew Querbes and John D. Ewing, beginning in 1927. It took a great deal of correspondence between the interested parties and the original proposal was rejected. However, in February 1928, a young crop duster, a U.S. Army Air Corps captain named Harold Ross Harris, was hired to fly over the local area in order to find a suitable site for the airfield.

Captain Harris selected what he felt was an adequate location for a military airfield. It was a sprawling section of cotton plantation near Bossier City. The site selection committee, representing the wealthiest taxpayers in the city, unanimously agreed upon the Barksdale Field location. A delegation of citizens traveled to Washington, D.C., to personally present the advantages of the proposed site to the War Department. Following the return of this delegation, a special U.S. Army board visited Shreveport and reported the location met all requirements of the Air Corps.

The site was selected 5 December 1928, as the location of the airfield. The land in Bossier Parish on which the airfield was built was unincorporated land near Bossier City that was annexed by the city of Shreveport once the site had been selected among 80 candidates. The real estate was purchased from over 800 property owners via a municipal bond issue approved by Shreveport voters in 1929 in fulfillment of the pledge that the citizens of Shreveport made to the U.S. government. The last of these bonds matured on 31 December 1959. After acquisition, Shreveport then donated the land to the federal government per their agreement, while the federal government assumed all the costs of building construction and equipment installation. Shreveport had originally proposed a site adjacent to Cross Lake (Shreveport, Louisiana), in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, but the War Department deemed this location inappropriate due to the lack of suitable terrain for the facility&#x27;s future expansion. Subsequent to the establishment of the military installation, Bossier City grew and expanded southward and eastward, eventually enveloping the area surrounding the base. Technically, of course, Barksdale AFB is neither in Bossier City nor Shreveport but, like all military bases, is an autonomous community with its own infrastructure. However, the base obtains its water from the Shreveport Water system, with a connection to the Bossier City Water System as a backup supply of water in case the Shreveport System is undergoing maintenance or emergency situations.

Construction of Barksdale Field began in 1931, when hangars, runways, and billets were built. Early flying operations began on 7 November 1932, with the arrival of the 20th Pursuit Group and its three pursuit squadrons equipped with the Boeing P-12 and Boeing P-26 Peashooter. The airfield was officially opened and dedicated on 2 February 1933.

By the mid-1930s, Barksdale Field was the headquarters and main base of the 3rd Attack Wing, equipped with the Curtiss A-12 and Northrop A-17. The airfield was used by both fighter and attack pilots to hone their gunnery and bombing skills. Additional barracks were constructed 1936–1937, and light bombers replaced pursuit and attack aircraft.

====World War II====
Barksdale was developed as an Air Corps flying school November 1940 and the runway apron was completed mid-1941. Between 23 and 25 May 1940, Barksdale Field was host to the Army&#x27;s &quot;complete military maneuvers&quot; simulating European combat operations. Some 320 aircraft from throughout the Army Air Corps participated, as Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower watched. General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, also briefly visited Barksdale Field during the latter stages of the maneuvers.

During World War II, the airfield trained replacement crews and entire units between 1942 and 1945. Known units that trained at Barksdale were:
* 27th Bombardment Group (Light) 1 February 1940 – 7 October 1940 (Douglas A-24 Dauntless)
* 8th Pursuit Group 5 September 1941 – 7 October 1941 (Curtiss P-40 Warhawk)
* 46th Bombardment Group (Light) 2 February 1942 – 1 April 1942 (Douglas A-20 Havoc)
* 44th Bombardment Group (Heavy) February 1942 – July 1942 (Consolidated B-24 Liberator)
* 98th Bombardment Group (Heavy) February 1942 – 30 March 1942 (Consolidated B-24 Liberator)
* 92nd Bombardment Group (Heavy) 1 March 1942 – 26 March 1942 (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress)
* 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) 1 March 1942 – 15 May 1942 (Consolidated B-24 Liberator)
* 90th Bombardment Group (Heavy) 17 May 1942 – 21 June 1942 (Consolidated B-24 Liberator)
* 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) 23 June 1942 – November 1942 (Martin B-26 Marauder)
* 95th Bombardment Group (Heavy) 15 June 1942 – 26 June 1942 (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress)
* 100th Bombardment Group (Heavy): 18 June 1942 – 26 June 1942 (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress)
* 319th Bombardment Group (Medium): 26 June 1942 – 8 August 1942 (Martin B-26 Marauder)
* 321st Bombardment Group (Medium) 26 June 1942 – 1 August 1942 (North American B-25 Mitchell)

The 335th Bombardment Group (Medium) took over training duties as a permanent Operational Training Unit (OTU) on 17 July 1942 with Martin B-26 Marauders. On 1 May 1944, the 335th was replaced by the 331st U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) Base Unit as the OTU, being subsequently replaced by the 2621st USAAF Base Unit on 1 December 1945. The 2621st provided pilot training until 26 September 1947, when it was inactivated and replaced by the 2621st Air Force Base Unit.

Also during World War II Barksdale played host to the major contingent of the Free French Air Forces and Nationalist Chinese aircrews.

===Postwar years===
Barksdale Field was renamed Barksdale Air Force Base on 13 January 1948, with the designation of the United States Air Force as a separate service in 1947.

In the postwar year of the 1940s, Barksdale then became headquarters for the Air Training Command from 1945 to 1949. The 47th Bombardment Wing, Light, equipped first with the Douglas B-26 Invader was assigned on 19 November 1948, from Biggs Field for transitioning to the North American B-45 Tornado. The B-45 was the USAF&#x27;s first operational jet bomber, and the first jet aircraft to be refueled in the air. The first B-45As began arriving in December 1948, with the wing accepting 96 aircraft by March 1950.

Due to budget reductions in the B-45 program, the air force planned to inactivate the 47th Bomb Wing and transfer its B-45s and personnel to Yokota AB, Japan so Far East Air Forces could benefit from the know-how gained by the 47th at Barksdale. However the costs of moving the aircraft to Japan were substantial, as the range of the B-45 was insufficient to fly from California to Hawaii, and the aircraft could not be equipped with external fuel tanks. Initial use of the B-45 at Barksdale also showed that the aircraft was not truly operational, with ineffective fire control and bombing systems along with structural weaknesses developing on the aircraft already in use. In addition, each engine had to be inspected after only hours of use. If found serviceable, it could be only flown another hours before a total overhaul was necessary. It was determined that the aircraft simply could not be deployed overseas and put into operational use. It took almost two years until Air Materiel Command could work out these issues and have the 47th Bomb Wing&#x27;s aircraft ready for operational use.

The 47th Bomb Wing was assigned to NATO and was reassigned first to Langley AFB, Virginia in March 1951, then afterwards to RAF Sculthorpe, England, arriving in the UK on 1 May 1951. With the departure of the 47th, Barksdale phased out bomber crew training.

U.S. Representative Joe Waggonner, worked successfully to keep Barksdale open during his time in Congress. Through his efforts, Barksdale survived base closures that occurred elsewhere across the nation.

===Cold War===
On 1 November 1949, Barksdale was reassigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC), and became home of Headquarters Second Air Force. Barksdale remained a SAC base for nearly the next half-century. However, with the change of commands, the mission of Barksdale initially remained that of a training base where units were formed and organized, then were reassigned to front-line operational bases.

==== 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing ====

The first SAC unit at Barksdale was the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was reassigned to the base from McGuire AFB on 1 October. The mission of the 91st was to provide global strategic reconnaissance, with emphasis on aerial photography and mapping.

The 91st was equipped with a myriad of aircraft, including versions of the Boeing RB/TRB-17 Flying Fortress; Boeing RB/TB/TRB-29 Superfortress; Douglas RC-54 Skymaster; Boeing B/RB-50 Superfortress, and the North American RB-45 Tornado.

The 91st maintained operational detachments of aircraft and crews drawn from several components to provide reconnaissance support in overseas areas, including the United Kingdom and locations in North Africa. Deployments would be routine and last for about three months.

When the Korean War broke out in 1950, a three-plane detachment from the wing flew to Johnson Air Base, Japan to provide the Far East Air Forces commander improved reconnaissance capability. The 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron remained in Japan for the duration of the war and flew reconnaissance missions over North Korea and the Sea of Japan. The wing also sent a detachment of RB-29 refueling aircraft, and conducted the first aerial refueling under combat conditions when a KB-29P refueled an RC-45C over North Korea in July 1951

With the arrival of the 376th Bomb wing in October 1951, the decision was made to reassign the 91st. On 16 June 1952 the 91st was reassigned to Lockbourne AFB, Ohio.

==== 301st Bombardment Wing ====

The 301st Bombardment Wing joined the 91st SRW at Barksdale on 7 November 1949, being transferred from Smoky Hill AFB, Kansas, where it was reactivated the year before. Both wings operated a joint integrated headquarters although each wing continued tactical operations independently.

Initially flying the B-29 Superfortress, after arriving at Barksdale the 301st was one of the first units to conduct aerial refueling operations with the KB-29 tanker version of the Superfortress. The wing converted to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in 1953 and traded in its KB-29 tankers for the upgraded Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter.

The mission of the 301st was to train for strategic bombing missions and to conduct aerial refueling. The wing deployed to England in 1953 and to French Morocco in 1954.

It was reassigned to Lockbourne AFB, Ohio on 15 April 1958 where it became an electronic countermeasures (ECM) unit and was engaged in various clandestine intelligence missions.

To provide air defense for the base, the U.S. Army established the Barksdale Defense Area in 1959 and constructed Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile sites for air defense. Sites were located near Bellevue (N.E. of Shreveport) (BD-10) , and Stonewall (BD-50) in Louisiana. The unit involved may have been from the 562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment. They were operational between November 1960 and March 1966 when they were inactivated as part of the reduction of the air defenses in the United States against aircraft.

==== 376th Bombardment Wing ====
On 10 October 1951 the 376th Bombardment Wing was reassigned to Barksdale from Forbes AFB Kansas. Initially equipped with obsolescent B-29 Superfortresses, the 514th Bombardment Squadron trained to drop A-bombs until the wing upgraded to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber in June 1953 which took over the A-bomb duty. The 376th began flying EB-47 Stratojets in 1954 for ECM operations, which became the wing&#x27;s primary mission in September 1953.

The wing was reassigned to Lockbourne AFB on 1 December 1957 where it replaced and absorbed the personnel and assets of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and was redesignated the 376th Bombardment Wing (ECM), flying EB-47E Stratojets .

==== 4238th Strategic Wing ====
Following the transfer 301st and 378th Bomb Wings in 1957 and 1958 respectively, Barksdale was slated to receive Boeing&#x27;s newest pair of strategic aircraft: the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The mission of Barksdale was also changed from being a SAC training base to a front-line operational base.

It received its new aircraft and mission in the form of the 4238th Strategic Wing which was a derivative of the 7th Bomb Wing from Carswell AFB, Texas. The 4238th was equipped with the B-52F and KC-135A strategic tankers that were assigned to Barksdale. Its units consisted of the 436th Bomb Squadron and 913th Air Refueling Squadron.

It was assigned to Barksdale on 3 May 1958 as part of SAC&#x27;s plan to disperse its big bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The 436th Bomb Squadron consisted of 15 aircraft. Half of the planes were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat. The remaining planes were used for training in bombardment missions and air refueling operations.

===== 1st Combat Evaluation Group =====
The 1st Combat Evaluation Group (1961–90) reporting directly to the Deputy Commander of Operations, Strategic Air Command Headquarters, Offutt AFB, Nebraska, to provide command level standardization/evaluation of SAC aircrews, radar scoring of simulated bombing activity by SAC aircraft; and contingency warfare support of ground directed bombing, with detachments in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. In 1990, part of the 1CEVG became the 99 Electronic Combat Range Group and was the 99th Range Group became part of the Nellis AFB 98th Range Wing in 1995.

==== 2nd Bombardment Wing ====
The 4238th Strategic Wing was phased out on 1 April 1963. The 2nd Bombardment Wing, Heavy was reassigned without equipment or personnel to Barksdale from Hunter AFB, Georgia. taking over the B-52 and KC-135 mission from the 4238th Strategic Wing. The aircraft and crews remained at the base, but the wing (and its bomb squadron) were given new designations, the 20th Bombardment Squadron and 913th Air Refueling Squadron.

The 2nd Bomb Wing under various designations, has been the host unit at Barksdale for over 40 years. The 20th retained the B-52Fs until being transferred in June 1965 to the 7th Bomb Wing at Carswell AFB. It was replaced by the 62nd Bomb Squadron, which flew the B-52G which was reassigned from the inactivating 39th Bombardment Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida. A second &quot;G&quot; squadron, the 596th Bomb Squadron was reassigned to Barksdale in April 1968 from the 397th Bombardment Wing at Dow AFB, Maine.

During the Vietnam War, the 2nd Bomb Wing deployed to Southeast Asia for &quot;Arc Light&quot; and &quot;Young Tiger&quot;, including use B-52G in Linebacker I and Linebacker II raids of 1972 – 73 at the end of the war. In addition to the Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder for Combat Skyspot, the B-52G had onboard ECM for protection against enemy surface-to-air missiles. In the latter stages of Linebacker II, some of the B-52Gs were diverted in-flight to targets deemed to be less dangerous. All aircraft and crews returned to Barksdale in January and October 1973.

===Post-Vietnam era===
From 1973–1992, Barksdale hosted the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition and awards symposium. After spending weeks dropping bombs on ranges throughout the United States and engaging in navigational competition, SAC&#x27;s finest bomber and tanker aircrews gathered here for the score posting and awards presentation, and to work together to improve the training of SAC aircrews.

Headquarters Second Air Force was inactivated on 1 January 1975, being replaced by Headquarters Eighth Air Force which was transferred to Barksdale after being located at Andersen AFB, Guam for five years in charge of SAC strategic operations for the Vietnam War. At Barksdale, the Eighth took over the operations and personnel of the inactivated Second Air Force.

In 1978, the Eighth Air Force Museum was established at Barksdale with the arrival of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the type the &quot;Mighty Eighth&quot; flew during World War II. The museum has grown greatly over the years, and today its collection includes the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Boeing B-47 Stratojet, Boeing B-52D and G Stratofortresses, British Avro Vulcan B.Mk2, General Dynamics FB-111A, Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor, Douglas C-47 Skytrain, Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman, Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, North American P-51D/F-51D Mustang, Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F, Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star and Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.

Barksdale&#x27;s 32nd Air Refueling Squadron received the first operational McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender aerial tanker in November 1981. The 32nd ARS was reassigned to the 458th Operations Group on 1 June 1992 and to the 305th Operations Group on 1 July 1995. The 71st ARS was reassigned to the 458th Operations Group at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. Barksdale&#x27;s last KC-135 was placed in the Eighth Air Force Museum after its final flight in March 1994 and the last KC-10 departed for McGuire AFB in October.
In April 1982, and again in December 1990, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; made stops at Barksdale on its way back to Cape Canaveral. In the immediate aftermath of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003, a hangar at Barksdale AFB, being the closest base to the accident site, was used to collect and catalogue the orbiter&#x27;s debris before it was shipped to Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

On 20 September 2009, the airport was again used as a refuelling stop for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s return flight to Kennedy Space Center, as has done numerous times before. This time it was &quot;Discovery&quot; that was being piggybacked from Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and &quot;Discovery&quot; remained at Barksdale over night.

===Operation Just Cause/Desert Shield/Desert Storm===
Barksdale played significant roles in Operation Just Cause to restore democracy in Panama in December 1989, Operation Desert Shield in August 1990 and Operation Desert Storm in January 1991. The first combat sortie of Desert Storm was launched from Barksdale, when seven B-52Gs flew a 35-hour mission – the longest combat sortie in history at that time – to fire a barrage of conventional air-launched cruise missiles against Iraq. The B-52s from Barksdale that were deployed to Morón Air Base, Spain (a former SAC &quot;Reflex&quot; base) dropped 10 percent of all U.S. Air Force bombs during the Persian Gulf War.

===Post-Cold War===

Upon its return from the Middle East, the 2nd Bombardment Wing, Heavy was redesignated the 2nd Wing with its implementation of the objective wing organization on 1 September 1991.

The base turned its attention from combat to more peaceful pursuits when two B-52s, a KC-10 and their crews visited Dyagilevo Air Base, Russia, in March 1992. In May 1992, Barksdale hosted a return visit by two Russian Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; bombers, an Antonov An-124 &quot;Condor&quot; transport and 58 Russian airmen. The Russians stayed for six days, seeing a slice of America and participating in Strategic Air Command&#x27;s final Bombing and Navigation Competition awards symposium. The Russians visited again in August 1994, bringing a Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; and an Ilyushin Il-78 aerial tanker. Barksdale began a friendship with Ukrainian Air Force airmen later in 1994, when a B-52 and KC-10 visited Poltava Air Base, Ukraine.

In April 1992, 265 buildings on Barksdale&#x27;s main base were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area from the Shreveport Gate to the flightline and from the Bossier Gate to Hoban Hall make up the Barksdale Field Historic District, along with much of family housing. On 1 June 1992, Barksdale was transferred from the inactivating Strategic Air Command to the newly activated Air Combat Command (ACC). All active-duty aircraft assigned to Barksdale were assigned ACC tail codes of &quot;LA&quot;.

An equipment change began also in 1992 when the 596th Bomb Squadron retired its B-52Gs and replaced them with B-52Hs from inactivating squadrons at other former SAC bases. The 596th itself was inactivated when it was replaced by the 96th Bomb Squadron on 1 October 1993. The 20th Bomb Squadron was reassigned to the 2nd Wing on 17 December 1992 when it and its B-52Hs were reassigned to Barksdale from the 7th Wing, the latter which was relocating from the closing Carswell AFB, Texas, and transferring to Dyess AFB, Texas in order to transition to the Rockwell B-1 Lancer.

In October 1993, the 2nd Wing was redesignated as the 2nd Bomb Wing when the 71st Air Refueling Squadron and its KC-135A/Qs were reassigned to the Air Mobility Command.

A third B-52H squadron was assigned to the wing on 1 July 1994 when the 11th Bomb Squadron was activated at Barksdale. The mission of the 11th BS is that of a Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the B-52H.

===1990s combat operations===

Barksdale became the focus of attention once again in September 1996 as two of its B-52s fired 13 AGM-86C CALCM missiles on surface-to-air missile sites and air defense radars in Iraq. Dubbed Operation Desert Strike, the mission came in response to Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein&#x27;s attacks on Kurds in northern Iraq and was the first combat employment of the B-52H in history. In only a span of 80 hours, Barksdale B-52s and support personnel deployed forward to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, carried out the strike against Iraqi targets and returned to Guam.

Fourteen months later, in November 1997, personnel and aircraft deployed from Barksdale to the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean by order of U.S. president Bill Clinton. They joined forces already in the region in response to a renewed bout of provocations and threats made by Saddam Hussein. Remaining at Diego Garcia until June 1998, Barksdale&#x27;s forces bolstered the ability to defend the security of the region against possible aggression by Iraq and to accomplish specific military objectives if a diplomatic solution to the confrontation could not be achieved.

Six B-52s and personnel from Barksdale were again deployed to Diego Garcia in November 1998 becoming part of the 2nd Air Expeditionary Group. Seven bombers and about 180 people deployed in response to Iraq&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors. Although president Clinton called off strikes after Hussein&#x27;s last-minute concessions to meet U.N. demands, Iraq&#x27;s cooperation continued to deteriorate. U.S. military forces, including Barksdale&#x27;s B-52s, launched a sustained series of air strikes against Iraq shortly after midnight 17 December 1998. The three-day-long campaign, dubbed Operation Desert Fox, followed the latest in a series of roadblocks by the Iraqi government against weapons inspections conducted by the U.N. Special Commission.

From March to June 1999, ten B-52s and personnel of the 2nd Bomb Wing played a prominent role in halting the brutal Serb expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. Operating from RAF Fairford as part of the 2nd Air Expeditionary Group in the United Kingdom, Barksdale B-52s flew over 180 combat sorties and released over 6,600 weapons against military targets throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during Operation Allied Force.

===&quot;War on Terror&quot;===

Immediately following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, Barksdale provided a safe haven for President George W. Bush on his return flight to the nation&#x27;s capital. Shortly thereafter, the National Command Authority called upon the base to provide substantial forces to spearhead the Global War on Terrorism. Operating from multiple overseas locations, Barksdale airmen and B-52s, both active and reserve alike, played a key role in the first airstrikes of Operation Enduring Freedom. Returning yet again to the skies of Iraq, Barksdale B-52s flew over 150 combat sorties against military targets throughout the southern half of the country during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

On 30 August 2007, a B-52 originating from Minot AFB carried six AGM-86 cruise missiles, each loaded with a W80 nuclear warhead, to Barksdale without the knowledge of base personnel or crew. The incident sparked controversy across the country. As an end result of the situation, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that, &quot;A substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand&quot;, and that he had accepted the resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Michael Moseley. This led to the establishment of the Global Strike Command, activated in August 2009 with headquarters at Barksdale.

The 2nd Bomb Wing was assigned to the Air Force Global Strike Command on 1 February 2010.

On 1 January 2011, Air Force Reserve Command inactivated the 917th Wing, while at the same time activating the 307th Bomb Wing, which subsumed the B-52 units of the 917th Wing. The A-10 units of the 917th Wing remain at Barksdale AFB, under the newly created 917th Fighter Group, while organizational control is with the 442nd Fighter Wing, Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

A 2013 North Korean propaganda photo shows that Barksdale is one of four targets in the United States for a potential North Korean nuclear attack, alongside the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the headquarters of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the site of the Pearl Harbor attacks, and San Diego, the homeport of the Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet. The photo depicts North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meeting with several of his generals in a &quot;situation room&quot; with walls covered in maps, one of which depicts lines thought to represent missiles going from Korea to the United States. The line targeting Barksdale was obscured by the hat of Lt. Gen. Kim Rak-gyom, but is believed by nuclear proliferation and North Korea expert Jeffrey Lewis to lead to Barksdale. Barksdale is thought to be targeted because it hosts the headquarters of the Air Force Global Strike Command and its fleet of nuclear-armed bombers. In a 2018 book, Lewis argues that North Korea also targeted Barksdale because President George W. Bush took shelter there after the 9/11 attacks, to send a message to the president that &quot;you can run, but you can&#x27;t hide.&quot; Though declining to comment on specifics, a spokesperson for Barksdale said that enemies of the United States are &quot;grossly overmatched in their capabilities&quot; and that the Air Force is &quot;ready to project that power and [to] make sure they understand that message loud and clear.&quot;

==== 917th Wing (Air Force Reserve Command) ====

The 917th Wing was originally formed as the 917th Troop Carrier Group on 17 January 1963 at Barksdale and was assigned to the 435th Troop Carrier Wing. Its mission was to administer and support its assigned 78th Troop Carrier Squadron which was equipped with Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs.

On 1 July 1963, both the group and squadron were reassigned to the 442nd Troop Carrier Wing because their new gaining command, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), wanted all five Air Force Reserve C-124 Groups assigned to the same wing. The units were reassigned to the 512th Troop Carrier Wing on 25 March 1965.

Reflecting similar changes in the active force, the 917th was redesignated twice – initially to the 917th Air Transport Group in 1965, and then to the 917th Military Airlift Group in 1966. The 917th Military Airlift Group was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its exceptional safety record of more than 55,000 accident-free flying hours and global support missions.

On 26 April 1972, the unit was redesignated the 917th Special Operations Group, with Tactical Air Command as the gaining major air command. As the missions changed, the unit was redesignated the 917th Tactical Fighter Group (917 TFG) on 1 October 1973. The 78th Troop Carrier Squadron was subsequently inactivated and replaced by the 47th Tactical Fighter Squadron. During the late 1980s, the 917 TFG group was upgraded to wing status and renamed the 917th Tactical Fighter Wing (917 TFW).

Due to air force restructuring in June 1992, Tactical Air Command was combined with all elements of the Strategic Air Command (except KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft) to form the new Air Combat Command (ACC). The 917th Tactical Fighter Wing joined Air Combat Command and &quot;Tactical&quot; was dropped from its name.

On 1 October 1993, the 917th Fighter Wing (917 FW) saw important changes once again. The 46th Fighter Training Squadron was inactivated when the active-duty Air Force took control of all fighter replacement training. On this same day, the 917th became the first unit in Air Force Reserve history to acquire a strategic mission: B-52Hs were added to the wing make-up and the 93rd Bomb Squadron was activated. Now a composite wing, the 917th dropped &quot;Fighter&quot; from its name and became the 917th Wing (917 WG).

In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. Some of the 354th Fighter Wing&#x27;s assigned A-10 aircraft (located at Eielson AFB) would be distributed to the 917th Wing Barksdale Air Force Base (three aircraft). This recommendation was made because, although a base with high military value, Eielson was an expensive base to maintain.

In another Recommendation, DoD recommended to realign Air Force Reserve fighter assets at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, LA. It would distribute six of the 926th Fighter Wing&#x27;s A-10 aircraft to the 917th Wing.

On 20 September 2009, the airport was used as a refuelling stop for the Space Shuttle Discovery&#x27;s return flight to the Kennedy Space Center that was being piggybacked from Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and Space Shuttle Discovery remained at Barksdale over night.

===Bossier Base===
Bossier Base, now called The East Reservation due to its location east of the runway, was formerly a Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA)
Q clearance maintenance and WSA during the Cold War. It was similar to Sandia Base&#x27;s Manzano. Once entirely independent of the USAF and Barksdale AFB, it has been merged with the main base.

==Based units==
Flying and notable non-flying units based at Barksdale Air Force Base.

Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Barksdale, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.

<text>Bessarion is a lunar impact crater located near the southwest edge of Mare Imbrium. It is named after Greek scholar Bessarion. Some distance to the east is the crater T. Mayer. Bessarion is a bowl-shaped crater with a low central rise and a higher albedo than the maria, making it a brighter feature when the sun is overhead.

Just to the north of Bessarion is a smaller crater Bessarion E that also has a relatively high albedo. This crater is sometimes called Virgil, although this name is not officially recognized by the IAU.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bessarion.

<doc id="940160" wikidata="Q604549" url="?curid=940160" title="Combined diesel and gas">
<text>Combined diesel and gas (CODAG) is a type of propulsion system for ships that need a maximum speed that is considerably faster than their cruise speed, particularly warships like modern frigates or corvettes.

Pioneered by Germany with the , a CODAG system consists of diesel engines for cruising and gas turbines that can be switched on for high-speed transits. In most cases the difference of power output from diesel engines alone to diesel and turbine power combined is too large for controllable-pitch propellers to limit the rotations so that the diesels cannot continue to operate without changing the gear ratios of their transmissions. Because of that, special multi-speed gearboxes are needed. This contrasts to combined diesel or gas (CODOG) systems, which couple the diesels with a simple, fixed ratio gearbox to the shaft, but disengage the diesel engines when the turbine is powered up.

For an example the new CODAG-propelled s of the Royal Norwegian Navy, the gear ratio for the diesel engine is changed from about 1:7.7 (engine:propeller) for diesel-only to 1:5.3 when in diesel-and-turbine mode. Some ships even have three different gear ratios for the diesel engines — one each for single-diesel and double-diesel cruises, and the third when the gas turbine is engaged.

Such a propulsion system has a smaller footprint than a diesel-only power plant with the same maximal power output, since smaller engines can be used and the gas turbine and gearbox don&#x27;t need that much additional space. Still, it retains the high fuel efficiency of diesel engines when cruising, allowing greater range and lower fuel costs than with gas turbines alone. On the other hand, a more complex, heavy and troublesome gearing is needed.

Typical cruising speed of CODAG warships on diesel-power is and typical maximal speed with switched on turbine is .

==Turbines and diesels on separate shafts==

Sometimes the engine arrangement of diesel engine and gas turbine with each system using its own shafts and propellers is also called CODAG. Such installations avoid the use of a complicated switching gearbox, but have some disadvantages compared to real CODAG systems:
* Since more propellers have to be used, they have to be smaller and thus less efficient.
* The propellers of the idling systems cause drag.

==CODAG WARP==
CODAG Water jet And Refined Propeller (WARP), a system developed by Blohm+Voss as option for their MEKO line of ships, also falls in this category, but avoids the above-mentioned problems. CODAG WARP uses two diesel engines to drive two propellers in a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) arrangement, &quot;i.e.&quot;, both shafts can also be powered by any single engine, and a centerline water jet powered by a gas turbine. The idling water jet does not cause drag, and since its nozzle can be placed further aft and higher it does not affect the size of the propellers.

==CODAG-electric==
Another way to combine the two types of engines is to connect them to generators and drive the propellers electrically as in a diesel-electric. See Combined diesel–electric and gas (CODLAG) and Integrated Electric Propulsion (IEP). This also permits propeller pods, with the propulsion motors being located inside the pods.

== Land vehicles ==
The Swedish Stridsvagn 103 utilizes a diesel engine for slow cruising and aiming, and a gas turbine for additional power.

<doc id="940161" wikidata="Q1627650" url="?curid=940161" title="Reverend Bizarre">
<text>Reverend Bizarre was a doom metal band from Finland. Formed in 1995, they played slow and heavy traditional doom with dramatic vocals, following in the footsteps of bands such as Witchfinder General, Saint Vitus, Candlemass, Pentagram and Black Sabbath. The band was one of the biggest names in 2000s traditional doom metal.

==History==
===Beginnings (1994–1999)===

The band was formed in 1994 in Lohja. After their military service, Albert Witchfinder, Peter Vicar and Juippi began playing in autumn 1997. In the summer of 1998, Albert moved to Turku to continue Reverend Bizarre with Vicar. To complete their training, they get back in touch with Earl of Void, at this time recently released from prison. They recorded the &quot;Slice of Doom&quot; demo in three days (16, 17 and 23 August 1999), which they send to several labels in the hope of signing a contract.

According to Albert Witchfinder, the band had planned three more full-length albums, after their second album – titled &quot;Songs from the Funereal World&quot;, &quot;Heavier Than Life&quot; and &quot;How It Was Meant to Be&quot; – but this plan was scrapped and the band made only one more LP, disbanding Reverend Bizarre &quot;before it started to suck.&quot; The album, &quot;III So Long Suckers&quot;, was recorded in the first half of 2007, and released in August of that year. The band&#x27;s last concerts were played during the autumn and winter of 2006 culminating in a final performance in Turku.

Two of the band&#x27;s EPs, &quot;Harbinger of Metal&quot; and &quot;Return to the Rectory&quot;, actually exceed 60 minutes in length.

===Disbandment and side projects (2007)===
Initially, five albums were planned. On 17 August 2007, after scrapping this plan, the band announced on MySpace their intention to publish their final album &quot;&quot;. At the end of September 2007, however, they announced the registration and publication of several recordings.

After the break-up of Reverend Bizarre, the band members focus on their other groups and projects. In 2005, Albert Witchfinder became a member of The Puritan as well as a solo project called Opium Warlords, and Peter Vicar founded a new band called Lord Vicar. Both of them released (alongside original material) songs originally meant for Reverend Bizarre and that were to appear on future two albums which were never released. Furthermore, all three members of Reverend Bizarre continue doing music together in Orne (originally known as Mesmer), Vicar&#x27;s old school progressive rock band in which Void plays the drums. Witchfinder has appeared on vocals on both Orne full-lengths, the 2006 debut &quot;The Conjuration by the Fire&quot; and the 2011 second album &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;.

<text>Birt is a lunar impact crater located in the eastern half of the Mare Nubium and west of the Rupes Recta. It was named after British selenographer William R. Birt.

Birt is a bowl-shaped formation with a raised rim, slightly intersected along the southeast edge by the much smaller crater Birt A. To the west of Birt, a rille named Rima Birt runs north-northwest in an arc from Birt F to Birt E.

<doc id="940170" wikidata="Q790811" url="?curid=940170" title="Barsauma of Nisibis">
<text>Barsauma (, &quot;Barṣaumâ&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Bar Sawma&quot;, &quot;son of Lent&quot; in Syriac, was Metropolitan of Nisibis in the 5th century, and a major figure in the history of the Church of the East. Under his leadership the church moved away from Roman loyalties and became increasingly aligned with the Nestorian movement. 

Barsauma had been a teacher and student at the School of Edessa, where his mentor had been Ibas, Bishop of Edessa. Barsauma was excommunicated with Ibas and other churchmen for their support of Nestorian teachings, which had been declared heretical at the Council of Ephesus in 431.

Though Ibas was acquitted of heresy at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, following his death in 457 his associates found themselves expelled from their positions once again. Barsauma and other of Ibas&#x27; followers relocated to the Sasanian Empire. 

Barsauma became metropolitan of Nisibis, one of the five great archdioceses of the Church of the East. He quickly became a favorite of King Peroz I, who preferred his compliant stance to that of Babowai, Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and head of the Persian Church, whom he regarded as a pro-Roman traitor. Over time Barsauma and Babowai&#x27;s relationship grew openly antagonistic and came into conflict over the issue of the marriage of bishops, which provoked outrage in the Church of the East. Barsauma was instrumental in Babowai&#x27;s downfall, ultimately leading to the latter&#x27;s execution by Peroz in 484.

Following Babowai&#x27;s death, Barsauma became the most powerful figure in the Persian Church, though he was never elevated to the position of Catholicos, or Patriarch. He pursued a policy of pro-Persian, anti-Roman interaction, and under his leadership the church adopted a more Nestorian theology, though it never fully adhered to the doctrine in his lifetime. He headed the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484, which officially declared Nestorianism as the doctrine of the church as well as disavowed clerical celibacy.

In 485 Barsauma&#x27;s political enemies consecrated as patriarch the moderate churchman Acacius of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in the hope that he would prevent the takeover of the Church of the East by the Nestorians. Acacius, despite frequent quarrels with Barsauma, was unable to prevent the victory of the powerful Nestorian faction. In August a synod was held at Beth Edraï, near Nineveh in which Barsauma and Acacius reconciled and agreed to meet again to resolve outstanding issues.

The following year the proposed council was held in Ctesiphon, however Barsauma did not participate, and the synod agreed to endorse the teachings of Theodore of Mopsuetia as official doctrine and the marriage of all clergymen. During this period, monophysitism spread throughout his archdiocese and Barsauma was faced with hostility from many Christians. Struggling to keep his see, Barsawma negotiated with Acacius to keep his seat.

After the forced closure of the School of Edessa in 489 by Emperor Zeno, Barsauma welcomed the teachers and students and reopened the School of Nisibis, becoming the key centre for Nestorianism in the East.

Barsauma died in 491, according to Bar Hebraeus he was killed by monks from Tur Abdin with the keys of their cells, however he also mentions how his tomb may be found in the Church of Mar Jacob in Nisibis.

<text>is a common name for Japanese communities in cities and towns outside Japan. Alternatively, a Japantown may be called J-town, Little Tokyo or , the first two being common names for Japantown, San Francisco, Japantown, San Jose and Little Tokyo, Los Angeles.

==History==

Historically, Japantowns represented the Japanese diaspora and its individual members known as , who are Japanese emigrants from Japan and their descendants that reside in a foreign country. Emigration from Japan first happened and was recorded as early as the 12th century to the Philippines, but did not become a mass phenomenon until the Meiji Era, when Japanese began to go to the Philippines, North America, and beginning in 1897 with 35 emigrants to Mexico; and later to Peru, beginning in 1899 with 790 emigrants. There was also significant emigration to the territories of the Empire of Japan during the colonial period; however, most such emigrants repatriated to Japan after the end of World War II in Asia.

For a brief period in the 16th–17th centuries, Japanese overseas activity and presence in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the region boomed. Sizeable Japanese communities, known as Nihonmachi, could be found in many of the major ports and political centers of the region, where they exerted significant political and economic influence.

The Japanese had been active on the seas and across the region for centuries, traveling for commercial, political, religious and other reasons. The 16th century, however, saw a dramatic increase in such travel and activity. The internal strife of the Sengoku period caused a great many people, primarily samurai, commoner merchants, and Christian refugees to seek their fortunes across the seas. Many of the samurai who fled Japan around this time were those who stood on the losing sides of various major conflicts; some were rōnin, some veterans of the Japanese invasions of Korea or of various other major conflicts. As Toyotomi Hideyoshi and later the Tokugawa shōguns issued repeated bans on Christianity, many fled the country; a significant portion of those settled in Catholic Manila.

In western countries such as Canada and the United States, the Japanese tended to integrate with society so that many if not all Japantowns are in danger of completely disappearing, with the remaining only existing in San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles, California.

==Characteristics==
The features described below are characteristic of many modern Japantowns.

===Japanese architectural styles===

Many historical Japantowns will exhibit architectural styles that reflect the Japanese culture. Japanese architecture has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (&quot;fusuma&quot;) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design.

===Japanese language===
Many Japantowns will exhibit the use of the Japanese language in signage existing on road signs and on buildings as Japanese which is the official and primary language of Japan. Japanese has a lexically distinct pitch-accent system. Early Japanese is known largely on the basis of its state in the 8th century, when the three major works of Old Japanese were compiled. The earliest attestation of the Japanese language is in a Chinese document from 252 AD.

Japanese is written with a combination of three scripts: hiragana, derived from the Chinese cursive script, katakana, derived as a shorthand from Chinese characters, and kanji, imported from China. The Latin alphabet, rōmaji, is also often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when inputting Japanese into a computer. The Hindu–Arabic numerals are generally used for numbers, but traditional Sino–Japanese numerals are also common.

==Locations==
===Americas===
Japantowns were created because of the widespread immigration of Japanese to America in the Meiji period (1868–1912). At that time, many Japanese were poor and sought economic opportunities in the United States. Japanese immigrants initially settled in Western parts of the US and Canada.

At one time, there were 43 different Japantowns in California, ranging from several square blocks of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, to one in the small farming community of Marysville in Yuba County. Besides typical businesses, these communities usually had Japanese language schools for the immigrants&#x27; children, Japanese language newspapers, Buddhist and Christian churches, and sometimes Japanese hospitals. After the World War II internment of the Japanese, most of those communities declined significantly or disappeared altogether.

There are currently four recognized Japantowns left in the United States, which are facing issues such as commercialization, reconstruction, gentrification and dwindling Japanese populations.

====Argentina====

* Colonia Urquiza is the Japanese district in La Plata, Argentina. Colonia Urquiza is the largest Japanese district in Argentina, and concentrates many institutions such as schools, restaurants and training centers.

====Brazil====

* Liberdade is the Japanese district in São Paulo, Brazil. São Paulo metropolitan area is the city that has the largest Japanese population outside Japan and the largest population of people that have Japanese descent.

====Canada====
Several Japantowns emerged in the British Columbia&#x27;s Lower Mainland during the early 20th century, including Japantown, Vancouver. Steveston in Richmond, British Columbia was another community whose population in 1942 was primarily made up of people of Japanese descent. However, these communities were dispersed after Japanese Canadians were interned during World War II.

In the early 21st century, a Little Japan has emerged around Bay and Dundas Street in Toronto, Ontario.

Canadian municipalities with Japanese populations higher than the national average (0.3%) include:
* Richmond, British Columbia (2%)
* Lethbridge, Alberta (1.9%) 
* Burnaby, British Columbia (1.7%)
* Vancouver, British Columbia (1.7%)
* North Vancouver, British Columbia (1.6%)
* North Vancouver (district municipality), British Columbia (1.5%)

====Mexico====

* Little Tokyo, Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City this neighborhood in the Cuauhtémoc district is home to many Japanese establishments from restaurants, ramen houses, Japanese bars, Japanese book stores, Japanese hotels and many other businesses catering to the Japanese community in the city as well as to the locals and tourists. Future plans for the neighborhood include a welcoming torii and Japanese style lanterns along the streets on Little Tokyo as designation markers of the &quot;Barrio Japonés&quot; and many other cultural markers. 
*Aguilas, Mexico City neighborhood in Mexico City. This part of the city is home to many Mexicans of Japanese origin.. Japanese clubs and restaurants as well as the Japanese gardens. This area was mainly settled by many Japanese during WWII as the Mexican government concentrated many Japanese nationals in this area. Today it is a thriving part of the city with many Japanese institutions for the Nikkei community. 
*Acacoyagua, Chiapas. Acacoyagua is to this day the oldest Japanese colony in Latin America. It is a colony from the late 1800s where Japan sent off citizens to populate other parts of the world because of overpopulation at the time. The Enomoto Colony tried to farm coffee seeing the success of the neighboring German colonies in the Soconusco region. The colony prospered and to this day maintains their Japanese identity in the region. A Torii has been erected to welcome visitors as many institutions and buildings have Japanese cultural markers, especially in the Central Park. The descendants are very proud of their culture and have very strong ties to Japan, including welcoming the Crown Prince of Japan And Japanese festivals.

====Peru====

* Neighborhood around the Peruvian Japanese Cultural Center in Jesús María District, Lima

====United States====
Prior to World War II, there were countless Japantowns across the country with over 40 in California alone. The mass evacuation and incarceration of Japanese Americans in the wake of Executive Order 9066 resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of Japanese American properties and businesses, effectively erasing many of the historic Japantowns across the country as their old neighborhoods were quickly occupied by new families who had moved in during their absence and were further obliterated in urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 60s.

Even the surviving Japantowns are a shadow of their former selves as later generations scattered and dispersed across the country as pre-war housing covenants began to be lifted in the 1960s, and now cater more to tourists and the greater Asian Pacific communities.

Designated Japantown areas remain in the following areas:
* Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California
* Sawtelle Japantown, Los Angeles, California
* Japantown, San Francisco, California
* Japantown, San Jose California
* Chinatown–International District, Seattle, Washington

<doc id="940181" wikidata="Q2716284" url="?curid=940181" title="Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King">
<text>The Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King (formerly CHSS-2) is a twin-engined anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter designed for shipboard use by Canadian naval forces, based on the US Navy&#x27;s SH-3 Sea King. Most CH-124s were assembled in Quebec by United Aircraft of Canada. The CH-124 served with the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and Canadian Armed Forces from 1963 to 2018.

==Design and development==
The advent of nuclear-powered submarines in the late 1950s let to the RCN assessing this new threat. While noisier than older submarines and thus detectable at longer ranges, nuclear submarines could also reach while submerged, faster than the RCN&#x27;s new destroyer escort&#x27;s top speed of . There were doubts that destroyers could effectively pursue and destroy such fast vessels, even when operating in pairs. During a 25 February 1959 Naval Board meeting, it was decided to counter the threat by operating helicopters from destroyers. The RCN examined the feasibility of operating ASW helicopters from small escorts, adding a temporary helicopter landing platform to the in mid-1956; successful trials were held in October 1956 using a Sikorsky HO4S-3. A larger temporary platform was fitted on the destroyer escort ; operational trials used an RCAF Sikorsky S-58, a much larger and heavier aircraft than the HO4S; these successful tests met with approval.

The RCN&#x27;s then current HO4S-3 utility helicopter could not operate safely in inclement weather with a heavy weapons and sensor load, which would be imperative for the ASW role; hence, a more capable aircraft was needed. Initial 1959 studies identified two helicopters that seemed suitable—the Sikorsky S-61 (HSS-2) and the Kaman K-20 (HU2K)—but neither aircraft had flown at the time, so no choice was made. After further studies concluded that the smaller Kaman would better satisfy RCN requirements, the Treasury Board approved an initial procurement of 12 HU2K helicopters for $14.5 million in December 1960.

Despite this apparent setback for Sikorsky, several factors derailed Kaman&#x27;s proposal. When the Naval Board held a follow-up meeting on 27 January 1961, it was revealed that the initial 12 units&#x27; asking price had nearly doubled to $23 million, only six weeks after approval from the Treasury Board. The Naval Board still endorsed the HU2K, but there were some misgivings over the sharp price increase and reports that Kaman&#x27;s performance projections may be overly optimistic. The Naval Board decided to await upcoming USN sea trials of the HU2K ahead of a final decision. These trials confirmed the calculations of RCN staff members; the HU2K was substantially heavier than promised, hampering performance and rendering it incapable of meeting RCN requirements, even using a proposed upgraded engine. The Sea King was ultimately chosen for production on 20 December 1961.

The first of 41 helicopters would be delivered in 1963 carrying the designation CHSS-2 Sea King. Airframe components were made by Sikorsky in Connecticut but most CHSS-2s were assembled in Longueuil, Quebec, by United Aircraft of Canada (now Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada), a subsidiary of Sikorsky&#x27;s parent company, United Aircraft. On 27 November 1963, the new landing platform aboard was used for the first operational destroyer landing of a production CHSS-2. Upon the unification of Canada&#x27;s military in 1968, the CHSS-2 was re-designated CH-124.

In the 1960s, the RCN developed a technique for landing large helicopters on small ship decks, using a &#x27;hauldown&#x27; winch (called a &quot;Beartrap&quot;), earning aircrews the nickname of &quot;Crazy Canucks&quot;. The Beartrap allows recovery of the Sea King in virtually any sea state. In 1968, the RCN, Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Army unified to form the Canadian Forces; air units were dispersed throughout the new force structure until Air Command (AIRCOM) was created in 1975. In August 2011, the Canadian Forces reverted to the former structure of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Operational service==
The Sea Kings were assigned to the former destroyers (2 per ship with total of 6), s (1 per ship with total of 12), and the former replenishment ships (3 per ship with total 6) as a means of extending the surveillance capabilities beyond the horizon. When deployed, each Sea King is accompanied by several crews. Each crew consists of two pilots, a Tactical Coordinator (TACCO), and an Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator (AESOp).

In order to find submarines, the Sea King&#x27;s sonar uses a transducer ball at the end of a 450-foot cable. It can also be fitted with FLIR to find surface vessels at night.

The CH-124 has undergone numerous refits and upgrades, especially with regard to the electronics, main gearboxes and engines, surface-search radar, secure cargo and passenger carrying capabilities.

In 2013 the CH-124 fleet averaged 9–14,000 flying hours, while Sea Kings of other fleets go as high as 40,000 hours. Although the CH-124 had frequent technical issues, none are serious, and they could maintain an 87 percent serviceability rate.

On 1 December 2018, the CH-124 was officially retired in a ceremony at Vancouver Island, British Columbia, concluding 55 years of service. Of the surviving 28 Canadian Sea Kings, nine are destined for museums or to be displayed as monuments, 15 are to be sold, three scrapped, and one retained as a training aid.

===Replacement===
From 1983 onward attempts were made to replace the aging Sea King helicopters. Due to a series of financial and political issues, the process was hampered by repeated delays. In the end the CH-148 Cyclone, a new variant of the Sikorsky H-92 Superhawk was selected.

==Variants==

;CH-124 : Anti-submarine warfare helicopter for the Royal Canadian Navy (41 assembled by United Aircraft of Canada).
;CH-124A : The Sea King Improvement Program (SKIP) added modernized avionics as well as improved safety features.
;CH-124B : Alternate version of the CH-124A without a dipping sonar but formerly with a MAD sensor and additional storage for deployable stores. In 2006, the five aircraft of this variant were converted to support the Standing Contingency Task Force (SCTF), and were modified with additional troop seats, and frequency agile radios. Plans to add fast-rope capability, EAPSNIPS (Engine Air Particle Separator / Snow &amp; Ice Particle Separator) did not come to fruition.
;CH-124B2 : Six CH-124Bs were upgraded to the CH-124B2 standard in 1991–1992. The revised CH-124B2 retained the sonobuoy processing gear to passively detect submarines but, the aircraft was now also fitted with a towed-array sonar to supplement the ship&#x27;s sonar. Since anti-submarine warfare is no longer a major priority within the Canadian Forces, the CH-124B2 were refitted again to become improvised troop carriers for the newly formed Standing Contingency Task Force.
;CH-124C : One CH-124 operated by the Helicopter Operational Test and Evaluation Facility located at CFB Shearwater. Used for testing new gear, and when not testing new gear, it is deployable to any Canadian Forces ship requiring a helicopter.
;CH-124U : Unofficial designation for four CH-124s that were modified for passenger/freight transport. One crashed in 1973, and the survivors were later refitted to become CH-124As.

<text>Brayley is a lunar impact crater located in the southwest part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after British geographer Edward W. Brayley in 1935. It has a circular rim and a low rise in the center. There are no notable craters overlapping the rim or interior. The sinuous rille Rima Brayley passes to the north of Brayley.

Brayley is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brayley.

<doc id="940184" wikidata="Q251297" url="?curid=940184" title="613 (number)">
<text>613 (six hundred [and] thirteen) is the natural number following 612 and preceding 614.

==Mathematical properties==
613 is a prime number, the first number of prime triplet (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot; + 4, &quot;p&quot; + 6), middle number of sexy prime triple (&quot;p&quot; − 6, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot; + 6). It is the index of a prime Lucas number.

613 is a centered square number with 18 per side, a circular number of 21 with a square grid and 27 using a triangular grid. It is also 17-gonal.

613 is the sum of squares of two consecutive integers, 17 and 18, and is also a lucky number and thus a lucky prime.

==Judaism==
The 613 commandments (: &quot;taryag mitzvot&quot;, &quot;613 Mitzvot&quot;): 613 is the traditional number of mitzvot in the Jewish Torah, even though the actual number of commands exceeds 2,000, such that the number 613 reflects some underlying yet unstated concept. Indeed, the earliest extant mention of this traditional number is found in Tractate Makkot (on page 23b) in the Talmud, where Rav Simla&#x27;i reports the number without a source.

Some Jewish commentaries equate the curtains of the Mishkan (i.e. the Tabernacle) with the commandments. Each curtain was 112 square cubits (4x28)—and 613 is the 112th prime number.

In Kabbalah, the number 613 is very significant, with every complete entity seen as being divisible into 613 parts: 613 parts to every Sefirah; 613 parts to each of the divine mitzvot in the Torah; and 613 parts to the human body (which is also stated by R. Simla&#x27;i in the Talmudic passage noted above). 

Starting in the 19th century, some Jewish sources claim that there is a tradition that pomegranates have 613 seeds, though this is clearly symbolic as there is no fixed number, and it is generally about 1,000 seeds in reality.

==Other occurrences==
The number 613 hangs from the rafters at Madison Square Garden in honor of legendary New York Knicks coach Red Holzman&#x27;s 613 victories.

In &quot;Scandal&quot;, the secret agency is known as B613.

Each increasing level represents an accident approximately ten times as severe as the previous level. Compared to earthquakes, where the event intensity can be quantitatively evaluated, the level of severity of a human-made disaster, such as a nuclear accident, is more subject to interpretation. Because of this subjectivity, the INES level of an incident is assigned well after the fact. The scale is therefore intended to assist in disaster-aid deployment.

== Details ==
A number of criteria and indicators are defined to assure coherent reporting of nuclear events by different official authorities. There are seven nonzero levels on the INES scale: three &quot;incident&quot;-levels and four &quot;accident&quot;-levels. There is also a level 0.

The level on the scale is determined by the highest of three scores: off-site effects, on-site effects, and defense in depth degradation.


== Out of scale ==
There are also events of no safety relevance, characterized as &quot;out of scale&quot;.
:Examples:
:* 5 March 1999: San Onofre, United States: Discovery of suspicious item, originally thought to be a bomb, in nuclear power plant.
:* 29 September 1999: H.B. Robinson, United States: A tornado sighting within the protected area of the nuclear power plant.
:* 17 November 2002, Natural Uranium Oxide Fuel Plant at the Nuclear Fuel Complex in Hyderabad, India: A chemical explosion at a fuel fabrication facility.

== Criticism ==
Deficiencies in the existing INES have emerged through comparisons between the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which had severe and widespread consequences to humans and the environment, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which caused one fatality and comparatively small (10%) release of radiological material into the environment. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was originally rated as INES 5, but then upgraded to INES 7 (the highest level) when the events of units 1, 2 and 3 were combined into a single event and the combined release of radiological material was the determining factor for the INES rating.

One study found that the INES scale of the IAEA is highly inconsistent, and the scores provided by the IAEA incomplete, with many events not having an INES rating. Further, the actual accident damage values do not reflect the INES scores. A quantifiable, continuous scale might be preferable to the INES.

Three arguments have been made: First, the scale is essentially a discrete qualitative ranking, not defined beyond event level 7. Second, it was designed as a public relations tool, not an objective scientific scale. Third, its most serious shortcoming is that it conflates magnitude and intensity. An alternative nuclear accident magnitude scale (NAMS) was proposed by British nuclear safety expert David Smythe to address these issues.

==Alternatives==
=== Nuclear Accident Magnitude Scale ===
The Nuclear Accident Magnitude Scale (NAMS) is an alternative to INES, proposed by David Smythe in 2011 as a response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. There were some concerns that INES was used in a confusing manner, and NAMS was intended to address the perceived INES shortcomings.

As Smythe pointed out, the INES scale ends at 7; a more severe accident than Fukushima in 2011 or Chernobyl in 1986 would also be measured as INES category 7. In addition, it is discontinuous, not allowing a fine-grained comparison of nuclear incidents and accidents. But the most pressing item identified by Smythe is that INES conflates magnitude with intensity; a distinction long made by seismologists to compare earthquakes. In that subject area, magnitude describes the physical energy released by an earthquake, while the intensity focuses on the effects of the earthquake. By analogy, a nuclear incident with a high magnitude (e.g. a core meltdown) may not result in an intense radioactive contamination, as the incident at the Swiss research reactor in Lucens shows – yet it resides in INES category 4, together with the Windscale fire of 1957, which caused significant contamination outside of its facility.

==== Definition ====
The definition of the NAMS scale is:

: NAMS = log10(20 × R)

with R being the radioactivity being released in terabecquerels, calculated as the equivalent dose of iodine-131. Furthermore, only the atmospheric release affecting the area &quot;outside&quot; the nuclear facility is considered for calculating the NAMS, giving a NAMS score of 0 to all incidents which do not affect the outside. The factor of 20 assures that both the INES and the NAMS scales reside in a similar range, aiding a comparison between accidents. An atmospheric release of any radioactivity will only occur in the INES categories 4 to 7, while NAMS does not have such a limitation.

The NAMS scale still does not take into account the radioactive contamination of liquids such as an ocean, sea, river or groundwater pollution in proximity to any nuclear power plant.

The estimation of magnitude seems to be related to the problematic definition of a radiological equivalence between different types of involved isotopes and the variety of paths by which activity might eventually be ingested, e.g. eating fish or through the food chain.

Smythe lists these incidents: Chernobyl, former USSR 1986 (M = 8.0), Three Mile Island, USA (M = 7.9), Fukushima-Daiichi, Japan 2011 (M = 7.5), Kyshtym, former USSR 1957 (M = 7.3).

<doc id="940190" wikidata="Q1500165" url="?curid=940190" title="Xiphos">
<text>The xiphos ( ; plural xiphe, ) is a double-edged, one-handed Iron Age straight shortsword used by the ancient Greeks. It was a secondary battlefield weapon for the Greek armies after the dory or javelin. The classic blade was generally about long, although the Spartans supposedly preferred to use blades as short as around the era of the Greco-Persian Wars.

== Etymology ==

Stone&#x27;s &quot;Glossary&quot; has &quot;xiphos&quot; being a name used by Homer for a sword. The entry in the book says that the sword had a double-edged blade widest at about two-thirds of its length from the point, and ending in a very long point. 

The word is attested in Mycenaean Greek Linear B form as , &quot;&quot;. A relation to Arabic &quot;saifun&quot; (&#x27;a sword&#x27;) and Egyptian &quot;sēfet&quot; has been suggested, although this does not explain the presence of a labiovelar in Mycenaean. One suggestion connects Ossetic &quot;äxsirf&quot; &quot;sickle&quot;, which would point to a virtual Indo-European &quot;*kwsibhro-&quot;.

== Construction ==
Most &quot;xiphe&quot; handles followed a two-piece construction (similar to a knife) using either native woods or, for more exotic imports, ebony and animal bone. The two slabs were attached to the tang of the sword, secured via two or three pins and then made smooth via filing giving the characteristic oval shape of a &quot;xiphos&quot; grip. Hand guards usually followed a &quot;bridge&quot; shape and were either also of organic material or iron or a combination of both, also secured via pins on each point. Some swords found in Italy or Macedonia tended to have an iron extension/reinforcement running along the handle (see picture of modern reconstruction of a &quot;xiphos&quot; made by Manning Imperial above).

There have been finds of &quot;xiphe&quot; with hilts decorated with gold foil. These swords were most likely ceremonial since they are always found in burial sites.

Surviving &quot;xiphe&quot; are relatively rare, but appear alongside iron weapons in burial sites, indicating both a household status and continued use into the Iron Age.

==History==

The period between the Classical and Iron Ages is often referred to as a &quot;dark age&quot;, but it featured important developments and innovations in metal casting, alloy construction, and procurement as widespread use of metallurgy slowly spread out of Iberia.

The xiphos sometimes has a midrib, and is diamond or lenticular in cross-section. It was a rather light weapon, with a weight around . It was generally hung from a baldric under the left arm. The &quot;xiphos&quot; was generally used only when the spear was broken, taken by the enemy, or discarded for close combat. Very few &quot;xiphe&quot; are known to have survived.

The &quot;xiphos&quot;″s leaf-shaped design lent itself to both cutting and thrusting. The origin of the design goes back to the Bronze Age; the blade of the &quot;xiphos&quot; looks almost identical to the blade of the Mycenaean Naue II sword, which itself transitioned from having a blade of bronze into a blade of iron during the Archaic period. It is likely that the &quot;xiphos&quot; is the natural evolution of the iron version of the Naue II but with a more sophisticated handle design.

The leaf-shaped short swords were not limited to Greece, as mentioned, but can be found throughout Europe in the late Bronze Age under various names.

The early Celtic La Tène short sword, contemporary with the &quot;xiphos&quot;, had a virtually identical blade design as the &quot;xiphos&quot;.

== Bronze sword myth ==

Contrary to popular belief, no example of a &quot;xiphos&quot; made from bronze has ever been found. The several whole or partial &quot;xiphe&quot; blades found in places such as Olympia, Macedonia and Southern Italy were all made exclusively from iron. Furthermore &quot;Xiphos&quot; swords only began to appear centuries after typical Bronze Age weapons - such as the Naue II - had transitioned from bronze to iron. In reality the Bronze Age sword during the Bronze Age was a completely different weapon, and Xiphe were not developed until after the end of the Bronze Age circa 1200 BCE. Researchers think the misidentification of Bronze Age ornaments has created the modern-day myth that the &quot;xiphe&quot; were ever cast in bronze.

<text>The GNU Core Utilities or coreutils is a package of GNU software containing implementations for many of the basic tools, such as cat, ls, and rm, which are used on Unix-like operating systems. 

In September 2002, the &quot;GNU coreutils&quot; were created by merging the earlier packages &quot;textutils&quot;, &quot;shellutils&quot;, and &quot;fileutils&quot;, along with some other miscellaneous utilities. In July 2007, the license of the GNU coreutils was updated from GPL-2.0-or-later to GPL-3.0-or-later.

The GNU core utilities support long options as parameters to the commands, as well as the relaxed convention allowing options even after the regular arguments (unless the environment variable is set). This environment variable enables a different functionality in BSD.

See the List of GNU Core Utilities commands for a brief description of included commands.

Alternative implementation packages are available in the FOSS ecosystem, with a slightly different scope and focus (less functionality), or license. For example, BusyBox which is licensed under GPL-2.0-only, and Toybox which is licensed under 0BSD.

==History==
In 1990, David MacKenzie announced &quot;GNU fileutils&quot;.

In 1991, MacKenzie announced &quot;GNU shellutils&quot; and &quot;GNU textutils&quot;. Moreover, Jim Meyering became the maintainer of the packages (known now as coreutils) and has remained so since.

In 2002, Meyering announced &quot;GNU coreutils&quot; as a merger of the earlier packages textutils, shellutils, and fileutils, along with some other miscellaneous utilities.

<text>Bedd Arthur (&quot;Arthur&#x27;s Grave&quot;) is a possibly Neolithic hengiform monument megalithic site in the Preseli Hills in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Thirteen upright stones and at least 2 fallen ones, each around high form an oval horseshoe with similarities to the earliest form of Stonehenge.

== Description ==
Bedd Arthur consists of a barely visible oval bank and ditch, with thirteen standing stones, none higher than arranged inside along with two further fallen stones. The stone layout measures around . The shape is not well defined and is generally described as sub-rectangular but has been described as a rectangle, a horseshoe, an oval and a pointed ellipse. Such arrangements of stones are also found at a site known as the &#x27;Churchyard&#x27; on Skomer Island, and were adopted at Stonehenge, for which and Bedd Arthur has been speculatively suggested as a prototype.

The stones appear to be leaning inwards, suggesting that they were originally placed on the flanks of a mound which has since disappeared. There is also one &quot;truncated end&quot;, similar to the portal on some elongated Neolithic burial mounds. There may have been a burial chamber in the middle of the stone setting: it would not be exceptional for the mound itself to have been removed by erosion or grave hunters, as may have happened to the Bedd yr Afanc passage grave on the northern side of Mynydd Preseli.

==Name==
It is one of many sites in the British Isles to be claimed by local folklore as the burial place of King Arthur. The name Bedd Arthur means Arthur&#x27;s Grave. There are numerous prehistoric sites around Pembrokeshire, claiming an association with Arthur. In the vicinity of Bedd Arthur, there are the Cromlechau Meibion Arthur in Nevern, Garn Arthur and Cerrig Meibion Arthur in Mynachiog-Ddu, and Bwrdd Arthur in Llanboidy

==Stonehenge connection==
It sits on top of the Preseli ridge and overlooks the rocky outcrop of Carn Menyn, a site that has been suggested as a source for some of the bluestones used at Stonehenge. A 2011 study of a particular group of the Stonehenge bluestones made of a Rhyolite material identified a geological match with an outcrop at Rhosyfelin, north of Bedd Arthur. On the other hand, a 2015 archaeological studies at Rhosyfelin failed to identify any signs of quarrying, which appears to promote the possibility of the stones as glacial erratics carried east on an ice-flow, rather than a neolithic cultural link between the two places.

==Site==
The site has not been excavated and is absent from authoritative surveys. Its authenticity as a site, and any relationship to Stonehenge or local sources of stone are therefore unconfirmed.

The site is in Eglwyswrw community, and is a Scheduled monument with legal protection from disturbance and is within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.

<text>Carlini is a small lunar impact crater located in the Mare Imbrium. It was named after Italian astronomer Francesco Carlini. The crater is bowl-shaped with a small central floor. It has a higher albedo than the surrounding mare, making it prominent due to its isolated location. To the south is a wrinkle ridge named Dorsum Zirkel, and farther south lies the peak Mons La Hire.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Carlini.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Carlini B — &quot;See&quot; McDonald (crater).

<text>Starcross is a village with a 2021 census recorded population of 1,694 situated on the west shore of the Exe Estuary in Teignbridge in the English county of Devon. The village is popular in summer with leisure craft, and is home to one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s oldest sailing clubs.

The A379 road and the London to Penzance railway line both run through the village along the banks of the estuary. Starcross railway station is situated on the railway, and the Starcross to Exmouth Ferry, a small passenger ferry, operates across the estuary to Exmouth.

A notable feature of Starcross is the Italianate pumping engine house, the best surviving building from Brunel&#x27;s unsuccessful Atmospheric Railway. The enterprise is commemorated in the &quot;Atmospheric Railway&quot; pub located opposite the present-day railway station. Note that the Brunel pumphouse now houses the Starcross Fishing and Cruising Club rather than a museum dedicated to the atmospheric railway, as quoted in many guide books.

St. Paul&#x27;s Church is found on Church Street, opposite the Almshouses. It was mentioned in Piggott and Co.&#x27;s pocket atlas, topography and gazetteer of England 1840 as St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel.

Powderham Castle is located north of Starcross on the A379 road towards the village of Kenton.

<doc id="940235" wikidata="Q7318753" url="?curid=940235" title="Revolutionary Communist League (Internationalist)">
<text>The Revolutionary Communist League (Internationalist) was a small Trotskyist group in the US which existed in various forms between 1968 and the mid 1990s.

== History ==
Though they considered their ideological origins to be in the &quot;Global Class War Tendency&quot; which was led by Sam Marcy and Vincent Copeland within the Socialist Workers Party from 1948–1959, organizationally it began as a splinter of the Spartacist League in 1968. This first incarnation was simply known as the Revolutionary Communist League, and had a more &quot;activist&quot; orientation than the SL. They collaborated with the Workers World Party, Youth Against War and Fascism and other New Left elements within a united front group called the Coalition for an Anti-imperialist Movement or CO-AIM.

The original RCL merged with the WWP later that year. However they quickly found the WWP internal atmosphere &quot;stultifying&quot; and its commitment to world revolution &quot;decayed beyond belief&quot;. They began to drift out during 1971 and established the New York Revolutionary Committee, which published several issues of a periodical called &quot;Common Ground&quot;. A year later this &quot;evolution culminated in what was essentially a rebirth of the old RCL&quot; adding (Internationalist) to the end of their name to reflect the development they had gone through. It originally had branches in New York City, Boston, and New Haven, but after several years the organization had only its New Haven group. Its publication was the &quot;Internationalist Worker&quot; and the &quot;Internationalist Worker Newsletter&quot;.

They attempted re-entry into the WWP in 1982, but were rejected in December of that year. In 1986 RCL(I) merged with Socialist Action. However, the group was soon to be expelled from SA. Later the group joined the Communist Party USA.

== Ideology ==
The RCL(I) defended various violent actions by New Leftists in the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1972 they stated that they &quot;Unconditionally and with only the most marginal political criticism - all oriented toward integrating military policy with an overall revolutionary strategy&quot; supported the Days of Rage, the bombing of defense research facilities on campus, the campaigns of the Weathermen and Black Liberation Army. In 1974, they announced that they supported the Symbionese Liberation Army as well.

On international issues it strongly supported the degenerated workers&#x27; states, even while advocating a change within them. They supported the Soviet Unions suppression of the Prague Spring, the strengthening of the Warsaw Pact, a healing of the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet and Chinese aid to defend the Korean, Cuban and Yemeni workers states, as well as revolutionary and national liberation struggles, and opposed Détente as an imperialist maneuver. Within the workers states they advocated a &quot;rearming of the masses&quot; into &quot;peoples militias&quot;, the abolition of privileges for bureaucrats and the &quot;restoration of Marxism-Leninism&quot;.

RCL-(I) viewed the Workers World Party as having abandoned Trotskyism to its political detriment..

== Activism ==
In the 1974, RCL-(I) organized the New Haven Political Defense Committee (NHPPDC) to defend a group of three Black Liberation Army members who were arrested in New Haven after a bank robbery and the shooting of a security guard.

<doc id="940236" wikidata="Q514022" url="?curid=940236" title="Hispanophone">
<text>Hispanophone refers to anything related to the Spanish language.

In a cultural, rather than merely linguistic sense, the notion of &quot;Hispanophone&quot; goes further than the above definition. The Hispanic culture is the legacy of the vast and prolonged Spanish Empire, and so the term can refer to people whose cultural background is primarily associated with Spain, regardless of racial or geographical differences. The whole sense of identity of the Hispanic population and the Hispanophones is sometimes referred by the term &quot;Hispanidad&quot; (Hispanicity).

When used in terms to refer to speakers of the Spanish language and the Spanish-speaking world, the Hispanosphere encompasses the following geographical areas: Spain, Hispanic America, Equatorial Guinea, and portions of the United States (namely the Southwest and Florida). When used in the broader sense to include areas where the local culture has been heavily impacted by Hispanic influences, the former Spanish East Indies colonies of Philippines and to a lesser extent, Guam are also included. 

The terms are derived from the Latin word &quot;Hispanicus&quot; (&quot;Spanish&quot;) which refers to anything pertaining to the Roman province of Hispania (&quot;Spain&quot;). In addition to the general definition of Hispanophone, some groups in the Hispanic world make a distinction between Castilian-speaking and Spanish-speaking, with the former term denoting the speakers of the Spanish language—also known as Castilian—and the latter the speakers of the Spanish or Hispanic languages (i.e. the languages of Spain or the languages of the Hispanic nations).

==The Hispanosphere==
There are an estimated 474.7 million native Spanish speakers and about 100 million second and foreign language speakers around the world as of 2022, totaling 574 million Hispanophones in total. This makes Spanish the second most natively spoken language and fourth most spoken language overall globally. The vast majority of Hispanophones are concentrated in the Hispanosphere, the countries and territories where Spanish is a native or significant language.

===Countries===

During the Spanish period between 1492 and 1898, many people from Spain migrated to the new lands they had conquered. The Spaniards took with them their language and culture, and integrated within the society they had settled, creating a large empire that stretched all over the world and producing several multiracial populations. Their influences are found in the following continents and countries that were originally colonized by the Spaniards.

==Geographic distribution of Spanish speakers==
===Europe===
====Spain====


The modern-day nationalities that live in the region of ancient Hispania are the Portuguese, Spanish, Andorran and Gibraltarian people. Historically, the modern country of Spain was formed by the accretion of several independent Iberian kingdoms through dynastic inheritance, conquest and the will of the local elites. These kingdoms had their own nationalistic loyalties and political borders.

Today, there is no single Castilian–Spanish identity for the whole country. Spain is a &quot;de facto&quot; plurinational state. Many Spanish citizens feel no conflict in recognising their multiple ethnic identities at the same time. Spain is a culturally heterogeneous country, home to a wide range of cultures, each one with its own customs and traditions. Some such cultures have their own language. Since the beginning of the transition to democracy in Spain and the creation of the Spanish &quot;autonomous communities&quot;, after Francoist Spain, there have been many movements towards more autonomy (delegation of powers) in certain territories of the country, some with the aim of achieving full independence and others with the goal of improving the system of devolution and the state of the autonomies (or self-government entities).

The existence of multiple distinct cultures in Spain allows an analogy to be drawn to the United Kingdom. Using the term Spanish for someone of Spanish descent would then be expected to be equivalent to using Briton to describe someone descending from some part of the United Kingdom. Cultures within the United Kingdom, such as English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh, would then correspond in this analogy to cultures within Spain such as Castilian, Catalan, Galician and Basque among others. In contrast with Spain, because of centuries of gradual and mutual consolidation across the Iberian Peninsula, such distinctions tend to be blurred. It is a subtle, yet important, distinction.

In Spain, as in the United Kingdom, the economically dominant territories—Castile and England—spread their language for mutual communication. However, the political dominance in the United Kingdom tends to be sharper compared to Spain, where most of medieval realms do not correspond with the actual boundaries of the autonomous communities, and the crown was unified into a sole monarch.

===Americas===
====Hispanic America====

Spanish is the most widely-spoken language of the Americas, as well as the official language in a great part of the Americas.

====United States====

====Origins and demography====

U.S. Hispanics are citizens of the United States whose ancestry or national origin is of any of the nations composing the Hispanosphere. A Hispanic person&#x27;s status is independent from whether or not he or she speaks the Spanish language, for not all Hispanic Americans speak Spanish. A Hispanic person may be of any race (White, Amerindian, mixed, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander). Hispanics accounted for 17.1% of the population, around 53.2 million people. This was an increase of 29% since 2004, when Hispanics were 14.1% of the population (around 41.3 million people). The Hispanic growth rate over the July 1, 2003 to July 1, 2004, period was 3.6% — higher than any other ancestral group in the United States — and more than three times the rate of the nation&#x27;s total population (at 1.0%). The projected Hispanic population of the United States for July 1, 2050, is 105.6 million people. According to this projection, Hispanics will constitute 25% of the nation&#x27;s total population by the year 2050.

Historically, a continuous Hispanic presence in the territory of the United States has existed since the 16th century, earlier than any other group after the Amerindians. Spaniards pioneered the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing on the continent was that of Juan Ponce de León, who landed in 1513 on the shore he christened &quot;La Florida&quot;. Within three decades of Ponce de León&#x27;s landing, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon, and the Great Plains. Spanish ships sailed along the East Coast, penetrating to present-day Bangor, Maine, and up the Pacific Coast as far as Oregon.

In 1540 Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of the present United States. In the same year Francisco Vásquez de Coronado led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today&#x27;s Arizona–Mexico border and traveled as far as central Kansas, close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the United States make up a long list that includes, among others, Lucas Vásquez de Ayllón, Pánfilo de Narváez, Sebastián Vizcaíno, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, Gaspar de Portolà, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Tristán de Luna y Arellano, and Juan de Oñate. In all, Spaniards probed half of today&#x27;s lower 48 states before the first English colonization attempt at Roanoke Island in 1585.

The Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565. Santa Fe, New Mexico also predates Jamestown, Virginia (founded in 1607) and Plymouth Colony (of &quot;Mayflower&quot; and Pilgrims fame, founded in 1620). Later came Spanish settlements in San Antonio, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, to name just a few. The Spanish even established a Jesuit mission in Virginia&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay 37 years before the founding of Jamestown.

Two iconic American stories have Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before John Smith&#x27;s alleged rescue by Pocahontas, a man by the name of Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from execution by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a thanksgiving—56 years before the famous Pilgrims festival—when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and garbanzo beans. As late as 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War, Spain held claim to roughly half of today&#x27;s continental United States (see New Spain); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached Alaska. From 1819 to 1848, the United States increased the nation&#x27;s area by roughly a third of former Spanish and Mexican territory, including today&#x27;s three most populous states: California, Texas, and Florida. Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired Southwest territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century, and a large minority in the 21st century.

Hispanic Americans have fought in all the wars of the United States and have earned some of the highest distinctions awarded to U.S. soldiers (list of Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients). Historic figures in the United States have been Hispanic from early times. Some recent famous people of Hispanic descent in the U.S. include actress Rita Hayworth, singer Linda Ronstadt, and baseball legends Lefty Gomez and Ted Williams.

====National Hispanic Heritage Month====
The National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated in the United States from September 15 to October 15.

====Diversity====
The people of Hispanophone countries encompass many different ethnic backgrounds. Though in countries like the United States, Hispanics may often be stereotyped as having a typical Mediterranean/Amerindian/Southern European appearance - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.

Most Hispanics in the United States have their origins in countries such as El Salvador, Cuba, and Mexico, with 90% of Salvadorans, 95% of Paraguayans, and 70% of Mexicans identifying as mestizo, with Mexico having the largest total mestizo population at over 66 million.

In the United States, Hispanics, regardless of self-identified racial background, are labeled &quot;Hispanic&quot; by the U.S. census. They may have varying of European ancestry, such as Spanish origins, and Amerindian or African roots. From 1850 to 1920, the U.S. Census form did not distinguish between whites and Mexican Americans. In 1930, the U.S. Census form asked for &quot;color or race&quot;, and census enumerators were instructed to write &quot;W&quot; for white and &quot;Mex&quot; for Mexican. In 1940 and 1950, the census reverted its decision and made Mexicans be classified as white again and thus the instructions were to &quot;Report &quot;white&quot; (W) for Mexicans unless they were definitely of full Indigenous Indian or other non-white races (such as Black or Asian).&quot;)

Of the over 35 million Hispanics counted in the Federal 2000 Census, 47.9% identified as White (termed White Hispanic by the Census Bureau); 42.2% some other race; 6.3% two or more races; 2% Black or African American; 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native; 0.3% Asian; and 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Even among those Hispanics who reported one race only, most would also possess at least some ancestral lineage from one or more other races, despite the fact that only 6.3% reported as such (this is also applicable to the non-Hispanics counted in the U.S. Census, although maybe in less proportion).

According to one study (Stephens et al. 2001), from the genetic perspective, Hispanics generally represent a differential mixture of European, Native American, and African ancestry, with the proportionate mix typically depending on country of origin.

The populations of Iberia (both Spain and Portugal), like all European populations, have received multiple other influences, even though they are still largely descended from the prehistoric European populations, and to a greater degree than any other major group.

===Africa===
====Equatorial Guinea====

In the former Spanish province of Equatorial Guinea, although Portuguese and French are co-official languages, the majority of the population speak Spanish. There is a small minority of African people who possessed Spanish and other European ancestry. These individuals form less than 1% of the population.

====Morocco====

Portions of the north coast of Morocco were a former Spanish protectorate and Spanish remains spoken by about 1.7 million people as of 2018. This makes Morocco the country with the most Spanish speakers outside the Hispanophone world unless the United States is excluded. However, demand for Spanish and overall competency in the language has fallen since the start of the 21st century and the most popular foreign language is now English (as French is considered a second and mandatory language in the country).

====Spanish territories in North Africa====
Since the Reconquista, Spain has held numerous emplacements in North Africa. Most of them were promptly lost, but to date, with an approximate population of 143,000 people, the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which constitute the two &quot;plazas de soberanía mayores&quot; (Major Territories under [Spanish] Sovereignty) remained Spanish, and the Chafarinas Islands, the Peñón de Alhucemas and the Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, which constitute the three &quot;plazas de soberanía menores&quot; (Minor Territories under [Spanish] Sovereignty), still forming part of Spain. The Canary Islands, a constituent part of Spain&#x27;s main territorial subdivisions, are also located in North Africa.

====Western Sahara====

Spanish is maintained as a secondary language alongside the official Arabic in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, a partially recognized state that claims Western Sahara, whose territory formerly comprised the Spanish colony of Spanish Sahara and now is mostly occupied by Morocco. However, Spanish is not a native language in the territory, and the Moroccan government uses Arabic and French in its administration of Western Sahara and the number of Spanish speakers in the territory itself is rather trivial compared to the former two languages.

===Asia===
====Philippines====

In the Philippines, the Spanish Filipino population which mostly descends from those Spanish colonists who arrived during the Spanish colonial period remains influential in Filipino society despite its small numbers. However, the vast majority of Spanish Filipinos today no longer speak Spanish. Instead, most now exclusively speak Tagalog or other local Philippine languages and English. Nevertheless, the only Spanish-based creole language in Asia called Chavacano was developed on the islands and is spoken by roughly a million people.

Section 7, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifies Spanish (along with Arabic) a language to &quot;be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis&quot;, while the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language () remains the state regulating body for the language. Castilian Spanish is the sole dialectal standard taught in schools, while Philippine Spanish (the local variant of the language which developed during the colonial era) currently has a few thousand native speakers left and is close to extinction.

Despite its rapid decline in the 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in the Spanish language since the first decade of the 21st century among select circles. Under the rule of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (herself a fluent speaker), Spanish was re-introduced into the educational system as an elective language in secondary schools. Nevertheless, the Spanish language&#x27;s presence in the country and its cultural influence continues to decline and is no longer present in daily life outside the numerous loanwords of Spanish origin in Philippine languages.

===Pacific Islands===
====Easter Island (Rapa Nui)====
Spanish is the official language of Easter Island, a territorial possession of Chile in Polynesia.

====Mariana Islands====

The Mariana Islands (today split between the United States territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) were formerly governed as a part of the Spanish East Indies, and thus many Chamorros possess some degree of Spanish admixture.

While most people living on these islands no longer speak Spanish, the native Chamorro language exhibits a noticeable Spanish influence in its vocabulary. Many Chamorros have also preserved Hispanic cultural elements such as fiestas, cockfighting, and the Catholic faith despite having integrated with the American way of life.

Spanish surnames are still prevalent on Guam, it is spoken by Catholic people and Puerto Ricans, and the custom of women keeping their maiden names after marriage is a both byproduct of Spanish culture on these islands as well as the matrilineal structure of indigenous Chamorro culture.

===Antarctica===

In Antarctica, there are only two civilian localities and both are inhabited primarily by native Spanish speakers. One of them is the Argentine Fortín Sargento Cabral, which has 66 inhabitants. The other is the Chilean town of Villa Las Estrellas, which has a population of 150 inhabitants in summer and 80 inhabitants in winter. In each of them there is a school where students study and do research in Spanish. The Orcadas Base, an Argentine scientific station, is the oldest base in all of Antarctica still in operation and the oldest with a permanent population (since 1907).

The following countries operate scientific bases in Antarctica:

==Religion==
The Spanish and the Portuguese took the Christian faith to their colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia; Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A significant minority of Spanish speakers are also either Protestant or not affiliated with any religion.

<text>Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima (born 4 July 1969) is a Brazilian retired long-distance runner. He was born in Cruzeiro do Oeste, Paraná. While leading the marathon after at the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was attacked on the course by Irish former priest Cornelius &quot;Neil&quot; Horan. Following the incident, Lima fell from first to third place, eventually winning the bronze medal. He was later awarded the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for his sportsmanship shown in that race.

Lima won the Tokyo International Marathon in 1996 and the Hamburg Marathon in 2004. He won the South American Cross Country Championships in 1995, and the marathon at the Pan American Games consecutively in 1999 and 2003. He lit the Olympic cauldron and carried the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==Professional career==
Lima started out as a cross country runner, representing Brazil at the 1989 and 1992 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. He won a bronze medal at the 1993 South American Cross Country Championships before going on to win the competition in 1995.

Lima won his first marathon in 1996, taking the Tokyo International Marathon title. He attended his first Summer Olympics that same year, running in the marathon at the 1996 Atlanta Games and finishing in 47th place. His first world appearance followed a year later at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics, where he finished 23rd. He set a personal best of 2:08:31 at the 1998 Tokyo Marathon, finishing second behind Alberto Juzdado.

Lima was a two-time Pan American champion, running 2:17:20 at the 1999 Games and 2:19:08 for the second victory at the 2003 Games. He began the 2004 season with a win (2:09:39) at the Hamburg Marathon.

===Attack at 2004 Summer Olympics===
On 29 August 2004, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Lima was attempting to become the first Brazilian to win an Olympic gold medal in the marathon. Soon after the mark, holding a lead of around 25 seconds, Lima was halted and grappled with by spectator Neil Horan, an Irish priest who was later defrocked. Horan had previously disrupted the 2003 Formula One British Grand Prix by running onto the Silverstone track. Greek spectator Polyvios Kossivas helped free Lima from Horan&#x27;s grasp and help Lima resume running. Horan said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t doing it as a prank, I was doing it to spread the gospel and to prepare people for the Second Coming.&quot;

Lima lost about 5–10 seconds in the incident, and he was passed by Italian Stefano Baldini (2:10:55) and American Meb Keflezighi (2:11:29) later at the mark. Lima ultimately finished third with a time of 2:12:11, winning the bronze medal. The Brazilian Athletics Confederation launched an appeal on behalf of Lima with president claiming that &quot;someone took him out of the race and we are asking for a gold medal for our athlete... solutions like that have been done in the past for other events.&quot; The appeal was rejected.

At the closing of the event, the International Olympic Committee awarded Lima the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for the spirit of sportsmanship. The medal was officially presented to Lima on 7 December in Rio de Janeiro, during a formal ceremony organized on a yearly basis by the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) during the Prêmio Brasil Olímpico. Lima was also named Brazilian Athlete of the Year in 2004, receiving the trophy presented by the COB at the same time as the Pierre de Coubertin Medal. His award was the first occasion in which the winner was selected by online popular vote.

===Post-Olympic career===

Lima ran at the world championships for a second time, but did not finish in the 2005 World marathon race. He took part in the 2005 Saint Silvester Road Race that same year but only managed to finish in 14th place. Lima attempted to defend his title at the 2007 Pan American Games, but dropped out with muscular problems at the 37-kilometer mark. He retired as a marathoner after running the Paris Marathon in April 2009.

Lima&#x27;s biography was written by Renata Adrião D&#x27;Angelo, &quot;Vanderlei de Lima - A Maratona de uma Vida (A Marathon of Life)&quot;, printed in Brazil by Casa da Palavra, in 2007. Lima took part in the 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay in Brasília. In August 2016, he received the honor of lighting the Olympic Flame at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro during the Opening Ceremonies.

<text>Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul is the sixth studio album by the American rock band the Replacements, released on February 1, 1989, by Sire Records.

==Recording and release==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; was the first Replacements album featuring Bob &quot;Slim&quot; Dunlap, who replaced founding guitarist Bob Stinson in early 1987. The album was recorded at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles and produced by Matt Wallace and the band. It was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge, who decided to give the record &quot;a three-dimensional, radio-ready sound&quot;. However, singer and guitarist Paul Westerberg was not satisfied with the new direction, commenting: &quot;I thought the little things I&#x27;d cut in my basement were closer to what I wanted.&quot;

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; was released on February 1, 1989 by Sire Records. The song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be You&quot; was released as a single. This proved to be the band&#x27;s only appearance on the Billboard Hot 100: the song peaked at #51 on the May 13, 1989 chart.

In 2008, the album was remastered and reissued by Rhino Entertainment with 7 additional tracks and liner notes by Peter Jesperson. In September 2019, Rhino released &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Pop&quot;, a box set featuring a remixed and resequenced version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; (said to be closer to the band&#x27;s original intentions) assembled by the album&#x27;s producer, Matt Wallace, along with rarities, demos, and other unreleased tracks. It includes a two CD release of the 1989 live concert released on vinyl as The Complete Inconcerated Live.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; received generally favorable reviews, with critics noting the music&#x27;s more mature themes and increasing disillusionment, along with a more private outlook. Ira Robbins of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Westerberg&#x27;s writing, stating that &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; &quot;is full of his sharp-tongued wordplay and idiosyncratic musical structures.&quot; In February 1990, the album was ranked at number 16 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1989 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; James Iha named the song &quot;Achin&#x27; to Be&quot; to his &quot;mixtape for dreamers,&quot; commenting, &quot;This is great, because he&#x27;s talking about a would-be artist who&#x27;s trying to do bigger stuff. And it sounds like someone everyone knows. Like he or she is an artist, but nobody really takes them seriously. So he&#x27;s talking about her. She danced alone in nightclubs. She&#x27;s a poet, she&#x27;s an artist, she&#x27;s like a movie, but at the end of the song, he&#x27;s like, &#x27;I&#x27;m like that, too. I&#x27;ve been aching for a while and I&#x27;m aching to be.&#x27; The narrator reveals himself, like, &#x27;I&#x27;m just like her and I don&#x27;t have the courage to go up to her.&#x27; Maybe I read too much into it. [Laughs.] But that&#x27;s how it reads to me.&quot;

<doc id="940245" wikidata="Q1148824" url="?curid=940245" title="Cyrillus (crater)">
<text>Cyrillus is a lunar impact crater located on the northwest edge of Mare Nectaris. Intruding into the northeast rim is the slightly larger, and younger crater Theophilus. To the south is another prominent crater named Catharina. Together these three craters form a prominent trio in the southeast quadrant of the Moon. To the northwest is Ibn-Rushd. Cyrillus is named after Saint Cyril of Alexandria, a 5th-century Patriarch and theologian.

The floor of Cyrillus contains a reduced central hill and the considerable crater Cyrillus A. The walls of the broken formation of Cyrillus remain intact until the point of junction with Theophilus. Slightly northeast of its center, three rounded mountains rise to heights of 1,000 metres above Cyrillus&#x27; floor: Cyrillus Alpha, Delta, and Eta.

A tiny crater with bright rays on the east side of Cyrillus has been named Shioli. A point to the east of Shioli is the proposed landing site of Japan&#x27;s SLIM lander.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cyrillus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Cyrillus B — &quot;See&quot; Ibn-Rushd crater.

<doc id="940246" wikidata="Q2957435" url="?curid=940246" title="Nakusp">
<text>The Village of Nakusp () is located south of the mouth of Kuskanax Creek, on the Upper Arrow Lake in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia. Lying between the Selkirk and Monashee ranges, the village is known for its nearby hot springs and picturesque mountain lakeside setting.

== Early history ==
The Secwepemc, Sinixt, and Ktunaxa peoples occupied the region for thousands of years. In 1811, Finan McDonald, a member of David Thompson&#x27;s party, was the first reported European explorer on the Arrow Lakes.

The settlement name came from the Nakusp Creek to the south. As to the word meaning, suggestions have included an eddy, safe place (sheltered bay), a coming together (of the lake, which narrowed at this point prior to the dam), a private body part, and having buffalo, despite no evidence buffalo ever roamed the area.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Nakusp had a population of 1,589 living in 760 of its 831 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,605. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Nakusp included:
*Irreligion (1,000 persons or 64.7%)
*Christianity (490 persons or 31.7%)
*Buddhism (10 persons or 0.6%)
*Other (30 persons or 1.9%)

==Transportation==
In the early 1890s, most passengers and freight would travel by steamboat connecting either south with the US landings, or north with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) main line at Revelstoke. However, low water and ice on the Arrow Lakes made the water route unreliable for several months of the year, which favoured Revelstoke for non-mining traffic. Shallow-draft sternwheelers frequented this important hub. From 1895, the Nakusp and Slocan Railway brought ore northwestward to Nakusp from the inland mines. From 1897, the Columbia and Kootenay Railway helped divert US bound traffic from the foot of the lake to the Nakusp landing. From 1913, CP operated a Nakusp–Kaslo link, after acquiring and rehabilitating the former Kaslo and Slocan Railway. Around 1930, the opening of the Summit Lake–Rosebery link completed the Nelson–Nakusp highway. Nakusp was the mid-way point for the Nelson–Vernon stage. During the late 1940s, Celgar built a forest service road to Galena Bay.
After the eastern terminal for the Upper Arrow Lake Ferry moved to Galena Bay in 1957, road traffic along the east shore of the lake superseded the former lake route. The upgrade of this road to highway status was completed in 1967.

==Community==
In 1892, a post office, general store and sawmill opened, but building lots were not for sale in the townsite subdivision, developed by A.E. Hodgins and Frank Fletcher, until the following year. A school came in 1895 and church in 1898. Electric power arrived in 1920.

In the early 1930s, the settlement included a hospital, elementary and high schools, four churches, movie theatre, community halls, post office, bank, police station, restaurant, three grocery stores, hardware store, menswear store, drug store, candy store, novelty store, bakery, barbershop, newspaper/printing office, and two garages, to serve the population of 800, the largest on the lake.

Nakusp was incorporated as a village in 1964. The reservoir for the Keenleyside Dam submerged the former waterfront area in 1968, necessitating some reconstruction. In the 1980s and early 2000s, a lobby group wanted to add &quot;Hot Springs&quot; to the name, as other communities had done to boost tourism. Residents overwhelmingly rejected the idea.

The census population was 1,605 in 2016, 1,569 in 2011, and 1,524 in 2006.

==Industry==
Mining used to be the most important industry in the area. By the early 1930s, a CP shipyard, forestry headquarters, and two sawmills operated. Surrounding lands were farmed. Forestry has formed the major economic base for the village since the 1950s.

The mining operations in Nakusp were focused primarily on the extraction of galena and gold.

==Nakusp Hot Springs Resort==
About northeast of the village up the Kuskanax Valley are the springs. In 1931, the access route was by car, and the remainder by packhorse or on foot, to the concrete swimming pool and hotter pool for relaxation. Cabins and tents were available for overnight stays.

Nowadays on a former logging road, the amphitheatre-shaped resort is built of rock and red cedar. The main building houses the diameter hot springs pools on the banks of the Kuskanax Creek, next to a serviced campsite. The resort, designed by Saskatchewan architect Clifford Wiens, includes four cedar chalets in a narrow A-frame design. The pool&#x27;s water is piped in from the source of the springs half a mile away. Premier Dave Barrett, who opened the resort officially in 1974, allegedly called it the Taj Mahal at the end of the Burma Road.

The two pools are fed daily by of fresh water pumped from the 57 °C (135 °F) source and filtered onsite. The smaller, Hot Pool is kept at in winter and in summer, and the filtered water is recycled every 30 minutes. The larger Warm Pool is maintained at in the winter and in the summer, on a two-hour recycling schedule.

The resort was built for $700,000 and paid for by the federal and provincial governments in the form of grants for the benefit of the municipality, which owns it. Wiens, referred to only as &quot;the architect from Saskatchewan&quot;, was the only &quot;outsider&quot; involved the development. Not everyone in Nakusp was pleased with the development, and continued to hike a half mile to the site of original hot springs, until one night when the old pool was &quot;mysteriously dynamited.&quot;

The resort made a profit for the first time in 2010. Halcyon Hot Springs, another privately owned hot springs resort, is north of Nakusp.

==Services==

The Nakusp recreational centre comprises an ice rink, squash court, curling rink, auditorium, outdoor tennis courts, and a soccer field around a five-hectare park. Arrow Lakes Hospital serves the village and surrounding communities. There is an elementary school, a high school, and a campus of Selkirk College. The schools are part of School District 10 Arrow Lakes which has its board office in Nakusp. The area also provides many opportunities for recreation, including the Summit Lake Ski Hill, a short drive out of town towards New Denver. Nakusp Airport (TC LID: CAQ5), with an asphalt runway in length, is northwest of the village on the hot springs road.

==Culture==
Nakusp is home to a community radio station, CJHQ-FM, and a small library and museum containing numerous local historical artifacts of the indigenous and settler communities of the region.

In 2004 the village held its first Nakusp Music Fest, which proved to be a popular attraction. It was known as the Interior&#x27;s largest classic rock festival, although classic rock isn&#x27;t the only genre being played. The Nakusp Music Festival is no longer running, having come to an end in 2011.

<text>Draper is a small lunar impact crater in the southern part of the Mare Imbrium. It is a circular, cup-shaped formation, with a tiny craterlet intruding into the northeastern rim. To the north-northeast is the crater Pytheas, and to the south lies the Montes Carpatus range. Just to the southeast is the slightly smaller crater identified as Draper C. The crater is named after American astronomer Henry Draper.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Draper.

<text>Where the Heart Is is an American soap opera telecast on the CBS television network from September 8, 1969 to March 23, 1973. Created by Lou Scofield and Margaret DePriest, the program ran for 25 minutes, the remaining five minutes of its timeslot ceded to a CBS news break.

Scofield and DePriest were the original head writers. A year after the soap&#x27;s premiere, they were succeeded by Pat Falken Smith. In 1972, Smith was replaced by Claire Labine and Paul Avila Mayer. The series was produced by Tom Donovan and directed by Richard Dunlap.

==Storylines==
Set in the fictional town of Northcross, Connecticut, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; focuses on the sexual and psychological intrigues of the dysfunctional Hathaway family. Although some believe that the serial was patterned after Grace Metalious’ scandalous novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (and subsequent television adaptation), the serial was actually CBS’ attempt to create a psychosexual, family melodrama popularized by NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; With such prurient themes as unabashed adultery, out-of-wedlock babies, and vaguely incestuous love triangles, the serial&#x27;s irreverent, fast-paced stories were in contrast to the other serials on CBS which were staid and conservative.

The serial opened with the death of pious Hathaway family patriarch Judge Daniel Hathaway. Judge Hathaway had three adult children: Julian (James Mitchell), a professor of literature at the local university, Kate (Diana van der Vlis), a sympathetic but sexually repressed law student, and Allison (Louise Shaffer), the liberated feminist black sheep of the family. In the first episode, Allison returned to Northcross for her father&#x27;s funeral, having left town years before with her sister&#x27;s fiancée Roy Archer (Stephen Joyce). Intrigued by the new family dynamic, Allison and Roy decided to settle down in the Hathaway mansion, much to the chagrin of Kate, Julian, and the family&#x27;s cantankerous housekeeper Stella O&#x27;Brien (Bibi Osterwald).

Having never gained his father&#x27;s love, Julian sought affection elsewhere, developing an unfortunate affinity for the many young women he taught at Northcross University. When the serial began, Julian had recently married nubile Mary (Diana Walker), his adult son Michael&#x27;s former girlfriend.

Michael was pursued by the amoral Vicky Lucas (Robyn Millan), even though she knew he still carried a torch for Mary. Vicky, the daughter of Ed Lucas (Joseph Mascolo) the owner of a restaurant in Northcross, called the Starlight, managed to seduce Michael, and when she conveniently became pregnant, he married her. Vicky attempted to become the sort of wife in which Michael could take pride, even getting lessons in “style” from his snobbish Aunt Allison. However, when Vicky overheard her husband profess his love for his stepmother, she angrily drove off in an ice storm. The car crashed, and she miscarried.

Vicky exploited Michael and Mary&#x27;s guilt for weeks by faking paralysis, but when Mary accidentally discovered her standing, the two rivals had a fight at the top of a staircase. Mary, who was also pregnant, fell down the stairs and languished in coma. Undaunted, Vicky slipped into Mary&#x27;s hospital room and tried to unplug her respirator, but was caught. Vicky was confined to a state mental hospital, while Mary, now recuperated from the accident, gave birth to Julian&#x27;s son and Michael&#x27;s half-brother, Daniel.

Julian&#x27;s hard-hearted sister Allison didn’t find success in love either. After her husband Roy died, Allison married Dr. Hugh Jessup (Rex Robbins and David Cryer), who had problems with commitment. Allison&#x27;s demanding nature sent him into the arms of Kate Hathaway&#x27;s best friend the confused but sweet-natured Christine Cameron (Terry O&#x27;Connor and Delphi Harrington). When Christine became pregnant, Hugh filed for divorce and left stony Allison, who was aghast that Christine seemed to elicit sympathy from most of their family and friends. After giving birth to Hugh&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Katina, Christine became the target of harassing phone calls and insidious notes, and everyone believed that Allison was her rival&#x27;s stalker. It transpired that the real culprit was Christine&#x27;s kindly, old neighbor Will Watts (Robert Symonds), a deranged psychopath who had murdered his adulterous wife decades before. Envisioning Christine as his dead wife, Will spirited her away to an isolated cabin, where Hugh managed to rescue her just as Will was ready to kill her. Christine had a nervous collapse and had to be hospitalized. Meanwhile, a bored Hugh cheated on Christine with ex-wife Allison, who decided she wanted Hugh back. While she was in the hospital, the boutique she owned was run by Amy Snowden (Clarice Blackburn), a friend to everyone in Northcross.

Kate, Julian and Allison&#x27;s sensible sister, married stalwart Steve Prescott (Laurence Luckinbill, Ron Harper) after a long courtship. Steve quickly developed amnesia and became involved with single mother Ellie Jardin (Zohra Lampert). Steve&#x27;s memory eventually returned, and when Ellie was murdered, he and Kate adopted Ellie&#x27;s mute son Peter (Michael Bersell). Peter&#x27;s muteness was psychosomatic, having developed after he witnessed a deadly fire involving his aunt, Margaret Jardin (Rue McClanahan), who had an incestuous attachment to her brother Robert (Keith Charles), Peter&#x27;s father. When Robert failed to return his sister&#x27;s feelings, she ran him down with a car and killed him. Peter also died in a tragic accident, and Kate, unable to cope with all the tragedy around her, began to display increasingly erratic behavior, hearing voices and acting lewdly. Kate feared that she was dying from the same brain aneurysm that killed her mother, but in reality she had developed a truculent split personality called Betty.

In the show&#x27;s final year, Julian fell into a steamy affair with conniving student Liz Harris Rainey (Tracy Brooks Swope). After he rejected her, Liz, secretly pregnant with his child, married Michael. Now ensconced in the Hathaway home, Liz tortured Julian, constantly threatening to tell Mary and Michael about their affair. She also instigated vicious rumors on the university campus that Julian and Mary were engaged in a ménage à trois with Loretta Jardin (Alice Drummond), Peter&#x27;s other aunt, a recovering alcoholic high school teacher. Meanwhile, Liz&#x27;s father John Rainey (Peter MacLean) became involved with Christine Cameron, who was caught in a court battle with Hugh and Allison for custody of Katina. Christine sought therapy with psychiatrist Dr. Adrienne Harris (Priscilla Pointer), unaware that she was John&#x27;s estranged wife. Desperate for reconciliation with John, Adrienne subtly manipulated Christine into having a complete nervous breakdown, forcing her to be institutionalized.

During the serial&#x27;s last week, all of Liz and Adrienne&#x27;s machinations were exposed, and they decided to move in together to rebuild their lives, without Michael and John. Mary, who left Julian after discovering that Liz was pregnant with his child, forgave him. Christine was released from the psychiatric hospital, reunited with John, and happily learned that Hugh and Allison agreed to share custody of Katina with her. Kate realized that her psychological problems stemmed from the repressive moral code inflicted upon her for so long by the late Judge Hathaway. Before she entered intensive therapy, Steve promised to whisk her away for a long, relaxing vacation in the Caribbean. Julian, who had always blamed Michael for his mother&#x27;s death in childbirth, went to visit Michael, who was falling in love with the now reformed Vicky (now played by Lisa Richards), the new proprietor of a country health food store called Back to Nature. Father and son agreed to put the past behind them and concentrate on the future. They were left in a warm embrace as the scene faded to black for the last time.

== Ratings and cancellation ==
Although &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; achieved fairly healthy ratings, averaging a 6.7 and 26 share for its three-and-a-half-year run, it was typically the lowest-rated soap on CBS’ daytime schedule. Advertisers weren’t thrilled with the show, either, because demographics suggested the serial&#x27;s attempt to attract a younger, less desirable cult audience.

In February 1973, CBS found itself locked in a battle with NBC for daytime ratings supremacy, and went on to cancel &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and another “underachiever,” &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,&quot; in a bid to bring up the daypart&#x27;s overall rating. As one industry insider revealed about the cancellations: &quot;It was a matter of pride, CBS didn&#x27;t like being third in the ratings. So, rather than struggle to improve the quality of these shows, it just canceled them.&quot;

&quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and the newsbreak that followed it (which later moved to 10:55 a.m.) were replaced on CBS&#x27; daytime schedule by &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which would become the most popular TV soap opera in America for three decades running, and is still on the air as of 2024.

== Surviving episodes ==
All 907 episodes of &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; were recorded on videotape at the CBS Broadcast Center Studio #44 in New York. Like most soap operas of the late 60s/early 70s, it fell victim to the industry practice of wiping tapes for re-use. Although the master tapes for &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; were erased, some rare kinescopes of the series remain in the possession of private collectors.

Only seven videotapes of the soap are confirmed to exist. These are non-circulating copies stored at the UCLA Television Archives. The archived episodes were telecast: March 8, 16, and 24, 1971, April 1 and 9, 1971, and March 12 and 20, 1973.

<doc id="940263" wikidata="Q853449" url="?curid=940263" title="Elastica (album)">
<text>Elastica is the debut studio album by English alternative rock band Elastica. It was released in March 1995 through Deceptive Records in the UK and DCG/Geffen Records internationally. The album was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. This is the only album to feature the original line-up, and guitarist Donna Matthews.

==Reception==

&quot;Elastica&quot; was well-received critically. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that &quot;the smart, sassy savagings of losers and poseurs are a refreshing advance from grunge&#x27;s gloomy self-absorption.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; concluded that &quot;it is, yes, new new wave, and sometimes too close to old new wave: &#x27;Vaseline&#x27; is Blondie and &#x27;Waking Up&#x27; the Stranglers.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; ranked the album at number 9 in its list of the &quot;50 albums of the year&quot;. In the U.S., the album was ranked as the sixth best album of the year by Mike Boehm in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the album was also highly rated by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

In their retrospective review, AllMusic praised the album, writing &quot;what makes &quot;Elastica&quot; such an intoxicating record is not only the way the 16 songs speed by in 40 minutes, but that they&#x27;re nearly all classics&quot; and that &quot;hardly any new wave band made records this consistently rocking and melodic&quot;. BBC Music wrote &quot;As albums that fall off a genre&#x27;s radar go, Elastica&#x27;s eponymous debut ranks high&quot;, calling it &quot;a neglected gem&quot; and the &quot;blueprint for what Britpop should sound like&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Elastica&quot; hit number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming, at the time, the fastest-selling debut since Oasis&#x27; &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; the previous year. The record also did well in the US, climbing to a peak of number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after 11 weeks on the chart. Two months after its release, it had sold over 59,000 units in the US according to Nielsen Soundscan. By the end of 1995 it had sold approximately 1 million copies worldwide according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. Around half of these sales were in America where it was certified as gold in December 1995. By April 2000, sales in the UK were estimated by the band&#x27;s Deceptive label at 270,000 copies.

==Legacy==
In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; called it the 191st greatest album of all time. The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2014, American LGBT magazine &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; ranked the album at number 38 in its list of the &quot;50 Best Alternative Albums of the 90s&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed the album at number six in its list &quot;The 50 Best Britpop Albums&quot;.

<doc id="940265" wikidata="Q5743475" url="?curid=940265" title="Heron Gate">
<text>Heron Gate or Herongate is a neighbourhood in Alta Vista Ward and Gloucester-Southgate Ward in the south end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is defined by the Herongate Tenant Coalition as being bounded on the north by Heron Road, on the west by Heron-Walkley Park and Albion Road, and by the Walkley rail corridor on the south. The total population for this area (excluding the Oak apartments on Albion which are in a different Census block) according to the Canada 2021 Census was 9,974.

There are several parks in the neighbourhood, and is served by Ridgemont High School), St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, St. Patrick Intermediate and Charles Hulse Elementary School for education. The area has train tracks to the south. It is one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city. A number of new developments were completed on the west of the neighbourhood between 2006 and 2008.

==History==
The neighbourhood north of Walkely was first built by Minto in 1966, while the neighbourhood south of Walkely was first built prior to 1976. Ottawa City Council approved the construction of 576 units on Heatherington in 1970, and 150 units at the corner of Heatherington and Albion in 1972.

==Demographics==
The neighbourhood is extremely linguistically and racially diverse. According to the 2016 Census, a plurality of the neighbourhood (42%) is Anglophone and 13% is Francophone. Other major languages include Arabic (12%), Somali (11%), Nepali (4%), Spanish (2%), Creoles (2%) and Persian (2%). It is a plurality Black Canadian (32%), and is nearly equally White (31%). Arab Canadians also make up a significant proportion (15%). Other races include South Asian (7%), Filipino (3%), Latin American (2%), Indigenous (2%), Chinese (2%), West Asian (1%) and Southeast Asian (1%).

==Retailers==
The main shopping area in the Herongate area is the Herongate Square (formerly Herongate Mall). There are also stores nearby which are separate from the mall.

==Timbercreek evictions ==
Most properties south of Heron and north of Walkley, within Baycrest Drive, Sandalwood Drive and Cedarwood Drive are managed by Timbercreek Asset Management who took possession in 2012. In 2016, Timbercreek evicted residents from 80 townhomes in Heron Gate, to make room for new developments in the area. In May 2018, it announced that it would evict residents of a further 150 townhomes, due to structural problems with the buildings. The decision to redevelop the area received criticism from residents and interested parties such as the UN special rapporteur on Adequate Housing, and was described as the &quot;&#x27;largest forced displacement in Canada&#x27; in recent history.&quot;

These evictions were criticized as being part of a broader pattern of racist “reno-victions” or “demo-victions”, as “90% of more than 500 tenants evicted in 2018 after rental properties were allowed to deteriorate were racial minorities”. Nonetheless, Heron Gate has been noted by scholars such as Emily Power, Bjarke Skærlund Risager, and Marina Gomá as an important site of working class, anti-racist activism by its residents. As Gomá notes, 
“The Herongate Tenant Coalition articulates a different reality to the narrative of Canadian benevolence, embodying class solidarity, denouncing structural racism, and recruiting allies to donate to their legal case against Timbercreek Management.”

Following an extended grassroots activist campaign and a human rights challenge, Timbercreek agreed to provide CAD$2,000 in moving compensation, relocation assistance and negotiated discounts with Ottawa moving companies.

<text>President&#x27;s Choice Financial (), commonly shortened to PC Financial, is the financial service brand of the Canadian supermarket chain Loblaw Companies. 

Two different wholly owned subsidiaries of Loblaw Companies provide services under the President&#x27;s Choice Financial brand: personal banking and Mastercard credit card services are provided by the federally chartered President&#x27;s Choice Bank, and insurance is provided by PC Financial Insurance Brokers.

== Services ==
Bank Machines (ATMs)

Most Loblaws and Loblaws-owned stores offer access to a PC Financial-branded ATM. These ATMs can be used for no fee by PC Financial customers. All other customers who use the ATMs will be charged fees.

===Mastercard credit cards===

PC Financial MasterCards are embedded with PayPass technology. In November 2014, Ugo Wallet, a mobile wallet app for Android was launched in partnership with TD Canada Trust. In addition, users can store PC credit cards on Apple Pay and Android Pay.

===Insurance===
President&#x27;s Choice offers auto insurance and home insurance, underwritten through a broker model by a number of Canadian insurance companies, pet insurance, underwritten by SecuriCan General Insurance Company, and travel insurance by Travel Guard Canada as managing general underwriter and agent for American Home Assurance Company. President&#x27;s Choice discontinued their home and auto insurance offerings to new customers in 2009 for a brief period as structural changes were made. During this time, the previous partnership with Aviva came to an end. Their home and auto insurance products returned under a separate &quot;broker model&quot; in January 2010.

===Consumer banking (since 2020)===
President&#x27;s Choice Financial launched the PC Money Account, a no-fee &quot;debit-like&quot; personal banking service, on September 14, 2020. Unlike its former banking service, which was provided by CIBC, PC Money Accounts are issued directly by President&#x27;s Choice Bank. The PC Money Account card can be used to collect PC Optimum points on purchases, and can be used online and worldwide at any retailer that accepts Mastercard. Unlike conventional chequing accounts in Canada, the PC Money Account does not use the Interac network on domestic debit purchase transactions, as the card operates on MasterCard’s global payment network; it is a prepaid card.

== Former services ==
===Consumer banking (1996–2017)===
Standard consumer banking products (chequing accounts, savings accounts, loans, mortgages) were provided as a joint venture with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce; this partnership began in 1996. CIBC offered lines of credit, loans, Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSPs), and mortgages using the President&#x27;s Choice brand under license, except for between January 2001 and October 2005 when banking services were provided by Amicus Bank (a CIBC subsidiary). Services were available in all Canadian provinces, except Quebec. All PC Financial bank accounts had the same bank number as CIBC (010), and were located under one transit/branch number (30800).

Clients performed their banking transactions on the Internet, at a PC- or CIBC-branded ATM, by telephone, or in person at pavilions located inside Loblaw-affiliated stores.

President&#x27;s Choice Financial consumer banking services were ranked by J.D. Power and Associates as having the highest customer satisfaction among mid-size Canadian banks in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

On August 16, 2017, it was announced that Loblaw Companies and CIBC had mutually decided to terminate their joint venture to provide consumer banking products. All PC Financial mortgages, loans, investments, and bank accounts were transferred to CIBC&#x27;s new direct banking brand Simplii Financial effective November 1, 2017. PC Financial&#x27;s credit card and insurance products were unaffected by the decision, and continued to be offered by subsidiaries of Loblaw Companies. At the time of the announcement the consumer banking products had approximately 2 million customers.

==Loyalty Program==

Customers collect PC Optimum reward points on purchases made with their President&#x27;s Choice Financial Mastercard credit cards, as well as with purchases made with the PC Money Account.

<doc id="940277" wikidata="Q60357" url="?curid=940277" title="Walther Wenck">
<text>Walther Wenck (; 18 September 1900 – 1 May 1982) was a German officer and industrialist. He was the youngest General of the branch (&quot;General der Truppengattung&quot;) in the German Army and a staff officer during World War II. At the end of the war, he commanded the German Twelfth Army that took part in the Battle of Berlin. Wenck left the military after surrendering to the Allies. He was asked to become Inspector General of the Bundeswehr as West Germany was re-arming in 1957, but declined to take the post when conditions he set were not met, such as the Inspector General being the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, not just an administrative leader.

Historians consider Wenck a capable commander and a brilliant improviser, although incapable of the impossible task he was given of saving Berlin in 1945. His efforts and achievements have been captured by the Swedish power metal band Sabaton in the song &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot;.

==Early life==
The third son of officer Maximilian Wenck, Walther was born in Wittenberg, Germany in 1900. In 1911 he joined the Naumburg Cadet Corps of the Prussian Army. From the spring of 1918 he went to the secondary military school in Gross-Lichterfeld.

==Career==
Wenck joined a paramilitary group (&quot;Freikorps&quot;) in 1919 and then the Army (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;) of the Weimar Republic in 1920. From 1939 to 1942, Wenck was Chief of Operations for the 1st Panzer Division. In 1942, he was an instructor at the War Academy, chief of staff for the LVII Corps, and then the Third Romanian Army on the Eastern Front.

From 1942 to 1943, he was chief of staff of &quot;Army Detachment Hollidt&quot;, named after Karl-Adolf Hollidt, which was subordinated to the Third Romanian Army. In 1943, he was Chief of Staff of the ill-fated 6th Army. From 1943 to 1944, Wenck served in the same capacity in the 1st Panzer Army. In 1944, he was chief of staff of Army Group South Ukraine. There he first attracted Adolf Hitler&#x27;s attention with his report about conditions on the Eastern Front, saying, &quot;As you see My Führer, the Eastern Front is like Swiss cheese, full of holes.&quot; Even though he was reprimanded for using informal language, Hitler commended the &quot;liveliness&quot; of his report.

On about 22 July 1944, Wenck was appointed Chief of Operations at OKH, the High Command of the German Army, by Heinz Guderian, who had just been appointed as OKH Chief of Staff by Hitler. He was soon advanced to Chief of Command Staff (Chief of the Führungsstab) an office that replaced Quartermaster General I.

On 13 February 1945, after a long argument, Guderian persuaded Hitler to make Wenck chief of staff of Army Group Vistula (with the power to launch an attack) under Himmler. Wenck&#x27;s attack was initially successful, but Hitler requested him to attend daily Führer&#x27;s briefings which forced him to make a daily round trip of . On February 17, 1945, an extremely tired Wenck took the driving wheel from his driver Dorn who had collapsed. Wenck then fell asleep at the wheel and crashed his car off the road. Saved by Dorn, he ended up in the hospital with a fractured skull and five broken ribs. Meanwhile, the attack failed.

On 10 April 1945, Wenck was appointed commander of the German Twelfth Army located to the west of Berlin to guard against the advancing American and British forces. But, as the Western Front moved eastwards and the Eastern Front moved westwards, the German armies making up both fronts backed towards each other. As a result, the area of control of Wenck&#x27;s army to his rear and east of the Elbe River had become a vast refugee camp for Germans fleeing from the approaching Soviet Army. Wenck took great pains to provide food and lodging for these refugees. At one stage, the Twelfth Army was estimated to be feeding more than a quarter of a million people every day.

===Battle of Berlin===
On 21 April, Hitler ordered Waffen SS &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Felix Steiner to attack the forces of Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov&#x27;s 1st Belorussian Front. Zhukov&#x27;s forces were encircling Berlin from the north, while the forces of Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front were encircling from the south. Steiner was to attack Zhukov with his Army Detachment Steiner. With few operational tanks and roughly a division&#x27;s worth of infantry, Steiner requested that his &quot;army&quot; be allowed to retreat instead of attacking.

On 22 April, as Steiner retreated, Wenck&#x27;s 12th Army became part of an unrealistic and poorly planned attempt by Hitler to save Berlin from encirclement. Under suggestion of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alfred Jodl, Wenck was ordered to disengage the Americans to his west and, attacking to the east, link up with the Ninth Army of &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Theodor Busse. Together, they would attack the Soviets encircling Berlin from the west and from the south. Meanwhile, the XLI Panzer Corps under General Rudolf Holste would attack the Soviets from the north.

Wenck&#x27;s forces attacked towards Berlin, but they were halted outside of Potsdam by strong Soviet resistance. Neither Busse nor Holste made much progress towards Berlin. By the end of the day on 27 April, the Soviet forces encircling Berlin linked up and the forces inside the city were cut off.

During the night of 28 April, Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible as support from Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army could no longer be expected. Instead, starting April 24, Wenck moved his army towards the Forest of Halbe, broke into the Halbe pocket and linked up with the remnants of the Ninth Army, Hellmuth Reymann&#x27;s &quot;Army Group Spree,&quot; and the Potsdam garrison. Wenck brought his army, remnants of the Ninth Army, and many civilian refugees across the Elbe and into territory occupied by the U.S. Army.

According to Antony Beevor, Wenck&#x27;s eastward attack toward Berlin was aimed specifically at providing the population and garrison of Berlin with an escape route to areas occupied by U.S. forces: &quot;Comrades, you&#x27;ve got to go in once more,&quot; Wenck said. &quot;It&#x27;s not about Berlin any more, it&#x27;s not about the Reich any more.&quot; Their task was to save people from the fighting and the Russians. Wenck&#x27;s leadership struck a powerful chord, even if the reactions varied between those who believed in a humanitarian operation and those keener to surrender to the Western allies instead of the Russians. According to Randall Hansen, Wenck&#x27;s actions, with the help of luck and U.S. General William Simpson, successfully evacuated a large number of troops and civilians (variously estimated from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands), with Wenck himself being one of the last who crossed the river.

==Later life and death==
Wenck was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army. He was released in 1947, and then began a second career as an industrialist. During the 1950s, he worked as the managing director of Dr. C. Otto &amp; Comp., a producer of industrial ovens, and in the 1960s as the director of the Diehl Group, an arms manufacturer.

In 1957, he was invited to become Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, but refused after being informed that his requirements, such as turning the office into that of Commander-in-chief, could not be met. 

In Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s 1966 epic &quot;The Last Battle&quot; he was listed as a contributor.

On 1 May 1982, Wenck died while on a trip to Austria, when his car collided with a tree. He was buried in his hometown of Bad Rothenfelde in Lower Saxony a few days later.

<text>Cruis&#x27;n World is a 1996 racing game developed by Midway Games and published by Nintendo. It is the sequel to the 1994 arcade racer &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. A port for the Nintendo 64 developed by Eurocom was released in 1998, and was the best received of the &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; ports.

&quot;Cruis&#x27;n World&quot; allows players to race on various tracks around the world. The game also features more cars than &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. This game introduced stunts to the &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; series. They served to dodge obstacles, take close curves, and gain extra seconds of time.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Cruis&#x27;n World&quot; has the same core gameplay as its predecessor, in that the player races on different tracks under a time limit to reach the goal, passing checkpoints along the way to help extend this time limit. The races take place in different destinations around the world, such as Hawaii, Japan, Australia, China, Africa, Egypt, Moscow, Germany, Italy, France, England, Mexico, New York City and Florida. The cars now have the ability to perform stunts during races such as wheelies, that give short speed bursts, and aerial flips, which deduct seconds from the final race time, allowing for the player to achieve a better position in the records&#x27; table. Should the player go through all stages including Florida, the car would be taken by a Space Shuttle for a trip to the moon.

The Nintendo 64 version adds an extra track on the Moon, which is unlocked once the player reaches the end of the &quot;Cruise the World&quot; mode. It also features an exclusive Championship mode, in which players race on circuit tracks set in the game&#x27;s different stages rather than the arcade&#x27;s road tracks, competing for points that allow the player to unlock upgrades for the cars. The game supports up to four players using a split screen.

==Development==
The developers of this game sent artists on a round-the-world trip to digitally capture sights and major tourist attractions.

The development of the Nintendo 64 version started in 1996 after the development of the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. Eugene Jarvis had admitted that Williams Entertainment&#x27;s port of &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; was not good, so they promised the game to be an arcade perfect port. Eurocom took the &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; license and decided to spend more time on the game than in &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. In early 1997, Nintendo announced &quot;Cruis&#x27;n World&quot; would be coming to the Nintendo 64 in the fall. However, the game was silently delayed until 1998.

==Reception==
The game was displayed at the 1996 AMOA show, where it won the award for Most Innovative New Title. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it a runner-up for Arcade Game of the Year. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic commented that, like &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;, &quot;Cruis&#x27;n World&quot; has an unsurpassed sense of arcade-style driving, saying the players can drive fast, knock the cars off the road and get into chaotic multi-car collisions. At the same time, he found this a shortcoming, since the game is very quickly mastered. He praised the track design as being more elaborate and requiring more skill than its predecessor, but said the pop-in remains as bad as before.

The Nintendo 64 port was met with mixed reception. On review aggregation site GameRankings, it held a score of 63% based on 14 reviews.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, criticising the game having minimal technique and difficulty.

<doc id="940290" wikidata="Q247944" url="?curid=940290" title="Neil Horan">
<text>Cornelius &quot;Neil&quot; Horan, sometimes referred to as The Grand Prix Priest, The Dancing Priest, or The Armageddon Priest (born 22 April 1947), is a laicised Irish former Roman Catholic priest who is noted for his interference with the running of the 2003 British Grand Prix and the 2004 Summer Olympics men&#x27;s marathon in order to promote his religious belief that the end times are near. He was arrested and spent some time in jail in Germany in 2006 when police found out about his plans to stage a pro-Nazi demonstration during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which included a poster he made praising Adolf Hitler.

Horan went on to appear on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in May 2009. He danced a soft jig on the show, received a standing ovation by the audience and was put through to the second round. He did not make the live semi-finals. In 2017, he showed his support outside court for disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris. In 2022, he protested against Rishi Sunak becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom with a placard saying &quot;Britain is a Christian country, it should have a Christian Prime Minister - not a Hindu one.&quot;

==Early life and the priesthood==
The second of 13 children born to Catherine (née Kelly) and John Horan, he is a native of Knockeenahone, Scartaglen in County Kerry. He currently lives in London. He studied to be a priest at St. Brendan&#x27;s College, Killarney and St Peter&#x27;s College, Wexford and was ordained in 1973.

==Incidents==
===2003 British Grand Prix===

On 20 July 2003, Horan ran across the track at the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit, wearing an orange skirt and waving a religious banner, which stated &quot;Read the Bible. The Bible is always right&quot;.

His protest took place on the Hangar Straight. Several drivers had to swerve to avoid him and the safety car had to be deployed to protect him and the competitors. Horan was tackled by track marshal Stephen Green, who removed Horan from the track before he was arrested. He was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, aggravated trespass and sentenced to two months imprisonment.

===2004 Epsom Derby===
At the 5 June 2004 Epsom Derby, Horan was spotted by police and shoved to the ground moments before they believed he was about to run in front of the horses. He was later released without charges, although police did circulate information about Horan to other sporting events. The following year a court order prevented him coming within two miles of the racecourse.

===2004 Summer Olympics men&#x27;s marathon===

In spite of tight security at the 2004 Athens Olympics due to fears of a terrorist attack, on 29 August Horan (who had flown to Athens earlier that day) was able to run onto the course of the men&#x27;s marathon event near the mark, carrying placards on his back and front.

Horan pushed Brazilian Vanderlei de Lima, who was leading the race, into the crowds alongside the course. After a few seconds Horan was hauled off the shaken runner by Greek spectator Polyvios Kossivas. Kossivas subdued Horan and helped de Lima up and back to the lane.

Horan was promptly arrested by Greek police, who were later criticized for not giving runners adequate protection. Following the encounter with Horan, De Lima suffered from leg cramps and muscle pain, although he continued running and completed the race. He lost about 10 seconds from his 25-second lead and finished third, after being passed by Italian Stefano Baldini and American Mebrahtom Keflezighi at the mark. De Lima later commented that &quot;I think that the psychological shock was the greatest impact that I suffered. To be attacked like that, it was painful. I was totally defenseless and exhausted.&quot;

The head of the Brazilian Athletics Confederation launched an appeal based on the controversy surrounding Horan&#x27;s interference in the marathon. The federation asked that de Lima also be awarded a gold medal, citing precedents set in past Olympic matches where extenuating circumstances have led to more than one winner in certain sports. This request was denied. Horan was given a 12-month suspended sentence by a Greek court and fined €3,000. Although he could have been sentenced to up to five years&#x27; imprisonment, the judge gave him a suspended sentence due to his mental state. Horan&#x27;s brother commented that he had gotten away &quot;scot-free&quot;.

===World Cup 2006===
During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Horan was arrested by German police before he could stage a planned protest. He had written to German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and &quot;The Kingdom&quot; newspaper in County Kerry, Ireland, informing them that he planned to dance a peace jig outside the stadium in Berlin before the World Cup final. He told &quot;The Kingdom&quot; he would carry posters declaring &quot;Adolf Hitler was a good leader who was following the word of Christ&quot;, give the Nazi salute and light a candle for Hitler at the Gestapo headquarters. He spent two months in custody awaiting trial but was released on 15 September 2006 when the judge discharged the case.

===St Mary&#x27;s Hospital===
During the waiting period outside the front door of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Lindo Wing in west London before Prince William&#x27;s first child was born in July 2013, Horan appeared in front of media with a sign proclaiming &quot;Queen Elizabeth is very probably the last monarch of Britain&quot; on one side, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth is very probably foretold in the Bible&quot; on the other. He handed out his business card, which read &quot;Neil Horan, the Britain&#x27;s Got Talent Irish Dancer. I perform at Weddings. My Mission in Life is to help prepare the world for the Second Coming.&quot;

===David Norris letter===
During campaigning ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election, Senator David Norris&#x27;s past came under scrutiny. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that it had seen a letter in which Norris had politely responded to Horan thanking him for his pamphlet on &quot;various Messianic prophecies&quot;. Norris admitted in the letter, &quot;To be honest I haven&#x27;t really read it in detail yet&quot;, but said that he would put his &quot;feet up and read it with great interest&quot; when he returned from a trip to Berlin. He added, &quot;I will then pass it on to my aunt who is just 100 and has always taken a keen interest in this kind of material.&quot;

==Reactions==
===Dismissal from priesthood===
In 2004, Horan was found not guilty of indecent assault against a seven-year-old girl in 1991. Although he admitted that he was naked while the girl tickled him and while they played hide-and-seek, during the court case he also claimed to own only one pair of tight-fitting green satin underpants that have never been washed as he needs them to &#x27;always be ready for use&#x27;, at one point Horan produced the pants from his pocket to show the jury.

On 20 January 2005, Kevin McDonald, the Archbishop of Southwark (South London), laicised Horan, after not working as a priest for 10 years for health reasons including depression. Horan later made the following statement to the press: &quot;I completely reject this decision. I appeal to the much higher court of heaven and the court of Jesus Christ ... I now cannot preach, I cannot give out Communion - I am little more than a pagan.&quot;

===Legal restraints===
On 13 April 2007, Horan was served with an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) banning him from entering, on the day of the race, any of the London boroughs that the course of the London Marathon passed through.

==Other appearances==
Horan auditioned for Series 3 of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2009 (airing 16 May) performing an Irish jig in traditional costume. The judges put Horan through to the second round. He was allowed to perform on the show because the producers &quot;did not know&quot; who he was. The makers of the show, TalkbackThames and Syco, defended showing Horan&#x27;s audition on the show. Horan then appeared on &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot; on Today FM and revealed that he did not get through to the next stage.

<text>In an electrical system, a ground loop or earth loop occurs when two points of a circuit are intended to have the same ground reference potential but instead have a different potential between them. This is typically caused when enough current is flowing in the connection between the two ground points to produce a voltage drop and cause the two points to be at different potentials. Current may be produced in a ground loop by electromagnetic induction.

Ground loops are a major cause of noise, hum, and interference in audio, video, and computer systems. Wiring practices that protect against ground loops include ensuring that all vulnerable signal circuits are referenced to one point as ground. The use of differential signaling can provide rejection of ground-induced interference. The removal of ground connections to equipment in an effort to eliminate ground loops will also eliminate the protection the safety ground connection is intended to provide.

== Description ==
A ground loop is caused by the interconnection of electrical devices that results in multiple paths to ground, thereby forming closed conductive loops through the ground connections. A common example is two electrical devices each connected to a mains power outlet by a three-conductor cable and plug containing a protective ground conductor for safety. When signal cables are connected between both devices, the shield of the signal cable is typically connected to the grounded chassis of both devices. This forms a closed loop through the ground conductors of the power cords, which are connected through the building wiring.

In the vicinity of electric power wiring there will always be stray magnetic fields, particularly from utility lines oscillating at 50 or 60 hertz. These ambient magnetic fields passing through the ground loop will induce a current in the loop by electromagnetic induction. The ground loop acts as a single-turn secondary winding of a transformer, the primary being the summation of all current-carrying conductors nearby. The amount of current induced will depend on the magnitude and proximity of nearby currents. The presence of high-power equipment such as industrial motors or transformers can increase the interference. Since the conductors comprising the ground loop usually have very low resistance, often below one ohm, even weak magnetic fields can induce significant currents.

Since the ground conductor of the signal cable linking the two devices is part of the signal path of the cable, the alternating ground current flowing through the cable can introduce electrical interference in the signal. The induced alternating current flowing through the resistance of the cable ground conductor will cause a small AC voltage drop across the cable ground. This is added to the signal applied to the input of the next stage. In audio equipment, the 50 or 60 Hz interference may be heard as a hum in the speakers. In a video system it may cause distortion or syncing problems. In computer cables it can cause slowdowns or failures of data transfer.

Ground loops can also exist within the internal circuits of electronic equipment, as design flaws.

Addition of signal interconnection cables to a system where equipment enclosures are already required to be bonded to ground can create ground loops. Proper design of such a system will satisfy both safety grounding requirements and signal integrity. For this reason, in some large professional installations such as recording studios, it is sometimes the practice to provide two completely separate ground connections to equipment bays. One is the normal safety ground that connects to exposed metalwork, the other is a technical ground for cable screens and the like.

==Representative circuit==
The circuit diagram illustrates a simple ground loop. Circuit 1 (left) and circuit 2 (right) share a common path to ground of resistance formula_1. Ideally, this ground conductor would have no resistance (formula_2), yielding no voltage drop across it (formula_3), keeping the connection point between the circuits at a constant ground potential. In that case, the output of circuit 2 is simply formula_4.

However, if this ground conductor has some resistance (formula_5), then it forms a voltage divider with formula_6. As a result, if a current (formula_7) is flowing through formula_1 from circuit 1, then a voltage drop across formula_1 of formula_10 occurs, causing the shared ground connection to no longer be at the actual ground potential. This voltage across the ground conductor is applied to circuit 2 and added to its output:formula_11

Thus the two circuits are no longer isolated from each other and circuit 1 can introduce interference into the output of circuit 2. If circuit 2 is an audio system and circuit 1 has large AC currents flowing in it, the interference may be heard as a 50 or 60 Hz hum in the speakers. Also, both circuits have voltage formula_12 on their grounded parts that may be exposed to contact, possibly presenting a shock hazard. This is true even if circuit 2 is turned off.

Although ground loops occur most often in the ground conductors of electrical equipment, similar loops can occur wherever two or more circuits share a common current path, which can cause a similar problematic voltage drop along the conductor if enough current flows.

==Common ground loops==
A common type of ground loop is due to faulty interconnections between electronic components, such as laboratory or recording studio equipment, or home component audio, video, and computer systems. This creates inadvertent closed loops in the ground wiring circuit, which can allow stray 50/60 Hz AC current to be induced and flow through the ground conductors of signal cables. The voltage drops in the ground system caused by these currents are added to the signal path, introducing noise and hum into the output. The loops can include the building&#x27;s utility wiring ground system when more than one component is grounded through the protective earth (third wire) in their power cords.

===Ground currents on signal cables===
The symptoms of a ground loop, ground noise and hum in electrical equipment, are caused by current flowing in the ground or conductor of a cable. Fig. 1 shows a signal cable &quot;S&quot; linking two electronic components, including the typical line driver and receiver amplifiers &quot;(triangles)&quot;. The cable has a ground or shield conductor which is connected to the chassis ground of each component. The driver amplifier in component 1 &quot;(left)&quot; applies signal &quot;V&quot;1 between the signal and ground conductors of the cable. At the destination end &quot;(right)&quot;, the signal and ground conductors are connected to a differential amplifier. This produces the signal input to component 2 by subtracting the shield voltage from the signal voltage to eliminate common-mode noise picked up by the cable
formula_13

If a current &quot;I&quot; from a separate source is flowing through the ground conductor, the resistance &quot;R&quot; of the conductor will create a voltage drop along the cable ground of &quot;IR&quot;, so the destination end of the ground conductor will be at a different potential than the source end 
formula_14
Since the differential amplifier has high impedance, little current flows in the signal wire, therefore there is no voltage drop across it: formula_15 The ground voltage appears to be in series with the signal voltage &quot;V&quot;1 and adds to it
formula_16
formula_17

If &quot;I&quot; is an AC current this can result in noise added to the signal path in component 2.

===Sources of ground current===
The diagrams in this section show a typical ground loop caused by a signal cable &quot;S&quot; connecting two grounded electronic components &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot;. The loop consists of the signal cable&#x27;s ground conductor, which is connected through the components&#x27; metal chassis to the ground wires &quot;P&quot; in their power cords, which are plugged into outlet grounds which are connected through the building&#x27;s utility ground wire system &quot;G&quot;.

Such loops in the ground path can cause currents in signal cable grounds by two main mechanisms:
* Ground loop currents can be induced by stray AC magnetic fields &quot;(B, green)&quot; which are always present around AC electrical wiring. The ground loop constitutes a conductive wire loop which may have a large area of several square meters. According to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, any time-varying magnetic flux passing through the loop induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the loop, causing a time varying current to flow. The loop acts like a short circuited single-turn transformer winding; any AC magnetic flux from nearby transformers, electric motors, or just adjacent power wiring, will induce AC currents in the loop by induction. In general, the larger the area spanned by the loop and the larger the magnetic flux through it, the larger the induced currents will be. Since its resistance is typically very low, often less than 1 ohm, the induced currents can be large.
* Another less common source of ground loop currents, particularly in high-power equipment, is current leaking from the &quot;hot&quot; side of the power line into the ground system. In addition to resistive leakage, current can also be induced through low impedance capacitive or inductive coupling. The ground potential at different outlets may differ by as much as 10 to 20 volts due to voltage drops from these currents. The diagram shows leakage current from an appliance such as an electric motor &quot;A&quot; flowing through the building&#x27;s ground system &quot;G&quot; to the neutral wire at the utility ground bonding point at the service panel. The ground loop between components &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot; creates a second parallel path for the current. The current divides, with some passing through component &quot;C1&quot;, the signal cable &quot;S&quot; ground conductor, &quot;C2&quot; and back through the outlet into the ground system &quot;G&quot;. The AC voltage drop across the cable&#x27;s ground conductor from this current introduces hum or interference into component &quot;C2&quot;.

===Solutions===
The solution to ground loop noise is to break the ground loop, or otherwise prevent the current from flowing. Several approaches are available.
* Group the cables involved in the ground loop into a bundle or snake. The ground loop still exists, but the two sides of the loop are close together, so stray magnetic fields induce equal currents in both sides, which cancel out.
* Create a break in the signal cable shield conductor. The break should be at the load end. This is often called &quot;ground lifting&quot;. It is the simplest solution; it leaves the ground currents to flow through the other arm of the loop. Some sound system components have ground lifting switches at inputs, which disconnect the ground. One problem with this solution is if the other ground path to the component is removed, it will leave the component ungrounded and stray leakage currents may cause a very loud hum in the output, possibly damaging speakers.
* Put a small resistor of about 10Ω in the cable shield conductor, at the load end. This is large enough to reduce magnetic-field-induced currents but small enough to keep the component grounded if the other ground path is removed. In high-frequency systems this solution leads to impedance mismatch and leakage of the signal onto the shield, where it can radiate to create RFI, or, symmetrically through the same mechanism, external signals or noise can be received by the shield and mixed into the desired signal. 
* Use a ground loop isolation transformer in the cable. This is considered the best solution, as it breaks the DC connection between components while passing the differential signal on the line. Even if one or both components are ungrounded, no noise will be introduced. The better isolation transformers have grounded shields between the two sets of windings. A transformer generally introduces some distortion in frequency response. A transformer designed specifically for the relevant frequency range must be used. Optoisolators can perform the same task for digital lines but introduce signal delay.
* In circuits producing high-frequency noise such as computer components, ferrite bead chokes are placed around cables just before the termination to the next appliance (e.g., the computer). These present a high impedance only at high frequency, so they will effectively stop radio frequency and digital noise, but will have little effect on 50/60 Hz noise.
* Reinforce the shield of the signal cable connecting C1 and C2 by connecting a thick copper conductor in parallel to the shield. This reduces the resistance of the shield and thus the amplitude of the unwanted signal.
* A technique used in recording studios is to interconnect all the metal chassis with heavy conductors like copper strips, then connect to the building ground wire system at &quot;one&quot; point; this is referred to as &quot;star grounding&quot; or &quot;single-point grounding&quot;. However, in home systems, multiple components are usually grounded through their 3-wire power cords, resulting in multipoint grounds.
* Battery-powering one or more of the circuits can avoid a ground loop, because the entire device may be disconnected from mains power.

A hazardous technique sometimes used by amateurs is to break the &quot;third wire&quot; ground conductor &quot;P&quot; in one of the component&#x27;s power cords, by removing the ground pin on the plug, or using a cheater plug. This creates an electric shock hazard by leaving one of the components ungrounded.

====Balanced lines====
A more comprehensive solution is to use equipment that employs differential signaling. Ground noise can only get into the signal path in single-ended signaling, in which the ground or shield conductor serves as one side of the signal path. When the signal is sent as a differential signal along a pair of wires, neither of which are connected to ground, any noise from the ground system induced in the signal lines is a common-mode signal, identical in both wires. Since the line receiver at the destination end only responds to differential signals, a difference in voltage between the two lines, the common-mode noise is canceled out. Thus these systems are very immune to electrical noise, including ground noise. Professional and scientific equipment often uses differential signaling with balanced lines.

==In low frequency audio and instrumentation systems==
If, for example, a domestic HiFi system has a grounded turntable and a grounded preamplifier connected by a thin screened cable (or cables, in a stereo system) using phono connectors, the cross-section of copper in the cable screen(s) is likely to be less than that of the protective ground conductors for the turntable and the preamplifier. So, when a current is induced in the loop, there will be a voltage drop along the signal ground return. This is directly additive to the wanted signal and will result in objectionable hum. For instance, if a current formula_18 of 1 mA at the local power frequency is induced in the ground loop, and the resistance formula_19 of the screen of the signal cable is 100 mΩ, the voltage drop will be formula_20 = 100 μV. This is a significant fraction of the output voltage of a moving coil pickup cartridge, and imposes an objectionable hum on the cartridge output.

In a more complex situation, such as sound reinforcement systems, public address systems, music instrument amplifiers, recording studio and broadcast studio equipment, there are many signal sources in mains-powered equipment feeding many inputs on other equipment and interconnection may result in hum problems. Attempting to cure these problems by removing the protective ground conductor creates a shock hazard. Solving hum problems must be done in the signal interconnections, and this is done in two main ways, which may be combined.

=== Isolation ===
Isolation is the quickest, quietest and most foolproof method of resolving hum problems. The signal is isolated by a small transformer, such that the source and destination equipment each retain their own protective ground connections, but there is no through connection from one to the other in the signal path. By transformer isolating all unbalanced connections, the unbalanced connections are converted to balanced connections. In analog applications such as audio, the physical limitations of the transformers cause some signal degradation, by limiting bandwidth and adding some distortion.

=== Balanced interconnection ===
Balanced connections see the spurious noise due to ground loop current as common-mode interference while the signal is differential, enabling them to be separated at the destination by circuits having a high common-mode rejection ratio. This rejection can be accomplished with transformers or semiconductor output drivers and line receivers.

With the increasing trend towards digital processing and transmission of audio signals, the full range of isolation by small pulse transformers, optocouplers or fiber optics become more useful. Standard protocols such as S/PDIF, AES3 or TOSLINK are available in relatively inexpensive equipment and allow full isolation, so ground loops need not arise, especially when connecting between audio systems and computers.

In instrumentation systems, the use of differential inputs with high common-mode rejection ratio, to minimize the effects of induced AC signals on the parameter to be measured, is widespread. It may also be possible to introduce narrow notch filters at the power frequency and its lower harmonics; however, this can not be done in audio systems due to the objectionable audible effects on the wanted signal.

==In analog video systems==
In analog video, mains hum can be seen as hum bars (bands of slightly different brightness) scrolling vertically up the screen. These are frequently seen with video projectors where the display device has its case grounded via a 3-prong plug, and the other components have a floating ground connected to the CATV coax. In this situation the video cable is grounded at the projector end to the home electrical system, and at the other end to the cable TV&#x27;s ground, inducing a current through the cable which distorts the picture. The problem is best solved with an isolation transformer in the CATV RF feed, a feature included in some CATV box designs.

Ground loop issues with television coaxial cable can affect any connected audio device such as a receiver. Even if all of the audio and video equipment in, for example, a home theatre system is plugged into the same power outlet, and thus all share the same ground, the coaxial cable entering the TV may be grounded by the cable company to a different point than that of the house&#x27;s electrical ground creating a ground loop, and causing undesirable mains hum in the system&#x27;s speakers.

==In digital and RF systems==
In digital systems, which commonly transmit data serially (RS-232, RS-485, USB, FireWire, DVI, HDMI etc.) the signal voltage is often much larger than induced power frequency AC on the connecting cable screens. Of those protocols listed, only RS-232 is single-ended with ground return, but it is a large signal, typically + and - 12V, all the others being differential. 

Differential signaling must use a balanced line to ensure that the signal does not radiate and that induced noise from a ground loop is a common-mode signal and can be removed at the differential receiver.

Many data communications systems such as Ethernet 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T, use DC-balanced encoding such as Manchester code. The ground loop(s) which would occur in most installations are avoided by using signal-isolating transformers.

Other systems break the ground loop at data frequencies by fitting small ferrite cores around the connecting cables near each end or just inside the equipment boundary. These form a common-mode choke which inhibits unbalanced current flow, without affecting the differential signal.

Coaxial cables used at radio frequencies may be wound several times through a ferrite core to add a useful amount of common-mode inductance. This limits the flow of unwanted high-frequency common-mode current along the cable shield.

Where no power need be transmitted, only digital data, the use of fiber optics can remove many ground loop problems, and sometimes safety problems too. Optical isolators or optocouplers are frequently used to provide ground loop isolation, and often safety isolation and can help prevent fault propagation.

==Internal ground loops in equipment==
Generally, the analog and digital parts of the circuit are in separate areas of the PCB, with their own ground planes to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce. These are tied together at a carefully chosen star point. Where analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are in use, the star point may have to be at or very close to the ground terminals of the ADC(s). Phase lock loop circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.

==In circuit design==
Grounding and the potential for ground loops are also important considerations in circuit design. In many circuits, large currents may exist through the ground plane, leading to voltage differences of the ground reference in different parts of the circuit, which can lead to hum and other problems. Techniques exist to avoid ground loops, and otherwise, guarantee good grounding:

* The external shield, and the shields of all connectors, should be connected together.
** If the power supply in the design is not isolated, this external chassis ground should be connected to the ground plane of the PCB at a single point; this single-point connection avoids large currents through the ground plane of the PCB.
** If the design uses an isolated power supply, this external ground should be connected to the ground plane of the PCB via a high voltage capacitor, such as 2200 pF at 2 kV.
** If the connectors are mounted on the PCB, the outer perimeter of the PCB should contain a strip of copper connecting to the shields of the connectors. There should be a break in copper between this strip, and the main ground plane of the circuit. The two should be connected at only one point. This way, if there is a large current between connector shields, it will not pass through the ground plane of the circuit.
* A star topology should be used for ground distribution, avoiding loops.
* High-power devices should be placed closest to the power supply, while low-power devices can be placed farther from it.
* Signals, wherever possible, should be differential.
* Isolated power supplies require careful consideration of parasitic, component, or internal PCB power plane capacitance that can allow AC present on input power or connectors to pass into the ground plane, or to any other internal signal. The AC may find a path back to its source via an I/O signal.

<text>Humason is a tiny lunar impact crater located in the Oceanus Procellarum. This is a cup-shaped crater with an outer rim that rises slightly above the surrounding lunar mare. To the west is a low system of mare wrinkle ridges named the Dorsa Whiston that wind southwards towards Montes Agricola.

This crater was previously identified as Lichtenberg G before being renamed by the IAU in 1973. The crater Lichtenberg itself lies over 100 kilometers to the west.

<doc id="940299" wikidata="Q2153620" url="?curid=940299" title="Ground loop (aviation)">
<text>In aviation, a ground loop is a rapid rotation of a fixed-wing aircraft in the horizontal plane (yawing) while on the ground. Aerodynamic forces may cause the advancing wing to rise, which may then cause the other wingtip to touch the ground. In severe cases (particularly if the ground surface is soft), the inside wing can dig in, causing the aircraft to swing violently or even cartwheel. In their early gliding experiments, the Wright Brothers referred to this action as &quot;well-digging&quot;.

==Looping phenomenon==
In powered aeroplanes, the ground loop phenomenon is predominantly associated with aircraft that have conventional landing gear, due to the centre of gravity being positioned behind the main wheels. It may also occur with tricycle landing gear if excessive load is applied to the nosewheel, a condition known as wheel-barrowing.

If the aircraft heading is different from the aircraft&#x27;s direction of motion, a sideways force is exerted on the wheels. If this force is in front of the centre of gravity, the resulting moment rotates the aircraft&#x27;s heading even further from its direction of motion. This increases the force and the process reinforces itself. To avoid a ground loop, the pilot must respond to any turning tendency quickly, while sufficient control authority is available to counteract it. Once the aircraft rotates beyond this point, there is nothing the pilot can do to stop it from rotating further.

==Contributing factors==
Ground loops occur when the aircraft is moving on the ground—either taxiing, landing, or during takeoff. Ground loops can damage the undercarriage and wingtips of an aircraft. Several extreme incidents of ground loop have resulted in fatalities.

In the case of the 1947 crash of Pan Am Flight 121, Captain Michael Graham, one of the surviving passengers, said that the landing would have been successful had an engine on the port wing not dug into the ground, dragging the plane in that direction in a ground loop and breaking it in two.

Ground loops may occur when landing on muddy ground, wet pavement, or frozen surfaces, especially if there are puddles or patches. They may also occur when an aircraft departs a paved surface: for example, after an engine failure in multi-engine airplanes produces asymmetric thrust. Another common cause is failure of a tire or wheel brake, causing a loss of directional control. 

A controlled ground loop may also be used as a rudimentary form of emergency braking while landing, &quot;in case one is still rolling too fast to stop.&quot; According to Robinet, &quot;The pilot would merely hold the right brake (in this case...no place on the left) harder than the left and wishes the airplane around in a tight turn on the ground. Another way of putting it, the airplane swaps ends. This is a ground loop.&quot;
Gliders commencing a takeoff behind a tow plane are vulnerable to ground looping during cross-wind conditions because the slipstream from the propeller of the tow plane generates more lift on the downwind wing of the glider than on the upwind wing. If the flight controls are unable to overcome the rolling tendency at this low speed, the upwind wingtip will contact the ground and initiate a ground loop; the glider pilot must release the tow rope to abandon the takeoff. Gliders with a large main wheel and a tail wheel or tail skid are particularly susceptible to this form of ground looping during cross-wind takeoffs because of the large angle of attack on the wing. Gliders with a nose wheel or nose skid cause the wing to present a lower angle of attack at the commencement of the take off roll and are much less susceptible to this form of ground looping. Tow plane pilots are taught to delay applying full power until the glider is moving fast enough that its tail is off the ground, reducing the angle of attack on the wing.

==Intentional looping==
Pilots may decide to execute a ground loop deliberately, usually as a last resort before hitting an immovable object, as in the case of China Airlines Flight 605. In such cases, energy may be dissipated by damaging the wings of the aircraft to protect the occupants seated in the fuselage.

<doc id="940301" wikidata="Q3083033" url="?curid=940301" title="Light Rail (MTR)">
<text>The Light Rail, also known as the Light Rail Transit (LRT), officially the North-West Railway, is a light rail system in Hong Kong, serving the northwestern New Territories, within Tuen Mun District and Yuen Long District. The system operates over track, using overhead power supply. It was once one of four systems comprising the KCR network in Hong Kong, before the MTR–KCR merger in 2007. It has a daily ridership of about 483,000 people. The network is coloured goldenrod on the MTR map.

== History ==
=== Planning and commencement ===
When Tuen Mun was developed in the 1970s, the Hong Kong government set aside space for the laying of rail tracks. There was uncertainty however as to which company would be chosen to build the railway. In 1982, Hong Kong Tramways showed interest in building the system and running double-decker trams on it, before abandoning the project after negotiations over land premiums for related property development failed. The government sought another builder. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) was &quot;heavily indebted&quot; at the time, and so Secretary for Transport Alan Scott invited the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) to consider the project instead. The KCRC announced they would build the system in 1984 to a budget of $1.5 billion, after investigating ways to improve commercial viability. After some research, construction commenced on 14 July 1985.

By that time, Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) had developed its own network in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, and there were about 10 routes serving within the districts internally, most of them profitable. However, the government introduced the concept of the &quot;Light Rail Service Area&quot; in both districts, within which the LRT would monopolise all public transport services, forcing the KMB to withdraw all internal bus services in favour of the Light Rail. It also forced the KMB to impose boarding and alighting restrictions for external routes. It was decided that services between town centres and settlements would be provided solely by the Light Rail, while feeder buses operated by the KCRC would connect remote sites to the network, replacing KMB&#x27;s equivalent services where applicable.

The system was completed and fully operational in September 1988. The first section was opened to the public on 14 September 1988, with free rides between Tuen Mun and Yuen Long; normal, all-day service began four days later, on 18 September. The system consisted of two large and three small loops serving most of the public housing estates in northern Tuen Mun. Three branches: one to On Ting Estate in the southeast, one to the Tuen Mun Ferry Pier in the southwest and another northern branch all the way into the town of Yuen Long along Castle Peak Road. It was then known as Light Rail Transit or LRT and is also called as the North-west Railway according to the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation Ordinance and Mass Transit Railway (North-west Railway) Bylaw.

The transit system is the first and the only one in Hong Kong to adopt a zonal fare system. The feeder buses have fares independent of these zones, but provide discounts when passengers interchange between these buses and LRT. Seventy single-deck LRVs were manufactured in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia by Comeng, to be shipped to Hong Kong for the seven LRT routes in the system. Three of the routes were to Yuen Long and the others were confined to Tuen Mun.

===Extensions===
The system&#x27;s first extension came for the southern and eastern parts of Tuen Mun. The eastern extension branches off the main line south of Siu Hong stop and crosses the river that runs through Tuen Mun immediately with a flyover. The line then runs along Castle Peak Road to a road north of the town centre, where it climbs to another flyover and rejoins the main route. The northern end of this extension is still the only non-triangular junction in the entire system.

The southern extension mainly consists of a route linking On Ting and Ferry Pier, on the newly reclaimed land near the river mouth of Tuen Mun River, known as &quot;Mouse Island&quot; by locals. A short spur was also built from the extension to another terminus at Sam Shing Estate, located near Castle Peak Bay. Three LRT routes were diverted (route 505 was extended to Sam Shing) and one feeder bus route (route 559) discontinued as a result of these changes.

Tin Shui Wai was originally an area with numerous fish ponds, but was developed as a residential new town in the early 1990s. With the increase of internal commuter traffic demand, an LRT spur was built north of Hung Shui Kiu stop that opened in 1993, with four stops serving the initial housing areas of the town. The area was further developed in the next few years and the line was extended by two stops: Chestwood and Tin Wing stop in 1995 (Tin Shui Wai Terminus was renamed Tin Wing after the opening of West Rail line). Two LRT routes were established, route 720 (now 751) to Yau Oi and route 721 Before Changed to (761) Then changed to (761P) to Yuen Long.

===West Rail===
The system remained essentially unchanged until the completion of the West Rail (now Tuen Ma line) in December 2003. Many changes were made, mainly around the new railway stations. The KCRC designed most railway stations in the LRT area to interchange with the new West Rail line. The idea was to encourage passengers to use the West Rail line instead of the Light Rail for longer journeys, thereby freeing up LRT vehicles for passengers making shorter journeys. For this purpose, an interchange discount system was launched with the introduction of the West Rail line system, meaning that passengers would pay no more (and in some cases less) to travel on West Rail line instead of the LRT for the main part of their journey. Although this most recent extension is the largest ever, no new vehicles were purchased. And although rearrangements were made, some infrequent and unreliable services resulted, causing passengers to blame the lack of vehicles and poor arrangement of new services. The KCRC has since modified the inside of some vehicles to allow more standing room for passengers during peak hours. They also made several route alterations to arrange them better.

In addition to the reconfiguration of light rail tracks around the new West Rail stations, the system was extended to reach northern Tin Shui Wai to serve ongoing development there.

==Rolling stock==

The system&#x27;s vehicles consist of five different types of LRVs. All LRVs are uni-directional with driving cab on one side only, long, and have 3 sliding doors fitted on the left side (when facing the running direction from inside). This means that island platforms (except the triangular platform at Siu Hong stop) cannot be used at all in the LRT system and the termini have to feature loops for LRVs to reverse in direction. Hong Kong and Kolkata are the only cities with unidirectional left-handed trams.

Phase I LRVs were built by Comeng and put in service in 1988. They are numbered 1001–1070 and accommodate 43 seated passengers and 161 standees. The driver&#x27;s cab interior and exterior design was conceived for KCRC by Design Triangle in 1986. Phase II LRVs were built by Kawasaki and entered service in 1992. They are numbered 1071-1090/1201-1210 and accommodate 26 seated and 185 standees. Cars 1071–1090 are cab cars while 1201–1210 are cabless trailers. Phase III LRVs were built by A Goninan and entered service in 1997. They are numbered 1091–1110 and accommodate 26 seated and 212 standees. Phase IV LRVs were manufactured by United Group and CSR and entered service in December 2009. They are numbered 1111–1132 accommodate 37 seated and 248 standees. Phase I LRVs have two wheelchair positions while Phase II, III, IV and V LRVs have three positions. The newest Phase V LRVs were manufactured by CRRC Nanjing Puzhen and entered service on 17 November 2020. They are numbered 1133-1162/1211-1220; 1133-1162 are cab cars while 1211-1220 are cabless trailer. 30 of these are set to replace existing Phase II LRVs, while the other 10 are for expansion.

Traction systems for Phase I and II LRVs consist of GTO thyristor choppers and DC traction motors provided by AEG, while those for the Phase III, IV and V LRVs consist of 2-level IGBT–VVVF inverters and asynchronous 3-phase AC traction motors provided by Mitsubishi Electric. The maximum speed for all LRVs is , although they rarely reach that speed because of the many grade crossings between stops and the close proximity between stops in Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai.

From the exterior it is difficult to differentiate between the first three types of LRVs. There are, however, distinct features that one can use to tell them apart; Phase III LRVs still retain their original green electronic displays while all other LRVs have new orange electronic displays. Phase I cars also have a wide window at the rear that can be opened in case of an emergency, while Phase II cars have a door at the back. The interior of the Phase III cars has a greenish look and the doors are also green. The Phase IV LRVs have a completely different appearance in contrast to the older phase. It has a white exterior livery with olive green and purple line on the side. The shape of the front of the LRV is more streamlined than the older phases. The door opening and closing mechanism was similar to the ones from the K-class cars used in the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line. The Phase IV has 3 surveillance cameras in each vehicle. Seat belts and wheelchair positions were also available in the Phase IV. On older-generation LRVs there is a perch seat but the Phase IVs do not maintain this feature. The refurbished Phase I LRVs have rounded rectangular windows while Phase IV LRVs have square ones.

The Phase II LRVs were not refurbished; upon the commissioning of 30 Phase V LRVs, this will see the Phase II LRVs phased out. Withdrawals began on 28 August 2022, with the first two Phase II LRVs (1079 and 1204) removed from Tuen Mun Depot and sent to the scrapyard. On 26 February 2023, the last of the Phase II LRVs were officially withdrawn from service following a retirement ceremony. One of the retired cars now survives at the Ying Wa College and Primary School, transformed into a classroom. Meanwhile, the Phase III LRVs are expected to be rebuilt and repainted with a scheme similar to the Phase IV LRVs. 

In June 2024, the MTR received its first hydrogen-powered light rail.

==Stops and routes==
===Stops===
===Notes===
===Routes===
There are currently 12 routes in the Light Rail system.
* Route 505 runs between Siu Hong and Sam Shing via Kin On. The route was created in 1988 and extended from On Ting to Sam Shing in 1992. On 14 July 2002, due to the Light Rail grade separation works on Pui To Road being done as part of the Light Rail&#x27;s integration with the then-under construction West Rail, route 505 was diverted to operate via Ngan Wai, and service to Shan King (North), Shan King (South) and Kin On was replaced by a temporary bus also numbered 505. The prior service was restored on 30 August 2003, following the completion of the grade separation works.
* runs between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Tin King via Ngan Wai. It was created in 1989 and was extended from On Ting to Tuen Mun Ferry Pier in 1991.
* runs between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Yuen Long via Ngan Wai and Ming Kum. It was created in 1988.
* runs between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Yuen Long via San Hui. It was created in 1992 and replaced route 611, which ran between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Yuen Long via Ho Tin and Kin On from 1988 to 1992.
* runs between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Yuen Long via Tin King. It was created in 1993.It was the longest route in MTR Light Rail.
* Routes and were created on 4 April 2004, and operate a circular service between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Siu Hong. The routes were created as a result of the Light Rail&#x27;s transition into becoming a short-distance feeder service for West Rail, and upon their creation the service frequencies of routes 614 and 615 were accordingly halved, such that the overall service levels at stops between Siu Hong and Tuen Mun Ferry Pier remained the same.
* runs an anticlockwise service around the Tin Shui Wai area via Tin Yat. The route was created on 22 August 2004 and replaced route 701, which ran a shorter anticlockwise service via Chestwood between 16 December 2003 and 21 August 2004.
* runs a clockwise service around the Tin Shui Wai area and serves the same stops as route 705. The route was created on 9 April 2004 to enhance short-distance feeder service in Tin Shui Wai.
* runs between Tin Yat and Yau Oi. It was created on 7 December 2003 and replaced route 720, which ran between Tin Wing and Yau Oi from 1994 to 2003. (Route 720 was created in 1994 and replaced route 722, which ran between Tin Wing and Siu Hong from 1993 to 1994, as well as route 612, which ran between Yuen Long and Yau Oi from 1988 to 1994.)
* operates as a short-distance variant of route 751 between Tin Yat and Tin Shui Wai, and runs only during peak hours on school days. It was created in August 2004.
* runs between Tin Yat and Yuen Long via Locwood. It was originally a short-distance variant of , but then replaced route 761 when it was permanently discontinued on 8 October 2006. Route 761 ran between Tin Wing and Yuen Long via Wetland Park from 7 December 2003 to 7 October 2006, and was a replacement of , which ran between Tin Wing and Yuen Long via Chestwood from 1993 to 2003. After the discontinuation of route 761, special services of route 761P to Tin Wing continued to operate at 30-minute intervals from 10:00 to 15:00 daily until 23 August 2010.

The present MTR Bus route 506 retains the number of the Light Rail route that it replaced. Light Rail ran between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Yau Oi via Kin On; it was created in 1988 and was extended from On Ting to Yau Oi in 1992. On 14 July 2002, due to the Light Rail grade separation works on Pui To Road, the route was suspended in its entirety and replaced by bus route 506. The suspension was originally intended to be temporary, but the Light Rail route was never resumed.

== Fares ==
The Light Rail is the only public transport system in Hong Kong to have fare zones and the only one with an honour system, in which there are no ticket gates. These fare zones apply only to passengers purchasing single-ride tickets from ticketing machines at LRT stops. Since the introduction of Octopus cards, however, passengers have a choice of ticketing options. All fares indicated below are for adults, while children and the elderly usually pay the concessionary fare, which is about half the adult fare.

=== Single-ride tickets ===
There are six fare zones – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5A – for passengers purchasing single-ride tickets in Light Rail stops. Zone 5A was introduced solely for the latest extension in Tin Shui Wai, and both zones 5 and 5A are only connected to Zone 4. Therefore, travelling between zones 5 and 5A is considered as travelling through three zones.

=== Octopus cards ===
Octopus card fares are calculated based on the minimum number of stops travelled (from origin to destination stops), rather than the number of fare zones travelled through. All stops have Octopus entry and exit processors at the entrances to and exits from platforms. Passengers may enter the system after scanning their Octopus card at an orange &#x27;Entry Processor&#x27; reader. At this point, the maximum fare is deducted from the card. On completion of a journey, the card previously read by an &#x27;Entry Processor&#x27; must be scanned at a dark-green &#x27;Exit Processor&#x27;, where the maximum fare less the fare incurred is refunded. Failure to do so within the time limit would cause the fare difference to be forfeited. If a person exits the same platform with the same card within 5 minutes, the fare deducted will be fully refunded.

Light-blue &#x27;Enquiry Processors&#x27; can also be found on most platforms. Like enquiry processors found in other places, passengers can check the balance on their card, along with the 10 most recent Octopus transactions. If a Personalised Octopus card is used, the number of Light Rail credits accumulated is also shown.

Passengers using Personalised Octopus cards are able to participate in the Light Rail Bonus Scheme. A card on which fares totalling HK$30 (adults) or HK$15 (children/seniors) or more are paid over six consecutive days gets an automatic credit of HK$3 (adults) or HK$1.5 (children/seniors).

Passengers using Octopus cards that are registered with the MTR Club are automatically enrolled into the MTR Club Bonus Scheme. Members can earn Bonus Points by riding on the MTR, Airport Express, Light Rail and MTR Bus with their registered Octopus card during the promotion period. Members can then redeem these points for exclusive rewards. Passengers can visit the MTR website for the information of the gift during that particular promotion period.
== Incidents ==
* In July 1994, a light rail vehicle (Phase l car 1013) and a lorry collided, killing the LRV captain.The involved car, 1013, was scrapped after the accident, making it the first light rail vehicle to be retired due to a crash.
* On 11 September 1994, a coach carrying factory workers ran a red light and was crushed between two light rail trains at a junction near Fu Tei. The coach driver and a coach passenger were killed. The two LRV captains were cleared of wrongdoing. The railway inspectorate also said the design of the junction was not to blame. The government said it would implement video recording at LRT junctions, improve road signage between Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, and better educate drivers.
* On 13 January 1995, a light rail train derailed as a result of intentional vandalism to the points at Tin King and Ming Kum roads. The KCRC had not received any threats or warning beforehand.
* On 9 February 2010, a construction crane fell on an LRT train (Phase IV car 1118) as it approached Leung King stop while operating on route 505 for Siu Hong. 18 were injured. The involved car, 1118, was scrapped in 2012 and a replacement car with the same number was bought by MTR in 2015.
* On 17 May 2013, a CSR Phase IV light rail train, cars 1112 and 1117 on route 761P, derailed and crashed while navigating a tight curve at 40.9 km/h, in excess of the posted speed limit of 15 km/h. The train was turning from Kiu Hung Road to Castle Peak Road south of Tin Shui Wai. At least 77 people were injured in the crash. The LRV captain was convicted of negligence under the Mass Transit Railway Ordinance. The front car, 1112, was scrapped after the accident and a replacement car with the same number was bought by MTR shortly after.
* On 19 August 2013, a 63-year-old man was killed at Locwood stop while crossing the tracks at a crossing point; the train did not stop in time.
* On 21 November 2014, LRV 1093 on route 507 collided with an MTR double decker bus near Tuen Mun Ferry Terminus. The bus crashed because it ran a red light. The train derailed and 20 were injured.
* On 23 July 2023, a train on route 614P departing platform 5 of Tuen Mun Ferry Pier stop collided with a train on route 507 departing platform 6. There were no injuries. The rail operator is investigating the incident, which it believes was caused by human error. The driver of the route 614P train has been temporarily suspended from driving duties to assist with the investigation.
* On 4 October 2023, two trains departing Yuen Long stop, a train on route 761P from platform 5 and an empty train from platform 1, collided at an intersection. 3 of the 120 passengers on board the route 761P train suffered minor injuries. According to preliminary findings by the rail operator, it was suspected that human error had caused the derailment.
* On 18 May 2024, the rear bogie of LRV 1016 derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen stop while the two-car train was heading back to Tuen Mun Depot. The derailment was caused by a wooden board at the spot where the train derailed, which fell off from a truck travelling along Castle Peak Road. The 49-year-old driver was arrested following a police report by the rail operator.

<doc id="940302" wikidata="Q948093" url="?curid=940302" title="Juice Leskinen">
<text>Juhani Juice Leskinen (born Pauli Matti Juhani Leskinen; 19 February 1950 – 24 November 2006), better known as Juice Leskinen ( as if the word &quot;juice&quot; were Finnish) was one of the most important and successful Finnish singer-songwriters of the late 20th century. From the early 1970s onward he released nearly 30 full-length albums and wrote song lyrics for dozens of other Finnish artists. Several of Leskinen&#x27;s songs have reached classic status in Finnish popular music, e.g., &quot;Viidestoista yö&quot;, &quot;Kaksoiselämää&quot; and &quot;Syksyn sävel&quot;. His early records are considered staples of the so-called Manserock movement of the mid-&#x27;70s. He also wrote poetry and plays and published nine collections of verse and seven plays.

After moving to Tampere to study English translation in 1970, Leskinen began his recording career in 1973 with the eponymous debut album of Juice Leskinen &amp; Coitus Int. One more record, &quot;Per Vers, runoilija&quot;, was made under the same band name, but from then on he released records with several line-ups, most notably Juice Leskinen Slam and Juice Leskinen Grand Slam from the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. Although concentrating more on poetry from the early 1990s, Leskinen still released new music every few years despite his failing health, which was caused by the unhealthy lifestyle he had led for years. After the longest hiatus of his recording career, &quot;L&quot; marked Leskinen&#x27;s 50th birthday in 2000. His last record, &quot;Senaattori ja boheemi&quot; (released in 2004), is a collaboration with Mikko Alatalo, a return to their partnership of the early 1970s. He wrote &quot;Nuku pommiin&quot; in 1982 for the Eurovision Song Contest.

Juice Leskinen&#x27;s most famous songs include &quot;Viidestoista yö&quot; (&quot;Fifteenth Night&quot;), &quot;Musta aurinko nousee&quot; (&quot;A Sun Rises out of Me&quot;, often misunderstood as &quot;The Black Sun Rises&quot; despite a clear pause between &quot;musta&quot; and &quot;aurinko&quot;), &quot;Marilyn&quot;, &quot;Rakkauden ammattilainen&quot; (&quot;Love Pro&quot;), &quot;Norjalainen villapaita&quot; (&quot;Norwegian Sweater&quot;) and &quot;Kaksoiselämää&quot; (Double Life).

Leskinen was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in the early 2000s.

He qualified 38th in the poll of the 100 greatest Finns held during the summer of 2004.

Leskinen died in 2006, after living with chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis and diabetes. He is buried in Kalevankangas cemetery, Tampere, near the main gate.
Leskinen has gained a considerable amount of posthumous recognition. A musical about Leskinen, titled &quot;Juice – taiteilijaelämää&quot; (an artist&#x27;s life) premiered in Tampere on 30 August 2011.
In 2015, two film companies announced plans for biography films. One of them was cancelled.
In 2014 a biography of Leskinen was published, written by Antti Heikkinen, and named &quot;Risainen elämä. Juice Leskinen 1950–2006&quot;.

<doc id="940303" wikidata="Q838304" url="?curid=940303" title="Tyr (album)">
<text>Tyr () (stylized as ᛏᛉᚱ) is the fifteenth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released on 20 August 1990 by I.R.S. Records.

The album title, and several song titles, allude to Norse mythology, which led many to call &quot;Tyr&quot; a concept album, although bassist Neil Murray dispelled that in 2005, stating that while many of the songs may seem loosely related, very little of the album has to do with mythology and it was not intended to be a concept recording.

In 2024, a remaster of the album was announced as part of the box set &quot;Anno Domini 1989–1995&quot;, marking the first time the album has been officially reissued. The 2024 remaster was also released as a stand alone CD and vinyl on November 15th, 2024. 

==Album information==
The album’s departure from the darker lyrics of &quot;Headless Cross&quot; was discussed by Tony Iommi in his 2012 autobiography &quot;Iron Man&quot;: “For our next album, &quot;Tyr&quot;, we went back to the Woodcray Studios in February 1990, with me and Cozy producing it again. On &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, Tony Martin had just come into the band and he assumed, oh, Black Sabbath, it’s all about the Devil, so his lyrics were full of the Devil and Satan. It was too much in your face. We told him to be a bit more subtle about it, so for &quot;Tyr&quot; he did all these lyrics about Nordic gods and whatnot. It took me a while to get my head around that.” The album was originally intended to be titled &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; but &quot;Tyr&quot; was chosen instead to disassociate it from the dark themes of the previous album.

This album represents possibly the most dramatic departure from Black Sabbath’s traditional sound, with only traces of it found in the occasional riff. The production has been criticised by some (who claim Cozy Powell’s drums drown out most of the other instruments) and praised by others, who note that this is one of Sabbath’s heaviest albums and perhaps the most prominently reliant on keyboards by the perennial fifth member, Geoff Nicholls.

The band have stated that while they do not disown or regret the song “Feels Good to Me”, it was put on the album solely to be released as a single and does not fit in musically with the rest of the record. The Tyr tour never made it beyond UK &amp; Europe and consisted of around 50 shows total.

Geezer Butler, Ian Gillan and Brian May made guest appearances on the European leg of the Tyr tour; Butler and May appearing during the encore of the show performed on 8 September 1990 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.

In Norse mythology, Týr is the god of single combat and heroic glory, and the son of Odin. The runes on the cover, ᛏ, ᛉ, and ᚱ are taken from the Rök runestone in Sweden. The middle rune, algiz, is transcribed as the modern letter &quot;x&quot; or &quot;z&quot;, not &quot;y&quot;.

==Legacy==
The only track to feature on post-&quot;Tyr&quot; tours was “Anno Mundi”, e.g. on the &quot;Cross Purposes Live&quot; VHS/DVD. Tony Martin re-recorded “Jerusalem” for his 1992 solo album &quot;Back Where I Belong&quot;. The Black Sabbath line-up that recorded &quot;Tyr&quot; would reunite to record their eighteenth studio album, &quot;Forbidden&quot;, in 1995. Frontman Heri Joensen of Viking metal band Týr claims to have been influenced by the album cover when designing his own band’s logo.

==Track listing==


The live tracks on this single were recorded at the Olimpiski Hall in Moscow, Soviet Union, in November 1989.

<doc id="940304" wikidata="Q157524" url="?curid=940304" title="Podocarpus">
<text>Podocarpus () is a genus of conifers, the most numerous and widely distributed of the podocarp family, the Podocarpaceae. &quot;Podocarpus&quot; species are evergreen shrubs or trees, usually from tall, known to reach at times. The cones have two to five fused cone scales, which form a fleshy, berry-like, brightly coloured receptacle at maturity. The fleshy cones attract birds, which then eat the cones and disperse the seeds in their droppings. About 97 to 107 species are placed in the genus depending on the circumscription of the species.

Species are cultivated as ornamental plants for parks and large gardens. The cultivar &#x27;County Park Fire&#x27; has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from Greek &quot;poús&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;karpós&quot; meaning &quot;fruit&quot;.

=== Names ===
Common names for various species include &quot;yellowwood&quot; and &quot;pine&quot;, as in the plum pine (&quot;Podocarpus elatus&quot;) or the Buddhist pine (&quot;Podocarpus macrophyllus&quot;).

== Description ==
&quot;Podocarpus&quot; species are evergreen woody plants. They are generally trees, but may also be shrubs. The trees can reach a height of at their tallest. Some shrubby species have a decumbent growth habit. The primary branches form pseudowhorls around the trunk. The bark can be scaly or fibrous and peeling with vertical strips. Terminal buds are distinctive with bud scales that are often imbricate and can be spreading.

The leaves are simple and flattened, and may be sessile or short petiolate. The phyllotaxis or leaf arrangement is spiral, and may be subopposite on some shoots. The leaves are usually linear-lanceolate or linear-elliptic in shape, though they can be broader lanceolate, ovate, or nearly elliptic in some species. Juvenile leaves are often larger than adult leaves, though similar in shape. The leaves are coriaceous and have a distinct midrib. The stomata are usually restricted to the abaxial or underside of the leaf, forming two stomatal bands around the midrib.

&quot;Podocarpus&quot; spp. are generally dioecious, with the male pollen cones and female seed cones borne on separate individual plants, but some species may be monoecious. The cones develop from axillary buds, and may be solitary or form clusters.

The pollen cones are long and catkin-like in shape. They may be sessile or short pedunculate. A pollen cone consists of a slender rachis with numerous spirally arranged microsporophylls around it. Each triangular microsporophyll has two basal pollen-producing pollen sacs. The pollen is bisaccate.

The seed cones are highly modified with the few cone scales swelling and fusing at maturity. The cones are pedunculate and often solitary. The seed cone consists of two to five cone scales of which only the uppermost one or rarely two nearest the apex of the cone are fertile. Each fertile scale usually has one apical ovule. The infertile basal scales fuse and swell to form a succulent, usually brightly colored receptacle. Each cone generally has only one seed, but may have two or rarely more. The seed is attached to the apex of the receptacle. The seed is entirely covered by a fleshy modified scale known as an epimatium. The epimatium is usually green, but may be bluish or reddish in some species.

== Distribution ==
The natural distribution of the genus consists of much of Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, and several South Pacific islands. The genus occurs from southern Chile north to Mexico in the Americas and from New Zealand north to Japan in the Asia-Pacific region.

&quot;Podocarpus&quot; and the Podocarpaceae were endemic to the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which broke up into Africa, South America, India, Australia-New Guinea, New Zealand, and New Caledonia between 105 and 45 million years ago. &quot;Podocarpus&quot; is a characteristic tree of the Antarctic flora, which originated in the cool, moist climate of southern Gondwana, and elements of the flora survive in the humid temperate regions of the former supercontinent. As the continents drifted north and became drier and hotter, podocarps and other members of the Antarctic flora generally retreated to humid regions, especially in Australia, where sclerophyll genera such as &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; became predominant. The flora of Malesia, which includes the Malay peninsula, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Guinea, is generally derived from Asia, but includes many elements of the old Gondwana flora, including several other genera in the Podocarpaceae (&quot;Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, Falcatifolium, Nageia, Phyllocladus,&quot; and the Malesian endemic &quot;Sundacarpus&quot;), and also &quot;Agathis&quot; in the Araucariaceae.

==Classification==

The two subgenera, &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Foliolatus&quot;, are distinguished by cone and seed morphology.

In &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, the cone is not subtended by lanceolate bracts, and the seed usually has an apical ridge. Species are distributed in the temperate forests of Tasmania, New Zealand, and southern Chile, with a few occurring in the tropical highlands of Africa and the Americas.

In &quot;Foliolatus&quot;, the cone is subtended by two lanceolate bracts (&quot;foliola&quot;), and the seed usually lacks an apical ridge. The species are tropical and subtropical, concentrated in eastern and southeastern Asia and Malesia, overlapping with subgenus &quot;Podocarpus&quot; in northeastern Australia and New Caledonia.

Species in family Podocarpaceae have been reshuffled a number of times based on genetic and physiological evidence, with many species formerly assigned to &quot;Podocarpus&quot; now assigned to other genera. A sequence of classification schemes has moved species between &quot;Nageia&quot; and &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, and in 1969, de Laubenfels divided the huge genus &quot;Podocarpus&quot; into &quot;Dacrycarpus, Decussocarpus&quot; (an invalid name he later revised to the valid &quot;Nageia&quot;), &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;, and &quot;Podocarpus&quot;.

Some species of genus &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; were formerly in &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, such as &quot;Afrocarpus gracilior&quot;.

==Allergenic potential==
Male &quot;Podocarpus&quot; spp. are extremely allergenic, and have an OPALS allergy-scale rating of 10 out of 10. Conversely, completely female &quot;Podocarpus&quot; plants have an OPALS rating of 1, and are considered &quot;allergy-fighting&quot;, as they capture pollen while producing none.

&quot;Podocarpus&quot; resemble yews, and as with yews, the stems, leaves, flowers, and pollen of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; are all poisonous. Additionally, the leaves, stems, bark, and pollen are cytotoxic. The male &quot;Podocarpus&quot; blooms and releases this cytotoxic pollen in the spring and early summer.

==Uses==
The earliest use of &quot;P. elongatus&quot; dates back to the southern African Middle Stone Age where it was used to produce an adhesive by distillation. Today, several species of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; are grown as garden trees, or trained into hedges, espaliers, or screens. In the novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; by Michael Crichton, &quot;Podocarpus&quot; trees (misspelled as &quot;protocarpus&quot;) were used on Isla Nublar, Costa Rica, to conceal electric fences from visitors. Common garden species used for their attractive deep-green foliage and neat habits include &quot;P. macrophyllus&quot;, known commonly as Buddhist pine, fern pine, or &quot;kusamaki&quot;, &quot;P. salignus&quot; from Chile, and &quot;P. nivalis&quot;, a smaller, red-fleshy-coned shrub. Some members of the genera &quot;Nageia&quot;, &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;, and &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; are marketed under the genus name &quot;Podocarpus&quot;.

The red, purple, or bluish fleshy cone (popularly called a &quot;fruit&quot;) of most species of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; are edible, raw or cooked into jams or pies. They have a mucilaginous texture with a slightly sweet flavor. They are slightly toxic, so should be eaten only in small amounts, especially when raw.

Some species of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; are used in systems of traditional medicine for conditions such as fevers, coughs, arthritis, sexually transmitted diseases, and canine distemper.

<text>Stanislao Cannizzaro ( , , ; 13 July 1826 – 10 May 1910) was an Italian chemist. He is famous for the Cannizzaro reaction and for his influential role in the atomic-weight deliberations of the Karlsruhe Congress in 1860.

== Biography ==
Cannizzaro was born in Palermo in 1826. He entered the university there with the intention of making medicine his profession, but he soon turned to the study of chemistry. In 1845 and 1846, he acted as assistant to Raffaele Piria (1815–1865), known for his work on salicin, and who was then professor of chemistry at Pisa and subsequently occupied the same position at Turin.

During the Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848, Cannizzaro served as an artillery officer at Messina and was also chosen deputy for Francavilla in the Sicilian parliament; and, after the fall of Messina in September 1848, he was stationed at Taormina. On the collapse of the insurgents, Cannizzaro escaped to Marseille in May 1849, and, after visiting various French towns, reached Paris in October. There he gained an introduction to Michel Eugène Chevreul&#x27;s laboratory, and in conjunction with F.S. Cloez (1817–1883) made his first contribution to chemical research, in 1851, when they prepared cyanamide by the action of ammonia on cyanogen chloride in ethereal solution. In the same year, Cannizzaro accepted an appointment at the National College of Alessandria, Piedmont as professor of physical chemistry. In Alessandria, he discovered that aromatic aldehydes are decomposed by an alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide into a mixture of the corresponding acid and alcohol. For example, benzaldehyde decomposes into benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol, the Cannizzaro reaction.

In the autumn of 1855, Cannizzaro became professor of chemistry at the University of Genoa, and, after further professorships at Pisa and Naples, he accepted the chair of inorganic and organic chemistry at Palermo. There, he spent ten years studying aromatic compounds and continuing to work on amines, until in 1871 when he was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the University of Rome.

Apart from his work on organic chemistry, which includes also an investigation of santonin, Cannizzaro rendered great service to chemistry with his 1858 paper &quot;Sunto di un corso di Filosofia chimica&quot;, or &quot;Sketch of a course of chemical philosophy&quot;, in which he insisted on the distinction, previously hypothesized by Amadeo Avogadro, between atomic and molecular weights. Cannizzaro showed how the atomic weights of elements contained in volatile compounds can be deduced from the molecular weights of those compounds, and how the atomic weights of elements of whose compounds the vapour densities are unknown can be determined from a knowledge of their specific heats. For these achievements, of fundamental importance to atomic theory, he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1891.

In 1871, Cannizzaro&#x27;s scientific eminence secured him admission to the Italian senate, of which he was vice-president, and as a member of the Council of Public Instruction and in other ways he rendered important services to the cause of scientific education in Italy.

He is best known for his contribution to the then-existing debate over atoms, molecules, and atomic weights. He championed Avogadro&#x27;s law that equal volumes of gas at the same pressure and temperature held equal numbers of molecules or atoms, and the notion that equal volumes of gas could be used to calculate atomic weights. In doing so, Cannizzaro provided a new understanding of chemistry.

<doc id="940316" wikidata="Q412285" url="?curid=940316" title="Dystrophin">
<text>Dystrophin is a rod-shaped cytoplasmic protein, and a vital part of a protein complex that connects the cytoskeleton of a muscle fiber to the surrounding extracellular matrix through the cell membrane. This complex is variously known as the costamere or the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Many muscle proteins, such as α-dystrobrevin, syncoilin, synemin, sarcoglycan, dystroglycan, and sarcospan, colocalize with dystrophin at the costamere. It has a molecular weight of 427 kDa 

Dystrophin is coded for by the &quot;DMD&quot; gene – the largest known human gene, covering 2.4 megabases (0.08% of the human genome) at locus Xp21. The primary transcript in muscle measures about 2,100 kilobases and takes 16 hours to transcribe; the mature mRNA measures 14.0 kilobases. The 79-exon muscle transcript codes for a protein of 3685 amino acid residues.

Spontaneous or inherited mutations in the dystrophin gene can cause different forms of muscular dystrophy, a disease characterized by progressive muscular wasting. The most common of these disorders caused by genetic defects in dystrophin is Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

== Function ==
Dystrophin is a protein located between the sarcolemma and the outermost layer of myofilaments in the muscle fiber (myofiber). It is a cohesive protein, linking actin filaments to other support proteins that reside on the inside surface of each muscle fiber&#x27;s plasma membrane (sarcolemma). These support proteins on the inside surface of the sarcolemma in turn links to two other consecutive proteins for a total of three linking proteins. The final linking protein is attached to the fibrous endomysium of the entire muscle fiber. Dystrophin supports muscle fiber strength, and the absence of dystrophin reduces muscle stiffness, increases sarcolemmal deformability, and compromises the mechanical stability of costameres and their connections to nearby myofibrils. This has been shown in recent studies where biomechanical properties of the sarcolemma and its links through costameres to the contractile apparatus were measured, and helps to prevent muscle fiber injury. Movement of thin filaments (actin) creates a pulling force on the extracellular connective tissue that eventually becomes the tendon of the muscle. The dystrophin associated protein complex also helps scaffold various signalling and channel proteins, implicating the DAPC in regulation of signalling processes.

== Pathology ==

Dystrophin deficiency has been definitively established as one of the root causes of the general class of myopathies collectively referred to as muscular dystrophy. The deletions of one or several exons of the dystrophin &quot;DMD&quot; gene cause Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. The large cytosolic protein was first identified in 1987 by Louis M. Kunkel, after concurrent works by Kunkel and Robert G. Worton to characterize the mutated gene that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). At least nine disease-causing mutations in this gene have been discovered.

Normal skeletal muscle tissue contains only small amounts of dystrophin (about 0.002% of total muscle protein), but its absence (or abnormal expression) leads to the development of a severe and currently incurable constellation of symptoms most readily characterized by several aberrant intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately yield pronounced myofiber necrosis as well as progressive muscle weakness and fatigability. Most DMD patients become wheelchair-dependent early in life, and the gradual development of cardiac hypertrophy—a result of severe myocardial fibrosis—typically results in premature death in the first two or three decades of life. Variants (mutations) in the DMD gene that lead to the production of too little or a defective, internally shortened but partially functional dystrophin protein, result in a display of a much milder dystrophic phenotype in affected patients, resulting in the disease known as Becker&#x27;s muscular dystrophy (BMD). In some cases, the patient&#x27;s phenotype is such that experts may decide differently on whether a patient should be diagnosed with DMD or BMD. The theory currently most commonly used to predict whether a variant will result in a DMD or BMD phenotype, is the reading frame rule.

Though its role in airway smooth muscle is not well established, recent research indicates that dystrophin along with other subunits of dystrophin glycoprotein complex is associated with phenotype maturation.

== Research==
A number of models are used to facilitate research on DMD gene defects. These include the mdx mouse, GRMD (golden retriever muscular dystrophy) dog, and HFMD (hypertrophic feline muscular dystrophy) cat.

The mdx mouse contains a nonsense mutation in exon 23, leading to a shortened dystrophin protein. Levels of dystrophin in this model is not zero: a variety of mutation alleles exist with measurable levels certain of dystrophin isoforms. Muscle degeneration pathology is most easily visible in the diaphragm. Generally, clinically relevant pathology is observed with older mdx mice.

The GRMD dog is one of several existing dystrophin-deficient dogs identified where substantial characterization has been performed. Clinically relevant pathology can be observed at 8 weeks after birth, with continued gradual deterioration of muscle function. Muscle histology is most analogous to clinical presentation of DMD in humans with necrosis, fibrosis and regeneration.

The HFMD cat has a deletion in the promoter region of the DMD gene. Muscle histology shows necrosis but no fibrosis. Extensive hypertrophy has been observed which is thought to be responsible for shorter lifespans. Due to the hypertrophy, this model may have limited uses for DMD studies.  

==Therapeutic microdystrophin==
* Delandistrogene moxeparvovec - systemic gene transfer with rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin.

== Interactions ==
Dystrophin has been shown to interact with:
* DTNA,
* SNTA1, and
* SNTB1.

==Neanderthal admixture==
A variant of the DMD gene, which is on the X chromosome, named B006, appears to be an introgression from a Neanderthal-modern human mating.

<text>Ibn-Rushd is a lunar impact crater located to the northwest of the larger crater Cyrillus. To the northwest is the crater Kant and to the north is Mons Penck, a mountain promontory. The crater is somewhat eroded with age, and the southern rim is overlain by a pair of smaller craters named Cyrillus B and C. The crater floor is relatively flat, and lacks a central peak. In 1976 the crater was named after Ibn Rushd (Latinized as Averroes), the 12th-century Muslim polymath from the Islamic Spain, whose many scientific accomplishments included analysis of the lunar surface. Prior to that, it was identified as Cyrillus B.

<text>Testor Corporation (or Testors) is an American manufacturer of tools and accessories for scale model kits. The business is based in Rockford, Illinois, and is part of RPM International. It was founded in 1929 and its products are made in the US and marketed to customers worldwide.

The Testors&#x27; line of products include enamel paints, acrylic paints, aerosol paints, adhesives, brushes, cutting tools, commercialised under the Testors, Model Master, Spray Chalk, and Testors Craft brands.

== History == 
=== Beginnings ===
Axel Karlson had been producing a product known as &quot;Karlsons Klister&quot; (&quot;klister&quot; being Swedish for glue), which was originally intended for use in the repair of women&#x27;s stockings, but had quickly found use in other applications as well. In February 1929, Karlson convinced Nils F. Testor (1903–1967), then the manager of an F. W. Woolworth store in the Swedish district of Rockford, Illinois, to serve as office manager of his new enterprise. It was a relatively risky move for Testor, who began his career as a stockroom boy in Woolworth&#x27;s Chicago store on State Street. Karlson&#x27;s Klister ultimately proved unsuccessful, and Karlson returned home to Sweden. Testor borrowed enough money to purchase the firm&#x27;s assets and founded &quot;The Testor Chemical Company&quot;.

By the time Testor arrived, cobblers had become the product&#x27;s primary market. Coming to the conclusion that the only way to save his new acquisition was to sell the product to additional markets, Testor renamed the adhesive &quot;Crystal Clear Household Cement&quot; and began marketing it to households as a general-purpose repair product, while continuing to sell a large quantity to shoemakers.

Testor&#x27;s actions proved to be successful, and by 1936 the company was able to expand its product line. Staying true to its status as a chemical corporation, hobbyist model cement and butyrate dope were introduced to the public. Four years later, Testor Corporation became a founding member of The Hobby Industry of America, an association of hobby parts suppliers and manufacturers.

=== World War II ===
Industrial production, necessitated by World War II, caused severe shortages of raw materials for manufacturers not directly involved in the war effort. In Testor&#x27;s case, this manifested itself in difficulties acquiring the chemicals necessary to continue producing its line of adhesives and paints. As a result, the company was forced to branch out into other segments of the hobby market. To this end, Testor began producing static scale models of popular aircraft out of pinewood. These scale models proved enormously popular, and enabled Testor Corporation to survive, despite its inability to produce its flagship chemical products in any significant quantity.

On February 1, 1944, a fire broke out at Testor&#x27;s main Rockford facility. In addition to totally destroying the upper two floors of the four-story brick building, production lines and equipment suffered severe damage from both the fire itself and from the water used to douse the flames. Total damage was estimated at over US$200,000; however, in less than a year a new, larger plant was built and production continued. With the end of the war, the company was able to resume production of its trademark glues and paints, including adhesives for the plastics that were quickly becoming popular. Additionally, surpluses of ultra-lightweight balsa wood left over from the war enabled the company to begin producing flying wooden aircraft models as well as provide raw balsa wood for builders of custom-designed models.

=== Acquisitions and partnerships ===
In 1949, Nils Testor began talks with Charles Miller, president of Duromatic Products, regarding a possible partnership. Duromatic was the manufacturer of the McCoy hobby engine, a popular motor for self-propelled models. These talks culminated in a joint marketing agreement of the McCoy engine with Testor model airplanes, as well as an agreement for each company to design its respective products to be interoperable with those of the other.

By the 1960s, plastics had risen to prominence in American life, including the hobby industry. Almost all model kits on the market were plastic, necessitating paints (the square, glass Testor paint bottles were sold in almost every dime store, department store, hardware store, toy store and hobby store in the US in the 1960s, making them truly ubiquitous) and glues different from those used for wooden models. Although Testor had been producing such chemicals since the 1940s, it had resisted producing plastic model kits for quite some time. 
However, the company could not stick to its tried-and-true line of wooden models indefinitely, and so in the early 1970s it purchased IMC and the Hawk Model Company, both well-respected manufacturers of plastic model kits. Later that same decade, the Italian model kit manufacturer Italeri was acquired, further expanding Testor&#x27;s line of plastic model kits, usually repackaged with photographs rather than paintings on the box.

In 1984–87, Testors sponsored a video series &quot;Adventures in Scale Modeling&quot;. The program featured half-hour segments on detailed model building with an on-location shoot featuring the item being modeled. The shows were produced by WSWP-TV.

From the late 80s through today, Testors partnered up with diecast brands such as Bburago, Jouef, Racing Champions, Lincoln Mint, Maisto, etc. to rebox them as model kits, usually for younger modelers as an alternative to the traditional plastic models also reboxed at the time.

==F-19==
In January 1986 Testors released a model kit of a hypothetical F-19 Stealth Fighter, designed using open source intelligence before the real F-117 Nighthawk was introduced. Although it was very different from the actual plane, video games and many other toys and models were inspired by this fictional design. Many features, such as canted fins, were used on the Nighthawk and other subsequent stealth designs. A Soviet fighter would be produced as well.

<text>Shoemaking is the process of making footwear.

Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand, often by groups of shoemakers, or &quot;cordwainers&quot; (sometimes misidentified as cobblers, who repair shoes rather than make them). In the 18th century, dozens or even hundreds of masters, journeymen, and apprentices (both men and women) would work together in a shop, dividing the work into individual tasks. A customer could come into a shop, be individually measured, and return to pick up their new shoes in as little as a day. Everyone needed shoes, and the median price for a pair was about one day’s wages for an average journeyman.

The shoemaking trade flourished in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries but began to be affected by industrialization in the later nineteenth century.
Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been largely superseded in volume of shoes produced by industrial mass production of footwear, but not necessarily in quality, attention to detail, or craftsmanship. Today, most shoes are made on a volume basis, rather than a craft basis. A pair of bespoke shoes, made in 2020 according to traditional practices, can be sold for thousands of US dollars.

Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the sole, stitched to a leather upper part.

Trades that engage in shoemaking have included the cordwainer&#x27;s and cobbler&#x27;s trades. The term &quot;cobbler&quot; was originally used pejoratively to indicate that someone did not know their craft; in the 18th century, it became a term for those who repaired shoes but did not know enough to make them.

== History ==
=== Traditional methods ===


For most of history, shoemaking has been a handicraft, limited to time-consuming manufacturing by hand. Traditional shoemakers used more than 15 different techniques for making shoes, including pegged construction, English welted (machine-made versions are referred to as &quot;Goodyear welted&quot; after the inventor of the technique), goyser welted, Norwegian, stitch down, turnout, German sewn, moccasin, bolognese stitched, and blake-stitched.

The most basic foot protection, used since ancient times in the Mediterranean area, was the sandal, which consisted of a protective sole, held to the foot with leather thongs or cords of various materials. Similar footwear worn in the Far East was made from plaited grass or palm fronds. In climates that required a full foot covering, a single piece of untanned hide was laced with a thong, providing full protection for the foot and so made a complete covering.

The production of clogs (wooden shoes) was widespread in medieval Europe. They were made from a single piece of wood roughly cut into shoe form. A variant of this form was a wooden sole to which a leather upper was attached. The sole and heel were made from one piece of maple or ash two-inches thick, and a little longer and broader than the desired size of shoe. The outer side of the sole and heel was fashioned with a long chisel-edged implement, called the clogger&#x27;s knife or stock; while a second implement, called the groover, made a groove around the side of the sole. With the use of a &#x27;hollower&#x27;, the inner sole&#x27;s contours were adapted to the shape of the foot. The leather uppers were then fitted closely to the groove around the sole. Clogs were of great advantage to workers in muddy and damp conditions, keeping the feet dry and comfortable.
By the 1600s, leather shoes came in two main types. &#x27;Turn shoes&#x27; consisted of one thin flexible sole, which was sewed to the upper while outside in and turned over when completed. This type was used for making slippers and similar shoes. The second type united the upper with an insole, which was subsequently attached to an out-sole with a raised heel. This was the main variety, and was used for most footwear, including standard shoes and riding boots.
The traditional shoemaker would measure the feet and cut out upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and stitched together. The sole was next assembled, consisting of a pair of inner soles of soft leather, a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and top-pieces for the heels. The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The &#x27;lasting&#x27; procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts. The finishing operation included paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking, and burnishing the edges of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering, and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which may have pierced through the inner sole.

Other types of ancient and traditionally made shoes included furs wrapped around feet, and sandals wrapped over them (used by Romans fighting in northern Europe), and moccasins—simple shoes without the durability of joined shoes.

The patron saint of shoemakers is Saint Crispin.

The most common materials used to make shoes are leather, textiles (cotton, polyester, wool, and nylon), synthetics, rubber, and foam (open and closed cell foam). Leather is flexible and elastic but very sturdy and strong which makes it the top choice for shoe making.

===Industrial era===

Shoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century, as it expanded as a cottage industry, typically organized around a central manufactory and subcontracted laborers organized into a putting-out system. Large warehouses began to stock footwear in warehouses, made by many small manufacturers from the area.

Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century&#x27;s end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of mass production, the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.

The first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the Napoleonic Wars by the engineer, Marc Brunel. He developed machinery for the mass-production of boots for the soldiers of the British Army. In 1812 he devised a scheme for making nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers by means of metallic pins or nails. With the support of the Duke of York, the shoes were manufactured, and, due to their strength, cheapness, and durability, were introduced for the use of the army. In the same year, the use of screws and staples was patented by Richard Woodman. Brunel&#x27;s system was described by Sir Richard Phillips as a visitor to his factory in Battersea as follows:

:&quot;In another building I was shown his manufactory of shoes, which, like the other, is full of ingenuity, and, in regard to subdivision of labour, brings this fabric on a level with the oft-admired manufactory of pins. Every step in it is effected by the most elegant and precise machinery; while, as each operation is performed by one hand, so each shoe passes through twenty-five hands, who complete from the hide, as supplied by the currier, a hundred pairs of strong and well-finished shoes per day. All the details are performed by the ingenious application of the mechanic powers; and all the parts are characterised by precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As each man performs but one step in the process, which implies no knowledge of what is done by those who go before or follow him, so the persons employed are not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers, who are able to learn their respective duties in a few hours. The contract at which these shoes are delivered to Government is 6s. 6d. per pair, being at least 2s. less than what was paid previously for an unequal and cobbled article.&quot;

However, when the war ended in 1815, manual labour became much cheaper, and the demand for military equipment subsided. As a consequence, Brunel&#x27;s system was no longer profitable and it soon ceased business.
Similar exigencies at the time of the Crimean War stimulated a renewed interest in methods of mechanization and mass-production, which proved longer-lasting. A shoemaker in Leicester, Tomas Crick, patented the design for a riveting machine in 1853. His machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.

The sewing machine was introduced in 1846, and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in the US and areas of England. A shoe stitching machine was invented by the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into partnership with McKay, his device became known as the McKay stitching machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout New England. As bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations, more and more of the manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated. By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.

A process for manufacturing stitchless, that is, glued, shoes—AGO—was developed in 1910.Traditional shoemakers still exist today, especially in poorer parts of the world, and create custom shoes. Current crafters, in developing regions or supply constrained areas may use surplus car or truck tire tread sections as an inexpensive and plentiful material resource with which to make strong soles for shoes or sandals. Generally, the modern machinery used includes die cutting tools to cut the shapes and grommet machines to punch holes for lacing.

Early 21st century has seen a resurgence in the shoemaking profession, particularly in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. This has been driven in large part by broader societal preferences in favour of leather restoration rather than replacement and extends to not only shoes but also handbags and other leather fashion accessories. Meanwhile, organizations within the industry have begun leveraging e-commerce and modern logistical networks to offer consumers greater convenience through the offering of services by mail.

<text>Ringling College of Art and Design (RCAD; stylized as Ringling College of Art + Design) is a private art and design school in Sarasota, Florida. It was founded by Ludd M. Spivey as an art school in 1931 as a remote branch of Southern College before their separation in 1933.

== History ==
The origins of the college go back to when the President of Southern College (now called Florida Southern College), Ludd M. Spivey, wanted to get the support of John Ringling for his institution. Spivey learned that Ringling did not have an interest in helping Southern College, was almost broke, and wanted to start his own art school on the grounds of his museum. The two discussed the idea of creating a new and independent art school before reaching the agreement that they would open a school in Sarasota as a branch of Florida Southern College.

The School of Fine and Applied Art of the John and Mable Ringling Art Museum was founded on March 31, 1931. It opened on October 2 with 75 registered students. The school, although an extension of Florida Southern, initially functioned as a junior college with business and arts classes. The college would end up breaking off from Southern College in 1933 after Ringling faculty discovered and disliked that money made from the school went to pay salaries at the college&#x27;s Lakeland campus. Another theory holds that conservative Methodist trustees from Florida Southern were outraged that Ringling students were drawing naked models, so they sought to end the relationship. In any case, the school ended up successfully petitioning for and officially became independent on May 14, 1933 when they received their charter. Under this new charter, the institution became known as the Ringling School of Art. In 1934, the junior college and music courses were eliminated and the decision was made to concentrate solely on art. After World War II, enrollment grew at the school, growing from 250 in 1949 to 450 by 1959, mostly because of the G.I. Bill.

The institution qualified for full accreditation as a degree-granting institution by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1979. That year the college became known as the Ringling School of Art and Design. In 1984, the school became accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art.

The campus has in the past also included the Longboat Key Center for the Arts, which operated from 1952 to 2017.

Most recently, the Sarasota Art Museum, housed in a newly-renovated 1926 Sarasota High School, opened in 2019 as a division of Ringling College of Art and Design, and comprises a separate &quot;Museum Campus&quot; further south than main campus.

== Academics ==
The college currently offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Arts degrees. It operates on a semester academic term system.

=== Library ===
The Alfred R. Goldstein Library is an informational, educational, and social hub for RCAD&#x27;s students and faculty. Designed specifically for its creative students, the library&#x27;s collection includes children&#x27;s literature, game arts, graphic novels, letterpress, book arts, pop up books, special collections, reference, and online resources. The 46,000-square-foot library houses over 75,000 books and periodicals.

The Ringling College Library Association (RCLA) is a nonprofit organization that was created by a small group of community leaders in 1975 in an attempt to aid Ringing College in constructing its first library. The RCLA operates with an annual overhead of 10% and has “made gifts and commitments to the college in excess of $11 million dollars”. With nearly 2,000 members, the RCLA continues to support the Alfred R. Goldstein Library and the RCAD community by providing scholarships to students, programming special events (including the RCLA Town Hall Lecture Series), and encouraging creativity and community togetherness. 

The library hosts an independent art publishing book fair called Paper Jam. Organized jointly with Letterpress and Book Arts Center and the Brizdle-Schoenberg Special Collections Center and in collaboration with SRQ Zine Fest, the annual event features a wide array of creative books and experimental printed items that highlight local and diverse perspectives.

The library originated as a first floor location on the east side of campus. Its new modern facility, completed in January 2017, is centrally located, physically representing the mission of the library as the heart of its college. The $20 million dollar library, designed by Shepley Bulfinch and Sweet Sparkman Architects, is significantly larger than its predecessor. It features furnishings selected by RCAD students, bright colors, a 24-hour lab, a café, ten group study areas, and 4 terraces overlooking Whitaker Bayou. American Libraries, a publication of the American Library Association, featured the Alfred R. Goldstein Library in its yearly Library Design Showcase later in 2017.

Alfred Goldstein, the library&#x27;s namesake, was a local benefactor. Along with his wife Ann, he contributed to many Sarasota organizations and funded the Ann Goldstein Children&#x27;s Rainforest Garden at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens. The library naming ceremony took place on February 15, 2016.

<text>Union Theological College is the theological college for the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and is situated in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is governed by the Council for Training in Ministry. It has been responsible for training people for ministry in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and also runs courses open to the wider public, including distance learning courses offered through BibleMesh.

The professors of the college constitute the Presbyterian Theological Faculty of Ireland (PTFI) which holds a Royal Charter to award postgraduate degrees.

* Undergraduate degrees are awarded by St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, but teaching is carried out at the college.
* Postgraduate teaching is provided in collaboration with BibleMesh.
* Doctoral studies are supervised in collaboration with Kirby Laing Centre for Public Theology in Cambridge and Davenant Hall.

The majority of ministers and deaconesses for the Presbyterian Church in Ireland are trained at the college, but the church also recognises training at an unspecified number of &quot;recognised colleges&quot; elsewhere.

==History==
=== The Assembly&#x27;s College ===

The college was founded in 1853 as the Assembly&#x27;s College. The Renaissance Revival style building with its grand Doric porch and Baroque attic was designed by Sir Charles Lanyon, the architect of the main building at Queen&#x27;s and built with Scrabo stone at a cost of £5,000. Merle d&#x27;Aubigné of Geneva participated in the opening ceremony on 5 December 1853 alongside Henry Cooke, President of the Faculty (the five other professors in the new college were John Edgar, Robert Wilson, William Killen, James G. Murphy and William Gibson).

There was a large influx of students in the wake of the 1859 Revival and the south wing with its dining hall and student accommodation (&quot;Chambers&quot;) was added in 1869. Princeton seminary had an important influence in the shaping of the ethos of the college during this period: the Rev. Roberts Watts who was appointed Professor of Systematic Theology in 1866 hoped to make &quot;Belfast another Princeton&quot;. The north wing with its wood-panelled chapel was designed by John Lanyon, son of original architect, and completed in 1881. The first degrees under the royal charter were conferred in 1883. However, the death of Watts in 1895 marked the beginning of the end of the Princetonian influence. A partial union took place between the faculties in Belfast and Magee in 1922.

The newly formed Parliament of Northern Ireland met in the Assembly&#x27;s College from 1921 until 1932 while Stormont was being built: the Commons met in the Gamble Library and the Senate in the college chapel. During this period the college conducted classes in a house and provided library resources in a house on University Square.

In 1926 the college became a Recognised College of Queen&#x27;s University but the college then came under criticism for its embrace of theological liberalism. This culminated in a charge of heresy being brought against Professor J. Ernest Davey in 1926-27 and a heresy trial in 1927 because of his teaching in the College. The five charges were summarised in the minutes of the General Assembly as follows:

# The first charge alleges that Professor Davey denies that &#x27;God pardoneth all our sins and accepteth us as righteous in His sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputes to us.&#x27;
# The second charge alleges that Professor Davey taught what is contrary to Holy Scripture concerning the absolute perfection of our Lord&#x27;s character.
# The third charge alleges that Professor Davey taught what is contrary to the Word of God and the Westminster Confession of Faith regarding the inspiration, infallibility, and Divine authority of Holy Scriptures,
# The fourth charge alleges that Professor Davey taught what is contrary to the doctrine that &#x27;the sinfulness of all sins proceedeth only from the creature and not from God.&#x27;
# The fifth charge alleges that Professor Davey held and taught that the doctrine of the Trinity is not taught in the Word of God.

Although cleared by the Church&#x27;s courts, a small number of Presbyterians broke away unhappy with the decision and founded what later became the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.

The college officially reopened in October 1932 and the inaugural lecture was delivered by the Scottish Historian Robert Rait. Between 1941 and 1948 the city police used the college as its own headquarters were bombed in the Belfast Blitz. In 1953, to mark the College&#x27;s centenary year, Prof. Davey was elected Moderator of the General Assembly.

=== The Union Theological College ===

In 1976 theological teaching at Magee College in Derry ceased and the two colleges amalgamated in 1978. The new college, constituted by an act of Parliament, the (c. v), was named the Union Theological College. John M. Barkley was Professor of Church History from 1954 until his retirement in 1981 (Principal 1976-1981) and was succeeded by Finlay Holmes (Principal 1987-1992). Laurence Kirkpatrick was subsequently appointed Professor of Church history in 1996 (Principal 2008-2010).

In 2003 the college celebrated its 150th anniversary by completing a £2.8million pound refurbishment in which individual study bedrooms with ensuite facilities were added. Alister E. McGrath, Professor of Historical Theology at the University of Oxford gave a public lecture entitled &quot;Renewing our vision for the future of Protestant Christianity in Northern Ireland&quot;. Bill Addley retired as Professor of Practical Theology in 2006 and the vacated chair was filled by Drew Gibson. Cecil McCullough, Professor of New Testament, who served as Principal from 1998 to 2002, retired in 2007 and was succeeded in the chair by Gordon Campbell.

On 14 November 2009 a fire caused serious damage to the rear of the college during the refurbishment of the Principal&#x27;s House (a £2.2million project). The extension known as the Training Resource Centre, providing further lecture and seminar rooms, was subsequently opened in September 2011. Stafford Carson was appointed as a new executive principal in 2013. At this time a major stonework restoration and conservation project took place (2013-2017). Patton Taylor retired as Professor of Old Testament in 2016 (Principal 2002-2008 and 2010-2013).

In 2017 the college marked the 500th anniversary of the Reformation by participating in a &quot;Luther 500&quot; conference and by hosting an autumn seminar series entitled &quot;The Unfinished Reformation&quot;. The Welsh Presbyterian theologian Stephen N. Williams, who had held the Chair of Systematic Theology from 1994, was succeeded in 2017 by Michael McClenahan.

In 2018 there was &quot;a refresh of the College&#x27;s Coat of Arms&quot; with the help of a digital heraldic artist, including discussion of the motto to &quot;buy the truth and sell it not&quot;. The shield of this coat of arms was then incorporated into a new logo, featuring two drinking horns above a burning bush. The logo was changed again in 2022, emphasising the year of the college&#x27;s foundation but removing the motto.

==== Breaking of links with Queen&#x27;s University Belfast ====

In 2016, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast undertook a strategic review of the teaching of Theology as all new undergraduate students were then taught at Union Theological College, noting decline in the overall number of students studying theology at the four Theological Colleges, and expressing concerns regarding the diversity of provision compared to Theology and Religions departments in other UK Universities, while also highlighting &quot;excellent student satisfaction rates&quot; and recommending that future plans include &quot;as many aspects of its current undergraduate provision via UTC as possible (community-mindedness, well-cared for student body, a fine library and library culture, and a real sense of the scholastics in ministry).&quot; The review also raised concerns about a lack of diversity in the faculty, noting that &quot;there are now no full-time female members of staff teaching on the undergraduate programmes&quot; and that the full-time teaching staff &quot;are all male and from a Presbyterian background&quot;, with a requirement that they &quot;be committed to working within the Christian ethos and doctrinal framework of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland&quot;. It was also noted that any Professorial appointment must be an ordained minister in the Church, or eligible to become such.

In 2018 the Professor of Church History was controversially suspended pursuant to his participation in a radio interview. A subsequent QAA report that was described by journalists as &quot;highly critical&quot; expressed concerns regarding &quot;weakness in the college&#x27;s maintenance of academic standards&quot;, with &quot;the potential to put academic standards and quality at risk&quot;. However the QAA themselves in a subsequent report in 2021 highlighted the good standard of teaching and achievement in the college despite the pressure of Covid, saying &quot;Students are clear about how assessment is organised and how assessments have been graded. The College describes the 2019-20 cohort&#x27;s achievement as commendable with, of the 41 students who graduated, seven achieving a first-class honours degree (17%), 31 a 2.1 (76%) and three a 2.2 (7%). Those figures compare favourably to the previous five years.&quot; and &quot;External examiners have commented favourably on the teaching and learning support provided to the students during the pandemic and have confirmed the standards and comparability of awards.&quot;

In 2019, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Senate approved a recommendation from the Academic Council regarding the Institute of Theology, with the result that the University would no longer offer Theology degrees, ending its relationship with all four Theological Colleges in the Institute of Theology, including Union Theological College. As tuition fees for 2018/19 were set at £4,160 annually, the projected annual financial shortfall to the college was estimated to be as high as £700,000 on the assumption that over 150 undergraduate students might normally be admitted in a given year. While student numbers enrolled in the colleges of the Institute of Theology had declined significantly in latter years, numbers in the College had seen a smaller decrease, from 264 in 2012 to 233 in 2017. It was subsequently argued that the immediately foreseeable shortfall in the absence of any new income streams would be £250,000 by 2022.

Until 2021, the college had provided teaching and assessment for undergraduate and postgraduate awards offered through the Institute of Theology at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Whereas a wider range of modules was offered to students in the past, previously including a &quot;Graduate Certificate in Youth Ministry programme&quot;, the range of available modules had latterly been restricted &quot;for reasons of financial viability&quot;. In its 2021 report the QAA stated that &quot;the College acknowledged that offering a full range of modules has been difficult to resolve for reasons of financial viability. It was further recognised by the senior team and staff, that greater and better use could be made of PTFI student representatives. However, students are largely satisfied with the variety of both formal and informal feedback mechanisms and described tutors as attentive and helpful.&quot;

==== Dismissal of a professor ====

In 2019 the Professor of Church History and former principal, Laurence Kirkpatrick, was dismissed for gross misconduct. This attracted considerable comment in local media and some comment in international media and was reported to be a factor in the decision by Queen&#x27;s University to review the nature of its relationship with the College.

Professor Kirkpatrick was suspended in 2018 from teaching largely in response to remarks on BBC Radio Ulster&#x27;s Talkback programme in June 2018, and subsequently dismissed by the college in 2019, after 22 years of teaching, as aspects of his radio interview were judged to constitute &quot;gross misconduct&quot;. Specifically, a disciplinary panel held that a statement about same-sex relationships which was not aligned with the doctrinal position of the professor&#x27;s employer was a serious breach of discipline, as was a failure to defend the college&#x27;s reputation when its link to Queen&#x27;s University Belfast was questioned. 

The dismissal prompted public debate about academic freedom in the college and the freedom of ministers in the church to disagree with church policy. Former Presbyterian ministers who had since left to pursue other careers, such as Richard Hill and Roy Simpson accused the church of &#x27;stifling public debate&#x27;, and Ian Hazlett, Emeritus Professor of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Glasgow, where he had supervised Professor Kirkpatrick&#x27;s doctoral studies, said that the &#x27;semi-secret plotting&#x27; that led to &quot;Laurence Kirkpatrick&#x27;s dismissal from his academic post by non-academic churchmen reminded him &#x27;in some respects of the Inquisition.&#x27; Trevor Gribben, Clerk of the General Assembly refuted these claims in an interview on BBC Radio Ulster&#x27;s Sunday Sequence, saying &#x27;people are free to debate in public, it is the nature of that discourse that is important … When we speak about one another and to one another, particularly as Christians, we need to do that in courteous and constructive ways.&#x27;

==== New partnerships in the post-Queen&#x27;s era ====

Following the breaking of links with Queen&#x27;s University, teaching for postgraduate degrees is delivered in partnership with the international institution, BibleMesh, and the degrees are awarded by the Presbyterian Theological Faculty Ireland. 

In 2020 Union Theological College announced it would partner with the Roman Catholic St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham for the awarding of undergraduate degrees. The General Assembly was not able to meet in 2020 to discuss the proposed partnership due to COVID-19 but the members of the Assembly authorised a Standing Commission to conduct business on its behalf. The Presbyterian Church addressed potential concerns about degrees from a Presbyterian college being validated by a Catholic university which is committed to the mission of the Catholic Church in higher education by saying that &quot;It&#x27;s a validation arrangement, with the college still being able to retain its reformed and evangelical identity, which will be respected by St Mary&#x27;s, who will continue with their Catholic identity - but we&#x27;ll both share a Christian ethos and the values that we share with all Christians. That is an important new development for Union College and it&#x27;s a positive sign for the new Northern Ireland where such sectarian divisions are perhaps a thing of the past.&quot;

The Presbyterian Theological Faculty of Ireland had been granted a Royal Charter in 1881 to confer postgraduate academic degrees. A Supplemental Charter was granted in 2021 to modernise the original charter.

In February 2022, it was announced that the college would be working with the Kirby Laing Centre for Public Theology in Cambridge to develop a cohort of supervisors who will supervise PhD studies for the college.

A further collaboration was announced in January 2023 between Union Theological College and the Davenant Institute&#x27;s Davenant Hall. Students in Davenant Hall&#x27;s M.Litt. degree program will now have the opportunity to continue their studies at the Ph.D. level at Union Theological College, while still being supervised by Davenant Hall faculty. It was announced that to facilitate this, five of Davenant Hall&#x27;s leading instructors (Matthew Hoskin, Joseph Minich, Bradford Littlejohn, Michael Lynch, and Alastair Roberts) would join the faculty of Union Theological College to supervise Ph.D. research within their fields of expertise.

Arrangements have also been made with Crosslands Training to further develop the College&#x27;s PTFI doctoral programme.

== Faculty ==

The faculty currently comprises two professors respectively leading extant academic departments, a &quot;non-academic&quot; Professor of Ministry, a senior lecturer in Biblical Studies, a lecturer in Historical Theology, a lecturer in New Testament and a lecturer in Practical Theology. Prof. W. Gordon Campbell became principal of the college in 2021 and was succeeded in this role in 2023 by Prof. Michael McClenahan.

== Library ==
Founded in 1873 by Mrs Caroline Gamble in memory of her late husband, the Rev. Henry Gamble (not to be confused with an Anglican priest of the same name), the college Library is the largest theological library in Northern Ireland. The Gamble Library stocks over 65,000 books, 20,000 pamphlets and taking over 50 journals and periodicals. The domed library served as the Chamber of the House of Commons for the Northern Ireland Parliament from 1921 to 1932. The foundation of the collection predates the college and was formed in 1845. A significant collection was acquired from the estate of the Presbyterian historian Rev. James Seaton Reid (d. 1851). Much of the Magee College pamphlet collection was added in 1977.

<text>Landsteiner is a tiny, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater in the central Mare Imbrium. It was named after Austrian-American pathologist and Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner. It is a circular, cup-shaped feature with no appreciable erosion. Nearby to the south is a low wrinkle ridge named the Dorsum Grabau. Farther south is the prominent crater Timocharis.

This feature was identified as Timocharis F before being renamed by the IAU.
