<text>Rock music in Australia, also known as Oz rock, Australian rock, and Aussie rock, has a rich history, rooted in an appreciation of various rock genres originating in the United States and Britain, and to a lesser extent, in continental Europe and Africa. Australian rock has also contributed to the development of some of these genres, as well as having its own unique Australiana sound with pub rock and its Indigenous music.

From 1955 to 1975, three distinct &quot;waves&quot; of Australian rock occurred. The first wave was from 1955 to 1963 and was influenced by American and British styles with local variants provided by artists such as Johnny O&#x27;Keefe, who had a hit with &quot;Wild One&quot;, which appeared in July 1958. Late in that stage, clean-cut acts, which featured on TV&#x27;s &quot;Bandstand&quot; and toured as the &quot;Bandstand family&quot;, were representing local music on the record charts. The second wave from 1964 to 1969 was directly influenced by The Beatles and their tour of the country in June 1964. Two major acts from that era are The Easybeats and Bee Gees. A weekly magazine, &quot;Go-Set&quot;, which was published from 1966 to 1974, and aimed at teenagers and twenty-year-olds, quickly became the most influential and popular music-related publication of the period. The third wave from 1970 to 1975, with the advent of pub rock, was typified by early exponents, Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs, Blackfeather, and Buffalo. Internationally, AC/DC started as a pub rock group in November 1973 and became one of the most well-known Australian rock bands, with more than 71 million sales in the US alone by 2014. Beginning in that era was &quot;Countdown&quot;, which was a popular music TV program on national broadcaster ABC, and ran from November 1974 until July 1987.

After 1975, Australian rock began to diversify, including local contributors to punk and indie rock styles. By the 1980s baby boomer acts were prominent, which included John Farnham, whose album, &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; (October 1986) peaked at number one on the Australian charts for 25 weeks and was certified 24x platinum indicating shipment of over 1.68 million copies—the highest by any Australian artist. Also in that decade and the next, Indigenous rock groups such as Yothu Yindi and Warumpi Band achieved wider recognition.

==1950s to early 1960s: &quot;First wave&quot; of Australian rock==

In the mid-1950s American rockabilly and rock and roll music was taken up by local rock musicians and it soon caught on with Australian teens, through films, records and from 1956, television. Although issued in 1954, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, a single by United States group Bill Haley and His Comets, did not chart in Australia until 1956. Initially considered a novelty song, the track and the related film of the same name: &quot;was like a beginner&#x27;s guide to rock and roll, and inspired legions of local copyists&quot;. In July 1956 Frankie Davidson&#x27;s cover version of another Haley single, &quot;Rock-A-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;, was released and is the first charting example of Australian recorded rock and roll, albeit as a minor hit. Other early recorded examples by Australians include non-charting singles: &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; by Les Welch (1954), &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Vic Sabrino (August 1955) and &quot;Washboard Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; by the Schneider Sisters (November 1956).

Back in September 1953 US entrepreneur, Lee Gordon, arrived in Sydney and soon established himself nationally by organising a record-breaking tour by US singer Johnnie Ray in August 1954. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described Gordon as &quot;the &#x27;midwife&#x27; of Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, [he] cut an imposing figure in his role as label manager, tour promoter and all-round music entrepreneur&quot;. From 1954 to 1962 Gordon&#x27;s Big Show promotions brought to Australia—in many cases for the first or only time—dozens of US jazz, rock and popular stars, including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Artie Shaw, Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Bill Haley &amp; The Comets, Little Richard, Buddy Holly &amp; The Crickets, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Chuck Berry. He also promoted local talent by using Australian acts as support on those tours.

In 1956 the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was established to regulate the music industry&#x27;s releases. United Kingdom&#x27;s EMI had dominated the Australasian record market since the end of WWII, and they made UK music a powerful force in the late 1950s and 1960s with signings like Cliff Richard and The Shadows, The Beatles, The Hollies and Cilla Black. EMI (Australia) also locally distributed Decca (The Rolling Stones&#x27; label) as well as the US Capitol label (The Beach Boys). During this period, however, a number of local companies in Australia expanded into the growing Australian music market, which grew considerably after the emergence of the first wave of American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. In 1952 merchant bank, Mainguard took over a struggling Sydney engineering firm, retooled and relaunched it as Festival Records. Its main local competition was ARC (Australian Record Company), a former radio production and disc transcription service that established the successful Pacific, Rodeo and Coronet labels and competed with Festival as a manufacturer and distributor in New South Wales.

Although most of the major labels were Sydney-based, Melbourne&#x27;s vibrant dance and concert scene powered a local boom in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and pop music and it became Australia&#x27;s pop capital in the 1960s. During the 1950s luthier Bill May expanded his Maton guitar company, becoming one of the first local manufacturers of the new electric guitars and amplifiers. In 1953 precision engineering company White &amp; Gillespie established a custom recording division, which their company history claims was the first in Australia to press records in the new vinyl microgroove format. The new division soon included the W&amp;G label and studio, which arguably had its biggest success with the earlier Australian releases of Melbourne band, later based in London, The Seekers. In 1960 Melbourne consumer electronics company, Astor Electronics, created its own record division, Astor Records, which established the Astor label and also became a leading distributor. Festival grabbed an early lead in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll by releasing Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in Australia in 1956 after it had been turned down by EMI and Decca. It became the biggest-selling hit released in the country up to that time, and its success set Festival on its way to becoming the dominant Australian local record company for the next fifteen years.

During this period Australia experienced an increase in migration, as hundreds of thousands fled post-war Europe. The majority of migrants were from the UK, many of whom were &quot;Ten Pound Poms&quot; who took advantage of the Australian government&#x27;s A£ 10 assisted-passage fare. Also, for the first time since the 1850s Gold Rush, large numbers of non-Anglo-Celts came from other European countries including Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Poland. These arrivals exerted a powerful influence on all aspects of Australian society and notably in popular music: many Australia pop and rock performers of the 1960s were migrants or their children.
By mid-1957, inspired by Elvis Presley and Little Richard, Sydney-based singer Johnny O&#x27;Keefe achieved local acclaim after his breakthrough appearances on a Gordon-promoted tour by Haley. O&#x27;Keefe carved out a national profile to become a legend of Australian rock music. He hosted one of Australia&#x27;s first TV rock shows, &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock Rock&quot; (1959 to 1961), and worked as an A&amp;R with Gordon&#x27;s label, Leedon. He was the first Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll performer to attempt to break into the US market. In early 1960 O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s 35 state US tour &quot;made little impact&quot; although his single, &quot;It&#x27;s too Late&quot;, charted locally in New Orleans. Iggy Pop covered O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s March 1958 Australian hit, &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, in 1986. Pop re-recorded it in 2008 with Australian band, Jet. For a few years, O&#x27;Keefe and other local rockers including Lonnie Lee &amp; The Leemen, Dig Richards &amp; The R&#x27;Jays, Col Joye &amp; The Joy Boys, Alan Dale &amp; The Houserockers, Ray Hoff &amp; the Off Beats, Digger Revell and the Denvermen and New Zealand&#x27;s Johnny Devlin &amp; The Devils whipped up excitement on a par with their US inspirations. In 1959, Lee Gordon would commission Lee Robinson to produce the first ever feature-length film of a Rock&#x27;n&#x27; Roll concert held at Sydney Stadium, entitled &#x27;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&#x27;. It is likely the only one of its kind in existence, and features a number of the aforementioned Australian artists.

In January 1960 Festival was purchased by rising media magnate, Rupert Murdoch, and in April ARC was taken over by US-owned CBS, which closed the Coronet label and replaced the Australian CBS label. The success of the &quot;first wave&quot; rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll acts was brief: by the early 1960s the first boom had begun to fade. Between O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s last major hit in 1961 and Billy Thorpe&#x27;s first hit in 1964, the local rock music scene had become blander and more conservative. The charts were dominated by clean-cut acts, many were regular guests on TV pop show, &quot;Bandstand&quot; (1958 to 1972), and toured as members of the &quot;Bandstand family&quot;, most were signed to Festival. &quot;Bandstand&quot; explicitly &quot;appealed to anyone from eight to eighty&quot;.

An alternative to mainstream pop acts were instrumental surf groups, for instance The Atlantics and The Denvermen in Sydney, and Melbourne&#x27;s, The Thunderbirds. Many of the players in these dance bands had come from the jazz scene, and were also influenced by R&amp;B and jump music of performers like Louis Jordan. Others were inspired by US surf guitarists Dick Dale and Duane Eddy, or UK&#x27;s The Shadows and US band the Ventures. The influence of The Shadows and their lead guitarist Hank Marvin on Australasian pop and rock music of the 1960s and 1970s is underrated. Australian instrumental bands played at dance venues in capital cities and regional towns. Like Australian jazz groups, these rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll musicians became accomplished players. Dance patrons moved as couples to traditional rhythms, and bands played a wide variety of musical styles. One of the popular dance crazes of the era was &quot;The Stomp&quot;. According to Digger Revell of The Denvermen &quot;it was like what the Red Indians do when they&#x27;re dancing around the teepee. I don&#x27;t know where it came from but everyone was doing it at the time&quot;.

==1964–1969: &quot;Second wave&quot;==

=== Beat boom: pop, rock, and garage ===
During the second wave of Australian rock or &quot;beat boom&quot; from 1964 to 1969, there were hundreds of bands active, both live and in recording studios. The Beatles, and other British Invasion acts, had a massive impact on the local rock music scene. These bands toured to wild receptions from the mid-1960s. When The Beatles&#x27; June 1964 Australian tour arrived in Adelaide, an estimated 300,000 people—about one-third of the city&#x27;s population at that time—turned out to see their motorcade from the airport to the city. The tours and recordings by British beat groups revitalised the pop and rock genres by inspiring scores of new and established groups, which quickly developed a vibrant and distinctive local inflection.

Bee Gees and The Easybeats are the best-known pop rock acts from this era which also gained success outside the country. Both groups consisted of members who had migrated from the UK and, in the case of the latter, from continental Europe. Bee Gees had formed in 1960 by the trio of singing Gibb brothers, who had migrated from UK two years earlier, created &quot;impeccable three-part harmonies&quot; in a pop and R&amp;B style. In 1963 they signed with Leedon Records which issued their early singles from that year and their debut album, &quot;The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs&quot;, in November 1965.

Their most successful Australian-based single, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, was issued in September 1966, which reached No. 4 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; Australian National Top 40. By January of the next year they had returned to UK where they continued a very successful career both there and later, in the US. They also continued to chart well in Australia throughout the decade and beyond. Their first number-one hit on &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40 is &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (December 1967).

The Easybeats had formed in late 1964 at Villawood Migrant Hostel (later called Villawood Detention Centre) in Sydney with all five founders being recent arrivals from Europe: Dick Diamonde (bass guitar) and Harry Vanda (lead guitar) were from Netherlands; Gordon &quot;Snowy&quot; Fleet (drums) and Stevie Wright (lead vocals) were from England; and George Young (rhythm guitar) was from Scotland. They adopted a Beatles-esque look, wearing &quot;neat matching suits&quot;, and performed original beat pop songs, written initially by Wright and Young. They signed with Albert Productions and issued &quot;a string of exceptional hit singles and undertaking hugely successful tours&quot; throughout Australia.

The Easybeats&#x27; later material was primarily written by Vanda &amp; Young, and by July 1966 they had relocated to the UK where they recorded &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; (released in November). Meanwhile, also in that month, their earlier single, &quot;Sorry&quot;, reached number one in &quot;Go-Set&quot;. In January of the next year &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; had also peaked at number one in &quot;Go-Set&quot;. This single also had chart success in the UK (at No. 6), US (at No. 16), Netherlands (at No. 1) and Germany (at No. 10). Vanda &amp; Young took over producing the group&#x27;s releases and the group toured the US in August 1967. They had further hit singles in Australia but disbanded late in 1969 with Vanda &amp; Young remaining in the UK until 1973.

Little Pattie (aka Patricia Amphlett) started as a surf pop singer with her debut single, &quot;He&#x27;s My Blonde Headed, Stompie Wompie, Real Gone Surfer Boy&quot; (November 1963), reaching No. 2 on the Sydney singles chart in January 1964. Which cashed in on &quot;The Stomp&quot; dance craze and led to her being a regular on &quot;Bandstand&quot;. In August 1966, aged 17, she toured Vietnam to entertain troops during the Vietnam War—she was singing on stage when the Battle of Long Tan started nearby. She later recalled &quot;During the third show I was given the sign, which of course is the fingers across the throat, which in show business means you better finish. We were very swiftly evacuated ... but I could see thousands and thousands of orange lights, which of course was the gunfire, and I&#x27;ll never forget it. Never&quot;. In the days after the battle, Amphlett visited injured soldiers in hospital to comfort and sing to them.

Some of leading acts during this period are, Billy Thorpe &amp; the Aztecs, Bobby &amp; Laurie, Ray Brown &amp; The Whispers, the Twilights, the Loved Ones, The Trend, the Masters Apprentices, MPD Ltd, Mike Furber &amp; The Bowery Boys, Ray Columbus &amp; The Invaders, Max Merritt, Dinah Lee, Normie Rowe, The Groop, the Groove, The Wild Colonials, Lynne Randell (who toured US supporting the Monkees and Jimi Hendrix), Johnny Young, John Farnham, Doug Parkinson, Russell Morris and Ronnie Burns. During the 1960s numerous New Zealand performers moved to Australia for wider commercial opportunities. Although their origins are often overlooked (in much the same way that Canadian performers such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are routinely classified as &quot;American&quot;) these trans-Tasman acts—including Max Merritt, Mike Rudd, Dinah Lee, Ray Columbus, Bruno Lawrence, Dragon and Split Enz—have exerted a considerable influence on the local rock music.

While some groups, such as the Bee Gees, were more pop-oriented, by 1965 many other acts employed a harder, blues-based style, such as The Missing Links, Purple Hearts, Wild Cherries, The Trend (Melbourne band) The Trend, The Creatures, and the Throb. The garage rock and protopunk sound of these bands and others exerted a significant influence on later bands including The Saints. Australia experienced a garage rock explosion similar to the US and elsewhere.

=== Culture and music industry ===
A weekly magazine, &quot;Go-Set&quot;, was published from February 1966 to August 1974, and was aimed at teenagers and twenty-year-olds. It quickly became the most influential and popular music-related publication, which chronicled major events, trends, fads and performers in local pop and rock music. Regular columnists included radio DJ Stan Rofe, fashion designer Prue Acton, and music journalist Ian Meldrum (later known as &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum). &quot;Go-Set&quot; published the first national singles charts from October 1966 (prior charts were state-based, or radio station listings). It detailed international musical developments and the exploits of Australian artists overseas including Normie Rowe and Lynne Randell. It reported on Australia&#x27;s annual rock band competition, Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds, which ran from 1966 to 1972. From 1967 &quot;Go-Set&quot; conducted a popularity poll which led to the King of Pop Awards starting with Rowe as King of Pop in 1967. Australian-raised critic and journalist, Lillian Roxon, wrote her &quot;Rock Encyclopedia&quot; in 1969, which is the first such encyclopaedia to detail rock music and its creators.

As in other countries, independent record labels proliferated during this period. The local branch of the UK-owned EMI company had dominated the Australian record market since the 1920s, but in this period it faced increasing challenges from its rivals, including the Australian arm of the US label, CBS Records, and particularly from the Sydney-based Festival Records, a division of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited.

Festival had its own successful house label, and it also signed valuable distribution deals with independent labels of the 1960s, including Leedon Records (which released the earliest recordings by the Bee Gees), Spin Records and the Perth-based Clarion Records. The many hits released on these independent labels comprised a significant part of Festival&#x27;s total turnover. Other important independent labels of this period included the Melbourne-based W&amp;G Records, Astor Records—also a major distributor—and the short-lived Go!! Records label, which was set up in conjunction with a pop music TV series, &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;.

Labels and production companies began to play an increasingly important role in the local rock music industry with their allied recording facilities such as Armstrong Studios in Melbourne. Founded in 1965 it became highly sought-after and recorded many local hits. It was an important training ground for some of Australia&#x27;s best engineers and record producers, Roger Savage and John L Sayers. An important independent production company was Albert Productions, which was established in 1964 by music executive, Ted Albert of J. Albert &amp; Son, who had signed both Billy Thorpe, and The Easybeats. Two members of the latter group, Vanda &amp; Young, started working as producers and songwriters at Alberts in 1967. Alberts also owned the leading Sydney AM pop radio station 2UW, along with several other lesser stations. Another such company was the Macquarie Radio Network. 
Albert Productions issued many major hits (released locally on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label) with both their flagship acts in the mid-1960s, and the associated record label, established in the early 1970s, became one of the most successful Australian labels of that decade. Other significant &#x27;indie&#x27; production houses of the period included Leopold Productions (Max Merritt, The Allusions), set up Festival&#x27;s original house producer Robert Iredale, and June Productions, led by former W&amp;G and Astor staff producer, Ron Tudor, who went on to found Fable Records in 1970.

==1970–1975: &quot;Third wave&quot;==
Australian rock&#x27;s third wave was from 1970 to 1975. During the late 1960s, many local acts dissolved or faded from view, while newer performers and surviving veterans of the 1960s beat boom coalesced into new formations and developed more distinctively Australian rock styles. However, acts that were successful within Australia rarely managed to achieve any lasting success overseas, generally due to the combination of poor management, lack of record company support or lack of radio exposure. The era also saw the popularity of local versions of rock musicals and festivals.

===Early &quot;Third wave&quot;===
Until the late 1970s, many Australian rock performers found it hard to become established and to maintain their profile, because of the difficulty in getting radio airplay. Until 1975, Australian mainstream radio was dominated by a clique of commercial broadcasters who virtually had the field to themselves and their influence over government was such that no new radio licences had been issued in any Australian capital city since the early 1930s. All commercial radio was broadcast on the AM band, in mono, and that sector strenuously resisted calls to grant new licences, introduce community broadcasting or open up the FM band (then only used for TV broadcasts) even though FM rock radio was already well-established in the US. Many of the more progressively-oriented artists found themselves locked out of these radio stations, which concentrated on high-rotation of a small list of three-minute pop singles. This was a result of the widespread adoption of the US-inspired &quot;More Music&quot; format.

A conflict between radio broadcasters and record labels resulted in the 1970 radio ban from May to October. During the ban major UK and Australian releases were refused airplay on commercial radio—but not on Australian Broadcasting Commission stations. A series of cover versions of UK singles by local artists on new labels, including Fable Records, were commercially successful. This is exemplified by Liv Maessen&#x27;s version of &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot;, which reached No. 2 on &quot;Go-Set&quot;″s National Top 40. However the original version by Mary Hopkin was not well known to contemporary listeners. After the ban even though there was a great deal of innovative and exciting music created by Australians; few listeners heard more than a fraction of it. By the 2000s their music underwent a resurgence of interest, both locally and internationally, as the country was one of the last untapped sources of 20th-century rock music.

Popular rock music acts of this period include Spectrum and its successor Ariel, Daddy Cool, Blackfeather, The Flying Circus, Tully, Tamam Shud, Russell Morris, Jeff St John &amp; Copperwine, Chain, Billy Thorpe &amp; the Aztecs, Headband, Company Caine, Kahvas Jute, Country Radio, Max Merritt &amp; the Meteors, the La De Da&#x27;s, Madder Lake, Stevie Wright (ex-The Easybeats), Wendy Saddington, Ayers Rock, The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band and The Dingoes.

Guitarist-songwriter-producer Lobby Loyde (ex Wild Cherries, Purple Hearts) was another key figure, including with his band, Coloured Balls (1972–74), which gained a considerable following, despite media allegations that their music promoted violence by sharpie gangs (an Australian youth subculture). Loyde played an important part in the re-emergence of Billy Thorpe in his new hard-rock incarnation of the Aztecs. Loyde&#x27;s solo and band recordings in this period had a significant impact in Australia and internationally; Henry Rollins and Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain are among those who cited Loyde as an influence.

Rock musicals were an important development at this time. The local production of &quot;Hair&quot; brought future &quot;Queen of Pop&quot; Marcia Hines to Australia in 1970. In 1972 a commercially successful and critically praised Sydney production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; premiered, which included Hines, Jon English, Reg Livermore, two future members of Air Supply, Stevie Wright, John Paul Young and Rory O&#x27;Donoghue. It was directed by Jim Sharman, who had international success as the director of both the original stage production and the film version of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

Alongside the more obscure acts was a raft of successful pop-oriented groups and solo artists, including Sherbet, Hush, Ted Mulry Gang (TMG) and John Paul Young, who became the first Australian performer to have a major hit in multiple international markets with his perennial track, &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; (1978)—a song which was written and produced by Vanda &amp; Young, who were behind many of the big hits of the mid-to-late Seventies. The tail-end of the second wave gave birth to Skyhooks, who bridged the transition from the third wave into the period of new wave music acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s. On the Australian charts Sherbet had &quot;20 consecutive hit singles to its credit&quot;, while Skyhooks had two number-one albums, &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; (October 1974, 226000 copies sold) and &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot; (July 1975, 210000 copies sold). Both acts toured the US but had limited success there, although Sherbet had chart success with their single, &quot;Howzat&quot; (1976), in Europe.

The early 1970s also witnessed the first major rock festivals in Australia, which were closely modelled on the fabled Woodstock festival of 1969. The festival era was exemplified by the annual Sunbury music festival, held outside Melbourne, Victoria each January from 1972 to 1975. Although there were numerous other smaller festivals, most were not successful and failed to have the lasting impact of Sunbury. After the disastrous 1975 Sunbury festival, which sent the promoters broke, large-scale festivals were considered too risky and were only occasionally staged in Australia until the advent of the annual Big Day Out in the 1990s.

Also paralleling a US trend was the beginning of an Australian Christian music culture. One of the first examples of this trend was the surprise success of singing nun Sister Janet Mead whose &#x27;rock&#x27; arrangement of &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; was a major hit in Australia and the US and earned a gold record award in the US. Bands like Family in Brisbane, and Kindekrist in Adelaide, started performing. Rod Boucher formed Good God Studios, which recorded a range of alternative Christian artists. Following on these foundations, later artists such as Newsboys had significant popular success.

Two important changes which had a dramatic effect on the rock scene were the long-overdue introduction of colour television and FM radio in 1975. This period also saw the decline of the booming local dance and discothèque circuit that had flourished in the 1960s and early 1970s. These rock dances were a continuation of the social dance circuit that had thrived in Australia&#x27;s cities and suburbs since the 19th century, and they were hugely popular from the late Fifties to the early Seventies, but they gradually faded in the early Seventies as the &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; generation grew into adulthood and changes to licensing laws saw pubs take on an increasingly important role as venues for live music.

From the 1950s to the early 1970s, the main venues for live music were discothèques (usually located in inner city areas), church, municipal and community halls, Police Boys&#x27; Clubs and beachside surf clubs. Bigger concerts and international tours were usually staged in the few large-size venues, such as the Sydney Stadium (originally built as a boxing arena), the Sydney Trocadero, and Brisbane and Melbourne Festival Halls. Such venues regularly attracted large numbers of young people because they were supervised, all-ages events—Australia&#x27;s restrictive liquor licensing laws of the period meant that these venues and dances were almost always alcohol-free.

According to rock historian Glenn A. Baker, in 1965 there were up to 100 dances being held every weekend in and around Melbourne alone. The most popular groups frequently played almost every night of the week, commonly commuting around town, performing short sets at three or more different dances every night. It was a very lucrative circuit for musicians and even moderately popular acts could easily earn considerably more than the average weekly wage at that time.

The decline of the local dance circuit, combined with the fact that the baby boom teenagers of the Sixties were now ageing into adulthood, led to the rise of a thriving new city and suburban pub music circuit in the mid-1970s, which in turn spawned a new generation of bands who cut their teeth in this often tough but formative training ground.

===1974: &quot;Countdown&quot;===

Teen-oriented pop music still enjoyed strong popularity during the 1970s, although much of it was sourced from overseas, and the proportion of Australian acts in the charts had hit an all-time low by 1973. That trend began to change around 1975, thanks largely to the advent of a new weekly TV pop show, &quot;Countdown&quot;, in late 1974. It gained a huge audience and soon exerted a strong influence on radio programmers, because it was broadcast nationwide on Australia&#x27;s government-owned broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). &quot;Countdown&quot; was one of the most popular music programs in Australian TV history, and it had a marked effect on radio because of its loyal national audience—and the amount of Australian content it featured.

The most important feature of Countdown was that it became a critical new interface between the record industry and radio. By the late 1970s, radio programmers ignored Countdown&#x27;s hit picks at their peril. Host Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum also frequently used the show to castigate local radio for its lack of support for Australian music. Unlike commercial TV or radio, Countdown was not answerable to advertisers or sponsors, and (in theory) it was far less susceptible to influence from record companies. Like no other ABC program before or since, it openly and actively promoted the products of these private companies. Countdown was crucial to the success of acts like John Paul Young, Sherbet, Skyhooks, Dragon and Split Enz, and it dominated Australian popular music well into the 1980s stimulating domestic demand for Australian pop and rock, with quality varying in extremes of good and bad.

===1975: Establishment of Double Jay===
In the long term, one of the most important changes to the Australian music industry in the 1970s (and beyond) turned out to be the founding of the ABC&#x27;s first all-rock radio station, Double Jay (2JJ) in Sydney in January 1975. It is indicative of the conservative nature of the Australian media and its regulators that Double Jay was the first new radio licence issued in an Australian capital city in more than 40 years. It was also Australia&#x27;s first non-commercial 24-hour rock station, and the first to employ women disc jockeys.

Double-Jay&#x27;s wide-ranging programming policies were influenced by British 1960s pirate radio, the early programming of BBC Radio One, and the American album-oriented rock (AOR) format. The new station opened up the airwaves to a vast amount of new local music, introduced listeners to important overseas innovations like reggae, dub, progressive rock, punk and new wave music that had been largely ignored by commercial radio. Double Jay also featured an unprecedented level of Australian content, and presented regular live concert broadcasts, comedy, controversial documentaries and innovative radiophonic features.

Double-Jay quickly made a significant mark on the ratings in its target age group, Its major commercial competitor was Sydney&#x27;s 2SM (then Australia&#x27;s top rating and most profitable pop station). The radio broadcaster had some synergies with the more pop oriented &quot;Countdown&quot; television show, also owned by the ABC. Double Jay/Triple-J has influenced Australia&#x27;s taste in rock music, and it has been a testing ground for many acts that were later played by commercial radio stations after becoming popular with the J&#x27;s audience.

==Late 1970s==
The advent of Double J and &quot;Countdown&quot; fundamentally changed the economy of Australian popular music, and the pub circuit gave rise to a newer generation of tough, uncompromising, adult-oriented rock bands. 

One of the most popular Australian groups to emerge in this period was the classic Australian pub rock band Cold Chisel, which formed in Adelaide in 1973 and enjoyed tremendous success in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although they never managed to break into other countries. 

Other popular acts from this transitional period include AC/DC, Skyhooks, Richard Clapton, Ol&#x27; 55, Jon English, Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons, The Angels, The Sports, Midnight Oil, The Radiators, Australian Crawl, Dragon, Rose Tattoo, Ross Wilson&#x27;s Mondo Rock, acclaimed soul singers Marcia Hines and Renée Geyer and pioneering Australian punk/new wave acts The Saints (Mk I) and Radio Birdman. The band Sebastian Hardie became known as the first Australian symphonic rock band in the mid-1970s, with the release of their debut &quot;Four Moments&quot;.

Three &quot;Australian&quot; acts that appeared towards the end of the Second Wave—AC/DC, Little River Band, and Split Enz—and lasted into the late 1970s and early 1980s achieved the long sought-after international success that finally took Australasian rock onto the world stage.

The progression of the Australian independent scene from the late seventies until the early nineties is chronicled in (Pan Macmillan, 1996) by author and music journalist Clinton Walker.

Australia&#x27;s main contribution to the development of punk rock, (not including sixties garage rock bands), consists of The Saints and Radio Birdman.

===AC/DC===

AC/DC started as a pub rock group in November 1973 and became one of the most well-known Australian rock bands, with more than 71 million sales in the US alone by 2014. They are perhaps the most well-known rock group from Australia, despite the fact that only one of the current band members is actually Australian-born. They have sold millions of albums, toured the world several times over, broken countless attendance records, and influenced hard rock music the world over. 

From their humble beginnings, Scottish brothers Angus and Malcolm Young forged a hard-hitting pub guitar sound, similar to Alex Harvey but tougher. After Bon Scott joined the band, the band shot to the top of the Australian rock scene in 1974–75 with their song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;. The band later achieved international success, especially with the release of their album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. This was to be Scott&#x27;s last album. During the subsequent tour, he was discovered in the backseat of a friend&#x27;s car, having died of alcohol poisoning. 

The band found a new singer in English-born Brian Johnson and released their next album, &quot;Back in Black&quot;, in the early 1980s. The U.S. took notice of the band with the song &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, and the album of the same name became one of the best-selling albums by a band ever, selling over 22 million copies in the U.S. and 42 million copies around the world. 

AC/DC are credited as a seminal influence by scores of leading hard rock and heavy metal music acts, and they are now rated the fifth-biggest selling group in U.S. recording history, with total sales of over 100 million records. 

===Little River Band===

Another highly popular and lucrative band of this period is the soft-rock-harmony group Little River Band (LRB). Resurrected from an earlier band called Mississippi, LRB centred on a trio of seasoned veterans. Lead singer Glenn Shorrock had fronted Australian 1960s pop idols The Twilights and singer-guitarists Beeb Birtles and Graeham Goble had been the core members of Mississippi; prior to that, Birtles had played bass in chart-topping Australian 1960s pop group Zoot whose former lead guitarist Rick Springfield also became a solo star in the US. 

Under the guidance of manager Glenn Wheatley (former bassist in The Masters Apprentices, one of the top Australian bands of the Sixties) LRB became the first Australian band to achieve major ongoing chart and sales success in the United States. They achieved huge success in the late 1970s and early 1980s and their single &quot;Reminiscing&quot; now ranks as one of the most frequently-played singles in American radio history.

===1970s and 1980s: Indie, punk, post-punk, and early Australian electronica===

Other developments starting from the mid-1970s were the appearance of early electronica, as opposed to electronic music, as Percy Grainger had invented some obscure electronic instruments earlier, and Rolf Harris was famously associated with the Stylophone. The most notable of early electronica were Cybotron, Sydney&#x27;s Severed Heads and Melbourne&#x27;s Laughing Hands and Essendon Airport who began to experiment with tape loops and synthesisers, but did not rise to prominence until the 1980s. Electronica had existed in the Australian classical music scene with David Ahern in the late 1960s. By the late 1990s Severed Heads were signed to the influential label Nettwerk records. Single Gun Theory had been with Nettwerk since 1987. The pop band Mi-Sex scored a major hit with the single &quot;Computer Games&quot; in 1980, which was one of the first Australian pop recordings to employ sequenced synthesiser backings. In 1980 producer Mark Moffatt pioneered dance technology by becoming the first in the world to use a Roland 808 rhythm composer and MC 4 digital sequencer on record with his studio project The Monitors. (exactly the same type of equipment had been in use around the world however, simply manufactured by other brands. The 808 of the time bore little resemblance to its later sample playback incarnations, machines whose capabilities were more like that of the Fairlight CMI series 1 and Synclavier)

Following the punk movement several influential bands of this post-punk era were The Birthday Party, led by Nick Cave, Foetus, The Celibate Rifles, The Go-Betweens, SPK, Dead Can Dance, These Immortal Souls, Crime &amp; the City Solution, No, Louis Tillett, Laughing Clowns, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists, Beasts of Bourbon.

==1980s==
While many Australasian bands from the 1980s remained cult acts outside of Australia, some, including Little River Band, Men at Work, AC/DC, INXS, Midnight Oil, and later Crowded House and Electric Pandas found wide success throughout the decade. Groups with international hit singles included Real Life with &quot;Catch Me I&#x27;m Falling&quot;, &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;, Divinyls with &quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot;, Big Pig with &quot;Breakaway&quot; and Rick Springfield with &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot;. Moving Pictures had a hit album with Days of Innocence. Jimmy Barnes and Michael Hutchence performed &quot;Good Times&quot; a song by the Australian songwriting duo Vanda &amp; Young and it was included on &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; soundtrack. Expatriate Mike Chapman continued his career as a prominent record producer and co-wrote &quot;Mickey&quot; which became a major hit when Toni Basil performed it.

===Baby boomer acts===
The 1980s was a boom period for acts whose members were usually born between 1946 and 1964 (baby boomers); this includes occasionally critically praised, popular acts such as The Party Boys, James Reyne, Models, Sunnyboys, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Machinations, Johnny Diesel, Matt Finish, Hoodoo Gurus, Chantoozies, The Dugites, The Numbers, The Swingers, Spy Vs Spy, Eurogliders, Mental As Anything, Boom Crash Opera, I&#x27;m Talking, Do Ré Mi, Rockmelons, Stephen Cummings, The Reels, The Stems, Paul Kelly, Nick Barker, Jenny Morris, The Triffids, The Choirboys, Icehouse, Redgum, Goanna, 1927, Max Q, Noiseworks, GANGgajang, The Black Sorrows and The Zorros.

The mainstream taste was to tap into the &quot;classic&quot; Fifties rock look, with a contemporary touch, while alternative rockers were often identifiable for sixties and seventies retro. At this time Goth fashion was very unusual and heavily applied black mascara was the sign of a deeply troubled person.

Many of these acts often topped the Australian charts but never gained international success. One notable exception was Joe Dolce who moved to Australia in 1979 from the US. His Australian Number One Shaddap You Face was Number One in the UK and fifteen other countries, selling over six million copies internationally and achieving the before unheard of sales of nine times platinum in Australia. There was no music industry award at that time to acknowledge sales of this magnitude so the Victorian Premier Sir Rupert Hamer presented Dolce with a specially made perspex-framed album cover and the Advance Australia Award. This Mainstream Australian rock of the eighties was generally uncontroversial with the exception of Kylie Minogue for her limited vocal range, Christina Amphlett and Ecco Homo, who were deemed by some to be too sexually provocative and Yothu Yindi&#x27;s &quot;Treaty&quot;, which was objected to by some because a white person Paul Kelly co-wrote it. Nick Cave was not famous in Australia until Triple J Radio became a nationwide, prominent broadcaster. Audiences who went to The Angels&#x27; gig were famous for their good humoured response &quot;No way, get fucked, fuck off!&quot; to the lead singer&#x27;s lyric &quot;Am I ever going to see your face again?&quot;.

===Mainstream acts===
Mainstream acts such as singer John Farnham, Daryl Braithwaite and Jimmy Barnes were very successful for many years within Australia, but remain largely unknown outside the country.
Farnham&#x27;s commercial comeback was one of the biggest success stories in Australian music in that decade, the former &quot;King of Pop&quot; spent years out of favour with the public and the industry, often reduced to working in suburban clubs, but he returned in 1986 with the album &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;, which became the biggest-selling album of that year and remains one of the biggest selling Australian records. His manager was Glenn Wheatley, former manager of Little River Band.

Renowned artists such as singer-songwriter Paul Kelly and his band The Coloured Girls (renamed The Messengers for America), ambient-rock-crossover act Not Drowning, Waving and Aboriginal-band Yothu Yindi drew inspiration from distinctly Australian concerns, particularly from the land, and they were critically well received within Australia, and also found international listeners.

One noteworthy group in this decade was the pioneering Aboriginal group Warumpi Band from the Northern Territory, whose landmark single &quot;Jailanguru Pakarnu (Out from Jail)&quot; was the first rock single ever recorded in an Aboriginal language. Triple J was the cutting edge radio station of the time and was instrumental in bringing this band to public attention, as were Midnight Oil, who took the group on national tours with them. Their classic 1987 single &quot;My Island Home&quot; was successfully covered by Christine Anu in the 1990s. Another memorable song of the Aboriginal rock scene is &quot;Black Boy&quot; by Coloured Stone.

===Darkwave===
Critically acclaimed acts like The Church, Cosmic Psychos, the darkwave-world music group Dead Can Dance, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Scribble, The Moodists, The Deadly Hume, the Wreckery, the second incarnation of The Saints, Laughing Clowns, The Go-Betweens and a new band formed by Nick Cave and Mick Harvey, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, developed consistent followings in Europe and other regions. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and the side project Honeymoon in Red were heavy on the pop cultural references to cult favourites like Johnny Cash and Saul Bass and lurid pulp fiction. From the late seventies to the late eighties there was also a lively Australian post-punk scene which was made up of bands that showed obvious influences of bands such as Tangerine Dream, Wire, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Suicide. J. G. Thirlwell, whose influential Foetus, began life in Melbourne before moving to London and the US. Of the early Australian electronica scene just a few truly memorable recordings emerged, for example &quot;Lamborghini&quot; by Severed Heads, &quot;Pony Club&quot; by The Limp &quot;The Pilot Reads Crosswords&quot; by Scattered Order and the electronica of Hugo Klang. The Makers of the Dead Travel Fast and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds were precursors of postrock. SPK was a sinister industrial band in the early 1980s and they surprised many of their fans by reinventing themselves as a fashion friendly synthpop group in the mid-1980s. SPK&#x27;s sound was unlike the chilly asexual minimalism of many little known experimental bands of the time. Australian Crawl, a chart topping rock group, dabbled in minimalist composition with &quot;Reckless&quot;, using a very simple bassline and voice, without alienating their established audience.

The use of violin was unusual in Australian rock bands, however, three who did include it were Box the Jesuit, Crime &amp; the City Solution and Sidewinder, with classically trained Richard Lee, later with Dragon, on that instrument.

===Garage rock revivalists===
Detroit rock influenced bands such as the Celibate Rifles, The Scientists, Lime Spiders and The Hitmen would serve as precursors to the garage rock revival of the 1980s and the grunge scene to follow. From the bass heavy &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Out&quot; by X in 1979 and throughout the eighties the Australian indie rock scene produced hook driven melodic songs with heavy guitar and bass backing. Examples are Johnny Teen and The Broken Hearts &quot;I Like It Both Ways&quot;, &quot;I Lied&quot; by The Pony, &quot;Too Much Acid&quot; by The Pineapples from the Dawn of Time, &quot;Chewin&quot;&#x27; by Space Juniors, These Immortal Souls&#x27; &quot;Blood and Sand, She Said&quot; and The Scientists&#x27; &quot;Swampland&quot;. Some bands had a foot in both the mainstream and alternative scenes, for example, The Johnnys, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Hoodoo Gurus, TISM, Painters and Dockers. In 1989 the group No released &quot;Once We Were Scum, Now We Are God&quot;, an Ep that was in parts as hard rock as The Cult, despite No being generally perceived as an &quot;underground&quot; band.

Noise rock acts included Lubricated Goat and &quot;People With Chairs Up Their Noses&quot;. Some of the louche pub rock names of the time were &quot;People With Chairs Up Their Noses&quot;, &quot;Free Beer&quot;, &quot;Shower Scene From Psycho&quot;, &quot;Thug&quot;, &quot;No More Bandicoots&quot; and &quot;Nyuk Nyuk Nyuck&quot;.

The Mark of Cain, one of the better and more consistently hard rock bands of the decade, formed in Adelaide between 1984 and 1985.

The decade also saw perhaps the most concerted examination of the routine and everyday aspects of suburban and inner-city life since perhaps The Executives 1960s classic &quot;Summer Hill Road.&quot; This approach was explored not only by Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls (in songs like &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot; and &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot;) but also by The Little Heroes (e.g. &quot;Melbourne is Not New York&quot;), John Kennedy&#x27;s Love Gone Wrong e.g. &quot;King Street&quot; and The Mexican Spitfires e.g. &quot;Sydney Town&quot; and &quot;Town Hall Steps.&quot;

Hong Kong&#x27;s Leslie Cheung covered Big Pig&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot; in 1989, in this decade, one of the rare instances of a popular overseas artist covering a song by a popular Australian band (other than AC/DC).

Iconic music festivals of the decade included the Narara Music Festival, Australian Made and &quot;Turn Back the Tide&quot; at Bondi.

==1990s: Ravers and alternative rockers==

In 1990, Boxcar released their first album, &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Central Station Records in Sydney was one of the leading retailers of dance music. The Sydney street press became half and half dance music and rock.

Highlights in rock from people of ATSI background were Archie Roach&#x27;s &quot;Took the Children Away&quot;, Christine Anu&#x27;s &quot;Party&quot; and her version of &quot;My Island Home&quot; and Yothu Yindi&#x27;s &quot;World Turning&quot;.

Fans of early punk band The Saints were excited when Ed Kuepper reunited with members of The Saints and played and recorded as The Aints. Kuepper was at the time receiving praise from the critics for his album &quot;Today Wonder&quot;, that featured simply Kuepper singing and on guitar and Mark Dawson on drums.

In 1991, the band Necrotomy played live on the Peter Couchman talk show special &quot;Couchman on Heavy Metal&quot; during a period of media controversy about heavy metal music.
( Metal as a form of music around the world underwent a massive stylistic evolution after this, with the emergence of many new styles such as black, doom, melodeath etc. in which Australian bands such as Alchemy, Armoured Angel, Abominator, Lord chaos, to name a very few, played and are still playing, a part in.)

Another acoustic act of the late nineties was Machine Translations.

The nineties was famous for not only grunge but also eclecticism with Machine Gun Fellatio and Def FX being popular cross-genre acts.

Gerling, an alternative rock and electronica band, formed in 1993, as was the pop–punk band Noise Addict featuring Ben Lee, who went on to be a prominent singer and songwriter into the following decade.

Peril was an attempt to make the self-styled avant garde music of the Tzadik Records label.

Musicians and music fans of the nineties tended to be less nostalgic for pre-punk rock compared to those of previous decade. The Cruel Sea and Divinyls were exceptions, showing the influence of the music of the sixties. Dave Graney and TISM continued to be popular with their irreverent commentary on contemporary culture.

Baby Animals released their eponymous debut album in 1991, which was briefly successful.

The Screaming Jets was a popular hard rock act from Newcastle. Having a down to earth image, they and Divinyls were examples of bands that survived the backlash against so called &quot;Hair Rock&quot; of the Eighties. In 1993, the Melbourne rock band Horsehead also gained popularity after garnering interest internationally from Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records and had a hit single &#x27;Liar&#x27; reaching the weekly top 40 ARIA charts and was performed televised on MTV&#x27;s &#x27;Take 40 Australia&#x27;. The band stylistically shared affinities with the huge American grunge scene at the time, drawing from the likes of Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. The band also had a second hit single and video &#x27;Oil and Water&#x27; which won the Australian Kerrang! award for best rock video. Their debut album was mixed by the legendary Mike Fraser. In 1994, hard rock band The Poor charted at #30 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks with &quot;More Wine Waiter Please&quot;. The Candy Harlots&#x27; 1990 Foreplay EP reached 17 in the ARIA national Top 100 chart.

Paul Capsis was one of the few rock acts to work with a theatre director, Barrie Kosky.

Killing Heidi had a hit song with &#x27;Mascara&#x27; in 1999.

Raja Ram was one half of Shpongle and their debut album in 1999 was &quot;Are You Shpongled?&quot;.

Roots music continued to have a strong appeal, with acts such as Blues band &quot;Bondi Cigars&quot; and Zydeco band &quot;Psycho Zydeco&quot;.

The comedy quiz show &quot;Good News Week&quot; was regularly signed off with Paul McDermott singing his rendition of Hunters &amp; Collectors&#x27; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;.

===Alternative rock===
Throughout the developed world, alternative rock of various kinds became more popular during the 1990s, especially grunge.

As in other countries, independent music festivals also saw a resurgence in popularity, notably the Big Day Out (which began in Sydney in 1992) attracted and helped build the careers of many Australian acts as well as showcasing international artists to a local audience, and the Woodford Folk Festival, attracting large crowds in South Eastern Queensland.

Notable Australian independent acts of the time included the Falling Joys from Canberra; Christine Anu from Cairns, Queensland; Diana Anaid from Nimbin; Magic Dirt from Geelong, Tumbleweed from Wollongong; The Superjesus from Adelaide; Regurgitator, Powderfinger, Screamfeeder, The Sallyanne Hate Squad and Custard from Brisbane; Something for Kate, The Living End, Dirty Three, The Paradise Motel, Rebecca&#x27;s Empire, Bodyjar and The Meanies from Melbourne; Jebediah, Ammonia and The Blackeyed Susans from Perth, RatCat, The Clouds, You Am I, Vicious Hairy Mary, Caligula, The Whitlams, Bughouse, The Crystal Set, The Cruel Sea, Crow, Nitocris, Front End Loader, Skulker, Frenzal Rhomb, and Pollyanna from Sydney; Spiderbait from Finley, New South Wales and Silverchair, who began as a teenage combo in Newcastle, were discovered by Triple-J and have since become one of the most successful Australian bands of all time. The changes brought about in this period and the aforementioned bands are discussed in the book &quot;The Sell-In&quot; by music journalist Craig Mathieson.

Frank Bennett covered many of the fashionable alternative rock bands in big band mode. His version of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot; was his most well known recording. His music was less danceable than overseas Retro swing acts Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Brian Setzer Orchestra. Frank Bennett was deeply ironic and only had moderate success with audiences who were attracted to the romanticised Harry Connick, Jr. Music in the style of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett was unfashionable in the Alternative rock scene, stigmatised by the derisive term Lounge Lizard. Singers Dave Graney, Tex Perkins and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (particularly for their album &quot;The Good Son&quot;), also drew on the styles. By the end of the decade there was renewed interest in Lounge music from elements of the club scene, the interest being in both the composition and the campness.

==2000s–2010s==

Several Australian rock bands saw international success in Europe and the US. Notable examples include The Vines, who rose to prominence in the UK before becoming known in Australia, and Jet. Jet, influenced by seminal 1960s acts such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, had their single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; used in an Apple iPod commercial, and consequently have sold 3 million copies in the US alone. Another band which had great success is Wolfmother, a hard rock band, very influenced by 1960s/1970s psychedelic rock and heavy metal bands, like Black Sabbath. In 2007, Wolfmother were awarded a Grammy for best hard rock performance for their extremely successful single &quot;Woman&quot;.

Apart from those bands which achieved international success, one of the well known Australian rock bands of the first decade of the 21st century was Grinspoon. They first achieved success in the music industry in 1995 after being Unearthed by Triple J, and have been a mainstay of festivals such as the Big Day Out ever since.

A wave of female fronted, PJ Harvey-esque bands emerged in Australia during the early 2000s, most notably Little Birdy and Love Outside Andromeda. And with the phenomenal success of Missy Higgins, artists such as Sarah Blasko and others have found themselves a strong following.

There has also been an abundance of modern rock bands who have been influenced by the alternative and progressive scenes. Bands like The Butterfly Effect, Karnivool, Mammal and Cog have all seen success, with Karnivool probably gaining the most international attention.

===Roots music and indie===
Domestically, roots music, seemingly a catch-all term for somewhat more laid-back acoustic music covering blues, country and folk influences, came to some prominence, including Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, The John Butler Trio, and the plaintive harmonies of The Waifs. A number of &quot;blues and roots&quot; festivals have sprung up and are attracting large audiences.

As well as these uniquely &quot;Aussie Bands&quot;, the mainstreaming of alternative music led to a shift of focus in indie rock in the 2000s. Post-rock indie band Art of Fighting, recorded their debut full-length album, Wires, in 2001. The album was successful and went on to win an ARIA award for Best Alternative Release. 2005 in particular sparked many brand new Australian &quot;indie rock&quot; bands such as End of Fashion who won ARIA awards for their debut self-titled album and hit song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (as well as performing at the Homebake festival and appearing on talk show Rove Live several times). There is also Kisschasy who appeared in concert on 2 October 2005 with teen favourite Simple Plan. Another band to appear on the scene at this time were John Smith Quintet wielding their new brand of funk onto the Australian charts and music scene.

Melbourne indie rock artist Gotye achieved considerable domestic and international success in 2011–12.

===Hardcore punk===

Australian hardcore punk is an active rock music subgenre with a dedicated following. Many bands never tour outside their home state but enjoy a relatively large local fanbase. Recorded material of their work may be hard to acquire as live shows are the mainstay of the scene.

The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) ethic is strong with local distributors and small record labels active in most capital cities. Unlike the United States relatively few bands are straight edge or influenced by particular political views or religious convictions.

The strong sense of DIY ethics supported by independent street press and community radio stations mostly in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth forms a breeding ground for creative artists who wish to explore the audio spectrum, as seen in Sticky Carpet rockumentary of Melbourne music scene.

In recent years, Australian hardcore bands have been growing in fanbase and success, the most notable being Byron Bay&#x27;s Parkway Drive signing to American punk/hardcore record label Epitaph Records.
The first popular Australian rock song to resemble contemporary dance music was the funky The Real Thing (1969) by Russell Morris. The high beats per minute blip of mainstream Electronic music in Australia appeared in the early 1980s with Severed Heads&#x27; &quot;Lamborghini&quot;. Severed Heads formed in 1979 and were the first electronic group to play the Big Day Out. The band achieved long-term success, winning an ARIA Award in 2005 for &quot;Best Original Soundtrack&quot; for &quot;The Illustrated Family Doctor&quot;, where lead singer Tom Ellard said the band would never fit into mainstream music.

===Electronic rock===
Traditional rock bands such as Regurgitator have developed an original sound by combining heavy guitars and electronic influences, and rock-electro groups, most notably Rogue Traders, have become popular with mainstream audiences. However, &quot;Cyclic Defrost&quot;, the only specialist electronic music magazine in Australia, was started in Sydney (in 1998) and is still based there. Radio still lags somewhat behind the success of the genre—producer and artist manager Andrew Penhallow told Australian Music Online that &quot;the local music media have often overlooked the fact that this genre has been flying the flag for Australian music overseas&quot;.

In the late 2000s and early 2010s indie-electronic, indietronica and synthpop music rose in popularity, with Cut Copy, and Midnight Juggernauts being notable Australian exports and touring internationally.

===Neo-psychedelic===
Since the mid to late 2000s, the popularity of psychedelic rock music in Australia has been steadily climbing due in part to the worldwide success of Perth band, Tame Impala. The neo-psychedelic scene in Australia is inspired by the experimental psychedelic pop of Pink Floyd the jangly guitar-driven sound of The Byrds, the distorted free form jams, and the sonic experiments of 60s psychedelic bands. To bring the style into the 21st Century, Australian Psychedelic music carefully blends these elements along with Electronic Music, Shoegaze, Hip Hop and a multitude other genres that have come to prominence since the 60s. Rather than being propelled by song lyrics, the edginess of the scene comes from the music which relies heavily on the use of effects including tape delays, phasers, sitars, fuzz boxes, and pitch modulators.

Generally, the lyrical content differs from early psychedelic music which focused mostly on absurdity and drug use. Although there&#x27;s still references to those subjects, the lyrics dial in on the issues introspection, paradox, identity, and isolation. The vocal melodies tend to weave together with the music to create a wall of sound as opposed to prominent, melodic lines. The main point in modern psychedelic music is to make listeners feel as if they have transcended into a dream-like state, solely through attentive listening to the music.

Perth is where a majority of bands in the psychedelic boom are coming from. Bands from Perth such as, Tame Impala, Pond, Mink Mussel Creek, Gum, and Allbrook/Avery share members, making the scene in Perth almost as if it were one big band. Spinning Top Music manages these bands as well as running press and social media. The dynamic of the Perth bands tends to be more cerebral and pop oriented than the raucous, tripped out rock by the likes of Wolfmother from Sydney or King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard from Melbourne

It&#x27;s mainly two record labels, Modular Recordings and Flightless who have been signing and promoting most of these bands. Promotion of these bands is focused mostly on regions outside of Australia with some of the biggest audiences being the US, the UK, and Mexico. Australian independent radio station, Triple J has also helped propel a multitude of these bands to garner a worldwide audience, with YouTube videos, articles, and airtime. Australia itself has a large number of music festivals that cater to the psychedelic, as well as other alternative music, scene. These include Big Day Out, Sydney Psych Festival, Come Together Music Festival, Pyramid Rock Festival, among others.

<doc id="948699" wikidata="Q904800" url="?curid=948699" title="Citronella oil">
<text>Citronella oil is an essential oil obtained from the leaves and stems of different species of &quot;Cymbopogon&quot; (lemongrass). The oil is used extensively as a source of perfumery chemicals such as citronellal, citronellol, and geraniol. These chemicals find extensive use in soap, candles and incense, perfumery, cosmetic, and flavouring industries throughout the world.
Citronella oil is also a plant-based insect repellent and has been registered for this use in the United States since 1948. The United States Environmental Protection Agency considers oil of citronella as a biopesticide with a non-toxic mode of action.

Citronella oil has strong antifungal properties.

==Types==
Citronella oil is classified in trade into two chemotypes:

=== Ceylon type ===
* CAS: 89998-15-2
* CAS: 8000-29-1
* EINECS: 289-753-6
* FEMA: 2308
* CoE: 39
* Obtained from: &quot;Cymbopogon nardus&quot; Rendle
* Main components: citronellal (5–15%), geraniol (18–20%) and geranyl acetate (2%), citronellol (6–8%), limonene (9–11%), and methyl isoeugenol (7–11%).

=== Java type ===
* CAS: 91771-61-8
* CAS: 8000-29-1
* EINECS: 294-954-7
* FEMA: 2308
* CoE: 2046
* Obtained from: &quot;Cymbopogon winterianus&quot; Jowitt
* Main components: citronellal (32–45%), geraniol (21–24%) and geranyl acetate (3–8%), citronellol (11–15%), limonene (1–4%).

The higher proportions of citronellal and geraniol in the Java type oil make it a better source for perfumery derivatives. The standard quality of Java type from Indonesia is regulated by Indonesian authority under SNI 06–3953–1995, which requires citronellal minimum 35% and total geraniol minimum 85%.

Both types probably originated from Mana Grass of Sri Lanka, which according to Finnemore (1962) occurs today in two wild forms – &quot;Cymbopogon nardus&quot; var. &quot;linnae (typicus)&quot; and &quot;C. nardus&quot; var. &quot;confertiflorus&quot;. Neither wild form is known to be used for distillation to any appreciable extent.

Citronella oil from &quot;Cymbopogon&quot; species should not be confused with other similar lemony oils from &quot;Corymbia citriodora&quot; and &quot;Pelargonium citrosum&quot;.

==Insect repellent==
Citronella oil is used especially as a mosquito repellent, particularly for &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; (dengue fever mosquito). Research also indicates that citronella oil is an effective repellent for body lice, head lice, and stable flies. A study conducted by DARPA in 1963 determined that hydroxycitronellal was an effective repellent against both aquatic and terrestrial leeches. 

Citronella candles (which burn wax mixed with citronella oil) are not effective at repelling mosquitos such as Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito responsible for spreading dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, Mayaro and yellow fever viruses, and other disease agents.

Although direct application of citronella oil to the skin is non-toxic, its use was not recommended as a topical insect repellent in Canada in 2006. Health Canada banned use of citronella oil as an insect repellent in 2012, but lifted the ban in February 2015.

==World production==
At present, the world annual production of citronella oil is approximately 4,000 tonnes. The main producers are China and Indonesia - producing 40 percent of the world&#x27;s supply. The oil is also produced in Taiwan, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Sri Lanka, India, Argentina, Ecuador, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mexico, and South Africa.

The market for natural citronella oil has been eroded by chemicals synthesised from turpentine derived from conifers. However, natural citronella oil and its derivatives are preferred by the perfume industry.

<text>Royal Air Force Mona, or more simply RAF Mona, is a Royal Air Force station near Bodffordd on the island of Anglesey, Wales. It is primarily used as a relief landing ground for RAF Valley.

RAF Mona is also the home of Mona Flying Club who operate some evenings and most weekends.

==History==
===First World War===

This location was first used for aviation during the First World War when the Royal Naval Air Service opened an airship base here named Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Anglesey (also known as RNAS Bodffordd, RNAS Gwalchmai and RNAS Llangefni).

RNAS Anglesey was commissioned on 26 September 1915, when it was operated by 14 Group RNAS, operating SS18, an SS class airship, which was later joined by airships SS22, SS24 and SS25. The station had in a large airship hangar, long, workshops, hydrogen gas production sheds and accommodation huts. The airships, which could drop bombs, escorted ships and patrolled for enemy submarines in the central section of the Irish Sea between Bardsey Island, Dublin, the Isle of Man and Morecambe Bay. This area includes the approaches to the Port of Liverpool, then one of the busiest ports in the world.
In June 1917 three SSP class airships, SSP1, SSP5 and SSP6, replaced two of the original SS class airships, the other two old airships continued in use. The airships were later replaced by eight SSZ class airships, which had greater speed, endurance and bomb load.

The airships communicated by radio with a relay station at Llaneilian on the north coast of Anglesey, whose operators contacted the airship station by telephone.

In November 1917 an unsuccessful attempt was made to base Airco DH.4 light bomber biplanes at RNAS Anglesey. From August to November 1918, eight Airco DH.6 biplanes of No. 255 Squadron RAF were based at RNAS Anglesey, but the poorly-drained land caused difficulty, and the aircraft were transferred to the newly opened Bangor Aerodrome on the mainland.

In July 1918 a mooring-out site was established in the grounds of Malahide Castle, north of Dublin. There were plans to base airships at Malahide from 1919, but the plans were abandoned at the end of the war.

Experimental work conducted at RNAS Anglesey during the First World War included the use of hydrophones suspended under airships to detect submarines, the use of phosphorus to create smoke screens at sea, and the use of hydrogen from the airship envelope to fuel the engine.

At the end of the First World War, Major Thomas Elmhirst, the commanding officer of the station, celebrated the armistice by successfully piloting an SSZ airship under the Menai Suspension Bridge. The act did not harm Elmhirst&#x27;s career, and he later became Air Marshal Sir Thomas Walker Elmhirst, a senior commander of the RAF.

In 1920 the site was bought by Anglesey County Council. The aircraft shed was demolished and some of the buildings were used as an isolation hospital.

===Second World War===
In 1941 the site was requisitioned for use as an airfield, and the hospital was transferred to Llangefni. In 1942 three tee hangars and seventeen blister hangars were constructed, and concrete runways were laid in 1943. At this time the base was controlled by RAF Flying Training Command. The RAF base was initially named RAF Heneglwys (a nearby hamlet) but was soon renamed RAF Mona (Latin for Anglesey).

The base was intended to be used by No. 6 Air Gunnery School (AGS), but this unit was not established and RAF Mona was instead used by 3 AGS, which transferred from RAF Castle Kennedy in south-west Scotland in December 1942. 3 AGS was initially equipped with 48 Blackburn Botha torpedo bombers, 6 Fairey Battle light bombers and 8 Miles Martinet target tug aircraft. These were subsequently replaced by Avro Anson multi-role aircraft. in October 1943, 3 AGS returned to RAF Castle Kennedy.

In spring 1943 RAF Mona was used by No. 5 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit to train Turkish officers, using Miles Master aircraft. From November 1943 until June 1945, No. 8 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit were based at RAF Mona, equipped with Avro Ansons. At the end of the Second World War, 1,378 officers and men of the RAF and 408 officers and women of the WAAF were based at RAF Mona. The airfield was placed on care and maintenance at the end of the war.

===After 1945===
RAF Mona reopened in 1951 as a relief landing ground for RAF Valley, then used by No. 202 Advanced Flying School operating de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. RAF Mona still has this role.

Today, Mona is used for circuit practice by BAE Systems Hawk T.2&#x27;s from RAF Valley along with a civilian flying club and 2474 (Cefni) Squadron Air Training Corps.

===RAF units===
The following units were based at RAF Mona:
* No. 3 Air Gunners School RAF (December 1942 - November 1943)
* Satellite of No. 4 Flying Training School RAF (August 1960 - )
* Detachment of No. 5 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF (February - March 1943)
* Relief Landing Ground for No. 7 Flying Training School RAF (June 1954 - August 1960)
* No. 8 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit RAF (November 1943 - June 1945)
* No. 63 Gliding School RAF (June - December 1946)
* Relief Landing Ground for No. 202 Advanced Flying School RAF (July 1951 - June 1954)
* No. 255 Squadron RAF
* No. 521 (Special Duty) Flight (June - August 1918)
* No. 522 (Special Duty) Flight (June - August 1918)
* No. 577 Squadron RAF
* Detachment of No. 1606 (Anti-Aircraft Co-operation) Flight RAF (January - February 1943 &amp; February 1944)

== Accidents and incidents ==
A Hawk aircraft crashed at RAF Mona in 2007. The pilot ejected safely and made a full recovery.

A Hawk aircraft overshot the runway on 13 September 2013. The aircraft was practising forced landings when it hit a goose while on the runway and ended up in the arresting safety net. Both instructor and pupil were unhurt.

In June 2016 a man was convicted of endangering aircraft by shining a powerful torch at pilots undertaking night-time fast jet training at RAF Mona.

<text>A Reserve Good Conduct Medal refers to any one of the five military conduct awards, four of which are currently issued and one of which was previously issued, by the United States Armed Forces to members of the Reserve and National Guard. The primary difference between the regular Good Conduct Medal and the Reserve Good Conduct Medal is that the regular Good Conduct Medal is only issued for active duty service while the reserve equivalent is bestowed for reserve duties such as drills, annual training, and additional active duty for either training or operational support to the active duty force or, in the case of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, in support of Title 32 U.S.C. state active duty (SAD) such as disaster response and relief.

To receive a Reserve Good Conduct Medal, a service member (excluding Army Reservists), must, generally, be an active member of the Reserve or National Guard and must have performed three to four years of satisfactory duty (to include drills and annual training) with such service being free of disciplinary action. Periods of active duty in the Active Component prior to joining the Reserve Component, full-time active duty in an Active Guard and Reserve, Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR), Full Time Support (FTS), or active duty recall or mobilization in excess of three years are not typically creditable towards a Reserve Good Conduct Medal, although such periods are typically creditable for the active duty equivalent Good Conduct Medal. Each service has specific varying requirements.

==U.S. Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal==
The last of the Reserve Good Conduct Medals to be authorized, the U.S. Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal (ARCAM), was established by the Secretary of the Army on 3 March 1971 and amended by Department of the Army General Orders 4, in 1974. The Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal was originally awarded for exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity while serving as a member of an Army National Guard or Army Reserve Troop Program Unit (TPU) for each four-year period of consecutive service completed on or after 3 March 1972. Effective 28 March 1995, the period of qualifying service for the award was reduced from four years to three years; however, this change was not retroactive. Additional awards of the ARCAM are indicated by bronze and silver oak leaf clusters.

Service must have been consecutive and service performed in the Reserve Component of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard may not be credited for award of this medal. The member must have exhibited honest and faithful service in accordance with the standards of conduct, courage and duty required by law and customs of the service of a member of the same grade as the individual to whom the standard is being applied. A member must be recommended for the award by his or her unit commander whose recommendation is based on personal knowledge of the individual and the individual&#x27;s official records of periods of service under prior commanders during the period for which the award is made. Furthermore, a commander may not delay award or extend the qualifying period for misconduct. A determination that service is not honorable as prescribed negates the entire period of the award.

Soldiers who are ordered to active duty in the Active Guard and Reserve program (AGR) will be awarded the ARCAM if they have completed two of the three years required (Good Conduct Medal eligibility starts on the effective date of the AGR order). Soldiers with less than two years will not receive an award. Service lost may be recovered if the soldier is separated honorably from the AGR program and reverts to troop program unit service, for example, a soldier serves one year and six months of qualifying service and is ordered to an AGR tour. This service is not sufficient for award of the ARCAM. When the Soldier leaves the AGR program that one year and six months is granted towards the next award of the ARCAM. Only the State Adjutant General may determine that the AGR service was not sufficiently honorable enough to revoke the previously earned time, regardless of the type of separation given.

The ARCAM is awarded to both officer and enlisted members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard (all enlisted ranks are eligible as well as officer ranks up to colonel) and has basically the same criteria as the other Reserve Services for award of a Reserve Good Conduct Medal. The Armed Forces Reserve Medal (AFRM) is a similar award, established in 1950, which is given for ten years of honorable reserve service (consecutive without a break in service) and is presented to both officers and enlisted personnel.

=== Notable recipients ===
* Tim Walz: Minnesota Governor and Democratic nominee for Vice president in the 2024 U.S. election

==Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal==
First created in 1962 with retroactive presentation to 1958, it remained an active decoration in the U.S. Navy until its discontinuation in 2014.

The Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal was considered the enlisted successor award to the previous Naval Reserve Medal. From 1958 until 1996, the medal was awarded for four years of satisfactory enlisted reserve service as a drilling reservist in the Selected Reserve (SELRES) or Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), to include Volunteer Training Units (VTU).

Full-time active duty enlisted personnel in the Naval Reserve&#x27;s Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Program (renamed the Full Time Support (FTS) Program from 2005 to 2021), while also eligible for the Naval Reserve Medal, were not eligible for the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal and were awarded the Navy Good Conduct Medal on par with active duty Regular Navy enlisted personnel.

The years of service requirement for the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal dropped from four years of service to three years of service from 1997 until its discontinuation, synchronizing it with the reduction in the required service for the active duty Navy Good Conduct Medal, which replaced it entirely pursuant to a SECNAV directive in 2014. As a result of this SECNAV directive, all enlisted sailors in both the Active Component and the Reserve Component now receive the same good conduct medal for the same period of service.

Additional awards of the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal are denoted by service stars. This was strictly an enlisted service medal on par with Navy Good Conduct Medal for active duty enlisted sailors, to include those active duty enlisted sailors in the renamed U.S. Navy Reserve&#x27;s Full Time Support (FTS) program, previously known as Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) prior to 2005, with FTS redesignated again as TAR in 2021. Commissioned officers, to include chief warrant officers, were not eligible for award of the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal.

==Air Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medal==
Designed by Thomas Hudson Jones and originally established on April 1, 1964 as the &quot;Air Force Reserve Ribbon&quot; by Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert, the award became a full sized medal, under its current name, on November 2, 1971 under Secretary of the Air Force Robert C. Seamans, Jr. From 1965 to 1974, the award was presented for four years of honorable reserve enlisted service in the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard, however the time limit was lowered to three years of service beginning on July 1, 1975. Additional awards of the Air Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medal are denoted with oak leaf clusters. This is strictly an enlisted service award on par with the Air Force Good Conduct Medal for active duty enlisted airmen in the Regular Air Force. Commissioned officers are not eligible for award of the Air Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medal.

==Selected Marine Corps Reserve Medal==
First created in 1925 as the &quot;Fleet Marine Reserve Medal&quot;, this is the oldest of the Reserve Good Conduct Medals. In 1939 the name of the medal was changed to the &quot;Organized Marine Corps Reserve Medal&quot;. In 1984, the award adopted its current name. As of January 1, 1996, the qualifying period of service was changed from four to three years to mirror the requirements of the Good Conduct Medal. Additional awards are denoted by bronze or silver service stars.

==Coast Guard Reserve Good Conduct Medal==
Created in 1963 and awarded for a standard satisfactory enlisted reserve tour of three years of duty. Additional awards are denoted by service stars. This is strictly an enlisted service award on par with the Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal for active duty enlisted coast guardsmen. Commissioned officers, to include warrant officers, are not eligible for award of the Coast Guard Reserve Good Conduct Medal, however, they are entitled to wear the award if it was earned during prior enlisted service.

<text>Beginning of the End is a 1957 American science fiction film produced and directed by Bert I. Gordon. It stars Peter Graves, Peggie Castle, and Morris Ankrum. An agricultural scientist, played by Graves, successfully grows gigantic vegetables using radiation. Unfortunately, the vegetables are eaten by locusts (the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers), which quickly grow to a gigantic size and attack the nearby city of Chicago. &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; is generally known for its &quot;atrocious&quot; special effects, &quot;and yet,&quot; writes reviewer Bill Warren, &quot;there is something almost compellingly watchable about this goofy little movie&quot;.

&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; is the most popular film at the Insect Fear Film Festival at UIUC, according to the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s magazine in 1995.

==Plot==
The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes accidentally stumbling upon a small town (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 residents are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright, who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.

Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Wainwright and Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now have turned to human beings as a source of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson, Colonel Sturgeon, and Captain Barton to try to come up with a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh, as well as several buildings.

General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts &quot;en masse&quot; is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan using a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The plan works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Wainwright and Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops.

==Production==
&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; was financed by American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT). The company had been formed in February 1953 when the American Broadcasting Company and United Paramount Theatres merged. In September 1956, AB-PT (sometimes also called &quot;Am-Par&quot;) announced the formation of a movie studio, and revealed a slate of six films a year in January 1957. The studio&#x27;s focus was on low-budget features which it could place in its theatres in the Northeast and South. AB-PT hoped to expand to a yearly slate of 20 pictures, and signed a distribution deal with Republic Pictures to get them into theatres.

&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; went into production in 1956, the first of the &quot;boom years&quot; for science fiction films in the United States. Its production was a direct outcome of the success of &quot;Them!&quot;

AB-PT announced on November 29, 1956, that it had approved production of its first film, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; and announced on December 2, 1956, that production would begin immediately. The company said it had hired 34-year-old Bert I. Gordon to direct and produce. Gordon had gotten his start as a supervising producer for televised commercials and network TV shows, had produced his first feature film (&quot;Serpent Island&quot;) in 1954, and directed his first feature film (&quot;King Dinosaur&quot;) in 1955.

The story was already set, according to press reports, with &quot;Variety&quot; claiming that Bert I. Gordon had already completed the script. Press sources noted that the studio was clearly attempting to cash-in on the science fiction movie craze. However, the final screenplay is credited to Fred Freiberger (a veteran writer of B movies) and Lester Gorn. The screen story bears a striking resemblance to the 1904 H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth&quot; (Gordon would adapt this novel twice, once for Embassy Pictures in 1965&#x27;s &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; and again for American International Pictures in 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Food of the Gods&quot;).

Casting was complete within two weeks of the start of production. In late November, AB-PT said actress Mala Powers was being considered for the female lead. But on December 2, the studio revealed that Peter Graves and Peggie Castle had been cast as the leads. Three days later, AB-PT announced that Don C. Harvey, Morris Ankrum, Pierre Watkin, Ralph Sanford, and Richard Benedict had also been cast. The studio also said that Pat Dean, its &quot;sexboat&quot; discovery (and a former dancer at the El Rancho Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada) would also appear in the picture. Larry Blake, Duane Cress, James Douglas, Eileen Jannsen, John Kranston, Ann Loos, and Jeanne Wood were added to the cast a few days later. Ankrum, Henry, and Seay were cast because they usually played military men in B movies, roles they portrayed in &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; as well.

John A. Marta, a veteran cinematographer, and Aaron Stell, a long-time film editor, also worked on the film. Marta had shot close to 150 B movies for Republic Pictures by this time, which is probably why he was hired (given AB-PT&#x27;s relationship with that studio and Marta&#x27;s fast-and-quick shooting style). Albert Glasser composed the musical score. Glasser worked in the same office building where Gordon had his offices, and Gordon admired his score for the 1956 war film &quot;Huk!&quot; (a B movie from Pan Pacific Productions). Gordon had already used Glasser to score his 1957 monster movie &quot;The Cyclops&quot;. Glasser wrote the musical score for &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; as well as five more of Gordon&#x27;s films. Glasser was paid $4,000 for his work on &quot;The Cyclops&quot;, which may indicate how much he was paid for the musical score for &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;. The musical soundtrack included the song &quot;Natural, Natural Baby.&quot; The art director was Walter Keller.

It is not clear what the budget for the picture was, although descriptions often use the term &quot;low budget&quot; or &quot;ultra-low-budget.&quot; According to a statement by AB-PT President Leonard Goldenson in 1957, the average cost of the AB-PT pictures greenlit to date was $300,000. In comparison, &quot;Invaders From Mars&quot; was budgeted at $150,000, &quot;The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms&quot; cost $400,000, &quot;It Came From Outer Space&quot; cost $532,000, &quot;Them!&quot; came in at under $1 million, and 1953&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; cost $2 million.

Filming began December 3, 1956. Shooting took place on the Republic Pictures backlot at 4024 Radford Avenue in Los Angeles, California (built by Mack Sennett and now home to CBS Studio Center). Actor Peter Graves said Gordon &quot;was okay, he was a good director.&quot; He also had praise for actress Peggie Castle, and said he felt privileged to be working with an actor of Morris Ankrum&#x27;s stature.

Gordon himself provided the special effects for the film. According to composer Glasser, Gordon literally worked out of his home garage. Animated grasshoppers were considered, but the idea rejected as too costly. So Gordon relied heavily on split screen, static mattes, and rear projection effects for the film. But his most important effort was one he had used in &quot;King Dinosaur&quot;: placing live creatures on still photographs, and blowing air at them to encourage the creatures to move. Gordon purchased 200 non-hopping, non-flying live grasshoppers in Texas (which had recently seen an outbreak of a species of exceptionally large locusts) for the film. But when he attempted to bring them into California for filming, state agricultural officials required that every single one of the animals be inspected and sexed. He later described his efforts:
:I had to get my grasshoppers from Waco, Texas. They had the only species large enough to carry focus. I could only import males because they didn&#x27;t want the things to start breeding. They even had someone from the agricultural department or some place like that come out to take a head count, or wing count. The grasshoppers turned cannibalistic.
Gordon kept the grasshoppers in a box for only a few days, but during that time the grasshoppers devoured one another and only 12 were left when Gordon finally got around to shooting them. Gordon also considered building miniatures for the grasshoppers to climb on, but this, too, was deemed too expensive. Instead, Gordon used still photographs of the Wrigley Building and other noted Chicago landmarks and simply filmed the grasshoppers moving about on top of the photograph. When the monsters are supposed to be wounded or killed by gunfire, Gordon merely tipped the photograph and the grasshoppers slid down it. According to one film historian, &quot;the effect looks (almost) real&quot; until one of the grasshoppers steps off the &quot;building&quot; into what is supposed to be thin air.

==Release==
&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; premiered in Chicago on June 16, 1957. Stars Peter Graves and Peggie Castle were both on hand for the premiere. The film opened widely in 244 theaters in the South and Midwest on June 20. It played as part of a double feature with &quot;The Unearthly&quot; (a film based loosely on 1932&#x27;s &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; and 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Black Sleep&quot;), another AB-PT production. As planned, it was distributed by Republic Pictures.

There is some discrepancy as to how long the film ran. Some sources cite 73 minutes, some 74 minutes, and some 76 minutes.

&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; proved an apt title for its parent studio. AB-PT shuttered its operations immediately after releasing the film, for reasons which are still unclear. Gordon&#x27;s work for AB-PT landed him a new contract with American International Pictures (AIP). The week &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; opened, Gordon began shooting his next feature film, &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot;, for AIP.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; was a modest hit, and profitable for AB-PT. For example, in its first week playing in San Francisco, it made $16,000—just behind the top-ranked movie of the week for the area, the reissue of &quot;Bambi&quot; (which grossed $18,500). The film&#x27;s debut in Los Angeles saw its gross reach $16,500, although this was a soft movie-going market.

The film made Bert I. Gordon famous for his giant monster films. Critics and film historians point out that the film is only one of many which drew heavily on most Americans&#x27; fear about atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the possibility of nuclear war. However, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as &quot;Godzilla&quot; or &quot;Them!&quot; A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans&#x27; worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).

The film received extensive negative reviews at the time of its release and by modern film historians. &quot;Variety&quot; was particularly negative. Calling the movie &quot;derivative&quot;, the industry trade publication said, &quot;Summarizing the plot of &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films.&quot; The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. &quot;Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit.&quot; It called the special effects &quot;obvious&quot; and decried the use of stock footage. The reviewer felt the screenplay was &quot;ludicrous&quot; and cliché-ridden. The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle&#x27;s performance as &quot;unconvincing&quot; and Morris Ankrum&#x27;s as &quot;artificial&quot;. The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average. Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; had several negative comments. &quot;The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it&#x27;s great stuff.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: &quot;The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming.&quot; As of 2008, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; is still &quot;one of the most excoriated creature features.&quot; Leonard Maltin summed up his review in one word: &quot;awful&quot;. Another recent film guide called it &quot;Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch.&quot; One review pointed out that Gordon didn&#x27;t even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land). Some have also been upset with film&#x27;s lack of horrifying images. The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie &quot;Them!&quot;, and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to &quot;cash in&quot; on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.

There have been some positive reviews, however. One modern critic said &quot;the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects.&quot; Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: &quot;As in &quot;Deadly Mantis&quot;, the &quot;complete&quot; disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as is the notion of 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been.&quot; Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: &quot;The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they&#x27;re naïve and go to get scared, or they&#x27;re sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn&#x27;t much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know.&quot; Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. &quot;I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who &#x27;bought&#x27; it and loved it.&quot;

&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; has become somewhat infamous because of its notoriously poor production values and unrealistic plot. The movie was parodied in the 11th season of the hit animated television program &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt).&quot; In that episode, Homer Simpson grows giant vegetables using radioactive materials, and automatically assumes that any animal eating the food will become monstrous. Homer even attempts to recall &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; as evidence of his claim, although he misremembers the title as &quot;Grasshopperus&quot; and the star as Chad Everett (another blond, all-American actor similar to Peter Graves). The film was the basis of an episode of the satirical cable television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (MST3K) during its fifth season. This episode of MST3K was released on DVD in 2001.

==Home media==
&quot;Beginning of the End&quot; was released on DVD in March 2003 by Image Entertainment. However, this print was considered &quot;smeary&quot; and not a very high quality issue.

<text>KREX-TV (channel 5) is a television station in Grand Junction, Colorado, United States, serving as the CBS affiliate for Colorado&#x27;s Western Slope region. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it is a sister station to low-power, Class A MyNetworkTV affiliate KGJT-CD, channel 27 (which KREX-TV simulcasts on its third digital subchannel); Nexstar also operates Fox affiliate KFQX (channel 4) under a shared services agreement (SSA) with owner Mission Broadcasting. The three stations share studios on Hillcrest Avenue in Grand Junction, where KREX-TV&#x27;s transmitter is also located.

KREX-TV can also be seen on KGJT-CD&#x27;s second digital subchannel (27.2), which allows homes with issues receiving KREX-TV&#x27;s VHF signal or only a UHF antenna to receive KREX in some form.

==History==
After starting test broadcasts on May 22, channel 5 first went on the air on May 30, 1954, as KFXJ-TV, owned by Colorado broadcasting pioneer Rex Howell along with KFXJ radio (AM 920). Howell had founded KFXJ in Edgewater, west of Denver, in 1926. It quickly established itself as one of the leading stations in Denver, but was beaten out for a CBS Radio affiliation by KLZ. In response, Howell moved KFXJ to Grand Junction in 1931, and relaunched it as the Western Slope&#x27;s first radio station. Intrigued by the growth of television, Howell made plans to sign on a television sister in 1951, but a delay in delivering the tower pushed the sign-on date back three years.

Channel 5 shared a studio with its radio sister on Hillcrest Manor, north of downtown Grand Junction. Howell had built the Art Deco and block glass structure in 1931 for the radio station, but expanded it to two stories to accommodate television. At the time, Hillcrest Manor was the highest populated point in the city. The stations&#x27; broadcast tower was located on the grounds next to the studio building.

The station carried programming from all four networks, but was a primary CBS affiliate. It lost DuMont when that network shut down in 1956, but continued carrying programs from CBS, NBC and ABC. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

In 1956, Howell moved the KFXJ calls to a newly opened satellite station on channel 10 in Montrose, some south of Grand Junction. The Grand Junction stations then changed their calls to KREX-AM-TV, after their founder. KREX-FM (92.3) signed on in 1960, transmitting from the same tower used by channel 5 at the Hillcrest location. KFXJ-TV in Montrose became KREY-TV in 1958. In 1965, Howell acquired then-shuttered KJFL-TV (channel 6) in Durango, Colorado, and changed its call letters to KREZ-TV, becoming the second satellite station for KREX-TV. This three-station network became known as &quot;XYZ Television&quot;, with the calls of all three stations corresponding to the word &#x27;king&#x27; (&#x27;Rex&#x27; coincidentally meaning king in Latin, with &#x27;rey&#x27; the Spanish word for king).

Howell sold his stations to a group of Cincinnati businessmen in 1966. However, they missed several payments, and Howell reclaimed control in 1969, running the stations until his death in 1978. In 1984, his heirs sold off his broadcasting empire, earning a handsome return on Rex&#x27;s original investment of 58 years prior. Channel 5 and its satellites went to Russell Withers, who retained the stations until selling them to Hoak Media in 2003 (Withers, however, sold KREZ-TV to Lee Enterprises in 1995).

For 25 years, KREX-TV was the only television station in western Colorado. However, cable providers supplemented it with the Denver stations. Channel 5 has also long claimed a large slice of eastern Utah as part of its primary coverage area, even though it is part of the Salt Lake City market.

Channel 5 finally got some local competition when KJCT signed on in 1979. KJCT took ABC full-time, leaving KREX-TV to shoehorn CBS and NBC onto its schedule. This was very unusual for a two-station market, especially one as small as Grand Junction. However, it made sense in light of the fact that ABC was the top-rated network at the time. Additionally, for the early part of its history, KJCT was a semi-satellite of fellow ABC affiliate KRDO-TV in Colorado Springs. Channel 5 finally lost NBC in 1996 when KKCO signed on. For a time in the 1990s, KREX also carried some Fox programming in the off-hours.

KREX-TV relocated its analog transmitter to the Black Ridge electronics site at the Colorado National Monument west of Grand Junction in 2002. It increased power eightfold, from 12.9 kW to 100 kW visual. The digital transmitter remains at the studio location, operating at a licensed power of only 834 watts.

KREX (AM) eventually moved its frequency to 1100 AM, and increased its power to 50,000 watts. It is now KNZZ, the top-rated radio station in the market, and transmits from Whitewater, a desert community south of Grand Junction. KREX-FM is now KMOZ-FM, broadcasting country music from a transmitter at the Black Ridge electronics site. It and KNZZ are now owned by MBC Grand Broadcasting. Channel 5 is still based at the Hillcrest Manor studio.

===Studio fire===
The KREX studios were ravaged by a fire that broke out on January 20, 2008. News reporters Michele Fralick and Lauren Dirks were two of the five persons (two news reporters, two master control operators, and one cleaning person) inside the building at the time of the fire, all of whom escaped without injury and survived. The cause of the fire was not immediately determined and it was initially noted as a cause &#x27;unknown&#x27;. The forensics investigations conducted led to follow-up reports that a space heater was concluded as being the source of the fire. 

The Grand Junction Fire Department was forced to pull firefighters from the building shortly after arriving on the scene. The 77-year-old building had been renovated several times, creating many dead air spaces. Fire officials were concerned by the potential for backdrafts, and decided to battle the fire from the exterior only. More than of water were required to fully extinguish the blaze, which continued to smolder for over 24 hours.

The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms assisted with the investigation. It was revealed that the fire started on the top floor (ground level offices) and continued down to the basement. Investigators focused on a heater in the hallway of the upper floor; however, it may be impossible to definitively determine the fire&#x27;s cause. This was due to the profound level of destruction within the building as well as the decision to allow the fire to burn itself out. Ironically, the station had passed a fire inspection by the Grand Junction Fire Department only a few weeks prior to the fire.

Damage to the facility was estimated at $6 million, making it the most significant fire loss in Grand Junction history. In addition to the losses of equipment and infrastructure, decades of file tapes were lost in the fire, as well as irreplaceable photographs and other archival material, wiping out a comprehensive catalog of the Grand Valley&#x27;s history.

The station&#x27;s CBS and Fox feeds went off the air around 10:30 a.m. However, within a few hours, the national CBS and Fox feeds were picked up by the then-local cable provider, Bresnan Communications. Dish Network temporarily replaced KREX and KFQX with their then network-owned Denver counterparts, KCNC-TV and KDVR, respectively. (DirecTV did not have an established local Grand Junction feed.) Due to the high penetration of cable and satellite in this area, most of the area&#x27;s residents didn&#x27;t lose access to CBS programming. Cable and satellite are all but essential for acceptable television in much of western Colorado due to the market&#x27;s rugged terrain. The fire also temporarily knocked out programming to KREX&#x27;s satellites and massive translator network, as they either were controlled from KREX&#x27;s studios, or fed off of the source originating at KREX&#x27;s transmitter.

===Recovery and reconstruction===
According to KREX General Manager Ron Tillery, the studios were a total loss and the structure is almost demolished. However, the $130,000 transmitter survived without significant damage, as it was housed in a 1960s-era bomb shelter located in the basement of the building. It took crews three days to reach the shelter due to debris and obstructions.

The transmitter was reassembled in a newly built outbuilding located on KREX&#x27;s current property, and the control room was temporarily housed in a portable building directly behind the transmitter. The station&#x27;s master control equipment was completely replaced with all-digital equipment, and the trailer featured three separate master controls for KREX&#x27;s CBS, Fox, and MyNetworkTV affiliates.

The KREX news division moved into temporary quarters at the PBS broadcasting studio at Western Colorado Community College, and staff also worked directly from their homes.

KREX-TV and its three full-power satellites returned to the air on January 30, 2008, with KFQX coming online the following day. As of mid-March, KREX and KFQX both began carrying a full slate of network and syndicated programming, and local news. KGJT-LP began repeating KREX&#x27;s programming with no variances in the schedule; this lasted until Fall 2008, when a separate schedule with MyNetworkTV programming resumed.

The station&#x27;s owner, Hoak Media, pledged to reconstruct a &quot;state of the art media and news gathering operation.&quot; A number of local businesses donated equipment and other materials to aid in the station&#x27;s recovery. On August 10, 2009, KREX&#x27;s new studios were completed. That day, the station premiered its new news set created by Delvin Design Group, its new graphics from VDO, and became the second station behind KJCT to launch local news in high definition.

===Dispute with Dish Network===
In June 2012, KREX and other Hoak-owned stations were pulled from Dish Network after they failed to renew a carriage agreement. The refusal to renew reportedly surrounds Dish Network&#x27;s &quot;Hopper&quot; digital video recorder and its controversial commercial-skipping feature &quot;AutoHop&quot;which has also led to complaints from the major U.S. television networks.

===Sale to Nexstar Broadcasting Group===
On November 20, 2013, Gray Television announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting in a $335 million deal. Since Gray already owns KKCO and operates KJCT (which is owned by Excalibur Broadcasting), it decided to spin off KREX and its translators, and KFQX (which is being acquired by Excalibur) to a third-party. On December 19, Gray announced, in a side deal related to the Hoak acquisition, that KREX and its satellites would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting, for $37.5 million. The sale of KREX was completed on June 13, 2014, while the KFQX sale was finalized on March 31, 2017. KREG was sold to Weigel Broadcasting in the winter of 2020, and has been repositioned via its cable and satellite carriage as a Denver-area station for its various popular subchannel networks.

==News operation==

KREX currently produces 22 hours of local news each week (with four hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). KREX-TV was the leading news station in the area for many years, but for most of the last decade has been runner-up to KKCO. Some of KREX&#x27;s newscasts are simulcast on its sister stations, KFQX and KGJT.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


===Translators===
* Aspen
* Basalt
* Collbran
* Mesa
* Redstone
* Snowmass Village
* Thomasville

==Former satellite stations==
KREX-TV formerly operated two additional satellite stations, KREZ-TV (channel 6) in Durango and KREG-TV (channel 3) in Glenwood Springs. KREZ had made several attempts at regional news programs over its 30 years as a semi-satellite of KREX. Eventually, the cost of supplying a microwave link to Durango plus the relatively small revenue base led to the sale of KREZ in 1995. It is now a satellite of Albuquerque, New Mexico&#x27;s KRQE. KREG had previously operated as standalone independent station KCWS for five months in 1984; after going dark for two years, it returned to the air as a satellite of KREX in 1987. In 2017, following the merger of Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Media General, KREG, which is considered to be within the Denver television market, was spun off to Marquee Broadcasting, then to Weigel Broadcasting in early 2020.

<text>Remote Radar Head Neatishead ( ), and commonly abbreviated RRH Neatishead, is an air defence radar site operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It is located approximately north-east of Norwich in the county of Norfolk, England.

Originally known as Royal Air Force Station Neatishead, or commonly RAF Neatishead, it was established during the Second World War, and consists of the main technical site located at Neatishead, together with a number of remote, and sometimes unmanned sites.

The station motto is &quot;Caelum Tuemur&quot;, meaning &#x27;We Watch over the Sky&#x27;. The station badge depicts the lowered head of a horned bull; and relates to the origins of the word &#x27;Neatishead&#x27;, meaning &#x27;the vassal&#x27;s household&#x27;.

RAF Neatishead was previously &#x27;parented&#x27; (for administrative and support functions) by the nearby RAF Coltishall (a fighter station latterly operating four squadrons of the ground-attack SEPECAT Jaguar). Following the closure of RAF Coltishall in 2006, RRH Neatishead became parented by RAF Marham in West Norfolk.

==History==
When RAF Neatishead was first established, its primary function was as a &#x27;Control and Reporting Centre&#x27; (CRC) for the south of the United Kingdom. Equipment previously located in the base included: Type 7 GCI, AN/FPS-6 height finding radar, Type 80 &#x27;Green Garlic&#x27; radar, Type 84 radar, Type 85 &#x27;Blue Yeoman&#x27; radar, 3 Decca (later Plessey) HF200 height finding radars, and a R15 radar.

On 16 February 1966, a fire broke out in the bunker, RAF station fire teams were unsuccessful in putting the fire out and so local civilian fire crews were called. Three civilian firefighters died and the fire burned for nine days before it was fully extinguished. Later that year, LAC Cheeseman was sentenced to seven years for starting the fire and causing the deaths. The station was closed for eight years, re-opening in 1974 after a major rebuild of the bunker complex. The operational nature of the work undertaken at Neatishead was transferred to the previously mothballed site at RAF Bawdsey in 1966, with Bawdsey reverting to a care and maintenance programme when Neatishead came back on line in 1974.

In November 1982, Group Captain Joan Hopkins took command of the station, becoming the first female RAF officer to take command of an operational station.

During July 1990 the Type 85 radar was decommissioned after 23 years of use, it was replaced by the Type 93.

In April 2004, the decision was taken to substantially reduce activities at RAF Neatishead, and by 2006, the base had been downgraded from an RAF station to Remote Radar Head (RRH) status, but its adjacent museum remains open. Its former gate guardian, a F-4 Phantom previously based at RAF Wattisham, was cut up for scrap in 2005 despite interest from the Radar Museum.

In October 2006, local news media reported that a buyer had been found for the now disused section of the base. The 25 1/2 acres site was advertised again in January 2010, with an asking price of £4,000,000. The site was subsequently purchased for an undisclosed amount by Zimbabwean-born British entrepreneur William Sachiti.

==Operations==
It forms part of the UK&#x27;s air defences – namely the UK &#x27;Air Surveillance And Control System&#x27; (ASACS), and is part of the larger NATO air defence. RRH Neatishead is adjacent to the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum.

RRH Neatishead formerly controlled the remote site of RRH Trimingham with its Lockheed TPS 77 radar.

In July 2022, it was announced that the radar equipment at RAF Trimingham would be moved to the RRH Neatishead site due to the threat of coastal erosion, and the increased interference experienced by radar operators from the off-shore wind turbines; the move is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

<text>The judo competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics was the first time the sport was included in the Summer Olympic Games. As a result, decades of judo being officially banned as an &quot;imperialist sport&quot; in the Soviet Union ended shortly before the Games started, as Soviet authorities prioritized winning medals over anything else. The medals were awarded in 4 classes, and competition was restricted to men only. The competition was held in the Nippon Budokan, which was built to host the competition.

<doc id="948738" wikidata="Q620661" url="?curid=948738" title="Project Echo">
<text>Project Echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment. Each of the two American spacecraft, launched in 1960 and 1964, were metalized balloon satellites acting as passive reflectors of microwave signals. Communication signals were transmitted from one location on Earth and bounced off the surface of the satellite to another Earth location.

The first transmissions using Echo were sent from Goldstone, California, to Crawford Hill in Holmdel, New Jersey, on 12 August 1960. The last Echo satellite deorbited and burned up in the atmosphere on 7 June 1969.

== Background ==
The concept of using orbital satellites to relay communications predated space travel, first being advanced by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945. Experiments using the moon as a passive reflecting way station for messages began as early as 1946. With the launching of Sputnik 1, Earth&#x27;s first artificial satellite, in 1957, interest quickly developed in orbiting communications satellites.

In July 1958, at a US Air Force sponsored meeting on communications satellites, Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer John R. Pierce put forth a presentation on passive satellite relay, describing how a reflective orbiting body could be used to bounce transmissions from one point on the Earth to another. William H. Pickering, director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), also attended the conference and suggested that JPL facilities, specifically a diameter polar-mounted antenna installed near Goldstone Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert, might be used as a ground facility for experiments with such a satellite.

In October 1958, Pierce, along with fellow Bell engineer Rudolf Kompfner, designed an experiment to observe atmospheric refractive effects using reflective balloon satellites. Believing the experiment would advance research toward transoceanic communications via satellites, the two engineers presented a paper advocating for the launch of balloon satellites to be used as passive communications reflectors to the National Symposium on Extended Range and Space Communication on 6 and 7 October 1958.

That same month, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formed, and two months later JPL was transferred from the United States Army to the new agency. Project Echo, NASA&#x27;s first communications satellite project, was officially laid out in a 22 January 1959 meeting with representatives from NASA, JPL, and Bell Telephone Laboratories setting the initial launch for September 1959.

== Objectives ==
Project Echo was a pathfinder mission with the objective of testing new technologies and preparing for future missions. Spaceflight engineers used Echo to prove new ideas and test limits in aerodynamics, satellite shape and size, construction materials, temperature control and satellite tracking. Echo was designed as an experiment to demonstrate the potential of satellite communications, not to function as a global communications system.

Echo was designed, approved and built with the following objectives:
* Observe and measure the effects of atmospheric drag
* Passively reflect ground based transmissions
* Demonstrate two-way communications
* Demonstrate commitment to the development of an American space program
* Provide precedent for the overflight of other nations by surveillance satellites

All of these objectives were accomplished with Project Echo. Further experiments used the satellite to engage a two-way telephone conversation on 15 August 1960 and to relay a live television transmission in April 1962.

== Ground stations ==
Two ground stations were used for testing Project Echo. The Goldstone facility located at Goldstone Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert, California and the Crawford Hill facility located at Holmdel, New Jersey. Both sites used separate antennas for transmitting and receiving. West-to-east transmissions were sent from Goldstone by a dish antenna built for Project Echo by JPL. The signals were received at Crawford Hill by a aperture horn-reflector antenna. Horn antennas were known to have low-noise properties. A transmission frequency of 2390 megahertz was selected, as this was the planned frequency band for future satellite experiments. East-to-west transmissions were sent from Crawford Hill using a diameter parabolic antenna and received at Goldstone using the existing Pioneer program antenna. A transmission frequency of 960.05 megahertz was used for westbound communications because the JPL receiver was already tuned to this frequency from the Pioneer lunar program.

Satellite acquisition and tracking were accomplished by three methods: optical, digital slave, and automatic radar. Optical tracking was the easiest method but could only be used at night when the Sun illuminated the satellite. Broad and narrow field telescopes with a television camera were mounted to the structure of the antenna at each site. The camera images were displayed to a servo operator who would control the position of the antenna to track the satellite. When optical tracking could not be used, a computer system called digital slave could acquire and track Echo. Digital slave worked by receiving primary tracking data from the NASA Minitrack network of stations. The computer would then issue antenna-pointing commands to control the antenna. The third tracking method was a continuous-wave radar subsystem. Radar was not suitable for acquisition of the satellite, but once Echo was acquired by optical, or digital slave, radar signals could be used to automatically maintain tracking.

== Spacecraft ==
The Echo spacecraft (Echo 1, Echo 1A, and Echo 2) were large thin skinned spheres that were inflated in orbit after leaving the atmosphere. These balloon satellites were approximately in diameter with a thin skin made of Mylar (a trade name for stretched polyethylene terephthalate or BoPET), and were built by Gilmore Schjeldahl&#x27;s G.T. Schjeldahl Company in Northfield, Minnesota. The satellites functioned as a reflector, not a transceiver; after being placed in low Earth orbit, signals could be sent from a ground station, reflected by its surface, and returned to Earth.

As its shiny surface was also reflective in the range of visible light, Echo was easily visible to the unaided eye over most of the Earth. The spacecraft was nicknamed a &quot;satelloon&quot; by those involved in the project (a portmanteau combining &quot;satellite&quot; and &quot;balloon&quot;). It was used to redirect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone, radio, and television signals. During the latter portion of its life, it was used to evaluate the technical feasibility of satellite triangulation.

=== Echo 1 ===
Echo 1 was in diameter, had a non-rigid skin made of -thick Mylar, and had a total mass of , weighing at launch. During ground inflation tests, of air were needed to fill the balloon, but while in orbit, several pounds of gas were all that was required to fill the sphere. To address the problem of meteorite punctures and keep the sphere inflated, Echo 1 included a make-up gas system using two types of sublimating powders – of anthraquinone and of benzoic acid. It also had 107.9 MHz telemetry beacons, powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. The spacecraft was useful to the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure, due to its large area-to-mass ratio. It was held together with Schjelbond, a proprietary adhesive developed by the Schjeldahl company.

=== Echo 2 ===
Echo 2 was a -diameter balloon satellite, the last launched by Project Echo. A revised inflation system was used for the balloon, to improve its smoothness and sphericity. Echo 2&#x27;s skin was rigidizable, unlike that of Echo 1. Therefore, the balloon was capable of maintaining its shape without a constant internal pressure; a long-term supply of inflation gas was not needed, and it could easily survive strikes from micrometeoroids. The balloon was constructed from a -thick mylar film sandwiched between and bonded with two layers of -thick aluminum foil. It was inflated to a pressure that caused the metal layers of the laminate to plastically deform slightly, while the polymer was still in the elastic range. This resulted in a rigid and very smooth spherical shell. A beacon telemetry system provided a tracking signal, monitored spacecraft skin temperature between , and measured the internal pressure of the spacecraft between 0.00005 mm of mercury and 0.5 mm of mercury, especially during the initial inflation stages. The system consisted of two beacon assemblies powered by solar cell panels and had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.02 MHz and 136.17 MHz.

== Flights ==
Five suborbital ballistic tests to determine whether the launch, deploy, and expansion mechanisms would work were flown using the Shotput test vehicle, a three-stage rocket. The first Shotput flew at 5:40 pm on 27 October 1959. Shotput 1 successfully delivered the Echo prototype to the desired altitude, but a small amount of residual gas in the folds of the balloon violently expanded, bursting the test article. People up and down the Atlantic coast witnessed what looked like distant fireworks as thousands of pieces of shredded Mylar reflected sunlight in a display that lasted for about 10 minutes. Four more Shotput tests were flown on 16 January, 27 February, 1 April, and 31 May 1960.

On 13 May 1960, the first attempt to orbit an Echo satellite was made. The mission, which was also the maiden voyage of the Thor-Delta launch vehicle, failed before deployment of the payload. Echo 1 lifted off from Cape Canaveral&#x27;s LC-17A, and the Thor stage performed properly, but during the coasting phase, the attitude control jets on the unproven Delta stage failed to ignite, sending the payload into the Atlantic Ocean instead of into orbit.

On 12 August 1960, Echo 1A (commonly referred to as &quot;Echo 1&quot;) was successfully put into an orbit of by another Thor-Delta. A microwave transmission from the JPL Goldstone facility in California, was relayed by the satellite to Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, that same day. It was originally expected that Echo 1A would not survive long after its fourth dip into the atmosphere in July 1963, although estimates allowed the possibility that it would continue to orbit until 1964 or beyond. It ended up surviving much longer than expected, and finally reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and burned up on 24 May 1968.

On 25 January 1964, Echo 2 was launched on a Thor Agena launch vehicle. In addition to passive communications experiments, it was used to investigate the dynamics of large spacecraft and for global geometric geodesy. Since it was larger than Echo 1A and orbiting in a near-polar orbit, Echo 2 was conspicuously visible to the unaided eye over all of the Earth. It reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and burned up on 7 June 1969.

Both Echo 1A and Echo 2 experienced a solar sail effect due to their large size and low mass. Later passive communications satellites, such as OV1-08 PasComSat, solved the problems associated with this by using a grid-sphere design instead of a covered surface. Later yet, NASA abandoned passive communications systems altogether, in favor of active satellites.

== Legacy ==

Project Echo facilitated the first successful satellite transmission and first two way communications between the JPL Goldstone facility and Bell Telephone Laboratories facility in Holmdel, New Jersey. Other groups participated in experiments including the Collins Radio Company and the Naval Research laboratory. Because Echo was only a passive system, it was primarily useful in demonstrating the future potential of satellite communications and became obsolete before it deorbited in 1968. Echo was most known to the general public for its visibility as it could be seen at night with the naked eye.

The Echo satellite program also provided the astronomical reference points required to accurately locate Moscow. This improved accuracy was sought by the U.S. military for the purpose of targeting intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The large horn antenna at Holmdel constructed by Bell Labs for the Echo project was later used by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson for their Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

On 15 December 1960, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp depicting Echo 1.

<doc id="948750" wikidata="Q6494134" url="?curid=948750" title="Last Best West">
<text>&quot;Last Best West&quot; was a phrase used to market the Canadian prairies to prospective immigrants. The phrase was used to advertise the Canadian west abroad, and in Eastern Canada, during the heyday of western settlement from 1896 until the start of the First World War in 1914, when few could leave Europe.

One of the key considerations for the government in this recruitment of settlers was the fear that Americans would stream North and settle the southern parts of what would become the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The goal was to encourage families, and therefore make it hospitable for women who could edify and purify the frontier.

The program was so successful that little more than nine years later the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed out of the enormous North-West Territories of Canada.

Printed on pamphlets distributed in Northern Europe, Britain and the United States, the campaign was operated by the Minister of the Interior Clifford Sifton, appointed by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier to oversee settlement of the west. &quot;The Last Best West&quot; was a direct comparison to the United States. While there were still tracts of land available in the U.S., most of the best land had been taken and the American frontier had been declared closed in 1890. The land in Canada was the last region still not populated by Europeans.

The phrase was for the most part a marketing ploy. However, even though the frost-free season is shorter in Canada, a less arid climate compensates for this and the Canadian prairies have long been more productive than those of the Dakotas and Wyoming. In addition, unlike the American West, the settlement of the Canadian west was well organized, with the North-West Mounted Police providing law and order.

<text>The Meritorious Service Medal () was a military decoration of South Vietnam that was awarded between the years of 1950 and 1974. Each of the three branches of the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces had its version of the Meritorious Service Medal. The medal was intended to recognize exceptionally important military achievement, both in combat and non-combat service, but did not warrant receipt of the higher decoration the Distinguished Service Order.

==Criteria==
The Meritorious Service Medal was awarded, or posthumously awarded, to non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel in the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces who, during their period of service met one of the following requirements:
*Cited or wounded many times in combat or in the line of duty.
*Accomplishing an exceptionally important achievement that reflects great credit on or is beneficial to the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces in any field.

The Meritorious Service Medal could also be awarded to foreign non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel for their meritorious service to the Republic of Vietnam.

<doc id="948759" wikidata="Q7237656" url="?curid=948759" title="Prague (novel)">
<text>Prague is a historical novel by Arthur Phillips about a group of North American expatriates in Budapest, Hungary. It is set in about 1990, at the end of the Cold War. &quot;Prague&quot; is the author&#x27;s debut novel, first published by Random House in 2002. 

In 2003, the novel won The Los Angeles Times/Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Prague&quot; opens on the afternoon of May 25, 1990 with five North American expatriates living in the city of Budapest. The expatriates are, for the most part, optimistic about their prospects in the Central European city. John Price seeks a reconciliation with his older brother, Scott, who has come to Budapest to separate himself from his earlier life in the United States. Emily Oliver, an idealistic worker at the American Embassy, hopes to begin a distinguished diplomatic career. Mark Payton, a Canadian researching a history of nostalgia, relishes the chance to be immersed in a place with interesting history. Only Charles Gábor, a Hungarian-American venture capitalist who resents his co-workers and has contempt for his fellow Magyars, displays any pessimism at the story&#x27;s outset. The five young expatriates enjoy the nightlife and new opportunities in the historic city.

John is instantly attracted to Emily, and plots to win her love, but she ignores him. He finds a job as a columnist for an English-language newspaper, &quot;BudapesToday&quot;. Still a virgin at the age of 24, he is initiated by his co-worker Karen, but finds the experience to be quite anticlimactic. He later commits &quot;fradultery&quot; with his brother&#x27;s future wife, Mária.

Part II presents the complex history of the Horváth Kiadó (Horvath Press), a family-run publishing company – which also serves as a history of Budapest from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Presently, the head of the publishing house is Imre Horváth, who until recently had been exiled in Vienna. In the mid-nineteenth century, during the Revolution, the Horváth business is affected by the April Laws, a collection of laws legislated by Lajos Kossuth with the aim of modernizing Kingdom of Hungary into a nation state. During the Communist regime, the Horváth Kiadó was a state-owned enterprise; after the fall of communism, it is due to be privatized. Imre seeks an investment from Charles&#x27; venture capital firm in order to buy the press&#x27;s assets and restart it in Budapest.

John frequently fraternizes with an elderly jazz bar pianist named Nádja. He is entranced by the romantic stories she tells of her past, but his friends are less than convinced of their veracity. In particular, John is dismayed by Emily&#x27;s dismissal of Nádja as an &quot;amazing liar&quot;. He is also dismayed that Emily pulls away when he tries to kiss her. John becomes involved with Nicky, a photographer and artist who wants a physical, but not an emotional, relationship.

Charles&#x27; firm rejects his proposal to fund the Horváth Kiadó. With the help of John, who writes supportive newspaper columns and serves as Charles&#x27; aide, Charles secures independent funding for this venture. He resigns from his firm and becomes a partner in the new Horváth Kiadó.

Mark Payton&#x27;s research into nostalgia becomes a personal obsession. He takes an inordinate interest in gramophone music and riding in a funicular carriage. He later becomes preoccupied with the contemporary Gulf War and its continuous coverage on CNN. In September 1990, Mark leaves Budapest suddenly, due to his declining mental health.

In autumn 1990, Scott marries Mária and moves to Romania with her, telling John that he never wants to see him again. John continues to desire Emily and be jealous of other men she talks to. Charles and John learn that other parties may want to bid for the Horváth Kiadó assets.

In January 1991, Imre Horváth suffers a stroke and goes into a coma. Charles Gábor effectively becomes sole head of the publishing company. He accepts a takeover bid by a multinational media corporation, headed by the Australian billionaire Hubert Melchior (a parody of Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation). Horváth recovers, but not in time to prevent his historic publishing firm from being absorbed into the multinational publishing empire.

In March, John says that he loves Emily, even though he knows she is a &quot;spy.&quot; The next day, John is fired from his job for having accused an embassy employee of being a spy. Emily, who was having a lesbian relationship with Nicky, leaves the city to escape the accusation. Charles returns to America, unrepentant. Frustrated by lack of catharsis and Charles&#x27; insincerity, John imagines a more fitting end to the story: Charles is shot dead in the airport by Krisztina Toldy, Imre Horváth&#x27;s loyal assistant.

Finally, John himself leaves Budapest, traveling by train to the more promising city of Prague.

==Characters in &quot;Prague&quot;==
*John Price is the protagonist of the novel, a 24-year-old who comes to Budapest to find his brother, with whom he has had a strained relationship. A dreamer throughout the story, he constantly suspects that life is better, more authentic, somewhere else. Both John and Scott Price are Jewish and from the US West Coast.
*Scott Price maintains a grudge against his younger brother John. A jock alpha male with a decidedly un-alpha childhood (he was overweight and often picked upon), he experiences regular lapses of insecurity, blaming John for his unpleasant childhood. For a living, he teaches English. Ultimately, he leaves for Romania with his wife, Mária, to escape John.
*Emily Oliver is an embassy worker, originally from Nebraska. The details of her work are not known to the other characters (she works in a classified information environment). She often feels unfulfilled by her work and suspects that she is living in the shadow of her father, with a distinguished foreign service career.
*Mark Payton is a gay Canadian academic who researches nostalgia. As his time in Budapest progresses, he becomes unable to separate his life from his work (which the other characters view as charmingly irrelevant) and eventually leaves for mental health reasons.
*Charles (Károly) Gábor is a junior member of a risk-averse venture capital firm. Of Hungarian ancestry (his parents escaped during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution) he came to Budapest hoping to earn a fortune, but his lethargic firm refuses his proposals. Eventually, he grows bitter, suspecting that all of Hungary&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirits have been drained by four decades of Communism. He independently gathers investment capital to restart the Horváth Press.
*Karen Whitley is John Price&#x27;s officemate, described by Nicky M. as &quot;the office airhead&quot;, and the woman to whom John Price loses his virginity.
*Nicky Mankiewiliczki-Pobudziej (aka Nicky M.) is John Price&#x27;s artist girlfriend who, while affectionate toward him, is also inerrantly selfish. While allowing sexual relations to flow freely, she refuses to give him any emotional support. She also has an affair with Emily Oliver.
*Mária is Scott Price&#x27;s fiancée and, later, wife, of Hungarian ancestry. Despite her evident affection for Scott, she sleeps with John at one point in the novel.
*Nádja is an elderly Hungarian piano player. A cosmopolite with dazzling stories, she becomes a close friend of John throughout the novel, and he even experiences a sexual attraction to her, wishing she were younger so that &quot;he&quot; could be featured in her romantic stories. Of the characters who meet her, only John actually believes her unlikely stories, but the question of their veracity is never settled.
*Imre Horváth is the head of a Hungarian publishing house that has been in his family for six generations. He escaped Hungary in 1956 and began a new publishing house in Vienna. After the fall of Communism, he wishes to return home and restart the press. Other characters see him as a silly, self-important old man.
*Krisztina Toldy is Mr. Horváth&#x27;s devoted assistant.

==Major themes==
&quot;Prague&quot; is set in Budapest, Hungary, following the Cold War. The city of Prague represents the unfulfilled emotional desires of the novel&#x27;s main characters: it is the city where – as the novel&#x27;s characters perceive – there is more life, capital flows more freely, and there are better parties.

The five central expatriates are reminiscent of the Lost Generation popularized in novels such as Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Each of &quot;Prague&quot;&#x27;s main characters comes to the city with a different motive. For Mark Payton, Budapest is an opportunity for field research in his study of historical nostalgia; he views his native city of Toronto as bland and lacking history. Emily desires to emulate her father&#x27;s acclaimed foreign service career by working in the United States embassy. Scott Price seeks to escape his miserable childhood in the United States, while John Price (whom Scott sees as a source of said misery) desires reconciliation. Finally, Charles Gábor&#x27;s goal is to make a fortune as a venture capitalist in the emerging, new Budapest.

Hungarian history is prominently featured in &quot;Prague&quot;, emerging via the novel&#x27;s major Hungarian characters, particularly Nádja. About one quarter of the novel deals exclusively with the history of the Horváth family&#x27;s publishing house – through Habsburg rule, the 1848 Revolution, a pre-World War I &quot;golden age&quot; (characterized, despite its charms, by cultural squabblings and anti-Semitism), then decades of turmoil through the World Wars and Soviet occupation.

Much of the historical detail furnished by Phillips is actually outside the purview or interest of the major characters (excluding Mark) but is given for the reader&#x27;s benefit, adding historical context to events of the novel.

<text>John Charles Waite (born 4 July 1952) is an English rock singer and musician. As a solo artist, he has released ten studio albums and is best known for the 1984 hit single &quot;Missing You&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the top ten on the UK singles chart. He was also the lead vocalist for the rock bands the Babys and Bad English.

==Early life==
Waite was born and raised in Lancaster, Lancashire, and was educated at Greaves Secondary Modern and Lancaster Art College (The Storey Institute).

==Career==

As a performer, Waite first came to attention as the lead singer and bassist of the Babys, a British rock band that had moderate chart success. The band achieved two pop hits that each peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Time&quot; (1977) and &quot;Everytime I Think of You&quot; (1979), and a solid following of their concert tours. Over the course of five years, the band produced five albums ending with the final album &quot;On the Edge&quot; in October 1980, after which the group disbanded.

Waite subsequently launched his solo career with his 1982 debut album &quot;Ignition&quot;, which produced the hit single &quot;Change&quot;. The Chrysalis 45 failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during its initial release (May 1982) but was a top track on AOR radio stations, as well as a very popular music video on MTV as the &#x27;new&#x27; cable channel celebrated its first full year of operation. The song was originally recorded in 1981 (with slightly different lyrics) by the American rock band Spider (which featured Amanda Blue, Holly Knight, and Anton Fig) and in 1985 was included on the platinum-selling &quot;Vision Quest&quot; soundtrack. When the single was reissued, it reached the Top 50 on the Hot 100. &quot;Going to the Top&quot; was released as the original follow-up single to &quot;Change&quot;.

In 1984, Waite guest-starred on three episodes of the TV series &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. The shows featured his songs &quot;Missing You&quot; and &quot;Tears&quot;.

Waite&#x27;s next album, &quot;No Brakes&quot;, resulted in international success. It was a Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; album in the US due to the smash hit &quot;Missing You&quot; which went to No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. It knocked Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got To Do With It?&quot; out of No. 1. For that very reason, Turner later recorded and released Waite&#x27;s smash song herself. (Turner&#x27;s single peaked at No. 84 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 in 1996). &quot;Missing You&quot; also hit No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Album Rock Tracks as well as the Top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;No Brakes&quot; sold over a million and a half US copies, yet has never been certified above the RIAA Gold standard (a record company must apply to the RIAA for such certification). Two more singles from &quot;No Brakes&quot; followed, including &quot;Tears&quot; which was a Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

The next album &quot;Mask of Smiles&quot; followed in 1985, featuring the hit single &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot;. Another single, &quot;If Anybody Had a Heart&quot;, was released from the soundtrack of the 1986 film &quot;About Last Night...&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Rover&#x27;s Return&quot; was released with the single &quot;These Times Are Hard for Lovers&quot;. Waite would have another soundtrack appearance in 1990 from &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; with &quot;Deal for Life&quot;.

In 1988, Waite joined former Babys bandmates Jonathan Cain and Ricky Phillips, along with Neal Schon and drummer Deen Castronovo from Journey, to form the supergroup Bad English. In 1989, the Bad English ballad &quot;When I See You Smile&quot; (penned by Diane Warren) went to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and earned a Gold-certified single. Its parent album reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Five and sold nearly two million copies in the United States alone. Bad English released two albums before tensions amongst the members led to the band&#x27;s dissolution by 1992.

Waite then returned to solo work. He released the album &quot;Temple Bar&quot; (1995), &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; (1997), &quot;Figure in a Landscape&quot; (2001), &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (2004), Downtown: Journey of a Heart&quot; (2007) and &quot;Rough &amp; Tumble&quot; (2011). He has continued to tour, such as in 2003 with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.

In 2006, &quot;Missing You&quot; was released as a duet with Alison Krauss and reached the Top 40 on the Country Charts in the United States. Waite appeared with Krauss on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on 5 February 2007 to perform the song. Waite&#x27;s songs have reappeared in other media as well: 2013 saw &quot;Missing You&quot; featured heavily in the movie &quot;Warm Bodies&quot;, and &quot;Change&quot; is on the soundtrack of the US movie &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;.

On 5 February 2019, Waite and Joe Ely filed a class-action lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) claiming the company had violated their right to terminate grants of copyright. On 3 May 2019, UMG filed a motion to dismiss the case. In January, 2023 a federal judge ruled that Waite and hundreds of other artists cannot join forces to sue UMG to regain control of their masters, saying the case raised big questions about “fairness” but that it was ill-suited for class-action litigation. 

Waite was the subject of 2022 biographical documentary &quot;John Waite: The Hard Way&quot;.

==Personal life==
Previously a longtime resident of New York City, since 2014 Waite has made his home in Santa Monica, California.

<text>SCORE (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment) was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built communications satellite. Launched aboard an American Atlas rocket on December 18, 1958, SCORE provided the second test of a communications relay system in space (the first having been provided by the USAF/NASA&#x27;s Pioneer 1), the first broadcast of a human voice from space, and the first successful use of the Atlas as a launch vehicle. It captured world attention by broadcasting a Christmas message via shortwave radio from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower through an on-board tape recorder. The satellite was popularly dubbed &quot;The Talking Atlas&quot; as well as &quot;Chatterbox&quot;. SCORE, as a geopolitical strategy, aimed to place the United States at an even technological par with the Soviet Union as a response to the Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 satellites.

==Background==
The Air Force had initially proposed using their Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) as early as 1955, when the United States government was reviewing proposals for an orbital satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). This proposal was rejected because it would redirect resources from the ICBM&#x27;s development, and it was also feared that the rocket would not be ready in time for the IGY.

SCORE, a six-month effort, was the first endeavor of the then-new Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) headed by Roy Johnson, and proved that a small, highly focused and versatile research group with appropriate resources was an ideal method to achieve the scientific and technological advances necessary to succeed in the emerging global space race.

SCORE&#x27;s technical objectives were two-fold. In addition to showing that an Atlas missile was capable of satellite payload launch, the payload itself was a hundred times more massive than any previous US satellite. The program demonstrated the feasibility of transmitting messages through the upper atmosphere from one ground station to one or more ground stations. The result of the program, which used both real-time and store and forward techniques, was a major scientific breakthrough which proved that active communications satellites could provide a means of transmitting messages from one point to any other on Earth.

==Spacecraft==
The SCORE (Signal Communication by Orbiting RElay) satellite of the US Army was a long, and diameter Atlas missile used as a platform for the communications relay experiment. The spacecraft body served as antennae. This satellite was to demonstrate the feasibility and explore problems associated with operation of a satellite communication system. It carried messages on a tape recorder which was used at one point to carry a Christmas greeting from President Eisenhower. The performance was nominal with experiment operation for 12 days, planned orbit lifetime 20 days, actual orbit lifetime 34 days. The tracking beacon operated at 108 MHz.

The SCORE communications package was designed and built by Kenneth Masterman-Smith, a military communication research engineer, along with other personnel with the U.S. Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The overall program was conducted in such secrecy that only 88 people were aware of its existence. Before the date of the SCORE launch, 53 of the 88 people had been told the program had been canceled and they were not to mention to anyone that it had ever existed. That left only 35 people who knew of the mission of Atlas 10B with the rest of the engineering crew, including the launch crew, under the impression that they were working solely on a test launch of the rocket. The night before launch, however, Rear Adm. John E. Clark, deputy director of ARPA, was asked at a news conference whether he could deny that Eisenhower&#x27;s voice was on the recorder. He replied, &quot;No&quot;, and news reports that day suggested the voice might well be the president&#x27;s.

==Signal Communication by Orbiting Relay Equipment==
This first purpose-built communications satellite experiment consisted of 2 identical communications repeater terminals mounted in the guidance pods along the sides of the launch vehicle. The experiment was to test the feasibility and explore problems associated with using satellites for communications purposes. No modulation was received on the carrier wave from experiment package no. 1. Voice and teletype messages were sent and returned in real-time, and also from experiment tape recorder no. 2. The tape recorder was loaded with new material 28 times and failure finally was due to battery depletion. The experiment receiver and transmitter operated on 150 and 132 MHz, respectively. The payload weighed , and was built into the fairing pods of the Atlas missile. Combined weight of the total on-orbit package was .

==Mission==
As with Sputnik 1, which was launched by its R-7 Semyorka ICBM shortly after the missile had made its first operational flight, the SCORE mission occurred just three weeks after the first successful Atlas test launch on 28 November 1958. SCORE was launched on 18 December 1958 into an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of from LC-11 at Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex, Florida, inclined at 32.3°, with a period of 101.4 minutes. Its batteries lasted 12 days and it reentered the atmosphere on 21 January 1959.

The communications repeater installed on the missile received, amplified and retransmitted signals. Two redundant sets of equipment were mounted in the nose of the SCORE missile. Four antennas were mounted flush with the missile surface, two for transmission and two for reception. SCORE&#x27;s other equipment included two tape recorders, each with a four-minute capacity. Any of four ground stations in the southern United States could command the satellite into playback mode to transmit the stored message or into record mode to receive and store a new message. These redundancies proved invaluable as one of the tape recorders malfunctioned and was rendered inoperable during the 12-day mission.

According to an official history of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), SCORE was originally programmed to broadcast a voice message from Army Secretary Wilber M. Brucker. When the President learned this fact, hours before lift-off, he said he would like to provide the message. His tape-recording was hand-carried to Cape Canaveral, but by then the payload was locked and ready for launch. The ARPA program director decided to launch with the Army message, then erase it while in space, and upload the President&#x27;s message to replace it. This effort was successful, and accordingly SCORE&#x27;s transmitted message from space to Earth was as follows:

This is the President of the United States speaking. Through the marvels of scientific advance, my voice is coming to you from a satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one: Through this unique means I convey to you and to all mankind, America&#x27;s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill toward men everywhere.

The broadcast signal for Eisenhower&#x27;s greeting was fairly weak, and only very sensitive radio receivers were able to detect it. Most Americans heard the message as it was rebroadcast on commercial news programs.

<text>Ketagalan or Ketangalan () are a Taiwanese aboriginal people originating in what is now the Taipei Basin. Their language has now become extinct.

On 21 March 1996, the road in front of the Presidential Office Building was renamed from &quot;Long Live Chiang Kai-shek&quot; Road (介壽路) to Ketagalan Boulevard (凱達格蘭大道) by then-mayor of Taipei City, Chen Shui-bian, to commemorate the people. Traffic signs banning motorcycles and bicycles from that road were abolished at the same time.

Beitou District in Taipei City houses the Ketagalan Culture Center, a cultural center about the Ketagalan people.

==Folklore==
Legend has it that the Ketagalan forebears originally lived on another island, Sanasay. One day, a monster appeared on the island. Every night it would appear in the village, terrorizing the villagers. Accordingly, the villagers laid traps for the monster all around their homes and fields. The wounded monster was forced back into the mountains and the village was peaceful again for a while, but soon afterward it reappeared. Pushed to insanity by hunger, the monster went into one of the village homes and killed a child. The villagers lived in fear of being eaten and did not dare to sleep. The villagers fiercely debated but nobody could think of a way to deal with the monster.

With no other choice, it was decided that they must pack up and leave the island. Following an arduous sea voyage, they sighted land. The island they landed on was Taiwan, near the Shuang-Xi river in the north. Many years later, the community was growing so one day the villagers agreed to draw straws. Those who drew long straws were permitted to remain living on the fertile plain while those drawing the short straws would have to move into the mountains. Thereafter, the villagers were separated into plain-dwelling and mountain-dwelling peoples.

<text>Universities Canada () is an organization that represents Canada&#x27;s universities. It is a non-profit national organization that coordinates university policies, guidance and direction.

Formed in 1911, as the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), it represents 97 public and private not-for-profit Canadian universities and university colleges in Canada. It provides member services in public policy and advocacy, communications, research and information-sharing, and scholarships and international programs. In April 2015, the organization renamed itself &quot;Universities Canada.&quot;

Universities Canada is not a higher education accreditation body. Membership in the association requires universities to meet strict criteria and adhere to set principles of institutional quality assurance that must be reaffirmed every five years. This reinforces the recognition of a Canadian university degree around the world as a high-quality academic achievement.

The association produces a number of publications, such as &quot;University Affairs&quot; magazine and the &quot;Directory of Canadian Universities&quot;.

Universities Canada&#x27;s arms, supporters, and badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on May 10, 2004.

==Academic freedom==

On 25 October 2011, Universities Canada, known then by its former name, announced a new &quot;Statement on Academic Freedom&quot; which was adopted unanimously by the membership at its centennial meeting. However, at least one critic has expressed the opinion that the Statement, drafted by academic administrators, essentially gives academic administrators the right to determine the limits of such freedom.

==Advocacy==
Universities Canada works in an advocacy role with governments to promote higher education and awareness of the contributions Canada&#x27;s universities make to the country.

Its priorities are increasing funding for universities&#x27; operating and capital costs, research, and international programs, along with improved student assistance.

It is also involved in the government&#x27;s copyright reform process.

== Equity, diversity, and inclusion ==
Universities Canada follows the Canadian government&#x27;s Federal Employment Equity Act in developing their equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) policies for the four pillars of marginalized students, professors, and other university members.
&quot;Under-represented groups include those identified in the federal Employment Equity Act – women, visible minorities, Aboriginal peoples, and persons with disabilities – as well as, but not limited to, LGBTQ2+ people and men in female-dominated disciplines.&quot;

Universities Canada (and similarly the Canadian government) exclude social class from their EDI statement and initiatives. That is, the invisible minority who come from and/or live in poverty, those from working-class backgrounds, and those who are generally known as first-generation and/or low socioeconomic status. In Canada, poverty is termed as &quot;social condition&quot; and is not grounds for discrimination.

==Scholarship programs==
The association is also active in managing government-funded international partnership programs and more than 130 scholarship programs on behalf of private sector companies.

In partnership with Community Foundations of Canada and Rideau Hall Foundation, the association manages the Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships Program.

<doc id="948784" wikidata="Q1444046" url="?curid=948784" title="Bubble Boy (film)">
<text>Bubble Boy is a 2001 American black comedy film directed by Blair Hayes, starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the title role. The 1976 movie inspired it &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot;. A musical of the same title was written by the same authors and first performed in 2008.

The film was released on August 24, 2001, and it received mixed reviews, with criticism primarily aimed at the film&#x27;s humor, although Gyllenhaal received praise for his performance, despite underperforming at the box office.

==Plot==
Born without an immune system, Jimmy Livingston lives in a sterilized dome in his bedroom in his home in California, earning him the nickname &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; by his neighbors. His overbearing and devout Christian mother only exposes him to &quot;Highlights&quot; magazine and &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; for entertainment. When he is a teenager, Jimmy is immediately taken with Chloe, who moves in next door, and the two become friends despite his mother&#x27;s discouragement. When Chloe leaves for Niagara Falls to marry her boyfriend Mark in three days&#x27; time, Jimmy realizes that Chloe cares for him and builds a mobile bubble suit, determined to stop the wedding.

Along the way, Jimmy is picked up by a cult called Bright and Shiny but is abandoned in the desert when he offends them. He finds a new ride with Slim, a biker who speaks fondly of his old flame &quot;Wildfire&quot; upon hearing Jimmy&#x27;s story. The Livingstons pursue Jimmy, along with the cult members whose leader Gil believes &quot;The Round One&quot; to be the group&#x27;s messiah. Jimmy leaves a distracted Slim behind in Las Vegas and continues on using a scooter he wins at a casino. Encountering his parents on the road, Jimmy is struck by their vehicle and bounced aboard a train belonging to Dr. Phreak, who shows &quot;freaks&quot; to the public for money. When Phreak tries to recruit Jimmy, Jimmy knocks him unconscious, which allows the freaks to go their own way. They choose to trail Jimmy along with the other parties in pursuit.

Jimmy is picked up by Pushpop, an Indian ice cream truck driver, but has to continue on foot when they hit a cow on the road. Winning $500 in a mud wrestling competition, Jimmy pays taxi driver Pappy for a ride but is cornered by the cult members. He slips away during the group&#x27;s skirmish with the freaks and Slim&#x27;s gang. After Pappy appears to have died at the wheel, Jimmy tries to call Chloe from a gas station in New York only to reach her fiancé Mark, who rudely convinces him that Chloe does not love him. Discouraged, Jimmy intends to return home with his parents, but encouragement and an opening provided by his father Morton allows him to escape on a plane piloted by Pappy&#x27;s twin brother Pippy.

When Pippy becomes lifeless over Niagara Falls, Jimmy survives the fall and arrives at the church in time to stop the wedding. Abandoning his bubble suit, he embraces and kisses Chloe before collapsing. At Morton&#x27;s insistence, Mrs. Livingston confesses that he had already developed an immune system when he was four and has been perfectly fine all along. She had kept him isolated only due to her overprotective nature.

Jimmy and Chloe are married with all the people encountered during his adventure in attendance. Recognized as the former &quot;Wildfire,&quot; Mrs. Livingston re-embraces her rebellious side and prepares to depart with Slim on his bike along with Morton. Jimmy and Chloe discover Pippy and Pappyboth of whom merely fell asleep instead of dyingas they ride off to begin their honeymoon.

==Reception==

The site&#x27;s consensus states that &quot;&quot;Bubble Boy&quot; bounces along with lame, offensive jokes that are more tasteless than funny.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 41% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
The film has been considered a &quot;cult comedy.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

=== Controversy ===
The film was the center of a brief controversy for downplaying the effects of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) for the purposes of comedy, which affected the life of David Vetter, another child who lived in a bubble and died at age twelve.

==Musical adaptation==

In 2013, Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio adapted &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; into a stage musical featuring original songs, for which an original cast recording was released on Ghostlight Records in 2017 featuring A.J. Holmes, Alice Ripley and Richard Kind, produced by Paul, Justin Goldner and Kurt Deutsch.

<text>The Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) is a charitable organization that was established in 1913, and has over 400 member institutions in over 40 countries across the Commonwealth. The ACU is the world&#x27;s oldest international network of universities. Its mission is to promote and support excellence in higher education for the benefit of individuals and societies throughout the Commonwealth and beyond. It has a combined population of 3 billion, mainly under the age of 30, in Commonwealth countries.

Drawing on the collective experience and expertise, the ACU seeks to address issues in international higher education through a range of projects, networks, and events. The ACU administers scholarships, provides academic research and leadership on issues in the sector, and promotes inter-university cooperation and the sharing of good practice, helping universities serve their communities.

The Association of Commonwealth Universities is governed by its member institutions through an elected Council. As the ACU is a UK-registered charity, Council members also act as its Trustees. The ACU Council comprises up to 23 members: 20 elected Council members, up to two co-opted Council members and, if the Honorary Treasurer is co-opted rather than elected, the Honorary Treasurer.

==History==
In 1912, the University of London took the initiative to assemble 53 representatives of universities in London to hold a Congress of Universities of the Empire. They decided they needed a &quot;bureau of information&quot;. Its affairs would be handled by a committee representing universities at home and abroad. In 1913 the office opened as the Universities Bureau of the British Empire. They incorporated under licence of the Board of Trade in 1919 and received a grant of £5000 to operate an office premises, with the understanding that the universities of the Empire would fund its maintenance. In 1948 the name was changed to Association of Universities of the British Commonwealth, and in 1963 it changed to its current name.

Anastasios Christodoulou was the Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities from 1980 to 1996.

In 1986, Queen Elizabeth II became patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. In 2019, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex became patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, a role which she held until February 2021. King Charles III was announced as the organisation&#x27;s patron in May 2024.

==Membership==
Currently 40 countries from the Commonwealth are represented in the Association.

===Criteria===
Member universities are divided into full and associate categories, with the latter not holding voting rights. Full members must:
* Be legally incorporated and based in the Commonwealth, or have chosen to retain membership in the ACU when the country where they are based left the Commonwealth.
* Be authorised to provide higher education.
* Hold their own degree awarding powers.
* Have at least 250 full time equivalent students, of which over half are studying at degree level.
* Have graduated at least one cohort of students.
The criteria for associate membership are similar, except that the requirement to be able to award their own degrees is replaced by a requirement that their students may be awarded degrees of another institution under a franchise, license or other collaborative agreement, and that the institution whose degrees are being awarded is itself eligible for full membership of the ACU and is located in the Commonwealth.

<doc id="948821" wikidata="Q388418" url="?curid=948821" title="Afrocarpus">
<text>Afrocarpus is a genus of conifer of the family Podocarpaceae. Two to six species are recognized. They are evergreen trees native to Africa. &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; was designated a genus in 1989, when several species formerly classified in &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Nageia&quot; were reclassified.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Afrocarpus gaussenii&quot; was based on a single specimen of a cultivated individual of &quot;Afrocarpus falcatus&quot; in Madagascar. Its distinctive features might have resulted from the conditions of its cultivation. No species of &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; is known to be native to Madagascar.

In a recent treatment of &quot;Afrocarpus&quot;, only two species were recognized; &quot;A. dawei&quot;, &quot;A. gracilior&quot;, and &quot;A. usambarensis&quot; were sunk into &quot;A. falcatus&quot;. The reason for this merger was that &quot;variation across the group appears to be essentially continuous&quot;.

Studies based on anatomical, biogeographical, morphological, and DNA evidence suggest the following relationships:

=== Species ===
== Description ==
&quot;Afrocarpus&quot; are evergreen trees. The individuals of the largest species, &quot;Afrocarpus falcatus&quot;, may reach a height of 60 meters. The thin bark often peels with scale-like plates.

The leaves are simple and flat. The phyllotaxis or leaf arrangement is usually spiral but may be opposite on young plants. The leaves are generally lanceolate in shape and coriaceous in texture. They have a single visible midrib. Stomata are found on both surfaces of the leaf.

&quot;Afrocarpus&quot; are dioecious, with male pollen cones and female seed cones borne on separate individual plants. The cones are short pedunculate and usually develop from axillary buds.

The male pollen cones are narrowly cylindrical and resemble catkins. They grow in small groups of two or three cones. The peduncles are glabrous. Each pollen cone has numerous spirally inserted microsporophylls each with two basal pollen sacs producing bisaccate pollen.

The female seed cones are solitary. Their peduncles may have small scale leaves. The cones consist of several sterile cone scales and one fertile cone scale with just one seed producing ovule. The sterile scales wither as the cone matures, unlike in the closely related genus &quot;Podocarpus&quot; where the scales fuse to form a fleshy receptacle. A part of the scale supporting the ovule develops into a rounded fleshy covering enclosing the seed entirely known as the epimatium. At maturity the epimatium varies in shape from subglobose to elliptic or obovoid and in color from greenish to yellow or brown.

== Distribution ==
As the name intimates, &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; is native to Africa. The species are distributed through the Afromontane forests of eastern and southern Africa, descending to the Indian Ocean coast in South Africa. The genus is native to Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.

The podocarps are associated with the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, where they were characteristic of the cool, moist southern Gondwana flora. Gondwana broke up into the continents of South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica between 160 and 30 million years ago. As Africa drifted north, it became hotter and drier, and the podocarps generally retreated to the cool, moist highlands of eastern and southern Africa.

== Uses ==
In South Africa, this wood is mostly used to make exclusive furniture.

<doc id="948827" wikidata="Q80950" url="?curid=948827" title="Santa Barbara Channel">
<text>The Santa Barbara Channel is a portion of the Southern California Bight and separates the mainland of California from the northern Channel Islands. It is generally south of the city of Santa Barbara, and west of the Oxnard Plain in Ventura County.

It trends east–west, is approximately long and averages about across, becoming narrowest at its easternmost extremity where Anacapa Island is about from the mainland. During the last ice age, the four northern Channel Islands, including Santa Rosa Island, were conjoined into Santa Rosae, a single island that was only five miles (8 km) off the coast.

The islands are visible from the mainland on clear days. Excursion boats cross the channel, taking visitors to watch whales and visit the islands. In the perpendicular (east-west) direction, huge cargo ships and tankers occupy a major shipping lane on their way to or from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

The Channel is the location of numerous oil fields, some of which have substantial reserves. These include the Ellwood, Summerland, Carpinteria offshore and Dos Cuadras fields. In 1969, the Dos Cuadras was the point of origin of a major oil spill, which came about when oil spurted at high pressure through faults and cracks around a zone which had recently been drilled for the first time. Public outrage over the massive environmental damage inflicted by this spill, which covered hundreds of square miles of the channel and fouled beaches from Ventura to Goleta, was a major spur to the budding environmental movement. The Santa Barbara Channel contains the world&#x27;s largest natural oil seepage – Coal Oil Point. Goleta Point is a nearby extension into the channel.

Point Arguello, a headland near the city of Lompoc, was the site of the Honda Point disaster in 1923, in which seven US Navy destroyers ran aground, in the largest peacetime loss of US Navy ships.

==Prehistory==
Prior to the Holocene era sea levels were considerably lower, such that the water width separating the islands from the mainland was much less, making biological colonization as well as human transport across the channel easier. In recent times the Native American Chumash peoples navigated these waters with ease in small watercraft, allowing communication and trade between island and mainland villages. C. Michael Hogan reviews some of the theories of colonization of the rare species Torrey Pine, &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; to the islands, suggesting that it is likely that Chumash peoples carried the initial cones in their Tomols. The pygmy mammoth, an extinct, endemic species, were capable swimmers able to cross the channel and adapt to the island environment by insular dwarfism.

==Risk of ship-whale collisions==

As of at least 2011, a few endangered species of whale (including blue, fin, and humpback) have begun to feed in a new area north of the Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands of the Santa Barbara Channel. These whales are at risk to be struck by ships passing through a shipping lane used to move goods south to Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. About 100 collisions have been documented off of the coast of California since 1982, which includes a rate of about 6 per year today, possibly more due to the difficulty of observing the incidents. Scientists estimate that over 80 endangered whales are killed from vessel collisions off the U.S. west coast each year.

<doc id="948831" wikidata="Q1303007" url="?curid=948831" title="Sudbury Wolves">
<text>The Sudbury Wolves are an Ontario Hockey League (OHL) ice hockey team based in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.

Sudbury has had various hockey teams competing at the junior and senior ice hockey levels of the game known as the &quot;Wolves&quot; (or &quot;Cub Wolves&quot;) nearly every year since around the time of World War I. The current junior franchise came into existence in 1972 when local businessman Mervin &quot;Bud&quot; Burke purchased the Niagara Falls Flyers and relocated the team to Sudbury. 

The current franchise has never won the Memorial Cup, nor has it captured the J. Ross Robertson Cup. Despite this lack of championships, the team has been one of the top development franchises in major junior over its history, with over 120 players drafted in to the National Hockey League (NHL) since 1973. The Wolves have been a central part of Sudbury&#x27;s history for decades, and the team is among the most iconic junior hockey franchises in all of North America.

==History==
Sudbury has had a hockey team known as the Wolves or Cub Wolves nearly every year since around WWI. This team name was informally adopted around 1920 as the &quot;Wolves of the North,&quot; likely a reference to the &quot;voracity and tenacity that typified the play of these men from Sudbury.&quot; 

The Sudbury Cub Wolves junior team began play in the 1920s as a member of the Nickel Belt Hockey League. Under the management of Max Silverman, and coached by Sam Rothschild, the Cub Wolves won the Memorial Cup in 1932 with a roster that featured future NHL players such as Hector &quot;Toe&quot; Blake, Nakina Smith, and Adélard Lafrance. In 1935, the Cub Wolves lost in the Memorial Cup finals to the Winnipeg Monarchs.

A senior team competing under the banner of the Sudbury Wolves, again coached by Silverman, have twice been chosen to be Canada&#x27;s representatives at the Ice Hockey World Championships, winning the title for Canada in 1938 and the silver medal in 1949. An iteration of the Wolves competed as the Eastern Canada entry at the 1954 Allan Cup senior national championship, falling to the Penticton Vees from Western Canada.

A professional Sudbury Wolves team competed in the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL) from 1959 until the league folded in 1963. Players such as Don Cherry, Dave Keon, and Gerry Cheevers suited up for the club during its brief existence.

A junior version of the Wolves emerged in the early 1960s as a member of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association, winning the league championship in 1969 and 1971. 

The OHL - then known as the Ontario Hockey Association and later the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League - arrived in Sudbury in 1972 when local businessman Bud Burke, who was a shareholder in the NOJHL Wolves, purchased the Niagara Falls Flyers from Leighton &quot;Hap&quot; Emms and moved the team to Northern Ontario. In 1975-76, the Wolves, coached by Jerry Toppazzini, who won the Matt Leyden Trophy that season, won Hamilton Spectator Trophy for having the best regular season record in the league with a roster of future NHL players such as Randy Carlyle, Ron Duguay, Rod Schutt, and Mike Foligno. Sudbury advanced to the 1975-76 OHL finals, but lost to the Hamilton Fincups in five games. In 1979, Burke sold the team to a large ownership group headed by future Hockey Canada board of directors chair Joe Drago. From 1973 to 1979, a young Joe Bowen began his broadcasting career covering the Wolves on local Sudbury radio.

The Wolves were the worst performing team in the entire Canadian Hockey League (CHL) in the 1980s, making the playoffs only once and not winning a single postseason game in the process. The club did manage to develop some notable players in this era, such as Pat Verbeek and Jeff Brown. A turning point in franchise history came in 1986 when local businessman Ken Burgess purchased the struggling club and initiated a major organizational turnaround. Sam McMaster was hired as general manager in 1988, and under his direction the team experienced renewed success, winning its first playoff series since 1979-80 when they defeated the Oshawa Generals in the first round of 1991-92 OHL playoffs. McMaster was named OHL Executive of the Year in 1989–90.

From the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, the Wolves experienced mixed success. The club lost in Game 7 of the 1994-95 OHL semi-finals to the Detroit Junior Red Wings. A string of disappointing seasons came to an end in 2006–07 - the Wolves&#x27; 35th anniversary - when the team advanced to the OHL Finals, but ultimately lost to the Plymouth Whalers in six games. Coached by Mike Foligno, the Wolves roster that season featured several future NHL players, namely Marc Staal, Nick Foligno, Adam McQuaid, and Akim Aliu. 

From 2007 to 2016, the team generally struggled, including posting the worst season in franchise history in 2014-2015. In August 2012, the Wolves were sent to represent Canada at the 2012 Junior Club World Cup. Sudbury defeated the Waterloo Black Hawks of the United States Hockey League in the championship finals by a score of 2-0. In 2016, the Burgess family, at the time the longest-serving ownership group in the OHL, sold the team to Sudbury businessman Dario Zulich. Since Zulich&#x27;s takeover, the team has been moving in a positive direction, drafting players such as Quinton Byfield and Ukka-Pekka Luukkonen, and winning a regular season division title in 2019-20.

==Championships==

The current Sudbury Wolves have never won the OHL championship, and have never participated in the Memorial Cup tournament. The team currently holds the third-longest Memorial Cup championship drought in the CHL, and the longest in the OHL.

The team has twice lost in the OHL finals, once in 1976 and again in 2007, winning the 1976 Leyden Trophy and the 2007 Bobby Orr Trophy in the process. The Wolves have twice won the Emms Trophy as the regular season Central Division champions, first in 2000-01 and then in 2019-20.

==Uniforms and logos==

From 1972 to 1988, the Sudbury Wolves&#x27; colours were green, white and gold. The tradition of Sudbury teams wearing green jerseys dates back to the mid-1910s. In 1988–89, Ken Burgess - who famously asked &quot;Who ever heard of a green wolf?&quot; - changed the team&#x27;s colours to blue, white and grey, which happened to be the corporate colours of the business that bore his name. These have been the Wolves&#x27; colours ever since, though the team has occasionally donned throwback green jerseys. The iconic blood-toothed, wily wolf-head logo has subtly evolved since the current franchise&#x27;s inception, but overall has remained relatively unchanged and today is one of the most recognizable logos in the CHL.

There have been various alterations and versions of the team&#x27;s primary jersey design over the years, as well as the introduction of third alternate jerseys, such as black and grey ones that were introduced in the mid-1990s and again in the early-2010s. The team unveiled several special edition jerseys during the 2022-23 season, including a fiftieth anniversary jersey, as well as a limited edition &quot;Shoresy&quot; Sudbury Blueberry Bulldogs themed jersey.

==Arena==
The Sudbury Wolves play their home games at the downtown Sudbury Community Arena, which was constructed in 1951. The City of Greater Sudbury and the Wolves have upgraded the facility over the years, but since the mid-2010s there have been intensified debates about the building of a new arena.

Every time the Wolves score a goal, a taxidermic wolf rolls out on a pulley system from the rafters of the Sudbury Arena in the direction of the opposing team&#x27;s bench. This tradition began in the 1950s when The Sudbury Star donated a stuffed wolf to the local Wolves team as a token of appreciation.

==Media==
In the 2009-10 hockey season, Wolves games were broadcast on CJTK-FM in Sudbury. As of 2018, Wolves games are broadcast on CKLU-FM.

<text>The Nuer language (&quot;Thok Naath&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s language&quot;) is a Nilotic language of the Western Nilotic group. It is spoken by the Nuer people of South Sudan and in western Ethiopia (region of Gambela). The language is very similar to Dinka and Atuot.

The language is written with a Latin-based alphabet. There are several dialects of Nuer, although all share one written standard. For example, final , is pronounced in the Jikany dialect but is dropped in other dialects despite being indicated in the Nuer orthography used by all.

== Phonology ==
A phonological analysis has yet to be done. The following consonants may therefore not all be distinct.

Voicing is not distinctive at the end of a stem, regardless of whether it&#x27;s at the end of a word or utterance. Consonant clusters due to suffixes tend to be simplified.

Dental consonants are written &quot;th dh nh&quot; in the practical orthography. is written &quot;ɣ&quot;.

Vowels may be long or short, modal or breathy voiced. The latter are written with an underscore in the practical orthography, except for &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ä&quot; , where there is no modal-voiced vowel to contrast.

 is rare. (Curly brackets indicate the set of &quot;æ&quot; vowels.) Final is always breathy voiced. There does not appear to be a distinction between short &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ə&quot;. Breathy is pronounced or .

Faust &amp; Grossman did not find strong evidence for lexical or grammatical tone, with a few exceptions such as the 1sg suffix and the plural suffix , which have a rising tone.

== Nominal inflection ==
Nuer nouns inflect for two numbers, singular and plural, and three cases, nominative, genitive and locative. At first glance the inflection is wholly non-systematic and resists description in terms of paradigms: just two suffixes and are used in sixteen different patterns across the stock of nouns, together with different selections from around sixty stem alternations, a situation that Baerman called &quot;paradigmatic chaos&quot;. Further research has identified more constraints and regularities governing Nuer nominal inflection.

There are various methods of plural noun formation in the Nuer language. Generally speaking, plural nouns are formed from singular nouns with the addition of plural markings, and tone changes. Countable nouns, collective nouns, and mass nouns take markings to show a singular state. This means that every noun in the Nuer language can potentially appear in a singular or plural form. Loan words also follow this process.

The most readily identifiable plural formation processes are: suffixation, vowel insertion, phonation, vowel quality change, final consonant alteration, vowel deletion, glide insertion, tone change, vowel lengthening, vowel shortening, suppletion, and zero or null formation, among other processes when the entire language is taken into account.

The most basic plural suffix is the suffix -ni̱. This suffix is used after words that end in sounds other than [l] and [r]. Words that end in [l] and [r] take the suffix -i̱. However, apart from this suffix there are other methods to form plural nouns.

==Sample phrases==
Nuer&quot;: &quot; &quot;Naath dial diethɛ kɛ a lɔr kä päärkɛ kɛ ciaŋ malä a mäni cuŋkiɛn. Tekɛ kɛ ca̱r kɛnɛ nhök ti de lät kɛ raan kɛ dämaan a gɔa&quot;.

English:&quot; &quot; “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood”.

&quot;(Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)&quot;

==Writing system==
The alphabet of Nuer uses 39 distinct letters, shown below in uppercase (majuscule) and lowercase (minuscule) styles.
A line under a vowel, like a̱, means that it is pronounced with breathy voice. The vowels ä, u, and final i are always breathy. A doubled vowel, like in the word &quot;raan&quot; (person), means that vowel is long. Nuer does have tone, but tone-based contrasts are not common.

=== History ===
The writing system was adopted in 1928 with minor changes being added over the history of the language. Both the Dinka and the Nuer agreed that their languages were so different that they could never share written languages, but they did come up with several common principles.
* final interdental consonants would always be represented as th.
* all voiceless alveolo-palatal consonants would be represented as c.
* the finalized Nuer alphabet consists of the following characters, which are equivalent to the phonemes of the Nuer language: d, k, l, m, n, p, t, w, g, j, r, y, ŋ, ny, th, dh, nh, ɣ, c, a, e, i, o, u, ö

<text>Francis Gregory Stafford (February 9, 1948 – October 10, 2018) was an American game designer, publisher, and practitioner of shamanism.

Stafford is most famous as the creator of the fantasy world of Glorantha, but he was also a prolific games designer. He was designer of &quot;Pendragon&quot;, he was co-designer of the &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and &quot;HeroQuest&quot; role-playing systems, founder of the role-playing game companies Chaosium and Issaries, designer of the &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot;, &quot;Nomad Gods&quot;, &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Knights&quot; and &quot;&quot; board games, and co-designer of the &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; computer game.

==Gaming industry career==
===1970s: Chaosium ===
Greg Stafford began wargaming with &quot;U-Boat&quot; by Avalon Hill, and in 1966 as a freshman at Beloit College he began to create the fantasy world of Glorantha. After rejection from a publisher, Stafford created &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; set in Glorantha, and after three different companies were unable to publish the game, he founded Chaosium. He took part of the name from his home, being near the Oakland Coliseum, and the other part of the name from &quot;chaos.&quot;

&quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; (1975) became the first game published by Chaosium, and was also Stafford&#x27;s first professional game. He designed the board game &quot;Nomad Gods&quot;. He also designed the wargames &quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Knights&quot; (1978).

Stafford wanted the world of Glorantha to be part of an original role-playing game; this ultimately resulted in &quot;RuneQuest&quot; (1978) by Steve Perrin, which was set in Glorantha.

Stafford and Lynn Willis simplified the &quot;RuneQuest&quot; rules into the 16-page &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; (1980). He designed the miniatures game &quot;Merlin&quot;. Stafford considers his Arthurian chivalric role-playing game &quot;King Arthur Pendragon&quot; (1985) his masterpiece. He co-designed the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; role-playing game (1986).

Stafford designed the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; roleplaying game (1989), which featured a basis in storytelling along with other innovations. He decided to produce a fiction line for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; after he realized that many Lovecraft fans in the early 1990s had never actually read any fiction by Lovecraft but were only familiar with him through the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; game. Stafford co-designed the computer game &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; (1999).

===1998–2000s: Issaries ===
Stafford left Chaosium in 1998, taking all of the rights for Glorantha, and founded the game company Issaries.

Stafford asked Robin Laws to design a new role-playing game based on Glorantha, which became known as &quot;Hero Wars&quot;, published in 2000 as the first fully professional product for Issaries. Stafford published the second edition of &quot;Hero Wars&quot; in 2003 using the name he preferred &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, as Milton Bradley allowed the trademark on the name to lapse. Stafford moved to Mexico in 2004, so production from Issaries ended at that time.

===Later years===

Hasbro let the &quot;RuneQuest&quot; trademark lapse, so Stafford picked up the rights to the game and licensed it to Mongoose Publishing to release a new edition in 2006. White Wolf obtained the rights to &quot;Pendragon&quot;, and published its fifth edition in 2005, while their ArtHaus imprint released &quot;The Great Pendragon Campaign&quot; (2006), in which Stafford laid out the huge role-playing campaign taking place between the years 485 to 566. Nocturnal Games then picked up the rights to &quot;Pendragon&quot;, and Stafford worked with them to produce a 5.1 edition of &quot;Pendragon&quot; (2010).

He moved from Berkeley, California, to Arcata, California, in 2007, having lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for some years.

In June 2015, Stafford and Sandy Petersen returned to Chaosium Inc., with Stafford taking the positions of President and CEO.

Stafford died at his home in Arcata on October 10, 2018, at the age of 70.

==Glorantha==
Greg Stafford&#x27;s interest in roleplaying and gaming originated in his adolescent fascination with mythology. During his adolescent years he read anything he could find on the subject, and when he exhausted the libraries, he started to write his own stories in his freshman year at Beloit College, in 1966. This was the start of the world of Glorantha.

Stafford&#x27;s 1974 board game &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; had featured the violent struggle between several cultures in the Dragon Pass region of Glorantha. The heart of the game was a conflict between the barbarian Kingdom of Sartar and the invading Lunar Empire, a theme which has remained central to Gloranthan publications since then.

As Stafford was founding his company Chaosium, the game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (and the concept of tabletop role-playing games) was gaining great popularity. Role-players were keen to use the &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; setting in such games. So Chaosium published &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, written by &quot;Steve Perrin, Ray Turney, and Friends&quot;. Stafford left Chaosium in 1998.

For some years, Stafford slowly wrote several novels set in Glorantha. Novels that he is known to have been working on are &quot;Harmast&#x27;s Saga&quot;, &quot;Arkat&#x27;s Saga&quot;, and his &quot;Lunar novel&quot;.

He was one of the designers on the Glorantha-based video game &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot;.

==Shamanism-related works==

Stafford was a practicing shaman and member of the board of directors of &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Drum&quot;, a journal of experiential shamanism. He had some short articles of Arthurian interest published. Stafford lived in Mexico for 18 months, tutoring English as a foreign language, and exploring places of archeological and shamanic interest.

==Honors and reception==
Fantasy author David A. Hargrave pays homage to Stafford in the Arduin series of supplements, the most widely known example of this being the Stafford&#x27;s Star Bridge 9th-Level mage spell (Arduin I, page 41).

Stafford was inducted in the Origins Award hall of fame in 1987.

In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Greg Stafford one of The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons, &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming.&quot;

Stafford won the Diana Jones Award in 2007, for &quot;The Great Pendragon Campaign&quot;, published by White Wolf and in 2015 for &quot;Guide to Glorantha&quot;, coauthored with Jeff Richard and Sandy Petersen and published by Moon Design Publications

He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being featured as the king of hearts in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2011 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

<text>Michael Christopher White (born June 28, 1970) is an American filmmaker and actor. He has won numerous awards, including the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award for the 2000 film &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot;, which he wrote and starred in. He has written the screenplays for films such as &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003) and has directed several films that he has written, such as &quot;Brad&#x27;s Status&quot; (2017). He was a co-creator, executive producer, writer, director and actor on the HBO series &quot;Enlightened&quot;. White is also known for his appearances on reality television, competing on two seasons of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and later becoming a contestant and runner-up on &quot;&quot;. He created, writes and directs the ongoing HBO satirical comedy anthology series &quot;The White Lotus&quot;, for which he has won three Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
White was born in Pasadena, California. He is the son of Lyla Lee (née Loehr), a fundraising executive, and former executive director of the Pasadena Playhouse, and James Melville &quot;Mel&quot; White, a former speechwriter and ghostwriter for Religious Right figures such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. His father came out as gay in 1994 and became an activist. Due to his father&#x27;s religious background, White grew up in a modest household in a conservative Christian community. He attended Polytechnic School which he thought was a &quot;very conservative country-club school&quot;. Later he went to Wesleyan University, where he met writing partner, Zak Penn. Penn convinced him to move back to Los Angeles, and helped him to get work soon after graduating.

==Career==
Although White and Penn&#x27;s writing partnership ended a few years later due to their different sensibilities, they remained on good terms, and White credits him with getting him into Hollywood&#x27;s social circles. White was a writer and producer on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; and wrote and acted in the films &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Orange County&quot;, &quot;School of Rock&quot; and &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;. He also had a role in the 2004 remake of &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, and the 2008 film &quot;Smother&quot;. &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot;, in which White portrayed a manchild who stalks his childhood friend, was named the best film of 2000 by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeff Bridges called White&#x27;s turn in &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; &quot;the performance of the decade&quot;.

He frequently collaborates with actor–writer Jack Black on films. Together they formed the production company Black and White, which closed in 2006. White is not a fan of classic rock, but he wrote &quot;School of Rock&quot; specifically so Black could perform his own favorite rock music.

White made his directorial debut with the self-penned &quot;Year of the Dog&quot; at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. He was a member of the US Dramatic Jury at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

Laura Dern brought White into a project with HBO which became the series &quot;Enlightened&quot; that premiered on October 10, 2011. Dern&#x27;s character, Amy Jellicoe, goes to a Hawaiian retreat after her professional life publicly implodes, and is introduced to meditation. White himself had suffered an on-the-job meltdown while running an earlier television series, and incorporated elements of that experience, as well as his own exploration of Buddhist meditation, into the new series&#x27; plot. White wrote the pilot and all the episodes in the first and second seasons.

White is a credited writer on &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot;; he spent three weeks with the film&#x27;s screenwriters and helped with the structure of the script. For this project he received a Golden Raspberry Award. He wrote and directed the 2017 film &quot;Brad&#x27;s Status.&quot;

In 2021, White created, wrote and directed &quot;The White Lotus&quot;, a satirical limited series for HBO.

In February 2022, it was announced White would write two upcoming animated films for Universal Pictures and Illumination: the original comedy &quot;Migration&quot;, released on December 22, 2023, and the fourth installment in the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; franchise, which was released on July 3, 2024.

===&quot;The Amazing Race&quot;===
He appeared on the fourteenth season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; along with his father Mel. They lasted for seven legs before being eliminated in sixth place in Phuket, Thailand. Mel and Mike returned to compete in &quot;The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business&quot;, where they were the second team eliminated in Japan after they both developed hypothermia.

===&quot;Survivor&quot;===
White was a contestant on &quot;&quot;, as a member of the Goliath tribe, then to reshuffled Jabeni tribe and the merged Kalokalo tribe. He made it to Day 39 and received three jury votes, finishing in second place behind the winner, Nick Wilson.

White said he had been a big fan of the show, and because of his connections had developed a friendship with the show&#x27;s host Jeff Probst, providing the host suggestions towards improving the show. For instance, Probst stated that it was White who discouraged him from bringing back Redemption Island for &quot;&quot;. At some point White decided to start trying out to be a participant of the show, but he failed to be picked over what he believed was a concern of having &quot;sloppy seconds&quot; from other reality television programs. White noted that once he was selected, he had had no other conversations with Probst until the game was concluded.

==Personal life==
White is a vegan and lived in Santa Monica with his partner, Josh. He also owns a house in Kauai. He is openly bisexual.

In a 2025 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, White said that due to &quot;The White Lotus&quot; taking over his schedule his relationship had fallen apart.

<text>The Greed of Man is a Hong Kong television series first broadcast on TVB Jade in 1992. The story, spanning three decades from the 1970s to the 1990s in Hong Kong and Taiwan, addresses various social and financial phenomena of the times, from triad violence to corruption in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It featured a top roster cast, including veteran TVB actors Adam Cheng and Damian Lau and award-winning actor Sean Lau. The series is also well remembered for a Hong Kong stock market cultural phenomenon called the &quot;Ting Hai effect&quot;. In 2022, the drama was selected as one of ten classic TVB dramas being honoured for a new Youku and TVB programme.

==Plot==
This is the first modern-age TV drama in Hong Kong history, where the story is told in reverse chronological order &quot;In medias res&quot;. The story starts at present time (in reality, the future: 7 June 1994), where The Day of Big Miracle happened, where the stock market rebounded after the market became volatile and crashed for the weekend. After the stock market stopped trading for the weekend, the Tings make the wrong bet and their entire fortune is wiped out, compounded by ending up in billions of dollars in debt. Ting Hai forces his sons to commit suicide by jumping off from the top of the stock exchange building before following suit himself, at the beginning, Ting Hai&#x27;s fate was unknown.

===1960-1970s===
Ting Hai and Fong Chun-sun were childhood friends. Ting is a stubborn, uneducated and pathologically self-righteous brute who imagines himself to be a living &quot;kong-woo&quot; hero, while Fong is an honest, cultured and refined leader of the Asian Stock Exchange. Fong is pressured by some of the most powerful and corrupt bureaucrats in Hong Kong to control the stock market. Immigration officers, police chiefs and government officials all attempt to cash in. Fong manipulates the market such that no one could touch him. The stock guru Yip Tin describes the event as a battle to seize control of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;.

Fong develops strong feelings for Ting&#x27;s girlfriend Lo Wei-ling, and becomes Ting&#x27;s rival for her affection. In a fit of fury over Lo&#x27;s disaffection, Ting cripples Fong, and later, during an ill-advised attempt at reconciliation, kills him. Without Fong&#x27;s moderating influence, the 1973 stock market crash forces many people into extreme poverty, including Fong and his family. Stock manipulation is one justification for the creation of the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in February 1974.

===1980s===
Ting Hai flees to Taiwan, where his unabatedly violent behaviour lands him a 14-year prison sentence. Back in Hong Kong, Ting&#x27;s four sons manage to build a powerful triad in their father&#x27;s absence. The four brothers blame the Fong family for separating them from their father, and they harass them unrelentingly. The eldest son, Ting How-hai, replays his father&#x27;s relationship with Lo Wei-ling on one of the Fong sisters, and is driven to violence when she rejects him. Ting Hai returns to Hong Kong and is convicted of murder, but is pardoned using a forged certification of terminal illness. All of Fong Chun-sun&#x27;s three daughters are brutally killed, while Fong&#x27;s only son, Fong Chin-bok, manages to survive and escape to Taiwan. With help from his two girlfriends, Fong strikes a fortune by gambling on the stock market (not by investing, but via an indirect gambling method) and returns to Hong Kong to avenge his family. At the same time, the Ting family&#x27;s wealth and power have increased to incredible proportions via the stock market due to sheer luck in the 1987 bear market.

===1990s===
The final showdown between the Tings and Fongs is inspired by the backdrop of a war in the Middle East in 1994. Fong Chin-bok&#x27;s investment company faces the Ting family in a winner-takes-all, last-man-standing stock market epic battle. To raise the stakes, the Tings are financed by international criminal syndicates. Fong wins the support of three of Hong Kong&#x27;s wealthiest tycoons, who want to return the favour as they built their financial empires with help from Fong&#x27;s father back in the 1960s. The stock market rises and falls correspondingly with news of American forces entering or withdrawing from the war. Eventually, the Tings make the wrong bet and their entire fortune is wiped out, compounded by ending up in billions of dollars in debt. Ting Hai forces his sons to commit suicide by jumping off from the top of the stock exchange building before following suit himself, but he survives and spends the rest of his life in prison.

==Reception ==
The first episode of &quot;The Greed of Man&quot; starts &quot;in medias res&quot; with Ting Hai hurling his four adult sons from the top of the stock exchange building after losing his fortunes in the stock market. Upon the show&#x27;s initial run in 1992, the audience found the scene so disturbing that the resulting torrent of complaints forced TVB to make several adjustments to the programme. The drama was moved from the 7 o&#x27;clock timeslot to the 9 o&#x27;clock timeslot after the first week of airing, and several sensitive scenes were cut. Scenes that have been edited out include Ting Hai trying to wash blood off his hands with his own urine, the rape and suicide of Fong Man, and the triads throwing the remnants of the Fong family down from the roof. No domestic version, including later reruns and VHS and DVD releases, contains the full unedited &quot;The Greed of Man&quot;; however, the North American VHS version, being shipped before the programme was aired and edited in Hong Kong, is considered to be the complete uncut version.

The April 2015 rerun, aired after a massive spike in the Hang Seng Index, drew an average of 360,000 viewers, a record for late night television in Hong Kong. The controversial opening scene itself drew 410,000 viewers. Young viewers watching the classic soap opera for the first time dubbed it a &quot;divine drama&quot; (神劇, meaning a highly acclaimed drama) on social media. The rerun won the &quot;Most Popular Classic Drama Serial&quot; award in the 2015 TVB Anniversary Awards.

==Legacy==

===Ting Hai effect===

The series, which centers on the bustling stock market during the early 1990s, has been studied by international stockbrokers for its peculiar effect on the global stock market trend. A phenomenon is observed, that whenever a television drama starring Adam Cheng, the actor for the character Ting Hai, is aired, the stock market will drop for unexplainable reasons. In 1992 when the series made its debut, the Hong Kong stock market dropped by 1200 points in one month. In 2009 when Cheng starred in &quot;The King of Snooker&quot;, the Hang Seng Index fell by 600 points again.

=== The actual &quot;Day of Miracle&quot; ===
Because the ending date of the drama was set in the future, in 1994, when it did happen, the stock market was also in the middle of a skid.

The &quot;Days of Miracle&quot; happened of sorts on 4 January 1994, Heng Seng Index closed on a then-historical high of 12,201, by 23 January, it fell to 6967.5, almost halving the value. On 7 June 1994, the day of the fictional miracle, Heng Seng Index closed at 9,247.9, down 135.1 from the Friday before (4 June, at 9,383).

===Others===
Sean Lau&#x27;s character Fong Chin-bok was involved in a love triangle with Yuen Mui and Long Kei-man, played respectively by Vivian Chow and Amy Kwok. Fong married Yuen eventually in the series before she was presumed dead from her heart conditions, but in reality, Lau dated Kwok and married her in 1998, and they were encouraged by Chow to become a couple after the filming. Amy Kwok has not been acting since 2006.

Yammie Lam, who played Lo Wei-ling, became mentally unstable like her character in the series. The Hong Kong media has since speculated that she has been possessed and cannot get out of her role. In September 1998, Lam lost control of her car while driving at Repulse Bay, and was admitted into hospital. Her mental illness was announced in the following year. She alleged that she was sexually harassed by two renowned seniors in the industry, and was found dead on 3 November 2018, having died a few days prior from injuries incurred from slipping in the bathroom in her flat in Stanley, Hong Kong.

Future film director Derek Kwok was so inspired by a quote spoken by the actor Law Lok-lam in episode 8 that he quit his original job as a graphic designer and started to study screenwriting in order to become a director.

===Sequel===
In 2000, TVB&#x27;s rival station ATV produced &quot;Divine Retribution&quot;, as a sequel to &quot;The Greed of Man&quot;. Both its Chinese and English titles, as well as its characters, were modified to avoid association with &quot;The Greed of Man&quot;. It was directed by Wai Ka-fai and featured Adam Cheng and Sean Lau.

<doc id="948874" wikidata="Q638881" url="?curid=948874" title="1992–93 NHL season">
<text>The 1992–93 NHL season was the 76th regular season of the National Hockey League. Each player wore a patch on their jersey throughout the season to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup. The league expanded to 24 teams with the addition of the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Under the new labour agreement signed following the 1992 NHL strike, each team began playing 84 games per season, including two games at neutral sites.

The Montreal Canadiens won their league-leading 24th Cup by defeating the Los Angeles Kings four games to one. This remains the last time that a Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup.

It proved, at the time, to be the highest-scoring regular season in NHL history, as a total of 7,311 goals were scored over 1,008 games for an average of 7.25 per game. Twenty of the twenty-four teams scored three goals or more per game, and only two teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks, allowed fewer than three goals per game. Only 68 shutouts were recorded during the regular season. A record twenty-one players reached the 100-point plateau, while a record fourteen players reached the 50-goal plateau—both records still stand through the 2022–23 season.

Through the halfway point in this season Mario Lemieux was in the process of putting together one of the most historic seasons in NHL history; being on pace to challenge both the 92 goal and 215 point records of Wayne Gretzky when he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. Lemieux still went on to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophies, despite every other player in the top five in league scoring playing a complete 84 game season to his 60 games. He also finished with the third highest point per game average in a season in league history.

==League business==
===Expansion===
This season saw two new clubs join the league: the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Senators were the second Ottawa-based NHL franchise (see Ottawa Senators (original)) and brought professional hockey back to Canada&#x27;s capital, while the Tampa Bay franchise (headed by Hockey Hall of Fame brothers Phil and Tony Esposito) strengthened the NHL&#x27;s presence in the American Sun Belt, which had first started with the birth of the Los Angeles Kings in 1967. The 1992 NHL expansion draft was held on June 18 to fill the rosters of the Senators and the Lightning.

This was the final season of the Wales and Campbell Conferences, and the Adams, Patrick, Norris, and Smythe divisions. Both the conferences and the divisions would be renamed to reflect geography rather than the league&#x27;s history for the following season. This was also the last year (until the 2013 realignment) in which the playoff structure bracketed and seeded teams by division; they would be bracketed and seeded by conference (as in the NBA) for 1993–94.

===Entry draft===
The 1992 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 20 at the Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec. Roman Hamrlik was selected first overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Bettman named first NHL Commissioner===
In the summer of 1992, NHL owners replaced NHL President John Ziegler with Gil Stein on an interim basis. Ziegler had held the position for 15 years, but owners became unhappy following the 1992 NHL strike. On February 1, 1993, Gary Bettman became the first NHL Commissioner, with the office originally created as &quot;senior&quot; to Stein&#x27;s position as NHL President. Working towards labour peace was among the tasks handed to Bettman when the owners hired him. After Stein&#x27;s tenure expired on July 1, 1993, the President&#x27;s office was merged into the Commissioner&#x27;s.

===Centennial celebration of the Stanley Cup===
All teams wore a commemorative patch this year celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup.

===Rule changes===
*Instigating a fight results in a game misconduct penalty.
*Substitutions disallowed for coincidental minor penalties when teams are at full strength, reversing a rule passed for the 1985–86 season. 
*Minor penalty for diving introduced.

==Arena changes==
* The expansion Ottawa Senators moved into Ottawa Civic Centre.
* The expansion Tampa Bay Lightning moved into Expo Hall in East Lake-Orient Park, Florida.

==Regular season==
===Neutral site games===
As a part of the 1992 strike settlement, the regular season was expanded from 82 to 84 games per team. The NHL and Bruce McNall&#x27;s Multivision Marketing and Public Relations Co. organized the additional 24 regular season games in 15 cities that did not have a franchise, providing as a litmus test for future expansion. Four of the cities chosen – Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas and Miami – were eventually the sites of expansion or relocations, and although neither Cleveland nor Cincinnati received NHL franchises, there would be one placed in Columbus, located halfway between the two cities. Two arenas that hosted neutral-site games had hosted NHL teams before: Atlanta&#x27;s The Omni (Atlanta Flames) and Cleveland&#x27;s Richfield Coliseum (Cleveland Barons).

The Hartford-St. Louis game was originally scheduled to be played on December 29, 1992, in Birmingham, Alabama.

===All-Star Game===
The All-Star Game was held on February 6, 1993, at the Montreal Forum, the home of the Montreal Canadiens.

===Highlights===
Teemu Selanne of the Winnipeg Jets shattered the rookie scoring record by scoring 76 goals and 56 assists for 132 points this season. He was named the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL Rookie of the Year, and his goals and points marks remain the NHL rookie records .

The New York Rangers missed the playoffs. This marked the first time since the President&#x27;s Trophy had been introduced that the previous season&#x27;s top team missed the next year&#x27;s playoffs.

For the first time in his NHL career, Wayne Gretzky did not finish in the top three in scoring. A back injury limited Gretzky to 45 games in which he scored 65 points.

The Pittsburgh Penguins set a new NHL record, winning 17 consecutive games. The streak ending with the regular season.

===Final standings===
&quot;Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, Pts = Points&quot;

==Playoffs==
===Bracket===
The top four teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. In each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). In the division semifinals, the fourth seeded team in each division played against the division winner from their division. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. The two winning teams from each division&#x27;s semifinals then met in the division finals. The two division winners of each conference then played in the conference finals. The two conference winners then advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals.

==Events and milestones==
* Manon Rhéaume became the first woman to play for a major sports league in North America as she tended goal for the Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition game on September 23, 1992, against the St. Louis Blues.
* The Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning were two new teams to be added to the league, bringing the league to 24 teams, one-third of which were Canadian teams, as they comprised eight of the twenty-four teams. Both teams would win their opening games and briefly sit atop their respective Divisions, which led to Harry Neale jokingly proclaiming before the end of Ottawa&#x27;s first win that both the Senators and Lightning would reach the Stanley Cup finals in May.
* October 1992: Gil Stein named NHL President.
* February 1993: Gary Bettman named NHL Commissioner.
* Record set for most 100-point scorers and most 50-goal scorers in one season.
* February 10, 1993: In a 13–1 drubbing of the San Jose Sharks, Calgary Flames goaltender Jeff Reese set NHL records for most points and most assists by a goaltender in one game, with three.
* The 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs marked the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup.
*Pittsburgh Penguins set the NHL record for longest win streak at 17 games. Conversely, the San Jose Sharks tied the NHL record for longest losing streak at 17 games.

===Major transactions===
*June 30, 1992: Eric Lindros traded from Quebec to Philadelphia for Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Mike Ricci, Kerry Huffman, Steve Duchesne, &quot;future considerations&quot; (eventually became enforcer Chris Simon), two first-round draft picks and US$15 million. One of the draft picks was used by the Nordiques to select goaltender Jocelyn Thibault, the other was traded twice and ultimately used by the Washington Capitals to select Nolan Baumgartner.

===Prince of Wales Conference===
===Clarence Campbell Conference===
==Broadcasting==
===Canada===
This was the fifth season of the league&#x27;s Canadian national broadcast rights deals with TSN and &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on CBC. Saturday night regular season games continued to air on CBC, while TSN televised selected weeknight games. Coverage of the Stanley Cup playoffs was primarily on CBC, with TSN airing first round all-U.S. series.

===United States===
ESPN signed an agreement for U.S. national broadcast rights, replacing SportsChannel America. However, SportsChannel America contended that its contract with the NHL gave them the right to match third-party offers for television rights for the 1992–93 season. Thus the network accused the NHL of violating a nonbinding clause, arguing that it had been deprived of its contractual right of first refusal for the 1992–93 season. Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court justice Shirley Fingerwood would deny SportsChannel America&#x27;s request for an injunction against the NHL. Upholding that opinion, the appellate court found the agreement on which SportsChannel based its argument to be &quot;too imprecise and ambiguous&quot; and ruled that SportsChannel failed to show irreparable harm.

ESPN&#x27;s weekly regular season games were generally broadcast on Wednesdays and Fridays. ESPN also had Sunday games between the NFL and baseball seasons.

ESPN&#x27;s deal did not include the All-Star Game; NBC instead televised it for the fourth consecutive season.

Through a brokered deal, sister broadcast network ABC televised five weekly playoff telecasts on Sunday afternoons starting on April 18 and ending on May 16. The first three weeks were regional coverage of various first and second round games, while the fourth and fifth games were nationally televised second round and Conference final contests, respectively. This marked the first time that playoff National Hockey League games were broadcast on American network television since 1975. ESPN then televised selected first and second round games, the rest of the Conference finals, and the Stanley Cup Finals.

Camborne covers an area of 0.84 km², including a land area of 0.84 km². Most of the suburb is a short walk from Porirua Harbour, and many homes have views of the harbour, neighbouring hills, the sea and Mana Island.

==History==

Camborne was developed over a 35-year period from the 1960s, initially by an investment company headed by a Mr Arthur Cornish. It was named after Camborne, Cornwall. Most of its street names are of Cornish origin, but its main street, Pope Street, is named after William George Pope (known as Bob), who was an honoured former resident of the adjoining suburb of Plimmerton.

The Paremata Residents Association includes members from Camborne.

<doc id="948888" wikidata="Q471267" url="?curid=948888" title="Sortino ratio">
<text>The Sortino ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment asset, portfolio, or strategy. It is a modification of the Sharpe ratio but penalizes only those returns falling below a user-specified target or required rate of return, while the Sharpe ratio penalizes both upside and downside volatility equally. Though both ratios measure an investment&#x27;s risk-adjusted return, they do so in significantly different ways that will frequently lead to differing conclusions as to the true nature of the investment&#x27;s return-generating efficiency.

The Sortino ratio is used as a way to compare the risk-adjusted performance of programs with differing risk and return profiles. In general, risk-adjusted returns seek to normalize the risk across programs and then see which has the higher return unit per risk.

== Definition ==
The ratio formula_1 is calculated as

: formula_2 ,

where formula_3 is the asset or portfolio average realized return, formula_4 is the target or required rate of return for the investment strategy under consideration (originally called the minimum acceptable return &quot;MAR&quot;), and formula_5 is the target semi-deviation (the square root of target semi-variance), termed downside deviation. formula_5 is expressed in percentages and therefore allows for rankings in the same way as standard deviation.

An intuitive way to view downside risk is the annualized standard deviation of returns below the target. Another is the square root of the probability-weighted squared below-target returns. The squaring of the below-target returns has the effect of penalizing failures at a quadratic rate. This is consistent with observations made on the behavior of individual decision making under uncertainty.

: formula_7

Here

formula_5 = downside deviation or (commonly known in the financial community) &quot;downside risk&quot; (by extension, formula_9 = downside variance),

formula_4 = the annual target return, originally termed the minimum acceptable return &quot;MAR&quot;,

formula_11 = the random variable representing the return for the distribution of annual returns formula_12, and

formula_12 = the distribution for the annual returns, e.g., the log-normal distribution.

For the reasons provided below, this &quot;continuous&quot; formula is preferred over a simpler &quot;discrete&quot; version that determines the standard deviation of below-target periodic returns taken from the return series.
# The continuous form permits all subsequent calculations to be made using annual returns, the natural way for investors to specify their investment goals. The discrete form requires monthly returns for there to be sufficient data points to make a meaningful calculation, which in turn requires converting the annual target into a monthly target. This significantly affects the amount of risk that is identified. For example, a goal of earning 1% in every month of one year results in a greater risk than the seemingly equivalent goal of earning 12% in one year.
# A second reason for strongly preferring the continuous form to the discrete form has been proposed by Sortino &amp; Forsey (1996):

&quot;Before we make an investment, we don&#x27;t know what the outcome will be... After the investment is made, and we want to measure its performance, all we know is what the outcome was, not what it could have been. To cope with this uncertainty, we assume that a reasonable estimate of the range of possible returns, as well as the probabilities associated with estimation of those returns...In statistical terms, the shape of [this] uncertainty is called a probability distribution. In other words, looking at just the discrete monthly or annual values does not tell the whole story.&quot;

Using the observed points to create a distribution is a staple of conventional performance measurement. For example, monthly returns are used to calculate a fund&#x27;s mean and standard deviation. Using these values and the properties of the normal distribution, we can make statements such as the likelihood of losing money (even though no negative returns may actually have been observed) or the range within which two-thirds of all returns lies (even though the specific returns identifying this range have not necessarily occurred). Our ability to make these statements comes from the process of assuming the continuous form of the normal distribution and certain of its well-known properties.

In post-modern portfolio theory an analogous process is followed.
#Observe the monthly returns.
#Fit a distribution that permits asymmetry to the observations.
#Annualize the monthly returns, making sure the shape characteristics of the distribution are retained.
#Apply integral calculus to the resultant distribution to calculate the appropriate statistics.

As a caveat, some practitioners have fallen into the habit of using discrete periodic returns to compute downside risk. This method is conceptually and operationally incorrect and negates the foundational statistic of post-modern portfolio theory as developed by Brian M. Rom and Frank A. Sortino.

==Usage==

The Sortino ratio is used to score a portfolio&#x27;s risk-adjusted returns relative to an investment target using downside risk. This is analogous to the Sharpe ratio, which scores risk-adjusted returns relative to the risk-free rate using standard deviation. When return distributions are near symmetrical and the target return is close to the distribution median, these two measure will produce similar results. As skewness increases and targets vary from the median, results can be expected to show dramatic differences.

The Sortino ratio can also be used in trading. For example, whenever you want to get a performance metric for your trading strategy in an asset, you can compute the Sortino ratio to compare your strategy performance with any other strategy. 

Practitioners who use a lower partial Standard Deviation (LPSD) instead of a standard deviation also tend to use the Sortino ratio instead of the Sharpe ratio.

<text>Nefilim was a gothic metal studio project formed by Carl McCoy with John &quot;Capachino&quot; Carter in 1992 after the disbanding of Fields of the Nephilim. It featured McCoy on vocals and keyboards and John Carter on bass, guitars and drums. The album title track &quot;Zoon&quot; was written during this period, as were now-famed demos including &quot;Red Harvest777&quot;, &quot;Chaochracy&quot; and &quot;Subsanity (Sensorium)&quot;. After a year Carter and McCoy parted company, and McCoy went on to recruit Paul Miles on guitar, Simon Rippin on drums and Cian Houchin on bass. 

The lineup released one album, &quot;Zoon&quot; (1996), which was more influenced by death metal and industrial metal than McCoy&#x27;s previous releases with the Fields of the Nephilim, though similar themes of mysticism are prevalent, seen in songs like &quot;Pazuzu (Black Rain)&quot;, which refers to the Assyro-Babylonian god also known as &quot;king of the demons&quot;. 

Rippin and Miles would later go on to form Sensorium, while Houchin would go on to form Saints of Eden. McCoy and Carter would later re-establish Fields of the Nephilim as a living entity which still performs today.
== Members ==
* Carl McCoy – vocals, keyboards (1992–1996)
* John &quot;Capachino&quot; Carter – bass, guitars and drums (1992–1993)
* Paul Miles – guitar (1993–1996)
* Simon Rippin – drums (1993–1996)
* Cian Houchin – bass (1993–1996)

== Discography ==
=== &quot;Zoon&quot; ===

Zoon, Nefilim&#x27;s only studio album, was released in April 1996 by Beggars Banquet Records (Catalogue number BEGA172). The album saw a move away from the rich soundscapes that characterised earlier works from Fields of the Nephilim towards a darker, more industrial/death metal sound. McCoy has stated that the album was in development hell for several years, due to restrictions from the record label. The album is dedicated to Scarlett McCoy, Carl McCoy&#x27;s daughter.

A music video was created for &quot;Penetration&quot;, and the song was later covered by Polish band Behemoth on their EP &quot;Slaves Shall Serve&quot;.

The album is a concept album, and while McCoy remained largely silent about the themes, one possible explanation is that the story revolves around the Watchers and the Book of Enoch. The word &quot;zoon&quot; is derived from Greek, meaning &quot;living creature&quot; or &quot;beast&quot;.

<text>The Aurora Islands was a group of three phantom islands first reported in 1762 by the Spanish merchant ship &quot;Aurora&quot; while sailing from Lima to Cadiz. The officers of the &quot;Aurora&quot; reported sighting them again in 1774. The Spanish ship &quot;San Miguel&quot; fixed their location at 52°37&#x27;S, 47°49&#x27;W. On 20 February 1794, they were sighted again by a Spanish survey ship, the corvette &quot;Atrevida&quot;, which as part of the Alejandro Malaspina circumnavigation had been sent to confirm them. Their reported location was approximately halfway between the Falkland Islands and South Georgia at . The latitude is considered perfect; the longitude was based on the meridian of the astronomical observatory, San Fernando, Cádiz. The islands were last reportedly sighted in 1856, but continued to appear on maps of the South Atlantic until the 1870s.

It is possible that the Aurora islands were &quot;discovered&quot; by Amerigo Vespucci in his 1501/1502 voyage with a Portuguese expedition. In his &quot;Lettera&quot; of 1504, his most detailed note, he states that he left the coast of Brazil from Cabo Frío and followed the path of the Sirocco south-east covering 500 leagues (about 3000 kilometres) by sea down to 50°S or 52°S. The probability is confirmed by Vice-Admiral Ernesto Basilico in &quot;The Third Voyage of Amerigo Vespucci&quot; (Buenos Aires, 1967) and by Lt-Cdr Barreiro Meiro (&quot;General Journal of Navy&quot;, October 1968, Madrid). At latitude 52°S Vespucci discovered an island 20 leagues (118 kilometres) long:

The only large islands in 52°S latitude were the as then undiscovered Falklands, but Vespucci&#x27;s description does not fit the Falklands, whose low-lying coasts are full of coves for shelter and are not &quot;wild&quot;. 3 April is not winter but the first month of autumn and a night of fifteen hours duration implies a mysterious shift of the sun; furthermore, sailors would not find the cold intolerable at that season of the year in 52°S. The suggestion of aberrant conditions accompanying a fierce storm is typical of a number of phantom islands, particularly Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island.

Raymond Ramsay suggests several possible explanations for the persistent reports of sightings over the century from 1762, including a massive iceberg, the possibility that the Aurora Islands are the Shag Rocks, and the possibility that they sank, but dismisses them all. He concludes that &quot;there is actually no wholly satisfactory explanation for the Aurora Islands and they remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of the sea&quot;. Commenting on Ramsay&#x27;s dismissal of the possibility that they sank, Stephen Royle notes that several volcanic islands have been known to have disappeared in recent times.

They are the subject of a 2001 novel entitled &quot;Hippolyte&#x27;s Island&quot;, by Barbara Hodgson, during which they are rediscovered by the book&#x27;s protagonist. In an episode in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, Pym and his crewmates search for but fail to find them.

<text>A sensorium (/sɛnˈsɔːrɪəm/) (: sensoria) is the apparatus of an organism&#x27;s perception considered as a whole. It is the &quot;seat of &quot; where it experiences, perceives and interprets the environments within which it lives. The term originally entered English from the Late Latin in the mid-17th century, from the stem &quot;sens-&quot; (&quot;sense&quot;). In earlier use it referred, in a broader sense, to the brain as the mind&#x27;s organ (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; 1989). In medical, psychological, and physiological discourse it has come to refer to the total character of the unique and changing sensory environments perceived by individuals. These include the sensation, perception, and interpretation of information about the world around us by using faculties of the mind such as senses, phenomenal and psychological perception, cognition, and intelligence.

== Ratios of sensation ==
In the 20th century, the sensorium became a key part of the theories of Marshall McLuhan, Edmund Carpenter and Walter J. Ong (Carpenter and McLuhan 1960; Ong 1991).

McLuhan, like his mentor Harold Innis, believed that media were biased according to time and space. He paid particular attention to what he called the sensorium, or the &quot;effects&quot; of media on our senses, positing that media affect us by manipulating the ratio of our senses. For example, the alphabet stresses the sense of sight, which in turn causes us to think in linear, objective terms. The medium of the alphabet thus has the effect of reshaping the way in which we, collectively and individually, perceive and understand our environment in what has been termed the Alphabet Effect.

Focusing on variations in the sensorium across social contexts, these theorists collectively suggest that the world is explained and experienced differently depending on the specific &quot;ratios of sense&quot; that members of a culture share in the sensoria they learn to inhabit (Howes 1991, p. 8). More recent work has demonstrated that individuals may include in their unique sensoria perceptual proclivities that exceed their cultural norms; even when, as in the history of smell in the West, the sense in question is suppressed or mostly ignored (Classen, Howes and Synnott 1994).

This interplay of various ways of conceiving the world could be compared to the experience of synesthesia, where stimulus of one sense causes a perception by another, seemingly unrelated sense, as in musicians who can taste the intervals between notes they hear (Beeli &quot;et al&quot;., 2005), or artists who can smell colors. Many individuals who have one or more senses restricted or lost develop a sensorium with a ratio of sense which favors those they possess more fully. Frequently the blind or deaf speak of a compensating effect, whereby their sense of touch or smell becomes more acute, changing the way they perceive and reason about the world; especially telling examples are found in the cases of &quot;wild children&quot;, whose early childhoods were spent in abusive, neglected, or non-human environments, both intensifying and minimizing perceptual abilities (Classen 1991).

== Development of unique sensoria in cultures and individuals ==
Although some consider these modalities abnormal, it is more likely that these examples demonstrate the contextual and socially learned nature of sensation. A &#x27;normal&#x27; sensorium and a &#x27;synesthetic&#x27; one differ based on the division, connection, and interplay of the body&#x27;s manifold sensory apparatus. A synesthete has simply developed a different set of relationships, including cognitive or interpretive skills which deliver unique abilities and understanding of the world (Beeli et al., 2005). The sensorium is a creation of the physical, biological, social, and cultural environments of the individual organism and its relationships while being in the world.

What is considered a strange blurring of sensation from one perspective, is a normal and &#x27;natural&#x27; way of perception of the world in another, and indeed many individuals and their cultures develop sensoria fundamentally different from the vision-centric modality of most Western science and culture. One revealing contrast is the thought of a former Russian on the matter:
:The dictionary of the Russian language...defines the sense of touch as follows: &quot;In reality all five senses can be reduced to one---the sense of touch. The tongue and palate sense the food; the ear, sound waves; the nose, emanations; the eyes, rays of light.&quot; That is why in all textbooks the sense of touch is always mentioned first. It means to ascertain, to perceive, by body, hand or fingers (Anonymous 1953).

As David Howes explains:
:The reference to Russian textbooks treating touch first, in contrast to American psychology textbooks which always begin with sight, is confirmed by other observers (Simon 1957) and serves to highlight how the hierarchization of the senses can vary significantly even between cultures belonging to the same general tradition (here, that of &quot;the West&quot;) (2003, pp. 12-13).

== Sensory ecology and anthropology ==
These sorts of insights were the impetus for the development of the burgeoning field of sensory anthropology, which seeks to understand other cultures from within their own unique sensoria. Anthropologists such as Paul Stoller (1989) and Michael Jackson (1983, 1989) have focused on a critique of the hegemony of vision and textuality in the social sciences. They argue for an understanding and analysis that is embodied, one sensitive to the unique context of sensation of those one wishes to understand. They believe that a thorough awareness and adoption of other sensoria is a key requirement if ethnography is to approach true understanding.

A related area of study is sensory (or perceptual) ecology. This field aims at understanding the unique sensory and interpretive systems all organisms develop, based on the specific ecological environments they live in, experience and adapt to. A key researcher in this field has been psychologist James J. Gibson, who has written numerous seminal volumes considering the senses in terms of holistic, self-contained perceptual systems. These exhibit their own mindful, interpretive behaviour, rather than acting simply as conduits delivering information for cognitive processing, as in more representational philosophies of perception or theories of psychology (1966, 1979). Perceptual systems detect affordances in objects in the world, directing attention towards information about an object in terms of the possible uses it affords an organism.

The individual sensory systems of the body are only parts of these broader perceptual ecologies, which include the physical apparatus of sensation, the environment being sensed, as well as both learned and innate systems for directing attention and interpreting the results. These systems represent and enact the information (as an influence which leads to a transformation) required to perceive, identify or reason about the world, and are distributed across the very design and structures of the body, in relation to the physical environment, as well as in the concepts and interpretations of the mind. This information varies according to species, physical environment, and the context of information in the social and cultural systems of perception, which also change over time and space, and as an individual learns through living. Any single perceptual modality may include or overlap multiple sensory structures, as well as other modes of perception, and the sum of their relations and the ratio of mixture and importance comprise a sensorium. The perception, understanding, and reasoning of an organism is dependent on the particular experience of the world delivered by changing ratios of sense.

== Clouded sensorium ==
A clouded sensorium, also known as an altered sensorium, is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. It is usually synonymous with, or substantially overlapping with, altered level of consciousness. It is associated with a huge variety of underlying causes from drug induced states to pathogenic states induced by disease or mineral deficiency to neurotrauma.

<text>Anthocharis euphenoides, the Provence orange tip, is a species of butterfly in the family Pieridae. It is found in the Iberian Peninsula (missing in the southwest and northeast), in the south of France (from the eastern Pyrenees to the Alpes-Maritimes) and in Italy in the Abruzzo. There are a few records from Switzerland (Southern Ticino). Its caterpillars use &quot;Biscutella&quot; as their food source.

==Description==
This butterfly has a very marked sexual dimorphism: the male is yellow with the apex of the forewings orange bordered by a small black band while the female is white with the apex orange and the same black band. The underside of the hindwings is marked with green and the apex of the forewings is orange in the male, yellow in the female.

==Description in Seitz==
&quot;A. euphenoides&quot; is distinguished in both sexes only by the colour and markings of the underside of the hindwing. In the females the colour of the apical area of the upperside of forewing is very variable, for there occur also specimens with rather large reddish yellow patch. — ab. &quot;lecithosa&quot; Tur., hitherto only found in South France, has no orange patch in the male, but, like the female of this form, a sulphur-yellow apical spot. — Larva greenish, with yellow and black dorsal markings
, white lateral stripes and large black dots, head green; in autumn on &quot;Biscutella&quot; species;
it is a so-called cannibal-caterpillar. Pupa light brown, also green, very strongly incurved (Spuler).

<text>Samuel Alexander (6 January 1859 – 13 September 1938) was an Australian-born British philosopher. He was the first Jewish fellow of an Oxbridge college. He is now best known as an advocate of emergentism in biology.

==Early life==
He was born into a Jewish family at 436 George Street, Sydney, Australia, the third son of Samuel Alexander, a prosperous saddler, and Eliza née Sloman. His father died around the time he was born, of tuberculosis. Eliza moved the family to St Kilda, Victoria in 1863 or 1864, and Alexander was tutored, and placed at a private school. In 1871, he was sent to Wesley College, Melbourne, then under the headmastership of Martin Howy Irving.

Alexander matriculated at the University of Melbourne on 22 March 1875. He completed the first two years with distinction, but then left without taking a degree.

==Academic career==
In May 1877, Alexander sailed for England in an attempt to win a scholarship at Oxford or Cambridge. He was successful at Balliol College, Oxford, and matriculated there on 28 January 1878. He graduated B.A. in 1881, was elected a Fellow of Lincoln College in 1882, and graduated M.A. in 1884. He remained as philosophy tutor at Lincoln College to 1893. It was during this period that he developed his interest in psychology, then a neglected subject. He travelled on the continent of Europe, and in the winter of 1890–91 was in Germany working on experimental psychology at the laboratory of Hugo Münsterberg at Freiburg.

Alexander for much of his life was deaf, which acted as a handicap. For some time, he wanted to obtain a professorship. He made three unsuccessful attempts before he was appointed at Owens College, Manchester in 1893. Among his colleagues there was the educational theorist Catherine Isabella Dodd, whom he admired. Another educationalist he found impressive was Esther Lawrence, a cousin.

Robert Mackintosh (1858–1933) owed his appointment as lecturer in 1904 to the new Manchester theological faculty in 1904 to Alexander, he believed. Alexander introduced experimental psychology at Manchester in 1907, in unorthodox fashion, with the appointment of Tom Pear (1886–1972), later a professor. Pear was recruited while still an undergraduate, but was backed by Charles Sherrington, who had brought William George Smith as a lecturer to the University of Liverpool in 1905. He invited John Macmurray to be a lecturer in the philosophy department in 1919.

Alexander was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1908 to 1911, and again from 1936 to 1937. In 1913, he was made a Fellow of the British Academy. R. G. Collingwood met Alexander in 1917, when both were working for the United Kingdom, and they kept in touch on philosophy for the rest of Alexander&#x27;s life. Collingwood later contended that Alexander had &quot;philosophical genius of very high order&quot;. Alexander influenced A. N. Whitehead, and mentored others who went on to become major figures in 20th-century British philosophy. One such was John Anderson.

In 1924 Alexander retired from his chair, and was succeeded by John Leofric Stocks.

==Awards and honours==
He was given the Hon. LLD of St Andrews in 1905, and in later years he received Hon. Litt. D. degrees from Durham, Liverpool, Oxford and Cambridge.

In 1924, Alexander sat for the sculptor Jacob Epstein, who made two copies of a bust. One copy went to the Ben Uri Gallery &amp; Museum, and the other to the University of Manchester. He was Herbert Spencer lecturer at Oxford in 1927, and in 1930 the Order of Merit was conferred on him, the first to a native of Australia.

==Death and legacy==

Alexander died on 13 September 1938. He was unmarried and his ashes lie in Manchester Southern cemetery (British Jewish Reform Congregation section). He left money to the University of Jerusalem and the University of Manchester. John Laird, his literary executor, edited &quot;Philosophical and Literary Pieces&quot; (1939). His papers were left to the John Rylands Library.

The building formerly known as Humanities Lime Grove at the University of Manchester was renamed the Samuel Alexander Building, in 2007. A theatre at Monash University, Melbourne, and a conference room at Wesley College, Melbourne are also named for him.

==Works==
Alexander contributed articles on philosophical subjects to &quot;Mind&quot;, the &quot;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society&quot;, and the &quot;International Journal of Ethics&quot;. In 1887, he won the Green moral philosophy prize with an essay on the subject &quot;In what direction does Moral Philosophy seem to you to admit or require advance?&quot; It was the basis of his volume &quot;Moral Order and Progress&quot;, which was published in 1889 and went into its third edition in 1899. Alexander credited A. C. Bradley with introducing him to ethics, and his brother F. H. Bradley helped him with the book. He was influenced by T. H. Green, in whose memory the prize had been set up, but diverged from his views in pursuing evolutionary ethics.

Alexander was appointed Gifford lecturer at Glasgow in 1915, and delivered his lectures in the winters of 1917 and 1918. They drew on preliminary papers he had written from 1908 onwards. These materials he developed into his major work &quot;Space, Time, and Deity&quot;, published in two volumes in 1920. John Laird called it &quot;the boldest adventure in detailed speculative metaphysics attempted in so grand a manner by any English writer between 1655 and 1920&quot;. His Arthur Davis Memorial Lecture on &quot;Spinoza and Time&quot;, in the nature of an annexe to &quot;Space, Time, and Deity&quot;, was published in 1921.

In 1933, Alexander published &quot;Beauty and Other Forms of Value&quot;, mainly an essay in aesthetics. It incorporated passages from papers that had appeared in the previous ten years. Compared to his systematic work, it was rather closer to the mainstream of British thought, and was praised highly by R. G. Collingwood.

==Philosophical ideas==
Two key concepts for Alexander are those of an &quot;emergent quality&quot; and the idea of emergent evolution:

His idea was to start with space and time, each of which he regarded as inconceivable without the other, in fact mutually equivalent. His thinking, as he said, originated in &quot;Instinct and Experience&quot; (1912) by C. Lloyd Morgan; who went on in 1922 to give an exposition of emergent properties. Pure spacetime emerges, through a process Alexander describes simply as &quot;motion&quot;, the stuff and matter that make up our material world:



Alexander absolutizes spacetime, and even speaks of it as an &quot;Entity|stuff&quot; of which things are made. At the same time he also says that spacetime can be called &quot;Motions&quot; – not motion in the singular, but complexes of motions with kaleidoscopic changes within a continuum. In other words, for Alexander motion is primitive, and space and time are defined through relations between motions.

In &quot;Space, Time, and Deity&quot; Alexander held that an object may be before a consciousness, but is not in it; consciousness of an object is not the same as consciousness of one&#x27;s consciousness of the object. For example, an object such as a chair may be apprehended by a consciousness, but the chair is not located within that consciousness; and, the contemplation of the chair is distinct from thinking about the act of contemplating the chair. Further, since the contemplation of an object is itself an action, in Alexander&#x27;s view it cannot be &quot;contemplated&quot;, but only subjectively experienced, or &quot;enjoyed&quot;.

Alexander asked the question:

Alexander&#x27;s views have been described as panentheistic.

==Family==
A change in Alexander&#x27;s home life occurred in 1902 when the whole of his family—his mother, an aunt, two elder brothers and his sister—came from Australia to live with him. His sister became his hostess and on Wednesday evenings there were informal social gatherings.

Alexander was an &quot;unofficial godfather&quot; to writer Naomi Mitchison née Haldane, born in 1897. He took an interest in her studies, and wrote her long letters. Mitchison devoted a chapter in her autobiographical work &quot;You May Well Ask&quot; to Alexander, recounting affectionate anecdotes and quoting extensively from his letters.

<doc id="948919" wikidata="Q617000" url="?curid=948919" title="Goliath birdeater">
<text>The Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) belongs to the tarantula family Theraphosidae. Found in northern South America, it is the largest spider in the world by mass () and body length (up to ), and second to the giant huntsman spider by leg span. It is also called the Goliath tarantula or Goliath bird-eating spider; the practice of calling theraphosids &quot;bird-eating&quot; derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one eating a hummingbird. Despite the spider&#x27;s name, it rarely preys on birds.

== Characteristics ==

These spiders can have a leg span of up to , a body length of up to , and can weigh up to . Birdeaters are one of the few tarantula species that lack tibial spurs, located on the first pair of legs of most adult males. They are mostly tan to light brown and golden-hued.

== Life cycle ==
Unlike other species of spider/tarantula, females rarely eat the males during mating. Females mature in 3–6 years and have an average lifespan of 15 to 25 years. Males die soon after maturity and have a lifespan of three to six years. Colors range from dark to light brown with faint markings on the legs. Bird-eaters have hair on their bodies, abdomens, and legs. The female lays 100 to 200 eggs, which hatch into spiderlings within 6–8 weeks.

==Behaviour==
=== Defenses ===
In response to threats, Goliath birdeaters stridulate by rubbing setae on their pedipalps and legs. Also, when threatened they rub their abdomen with their hind legs and release hairs that are a severe irritant to the skin and mucous membranes. These urticating hairs can be harmful to humans.

Like all tarantulas, &quot;T. blondi&quot; spiders have fangs large enough () to break the skin of a human. They carry venom in their fangs and have been known to bite when threatened, but the venom is relatively harmless and its effects are comparable to those of a wasp&#x27;s sting. Tarantulas generally bite humans only in self-defense, and these bites do not always result in envenomation (known as a &quot;dry bite”).

=== Feeding ===
Despite its name, the Goliath birdeater only rarely actually preys on birds; in the wild, its diet consists primarily of other large arthropods, worms, and amphibians. However, because of its size and opportunistic predatory behavior, this species commonly kills and consumes a variety of insects and small terrestrial vertebrates. They do not consume their prey in the open; rather, they drag it back to their burrow and begin the digesting process. They do this by liquefying the insides of their prey and proceed to suck it dry. In the wild, &quot;T. blondi&quot; has been observed feeding on rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and even snakes.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Goliath birdeater is native to the upland rainforest regions of Northern South America: Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, northern Brazil, eastern Colombia, and southern Venezuela. Most noticeable in the Amazon rainforest, the spider is terrestrial, living in deep burrows, and is found commonly in marshy or swampy areas. It is a nocturnal species.

== Culinary use ==
The Goliath birdeater is an edible spider. The spider is part of the local cuisine in northeastern South America, prepared by singeing off the urticating hairs and roasting it in banana leaves. The flavor has been described as &quot;shrimp-like&quot;.

The setting first appeared in a 1992 RPG scenario and revolves around a secretive organization tasked with protecting the United States from paranormal and alien threats. &quot;Delta Green&quot; combines the classic 1920s Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft with modern conspiracy fiction.

In August 2011, Arc Dream Publishing and the Delta Green Partnership announced development of a standalone &quot;Delta Green&quot; role-playing game. Funding began in 2015 and in 2016 the &quot;Agent&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was released followed by the &quot;Handler&#x27;s Guide&quot; in 2018. Arc Dream Publishing also made a partnership with Pelgrane Press to release a prequel named &quot;The Fall of DELTA GREEN&quot; using the Gumshoe System in 2018.

==Premise==
&quot;Delta Green&quot; is a contemporary setting, starting in the mid-1990s, with intermittent updates thereafter. The game revolves around a fictitious secret organization, created by the U.S. Government following the covert raid on the town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;. The organization takes its name from its World War II-era codename.

Delta Green agents work undercover through other U.S. government agencies, recruiting across a wide range including the FBI, ATF, CIA, CDC, DEA and the U.S. Military. It appears to have &quot;gone rogue&quot; somewhere between the 1960s and the 1980s, following a disastrous operation in Cambodia and a &quot;deal&quot; struck by Reagan-era rivals in Majestic-12, ostensibly with &quot;Greys&quot;. Delta Green must not only contain incursions from creatures from the Cthulhu Mythos, but also secret conspiracies and rogue organizations that seek to weaponize its powers.

The 2016 edition advances the history to the 2010s. In 2001, the September 11 attacks greatly affect the Intelligence Community, including Delta Green and MAJESTIC-12. Majestic was weakened and destroyed, while Delta Green has been brought back into the government fold, given a budget and official standing, using the War on Terror as a cover to their operation. There&#x27;s also a group of old guard agents that were opposed to the restructure of Delta Green, preferring to maintain the old conspiracy running, forming their own splinter group known as &quot;The Outlaws&quot;, as opposed to the official &quot;Program&quot;.

&quot;The Fall of Delta Green&quot;, on the other hand, is a spin-off set during the 1960s. Focusing on Delta Green&#x27;s operations during the Cold War, in particular in Indochina and the Vietnam War, before the fateful operation that led to the original disbandment of the organization.

The group was introduced in the seventh issue of &quot;The Unspeakable Oath&quot;, a &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; fanzine created by Pagan Publishing, in early 1993. Four years later, the &quot;Delta Green&quot; supplement appeared and spawned a number of its own supplements and novels. The premise is similar to &quot;The X-Files&quot; (although the original incarnation of Delta Green preceded &quot;The X-Files&quot; by almost a year). Both draw on federal alphabet soup folklore, UFO conspiracy theories and other modern legends.

The &quot;Delta Green&quot; supplement lays the groundwork for organized investigations into paranormal crime and horror, setting up the initial plot and providing players with their motivations and the resources they need to carry out their tasks. It also provides a source of replacements for characters who go mad or are killed. Canonical materials revolve around threats from the Cthulhu Mythos, but the framework is very flexible. Delta Green agents typically know little about the Mythos. While the scenarios and written material is centered around the United States, there are possibilities for international games too. &quot;Delta Green: Countdown&quot; introduced counterparts in the United Kingdom and Russia, called PISCES and GRU SV-8 respectively, as well as real-life international law enforcement and intelligence agencies. While &quot;Targets of Opportunity&quot; introduced the Canadian M-EPIC.

==Gameplay==
The original 1997 edition of &quot;Delta Green&quot; was a sourcebook for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;; as such, it used the Basic Role-Playing system that &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; had.

The 2016 standalone edition takes the percentile dice of Basic Role-Playing and &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; mechanics, and introduces modifications adapted for the setting. Player Characters are called &quot;Agents&quot; and the Game Masters &quot;Handlers&quot;.

&quot;Sanity&quot; is rolled when characters meet unnatural horrors, as well as in violent situations and moments when the Agents feel helpless. Agents can &quot;adapt&quot; to violence and helplessness after failed Sanity checks, but excessive loss of Sanity can result in agents developing mental disorders.
Delta Green introduces the concept of &quot;Bonds&quot;, which are the friends and family of the Agents, and &quot;Motivations&quot;, the reasons why the Agents fight. The latter serve as character-expanding tool for players and a sanity-regulation mechanic, as they can be used to halve the SAN loss. At the point of their relationship with bonds, if the relationship points fall, the connection with the bond will be crossed out. With the bond mechanics, the &quot;Home&quot; scenes are also introduced. These are between-mission vignettes of the everyday lives of the Agents. They can be about building relationships with bonds, investigating the unnatural, or going to the therapists, among others.

Gear and equipment can be requisitioned from the government organizations under which the Agent works, through the use of the &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; skill, with more expensive and advanced equipment increasing the difficulty of the roll. A failure might result in the Agent getting fired, blacklisted, or even arrested. Items can also be purchased using the Agent&#x27;s personal wealth, though this can risk the Agent&#x27;s relationship with their bonds.

Combat was also streamlined to be quicker, more tactical and deadly. The main combat mechanic introduced is &quot;Lethality&quot;, weapons that deal damage above 2d10 have a &quot;lethality rating&quot; from 10% to 90%, if the percentile roll is below the rating the targeted enemy dies instantly; otherwise, the damage dealt is the sum of the percentile dice.

&quot;The Fall of Delta Green&quot; uses Pelgrane Press&#x27; own Gumshoe System that is also used in their other games such as The Esoterrorists, Fear Itself and Trail of Cthulhu. Unlike the standard D100/BRP system that both &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;Delta Green&quot; use, in which many actions are subject to D100 rolls to determine outcome, the Gumshoe system emphasizes getting characters from scene to scene quickly, gathering clues and interpreting them using minimal rolls of a 6-sided die.

&quot;Fall of Delta Green&quot; also introduces new mechanics for the Gumshoe formula, adapting the new rules introduced by the standalone edition of &quot;Delta Green&quot;: Bonds and Motivations complement the sanity system (Itself based on the one used in Trail of Cthulhu), adaptation to SAN loss was included, &quot;Revelation&quot; works similarly to the &quot;traumatic background&quot; in Delta Green&#x27;s character creation and a few new abilities were added, most prominently was the ability of &quot;Agency&quot; to represent the capability of the Player Character to manipulate their employing agency&#x27;s (Such as the CIA, MACV-SOG or the Federal Bureau of Narcotics) resources in their investigations.

==History==
The setting was first introduced in 1992 in the seventh issue of &quot;The Unspeakable Oath&quot;, Pagan Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; fanzine, in the scenario &quot;Convergence&quot;, which would be later republished in the first &quot;Delta Green&quot; sourcebook. The scenario introduced Delta Green as a loose organization within the U.S. government dedicated to secretly fight the creatures from the Cthulhu Mythos. &quot;Convergence&quot; was also followed by a sequel named &quot;Transference&quot; published in Volume 2 Issue 2 of the Cyberpunk 2020 fanzine &quot;The Interface,&quot; although later published material disregards this scenario.

Pagan Publishing would then expand the setting resulting in the publishing of the &quot;Delta Green&quot; sourcebook in 1997. This was followed an additional sourcebook in 1999 titled &quot;Delta Green: Countdown&quot;.

On May 1, 2006, the Pagan Publishing homepage was updated with an announcement describing the reasons for the delay of the new release of &quot;Delta Green&quot;, and stating that the d20 edition of the game should be available in time for Gen Con Indy. While there were a few show copies available there were no copies available for sale to the public as most of them were &quot;still being shipped from China&quot;. As of May 2007 the book, which is a reprint of the 1997 book with the addition of D20 stats, was finally reprinted and was available in stores.

A hardback compilation of the three &quot;Delta Green Eyes Only&quot; chapbooks, along with additional material, was released in November 2007. The book was published in cooperation with Arc Dream Publishing. The entire 1,000 copy print run was sold out by February 2008. The hardback edition of &quot;Delta Green: Eyes Only&quot; was a finalist for the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Supplement of 2007. A softback version of the compilation followed in September 2008 and is available to retail distribution.

Pagan Publishing and Arc Dream Publishing began work in mid-2008 on a new sourcebook, &quot;Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity&quot;, which was released as a limited-edition hardback in June 2010, to be followed by a softcover retail edition. As of August 2011 the entire 1,000-copy print run of the hardback limited edition was sold out. In August 2011, &quot;Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity&quot; won silver (2nd place) Ennie Awards for Best Writing and Best Adventure.

Arc Dream Publishing released an ebook edition of the novel &quot;Delta Green: Denied to the Enemy&quot; in January 2011.

As of October 29, 2015, a Kickstarter Campaign by Arc Dream Publishing funded a series of new &quot;Delta Green&quot; products, converting the setting into a standalone role-playing game. On February 26, 2016, a quick-start rulebook &quot;Delta Green: Need to Know&quot; was released for free download with the &quot;Agent&#x27;s Handbook&quot; following soon after on April 27, 2016. The &quot;Handler&#x27;s Guide&quot; was released October 31, 2017, in PDF and on March 8, 2018, a compilation of several other &quot;Delta Green&quot; adventures released by Arc Dream was released in only one book &quot;Delta Green: A Night at the Opera&quot;, containing the adventures &quot;Reverberations&quot;, &quot;Viscid&quot;, &quot;Music from a Darkened Room&quot;, &quot;Extremophilia&quot;, &quot;Star Chamber&quot; and &quot;Observer Effect&quot;.

In February 2018, Pelgrane Press released &quot;The Fall of Delta Green&quot;, the Vietnam War game financed on the 2015 Kickstarter as a GUMSHOE counterpart to Delta Green&#x27;s Basic Role-Playing.

On July 9, 2018, returning co-creator John Scott Tynes started a Kickstarter campaign to fund &quot;Delta Green: The Labyrinth&quot;, a new sourcebook containing &quot;new threats, allies, and mysteries to deepen the terrors of your campaign.&quot; It was released on November 12, 2019, in PDF and July 29, 2020, in physical format.

In 2018, &quot;Delta Green&quot; won six ENnies awards. Gold in &quot;Best Rules&quot;, &quot;Best Production Values&quot; for &quot;Delta Green: The Roleplaying Game&quot; and &quot;Best E-Book&quot; for &quot;Delta Green: A Night at The Opera&quot; categories; while Silver in &quot;Product of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Game&quot; for &quot;Delta Green: The Roleplaying Game&quot; and &quot;Best Adventure&quot; for &quot;Delta Green: A Night at The Opera&quot;.

On April 18, 2019, the sourcebook &quot;Delta Green: The Complex&quot; was released, containing information on federal agencies and related professions that didn&#x27;t appear in the &quot;Agent&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, such as the ATF, NSA, Booz Allen Hamilton, United States Coast Guard among other federal law enforcement, intelligence, military and private contractors agencies that work for the US government. Later on April 24, the collection of scenarios &quot;Delta Green: Control Group&quot; was released in PDF format, the scenarios in &quot;Control Group&quot; are meant to be introductory for both players and their characters, the scenarios use pre-made characters that are not in the Delta Green conspiracy. 2020 saw the release of &quot;Black Sites&quot;, similar to &quot;A Night at The Opera&quot;, it&#x27;s a hardback collection of scenarios previously available only in PDF or paperback.

On January 25, 2021 &quot;Delta Green: Impossible Landscapes&quot; was released. It is &quot;Delta Green&quot;&#x27;s first full-length campaign, centered around Hastur, The King in Yellow and Carcosa, with a bigger focus in surreal horror.

On August 10, 2021, Arc Dream started yet another Kickstarter campaign called &quot;Delta Green: The Conspiracy&quot;. The project is an updated re-release of the original &quot;Delta Green&quot; sourcebook (now retitled &quot;Delta Green: The Conspiracy&quot;) with new art, layout and aligned with the new edition&#x27;s rules. The campaign was a success and it raised $513,158, more than any previous campaign. Beside the original sourcebook, the campaign also funded the rest of the original line of Pagan Publishing sourcebooks: &quot;Delta Green: Countdown&quot; (as &quot;Delta Green: The Millennium&quot;) and &quot;Delta Green: Eyes Only&quot; (as &quot;Delta Green: Machinations&quot;). &quot;Targets of Opportunity&quot; was divided in two books: &quot;Legacies,&quot; with the chapters of the Black Cod Island, M-EPIC, the Disciples of the Worm, and the DeMonte Clan, and &quot;Transcendence&quot; with the chapters of Cult of Trascendence. The scenarios in the original sourcebooks won&#x27;t be released with the new ones; instead they will be released separately as paperback and then in one hardcover book called &quot;Delta Green: Incursions.&quot; &quot;Delta Green: Agencies&quot; will contain the U.S. and international agencies profiled in the annex of &quot;Delta Green&quot; and &quot;Countdown.&quot; The only new material will be &quot;Delta Green: Shotgun Scenarios&quot;. A &quot;shotgun scenario&quot; is a short standalone scenario that can fit into other, larger campaigns or scenarios. Many of them will be fan-made, coming from the community-ran Shotgun Scenarios fan contest.

April 2022 saw the release of &quot;Iconoclasts&quot;, Delta Green&#x27;s second campaign. It is set in 2016 during war against the Islamic State in Iraq, tasking players to infiltrate and investigate mysterious events going on inside the territory of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

On October 13, 2023 Delta Green&#x27;s third campaign &quot;God&#x27;s Teeth&quot; was released. The campaign is set in 2001 and plays out over a 19 year timespan.

=== International publishing ===

==Reception==
In the March 1997 edition of the British game magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; (Issue 17), Andy Butcher said &quot;Right from the first page of the book, it&#x27;s obvious that &quot;Delta Green&quot; is something really special.&quot; Butcher complimented the book for &quot;a wealth of rich detail, intricate plotting, and great imagination. The result is truly inspiring.&quot; He concluded by giving the book at excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;One of the biggest, most detailed, best conceived and inspiring sourcebooks ever released for any game system. An absolute must for any &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; referee considering a modern-day campaign, and highly recommended even if you&#x27;re not.&quot;

In the July 1998 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 249), Ray Winninger called &quot;Delta Green&quot; &quot;one of the richest, most detailed, and most complete sourcebooks ever published.&quot; Winninger found that this book &quot;successfully melds Lovecraft&#x27;s eerie mythos with modern UFO and conspiracy folklore to produce a compelling hybrid setting all its own.&quot; Winninger gave the book a perfect rating of 6 out of 6, concluding, &quot;The book contains all the material any Keeper could possibly expect, all of it first rate: the illustrations are excellent and helpful, the included adventures are top-notch, and the price is remarkably reasonable [...] Products like this come along only very rarely. For &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; fans, &quot;Delta Green&quot; is a must buy. For everybody else, it&#x27;s still probably worth a look.&quot;

In Issue 3 of the French game magazine &quot;Backstab&quot;, Stéphane Bura wrote, &quot;Seldom has a role-playing product inspired in me such a sense of despair and helplessness in the face of the threat it offered.&quot; He concluded by giving the book a perfect rating of 10 out of 10, saying, &quot;Even if you wouldn&#x27;t normally play a contemporary role-playing game, buy this supplement anyway. This is the must-see product that will set the bar for excellence for a few years to come.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;A rich narrative web increases the horror for the players, even if the players don&#x27;t experience the full story. There is a thrill to combing through the histories and timelines, making connections, and developing theories.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;&quot;Delta Green&quot; more often pits players against other humans, rather than monsters, which, in turn, places an increased value on examining the human toll of the missions ... It doesn&#x27;t always ring true, but it represents a vast improvement over sanity systems that feature pulp-inspired caricatures of mental health.&quot;

<doc id="948937" wikidata="Q4588405" url="?curid=948937" title="1993 Chrétien attack ad">
<text>During the 1993 Canadian federal election campaign, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party produced a televised attack ad against Jean Chrétien, the Liberal Party leader. The ad (sometimes referred to as the &quot;face ad&quot;) was perceived by many as a focus on Chrétien&#x27;s facial deformity, caused by Bell&#x27;s palsy. The resulting outcry is considered to be an example of voter backlash from negative campaigning.

==Background==
Heading into the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservatives were beset by many problems, notably the ongoing recession, the unpopular Goods and Services Tax, and loss of support to the recently-formed Reform Party and Bloc Québécois. While the party was initially optimistic about being able to at least retain second place, its support had dropped badly in the final weeks of the campaign. Realizing that without something dramatic the Liberals were certain to win a majority government, the PC campaign leaders decided to launch a group of four ads attacking Chrétien and his record.

PC campaign director (and future Toronto mayor) John Tory was mainly responsible for deciding to launch the ads, along with Allan Gregg, a pollster who was one of the top campaign managers. Gregg had launched a series of attack ads aimed at Liberal leader John Turner in the last days of the 1988 election to great effect. The new ads were produced quickly, and few in the party, including Prime Minister and PC leader Kim Campbell, who was on the campaign trail, saw them before they were aired.

==The second ad and immediate reaction==
The second of the four ads premiered on October 14, 1993. The ad featured still pictures of Chrétien&#x27;s face interspersed with comments by actors posing as regular Canadians; the first voiceover asked &quot;Is this a Prime Minister?&quot; with other voices questioning his record. The final, and most prominent, line was &quot;I would be very embarrassed if he became Prime Minister of Canada.&quot;

While the ad&#x27;s creators claimed they had meant for the voiceover lines to refer to Chrétien&#x27;s policies and ethics, the intercutting of the lines with images of the Liberal leader&#x27;s face, focusing on his facial deformity, were interpreted by many as an attack on Chrétien&#x27;s appearance and health condition. The Liberal Party encouraged its members to call media outlets about the ad, an effort championed by Roméo LeBlanc.

==Reaction and backlash==


Though she did not make a full apology for the ad campaign, Campbell ordered the second ad be pulled less than 24 hours after its premiere; she also ordered that the remaining two ads in the campaign not be aired.

Even more beneficial for the Liberals than the anti-Tory backlash was Chrétien&#x27;s reaction to the commercials. One pundit described them as allowing Chrétien to &quot;make the speech he had been waiting his entire career to deliver.&quot; Speaking in Nova Scotia, Chrétien stated that &quot;God gave me a physical defect, and I&#x27;ve accepted that since [I was] a kid.&quot; Chrétien poked fun at himself, saying &quot;It&#x27;s true, that I speak on one side of my mouth. I&#x27;m not a Tory, I don&#x27;t speak on both sides of my mouth.&quot;

It is unclear what effect the ad had on the election, as Campbell&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives were adversely affected by other issues (see &quot;Background&quot; above).

==Election results and aftermath==
The election turned out to be one of the most eventful in Canada&#x27;s history, with more than half of the electorate switching parties from the 1988 election. The Liberals won a landslide majority, capturing 177 of the 295 seats in the 35th Canadian Parliament. Chrétien became Prime Minister as a result, a position he would retain until his retirement from politics a decade later.

By comparison, the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; share of Parliament was reduced to only two seats; they lost official party status (and the Parliamentary entitlement and federal funding that accompanies it) as a result. Campbell, who lost her own seat in Vancouver Centre, resigned the party leadership soon after. The PCs never recovered as a federal political party; in 2003, they merged with the Canadian Alliance (the successor of the Reform Party), with the new entity becoming the Conservative Party of Canada. The Conservatives eventually regained power with a minority government in the 2006 federal election.

<doc id="948953" wikidata="Q345702" url="?curid=948953" title="Kazimierz Deyna">
<text>Kazimierz Deyna (; 23 October 1947 – 1 September 1989) was a Polish professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder in the playmaker role and was one of the most highly regarded players of his generation, due to his excellent vision. Throughout his career he played for such clubs as Legia Warsaw, Manchester City and San Diego Sockers. 

At the international level, he earned 97 caps and scored 41 goals helping Poland claim 3rd place at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. At the 1972 Summer Olympics, he won gold with Poland and was the top goalscorer of the tournament. From 1973 to 1978, he served as captain of the national representation. In 1976, he won silver medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics. 

In 1973 and 1974, he won the Polish Footballer of the Year Award. In 1974, he claimed third place in the Ballon d&#x27;Or. He was named &quot;the greatest Polish footballer of the 20th century&quot; by the &quot;Piłka Nożna&quot; football weekly.

==Early life==
Deyna was born in Starogard Gdański to Franciszek (1911–1976), a dairy worker, and Jadwiga (1917–1981), a housewife. He had six sisters and two brothers, Henryk and Franciszek, who also were footballers. Henryk played for Włókniarz Starogard Gdański, while Franciszek was a Starogardzki KS player.

==Club career==

===Legia Warsaw===
Deyna began playing youth football in 1958 at his local club Włókniarz Starogard Gdański. In 1966 he made one appearance for ŁKS Łódź (on 8 October in a 0–0 draw against Górnik Zabrze). But he was quickly snapped up by Legia Warsaw. In communist Poland each team had its own &quot;sponsor&quot;. The Warsaw club was much more powerful as it was the military club. Moreover, it was the favourite club of the authorities. Deyna was called up into the army and in this way he had to play for Legia Warsaw. He made a name for himself during his first season, becoming one of Legia&#x27;s most important players.
In 1969 and 1970 his team won the Polish Championship. After his performances at the 1974 World Cup, European top teams like AS Saint-Étienne, AS Monaco, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich tried to acquire his services but he was unable to join, since the communist regime in Poland prevented him from moving to Western Europe. Real Madrid was so determined to acquire Deyna that they sent a shirt to Warsaw with his name and number &quot;14&quot;.

===Manchester City===
Soon afterwards Deyna was transferred to English club Manchester City, making his debut in November 1978, and being one of the first wave of overseas players to play in the English league. His time in England was marred by a series of injuries, and he left in January 1981, shortly after Manchester City made a managerial change, having made only 43 appearances in all competitions. However, he was regarded as an exceptionally gifted playmaker and became a cult figure with City fans. Deyna scored thirteen goals in his time with the club. Furthermore, his seven goals in the last eight games of the 1978–79 season were crucial for Manchester City in their relegation battle.

===San Diego Sockers===

Deyna appeared in the 1981 film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; as Paul Wolcheck. In the same year, he emigrated to the United States, where he signed with the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League in January 1981. During the next seven years, he played four NASL outdoor seasons, one NASL indoor season and five Major Indoor Soccer League seasons with the Sockers, winning five championships. The Sockers released him in June 1987. He was a 1983 NASL Second Team All Star.

==International career==

On 24 April 1968, Deyna made his debut for the Poland national team in a match against Turkey in Chorzów. He won the gold medal in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and the bronze in Football World Cup 1974, after a match against Brazil. In 1972, he was also the Top Goalscorer of the Olympic Games, with a total of nine goals.

In 1976 Summer Olympics his team yet again reached the finals and won the silver medal. Additionally, he was ranked third in the European Footballer of the Year for 1974, behind Johan Cruyff and Franz Beckenbauer.

Deyna played for Poland on 97 (84 after the deduction of Olympic Football Tournament competition games) occasions, scoring 41 goals, and often captained the side. He had the ability to score from unusual positions, for example directly from a corner. Because of his achievements and talents, he was chosen &quot;Football Player of the Year&quot; several times by Polish fans. In 1978, he captained Poland at the Football World Cup in Argentina, where the team reached the second phase.

==Death==

Deyna died in a car accident in San Diego, California in 1 September 1989, aged 41 (just two days before another fatal car accident claimed the life of another international football star, the Italian Gaetano Scirea). In 1994, he was chosen by the Polish Football Association (PZPN) and the readers of all Polish sports-related newspapers as the Greatest Polish Football Player of All Time. His number 10 is retired by Legia Warsaw and the Sockers. In June 2012 Kazimierz Deyna&#x27;s remains were exhumed and reburied in Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Military Cemetery.

<text>2GB is a commercial radio station in Sydney, Australia, owned by parent company Nine Radio, a division of Nine Entertainment Co., who also own sister station 2UE.

2GB broadcasts on 873 kHz, AM.

In 2024, 2GB held 14% of the total radio ratings share, making it one of the most widely listened-to radio stations in Sydney.

== History ==

2GB commenced intermittent broadcasting in August 1926. The operator, Theosophical Broadcasting Station Pty Ltd, owned by interests associated with the local branch of Theosophical Society Adyar, was granted a radio broadcasting licence for the Sydney area.
The initials honour Giordano Bruno. George A. Saunders, previously with 2BL, became 2GB&#x27;s first station manager and (as &quot;Uncle George&quot;) on-air personality in 1927.

2GB became the first Australian station to play transcription records by 1933, holding the world&#x27;s largest transcribed record library at the time.

The controlling interest in the station was purchased by Denison Estates Ltd in 1936. A new board of directors was appointed under chairman Sir Hugh Denison and included Frederick Daniell and A. E. Bennett, who continued as station manager.

In what radio historian and writer Richard Lane termed &quot;The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama&quot;, Denison and his media adviser Daniell inaugurated the Broadcasting Service Association Players, renamed the Macquarie Players in 1938.

2GB produced local weekly serials such as &quot;Dolly and Dan&quot; and &quot;Doctor Mac&quot;, and presented a full-length drama on Sunday afternoons. Writers included John E. C. Appleton, Lynn Foster, E. Mason Wood, William L. Power (who dramatised Helen de Guerry Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Boomerang&quot;, a series on &quot;Famous Escapes&quot;, and &quot;Tales Told to Peter and Pam&quot;, a popular children&#x27;s series), E. V. Timms and Ken Pawley.

Actors included James Raglan, Lou Vernon, Peter Finch, Betty Suttor and Harry Dearth.

The station launched the Macquarie Radio Network, in February 1938, in competition with the Major Network, started by fellow Sydney station 2UE.

&quot;Calling the Stars&quot; was an expensive show created locally and sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. The stars of the show included comedians Jack Davey, `Mo’ (Roy Rene) and Willie Fennell. Dorothy (Dilly) Foster and Rita Pauncefort read double entendres as the not too bright, &quot;Ada and Elsie&quot; in a script written by Foster until 1954.

In 1940, the station became the largest producer of radio drama programs in the Southern Hemisphere. During World War II, 2GB provided transcription records to the Australian Army&#x27;s network of radio stations in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands.

Station announcer Ted Harris, aided by American Ted Schroeder, became the first man to give a direct ball-by-ball description of the Davis Cup from Forest Hills to Australia on 27 August 1955. Two years later, 2GB became the first Australian station to air news bulletins on the hour, every hour during its broadcast day.

Prior to 1964, the controlling interest (45%) was held by Broadcasting Associates Pty Ltd., with 14% owned by the John Fairfax group of companies, and the balance owned by various smaller shareholders. Broadcasting Associates was owned by A.T.V. (Australia) Pty. Ltd., the Australian subsidiary of ITV company Associated Television. In 1964, Fairfax purchased ATV&#x27;s Australian assets, including the 45% share in 2GB.

Although the ownership of the station has subsequently passed to strictly commercial interests, the Theosophical Society was still presenting programmes on the station as late as 1975.

Ray Hadley, previously with 2UE, became a presenter at the station in 2001.

2GB had a standby mast and its original 873 AM transmitter tower at Wentworth Point at Homebush Bay. Its location was visible via the Ryde Bridge, and also via the train line to Rhodes and Concord train stations. Due to a redevelopment occurring on the same land, the tower was brought down on Friday 11 September 2015. A month or two before, a new tower was erected for 2GB and is now situated at the 2KY transmitter site, also in Homebush.
In October 2012, following the Alan Jones &quot;died of shame&quot; controversy, 2GB suspended advertising on the Alan Jones show. This decision was reversed in October 2012, but many advertisers declined to return to sponsoring the program.

In June 2014, Michael Smith was fired as fill-in commentator for calling Muhammad a paedophile; Program Director David Kidd referred to Muhammad as a deity.

==Merger==

On 1 April 2015 The Macquarie Radio Network merged with the Fairfax Radio Network of Fairfax Media. The news teams of 2UE and 2GB are being merged with &quot;significant job cuts.&quot; Consequently, on 9 April 2015 the 2UE newsroom was closed.

== Callsign and frequency ==
The number 2 of the callsign refers to the state of New South Wales, which also has postcodes starting with 2. The two letters GB indicate an AM station, and were chosen to honour the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, who was much admired by Theosophists. Its original frequency allocation was 950 kHz and moved to 870 kHz in 1935, then to 873 on 23 November 1978, when channel separation was reduced from 10 kHz to 9 kHz as a result of an international medium wave frequency realignment. It has also been attributed to Grace Brothers the department store building where the station originally broadcast from.

<doc id="948956" wikidata="Q16546994" url="?curid=948956" title="Self-love">
<text>Self-love, defined as &quot;love of self&quot; or &quot;regard for one&#x27;s own happiness or advantage&quot;, has been conceptualized both as a basic human necessity and as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and selfishness, synonymous with amour-propre, conceitedness, egotism, narcissism, et al. However, throughout the 20th and 21st centuries self-love has adopted a more positive connotation through pride parades, Self-Respect Movement, self-love protests, the hippie era, the modern feminist movement (3rd &amp; 4th wave), as well as the increase in mental health awareness that promotes self-love as intrinsic to self-help and support groups working to prevent substance abuse and suicide.

==Views==
The Hindu arishadvargas (major sins) are short-term self-benefiting pursuits that are ultimately damaging. These include mada (pride). Jainism believes that the four kashaya (passions) stop people escaping the cycle of life and death.

Gautama Buddha ( 563-483 BC) and Buddhism believe that the desires of the self are the root of all evil. However, this is balanced with karuṇā (compassion).

Confucius (551–479 BC) and Confucianism values society over the self. 

Yang Zhu (440–360 BC) and Yangism viewed &quot;wei wo&quot;, or &quot;everything for myself&quot;, as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation. All of what is known of Yangism comes from its contemporary critics - Yang&#x27;s beliefs were hotly contested.

The thoughts of Aristotle (384–322 BC) about self-love (philautia) are recorded in the Nicomachean Ethics and Eudemian Ethics. Nicomachean Ethics Book 9, Chapter 8 focuses on it particularly. In this passage, Aristotle argues that people who love themselves to achieve unwarranted personal gain are bad, but those who love themselves to achieve virtuous principles are the best sort of good. He says the former kind of self-love is much more common than the latter. 

Cicero (106–43 BC) considered those who were &quot;sui amantes sine rivali&quot; (lovers of themselves without rivals) were doomed to end in failure.

Jesus ( 4 BC-30 AD) prioritised the loving of God, and commanded his followers to love others selflessly, following his example. Early follower of Jesus, Paul the Apostle ( 5–64/65 AD) wrote that inordinate self-love was opposed to love of God in his letter to the Phillipian church. The author of the New Testament letter of James had the same belief. 

Christian monk Evagrius Ponticus (345–399) believed excessive self-love (hyperēphania – pride) was one of eight key sins. His list of sins was later lightly adapted by Pope Gregory I as the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot;. This list of sins then became an important part of the doctrine of the western church. Under this system, pride is the original and most deadly of the sins. This position was expressed strongly in fiction by Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;.

Augustine (354–430) – with his theology of evil as a mere distortion of the good – considered that the sin of pride was only a perversion of a normal, more modest degree of self-love.

The Sikhs believe that the Five Thieves are the core human weaknesses that steal the innately good common sense from people. These selfish desires cause great problems.

In 1612 Francis Bacon condemned extreme self-lovers, who would burn down their own home, only to roast themselves an egg.

In the 1660s Baruch Spinoza wrote in his book &quot;Ethics&quot; that self-preservation was the highest virtue.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) believed there were two kinds of self-love. One was &quot;amour de soi&quot; (French for &quot;love of self&quot;) which is the drive for self-preservation. Rousseau considered this drive to be the root of all human drives. The other was &quot;amour-propre&quot; (often also translated as &quot;self-love&quot;, but which also means &quot;pride&quot;), which refers to the self-esteem generated from being appreciated by other people.

The concept of &quot;ethical egoism&quot; was introduced by the philosopher Henry Sidgwick in his book &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot;, written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of utilitarianism, writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.

In 1890, psychologist William James examined the concept of self esteem in his influential textbook &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot;. Robert H. Wozniak later wrote that William James&#x27;s theory of self-love in this book was measured in &quot;... three different but interrelated aspects of self: the material self (all those aspects of material existence in which we feel a strong sense of ownership, our bodies, our families, our possessions), the social self (our felt social relations), and the spiritual self (our feelings of our own subjectivity)&quot;.

In 1956 psychologist and social philosopher Erich Fromm proposed that loving oneself is different from being arrogant, conceited or egocentric, meaning that instead caring about oneself and taking responsibility for oneself. Fromm proposed a re-evaluation of self-love in more positive sense, arguing that in order to be able to truly love another person, a person first needs to love oneself in the way of respecting oneself and knowing oneself (e.g. being realistic and honest about one&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses).

In the 1960s, Erik H. Erikson similarly wrote of a post-narcissistic appreciation of the value of the ego, while Carl Rogers saw one result of successful therapy as the regaining of a quiet sense of pleasure in being one&#x27;s own self.

Self-love or self-worth was defined in 2003 by Aiden Gregg and Constantine Sedikides as &quot;referring to a person&#x27;s subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative&quot;.

==Mental health==
Lack of self-love increases risk of suicide according to the American Association of Suicidology. The association conducted a study in 2008 which researched the impact of low self-esteem and lack of self-love and its relation to suicidal tendencies and attempts. They defined self-love as being &quot;beliefs about oneself (self-based self-esteem) and beliefs about how other people regard oneself (other-based self-esteem)&quot;. It concluded that &quot;depression, hopelessness, and low self-esteem are implications of vulnerability factors for suicide ideation&quot; and that &quot;these findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation&quot;.

==Promotion==
===History===
Self-love was first promoted by the Beat Generation of the 1950s and in the early years of the Hippie era of the 1960s. After witnessing the devastating consequences of World War II and having troops still fighting in the Vietnam War, western (especially North American) societies began promoting &quot;peace and love&quot; to help generate positive energy and to promote the preservation of dissipating environmental factors, such as the emergence of oil pipelines and the recognition of pollution caused by the greenhouse effect.

These deteriorating living conditions caused worldwide protests that primarily focused on ending the war, but secondarily promoted a positive environment aided by the fundamental concept of crowd psychology. This post-war community was left very vulnerable to persuasion but began encouraging freedom, harmony, and the possibility of a brighter, non-violent future. These protests took place on almost all continents and included countries such as the United States (primarily New York City and California), England, and Australia. Their dedication, perseverance, and empathy towards human life defined this generation as being peace advocates and carefree souls.

The emergence of the feminist movement began as early as the 19th century, but only began having major influence during the second wave movement, which included women&#x27;s rights protests that inevitably led to women gaining the right to vote. These protests not only promoted equality but also suggested that women should recognize their self-worth through the knowledge and acceptance of self-love. Elizabeth Cady Stanton used the Declaration of Independence as a guideline to demonstrate that women have been harshly treated throughout the centuries in her feminist essay titled &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot;. In the essay she claims that &quot;all men and women are created equal; ... that among these [rights] are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;; and that without these rights, the capacity to feel self-worth and self-love is scarce. This historical essay suggests that a lack of self-esteem and fear of self-love affects modern women due to lingering post-industrial gender conditions.

Self-love has also been used as a tool in communities of Color in the United States. In the 1970s Black-Power movement, the slogan &quot;Black is beautiful!&quot; became a way for African-Americans to throw off the mantle of predominately White beauty norms. The dominant cultural aesthetic pre-1970s was to straighten Black hair with a perm or hot comb. During the Black Power movement, the &quot;afro&quot; or &quot;fro&quot; became the popular hairstyle. It involved letting Black Hair grow naturally, without chemical treatment, so as to embrace and flaunt the extremely curly hair texture of Black people. Hair was teased out the hair using a pick. The goal was to cause the hair to form a halo around the head, flaunting the Blackness of its wearer. This form of self-love and empowerment during the 70s was a way for African-Americans to combat the stigma against their natural hair texture, which was, and still is, largely seen as unprofessional in the modern workplace.

===Modern platforms===
The emergence of social media has created a platform for self-love promotion and mental health awareness in order to end the stigma surrounding mental health and to address self-love positively rather than negatively.

A few modern examples of self-love promotion platforms include:
* Dove Campaign for Real Beauty (commercial marketing campaign)
* SlutWalk
* To Write Love on Her Arms

Malvolio is described as &quot;sick of self-love...a distempered appetite&quot; in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (I.v.85-6), lacking self-perspective.

Self-love or self-worth was later defined by A.P. Gregg and C. Sedikides in 2003.

<doc id="948961" wikidata="Q5074539" url="?curid=948961" title="Charity care">
<text>In the United States, charity care is health care provided for free or at reduced prices to low income patients. The percentage of doctors providing charity care dropped from 76% in 1996–97 to 68% in 2004–2005. Potential reasons for the decline include changes in physician practice patterns and increasing financial pressures. In 2006, Senate investigators found that many hospitals did not inform patients that charity care was available. Some for-profit hospitals provided as much charity care as some non-profit hospitals. Investigators also found non-profit hospitals charging poor, uninsured patients more than they did patients with health insurance. Hospitals must provide some charity care if they wish to maintain non-profit status.

One estimate put the cost of uncompensated care for 2004 at $41 billion, of which $34.6 billion was funded through a patchwork of government programs. Over half of all government reimbursement for uncompensated care comes from the federal government; most of that is provided through Medicare and Medicaid. These federal funds are a primary source of support for health care providers that serve the uninsured. Increasing demand for free and low-cost health care services by uninsured patients and Medicaid beneficiaries is, along with increased competition, placing a growing financial strain on safety-net health care providers. Some safety-net providers are responding by trying to limit their charity care exposure and attract more paying customers.

==State reimbursement for charity care==
The state of New Jersey has a program to provide reimbursements to hospitals and other health care institutions which provide uncompensated or under-compensated health care to patients lacking private health insurance whose income falls below a certain amount but is too high to qualify them for Medicaid and are not old enough to be eligible for Medicare (New Jersey&#x27;s situation is somewhat unusual among American states in that the state has no county or municipal hospitals).

The scheme provides free health care to uninsured state residents whose income is up to 200% of the federally designated poverty line, and provides discounts which gradually phase out at incomes between 200% and 300% of the poverty line; the patient&#x27;s liquid assets (not including the patient&#x27;s home and one automobile) must not exceed $7,500. Also, the maximum any individual qualifying for aid under the aforementioned criteria can be liable for in a single year is 30% of that patient&#x27;s gross income for that year. A special fund was designed to compensate the health care provider—which may have furnished either inpatient or outpatient services—for the applicable difference in cost. However, New Jersey hospitals are reimbursed for charity care at below their cost to provide these services, which helps account for the fact that in the past two years, nine hospitals have closed in the state and six others have filed for bankruptcy, according to the New Jersey Hospital Association.

Some private health care providers in other states—particularly those that are operated on a nonprofit basis (often by religious entities)—also provide free and/or low-cost health care to uninsured patients, using income thresholds similar to those observed statewide in New Jersey; but state laws vary widely as to how much, if any, reimbursement (usually in the form of tax credits) the institution receives for so doing (and in only one other state besides New Jersey—Washington—does an outright mandate exist to provide charity care). Perhaps the most famous example of such an institution was the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, founded in 1732 and now run by the Medical Center of Louisiana, now closed due to damage from Hurricane Katrina.

In 2007 the community hospitals in Washington State agreed to uniform standards for providing free and reduced cost care to low-income individuals. The new standards were less generous than existing practice for four out of ten community hospitals, but is stronger than existing state law. Care is free for families with incomes below the federal poverty level. Between one and two times the federal poverty level patients may buy care at cost; between two and three times the federal poverty level uninsured patients are charged no more than what an average insured patient would pay.

<text>The Mark Hellinger Theatre (formerly the 51st Street Theatre and the Hollywood Theatre) is a church building at 237 West 51st Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, which formerly operated as a cinema and Broadway theater. Opened in 1930, the Hellinger Theatre is named after journalist Mark Hellinger and was developed by Warner Bros. as a movie palace. It was designed by Thomas W. Lamb with a modern facade and a Baroque interior. It has 1,605 seats across two levels and has been a house of worship for the Times Square Church since 1989. Both the exterior and interior of the theater are New York City landmarks.

The facade on 51st Street is designed in a modern 1930s style and is constructed with golden and brown bricks. The stage house to the west and the auditorium at the center are designed as one unit, with a cornice above the auditorium. The eastern section, containing the building&#x27;s current main entrance, includes statues flanking the doors, as well as an overhanging marquee. The 51st Street facade was originally a side entrance; the main entrance was originally at 1655 Broadway but was closed in the 1950s. In contrast to the exterior, the theater has a Baroque interior. Its rotunda lobby contains eight fluted columns, a balcony, and a domed ceiling with several murals; a basement lounge exists under the lobby. The auditorium has a coved ceiling with murals, as well as boxes and a deep stage.

For the first two decades of the Hellinger Theatre&#x27;s existence, it largely served as a cinema under the Hollywood Theatre name. Vaudeville was presented in 1932, and some legitimate productions were shown intermittently from 1934 to 1942. The theater was briefly known as the 51st Street Theatre in 1936 and 1941 and as the Warner Theatre from 1947 to 1948. Anthony Brady Farrell bought the theater and renamed it after Hellinger, reopening it as a legitimate theater in 1949. The theater was subsequently acquired by the Stahl family in 1957 and the Nederlander Organization in 1976. The Hellinger hosted some hits from the 1950s to the 1970s, including &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Timbuktu!&quot;, but its later productions were mostly flops. By 1989, a lack of Broadway productions prompted the Nederlanders to lease the theater to the Times Square Church, which bought the building two years later and continues to operate it .

==Site==
The Mark Hellinger Theatre is at 237 West 51st Street, on the north sidewalk between Eighth Avenue and Broadway, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The irregular land lot covers , with a frontage of on 51st Street and a depth of . The bulk of the theater exists on 51st Street, with a wing extending north to 52nd Street. The Mark Hellinger shares the block with the Neil Simon Theatre to the west and Gallagher&#x27;s Steakhouse to the north. Other nearby buildings include the August Wilson Theatre to the north; the Broadway Theatre and 810 Seventh Avenue to the northeast; Axa Equitable Center to the east; the Winter Garden Theatre to the southeast; and Paramount Plaza (including the Circle in the Square Theatre and the Gershwin Theatre) to the south. An entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 50th Street station, serving the , is just south of the theater.

== Design ==

The Mark Hellinger Theatre, originally the Hollywood Theatre, was designed by Thomas W. Lamb and was constructed in 1930 as a movie palace for Warner Bros. While the interior was designed in a Baroque style, the exterior was treated in a modern style.

=== Facade ===

==== Former Broadway ====
The Hollywood Theatre&#x27;s main entrance was originally at 1655 Broadway, with a narrow lobby leading to a grand foyer on 51st Street. At the time of the theater&#x27;s construction in 1930, cinemas that premiered films in the Times Square area typically had entrances on Broadway, regardless of the width. While the Broadway entrance was narrow, it contained a bright marquee and a huge lighted vertical sign. The Broadway entrance was closed in 1934 and converted to retail space before being demolished completely prior to the late 1990s.

The roof of the Hollywood Theatre&#x27;s Broadway wing originally contained a V-shaped steel sign measuring tall and wide. Described in 1929 as &quot;the largest electrical display in the world&quot;, the sign weighed 115 tons. A dedicated generator illuminated the sign&#x27;s 20,000 bulbs, which were arranged so that letters could be flashed.

==== 51st Street ====
The only surviving facade is on 51st Street and consists of two modern-style sections, both made of brick and designed with vertical motifs. The eastern section is a narrow tower containing the building&#x27;s entrance. The other section, which contains the stage house and auditorium, is shorter but wider. Although the 51st Street facade serves as the building&#x27;s current front entrance, this was originally a side entrance.

The entrance section has a water table made of black granite. The entrance itself contains five double doors below transom windows, all made of glass with bronze frames. On either side are tall figures holding globe-shaped lanterns, as well as bronze display boxes. A modern marquee is mounted over the building&#x27;s entrance. The facade is made of gold brick, with three strips of brown-brick rectangles above the marquee, rising to a set of three brown-brick squares. On either side are fluted terracotta panels, topped by stylized urns that contain plant forms. On all stories, the theater&#x27;s brick courses step outward to the left and right of the tower. The top of the entrance&#x27;s facade contains a parapet with zigzag patterns.

The stage house to the west and the auditorium at the center share a facade, with gold brick above a black-granite water table. Horizontal brown-brick strips run across the first story. The first floor also contains display boxes with brick headers around them, as well as an office door, a former stage door, and a wide garage door. On the upper stories, the central section (auditorium) contains a large brick panel surrounded by soldier courses. There are rectangular openings to the east (right) of this panel, with grilles above them. The top story of the auditorium contains stylized brick brackets, which support a decorative copper cornice; there are octagonal panels between the brackets. The stage house contains window openings between shallow brick piers. The stage house has a setback on the upper stories, with plain brick behind it.

=== Interior ===
The Hellinger&#x27;s rococo interior was similar to that of other 1920s movie palaces. The interior spaces were designed by Leif Neandross, chief designer of the Rambusch Decorating Company. The original decorative scheme was gold with highlights of red and blue.

==== Lobby ====

The original lobby from Broadway (since demolished) was designed in a modern French style. It was Art Deco in design and led to the present main lobby. According to a contemporary account, the Broadway lobby had mirrored walls with bronze and marble decorations, in addition to a plaster ceiling. The Broadway lobby was designed to potentially support a taller building that was canceled during the Great Depression.

The main lobby is a double-height oval rotunda with eight fluted columns holding up a domed ceiling. According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), the lobby&#x27;s design is similar to the interior of the 18th-century Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers in Germany. The Times Square Church uses the lobby to sell religious products such as books and CDs. The main lobby&#x27;s columns are placed on marble pedestals, and they are topped by Ionic-style capitals. Above the columns is a marble entablature with cherubs. The ceiling has paneled arches and coves, which converge at a rope molding that surrounds the oval dome at the ceiling&#x27;s center. A classical mural is painted in the middle of the ceiling; the mural was intended to symbolize arts and learning. A large multi-tiered candelabra hangs from the middle of the dome.

The lobby&#x27;s walls contain marble bases, above which are panels surrounded by ornamental moldings. Lighting sconces are mounted onto the walls, and there are openings to the auditorium&#x27;s orchestra level on the west wall. Doors on the south wall lead back to the ticket lobby. The north wall contains a grand staircase to a balcony at the auditorium&#x27;s mezzanine level. Additional staircases connect to that level from the lobby&#x27;s entrance.

The balcony overlooks the lobby. The staircases from the lobby contain wall panels with ornamental moldings as well as lighting sconces; there are also mirrors at the landings. Underneath the balcony, next to the columns on the north wall, are segmental arches that are supported by console brackets. The balcony itself has a balustrade with motifs of scallops and cherubs, while the underside of the balcony has moldings. The walls of the balcony also have panels with moldings; there are doorways decorated with cartouches and swags, which lead to lounges. Ribs divide the balcony&#x27;s ceiling into panels, and there are moldings along the border of both the ribs and the panels. Candelabras and globe chandeliers are suspended from the balcony ceiling. There was originally furniture along the balcony.

==== Auditorium ====
The auditorium has an orchestra level, one balcony, boxes, and a stage behind the proscenium arch. The auditorium is slightly wider than its depth, and the space is designed with plaster decorations in low relief. The auditorium&#x27;s seating capacity is 1,603, though historically it could fit 1,506 people. The orchestra alone could fit 900 people. The seats are upholstered in red velvet and finished in wood. From the outset, three hundred seats were equipped with &quot;Warner Theatre-phones&quot; to both amplify and clarify sound for hard-of-hearing users. Damask curtains were placed on the walls to increase insulation. The auditorium curves inward near the proscenium.

===== Seating areas =====
The rear (east) end of the orchestra contains a shallow, curving promenade. The walls of the orchestra promenade have doors, above which are exit signs with flanking volutes. Both the orchestra and the promenade contain flat pilasters on the walls, between which are panels with moldings on their borders. The orchestra is slightly raked, sloping down toward an orchestra pit near the stage.

The underside of the balcony, above the orchestra, contains globe-shaped light fixtures and three coves with scallops and foliation. Though the balcony is also raked, its underside is convex, preventing sound-deadening air pockets from accumulating at the orchestra&#x27;s rear wall. The balcony also has a promenade at its rear, separated from the main balcony by decorated vertical piers. The balcony and promenade walls contain flat pilasters and panels with molded borders. The side walls contain arched doorways with molded frames. The rear wall has a standing rail and lighting sconces. The balcony level is divided into front and rear sections by a crossover aisle, which runs between metal railings on either side. The balcony&#x27;s front railing has foliate motifs, which are aligned on a vertical axis. A projection room was placed at the rear of the balcony, measuring long and tall.

On either side of the proscenium is an archway with a single box that is curved outward. The balcony&#x27;s front railing extends onto the box&#x27;s front railing, supporting two fluted Corinthian columns on either side of each box. Underneath the front railing of each box is an arch at orchestra level, which contains a pair of console brackets with a cartouche at the center. There are also cartouches beside the arches, under each pair of columns; these in turn are flanked by brackets with cherubs and swags. Above each box is another arch, which rises from volutes atop the Corinthian-column pairs. Small pendant chandeliers are placed in front of the boxes&#x27; column pairs.

===== Other design features =====
Next to the boxes is an inverted proscenium arch. The proscenium arch contains Corinthian-style fluted piers and columns on either side, topped by console brackets. The top of the arch is designed as an ornate entablature. The center of the proscenium contains a large plaster-of-Paris crown, supported by a broken pediment with winged figures. The stage has a depth of . Although the Hellinger was built as a cinema, the theater&#x27;s large stage could also be used to present large musical shows.
Below the ceiling, wrapping around the whole auditorium, is an entablature with a leaf molding. The edges of the ceiling are split into numerous coves, separated by console brackets with cartouches at their centers. Each of the coves contains a painted mural with a round frame and a cartouche above. There are twelve frames in total, which depict 18th-century French aristocratic scenes; each mural signifies a different part of the year. The main portion of the ceiling contains additional molded bands, which contain more murals and surround an oval panel at the center. The oval panel contains a fan design while the surrounding panels are designed in the Adam style. There are small pendant-style chandeliers hanging from the outer panels of the ceiling. A large globe-style chandelier hangs from the center of the oval panel.

==== Basement ====
Directly below the lobby is an oval basement lounge. There are eight pairs of imitation-marble columns, topped by Tuscan-style capitals. The walls contain panels with molded borders, and there are molded doorway openings with entablatures. One wall contains a fireplace, the mantelpiece of which consists of a shelf supported on console brackets. The immediate opposite wall has doorways to the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s restrooms. The lounge formerly also had a bar, which was installed in the 1960s.

The ceiling dome is shallow and contains a central medallion with overlapping circles, from which hangs a large chandelier. The rest of the ceiling contains moldings and beams, which divide the ceiling into sections, each with a central medallion and a smaller globe-style chandelier. A staircase curves upward to the lobby and contains paneled walls with molded borders, as well as a paneled ceiling with suspended globe-style chandeliers.

==History==
Movie palaces became common in the 1920s between the end of World War I and the beginning of the Great Depression. In the New York City area, only a small number of operators were involved in the construction of movie palaces. Relatively few architects were responsible for these theaters&#x27; designs, including legitimate theater architects Thomas Lamb, C. Howard Crane, and John Eberson.

===Hollywood Theatre===

==== Development and opening ====

In April 1929, Warner Bros. leased the lots at 217 to 233 West 51st Street and 234 West 52nd Street at an annual rate of $40,000. The lease was to run for 17 years, with options for two 21-year extensions. Warner Bros. immediately started planning a movie palace on the site. The company planned to build an entrance from Broadway, on the eastern end of the block. The theater was to have 1,600 seats on an orchestra and a balcony level, and it would be the first Broadway theater built specifically for films. Warner Bros. had chosen this site specifically because it was close to the established Theater District around Times Square. That area, by the 1920s, was starting to see the development of movie theaters alongside legitimate venues.

The Warner Bros. Hollywood Theatre opened on April 22, 1930, with the Warner Technicolor musical film &quot;Hold Everything&quot;, starring Winnie Lightner and Joe E. Brown. The storefronts on Broadway were leased out for uses such as a Lindy&#x27;s restaurant. For its first two years, the Hollywood only screened films. These included &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;The Beggar of Bagdad&quot; in 1930, as well as &quot;Bought&quot; and &quot;The Mad Genius&quot; in 1931. Lou Holtz announced his intention in early 1932 to lease the theater for vaudeville. Holtz&#x27;s vaudeville revues opened that February, but they stopped two months later because Holtz said his simultaneous acting and producing of these revues were &quot;strenuous&quot;. Vaudeville returned in November 1932 when Arthur George Klein took over the theater for twice-a-day revue. By February 1933, the Hollywood was again dark, and the theater returned to hosting films afterward. During 1933, Warner Bros. acquired additional land at 235 to 239 West 51st Street from the Shubert brothers. Generally, the Hollywood&#x27;s films were not successful, and the venue stood empty for long periods.

==== Alternating live shows and film ====

Warner Bros. announced in October 1934 that it would renovate the stage for theatrical use and add 32 dressing rooms. These changes were to accommodate Hollywood&#x27;s first theatrical production: &quot;Calling All Stars&quot;, a musical revue with Martha Raye, which opened in December 1934 and ran 35 performances. In October 1935, the Hollywood hosted the premiere of the Warner Bros. film &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, starring James Cagney and Olivia de Havilland. The following March, Earl Carroll negotiated with Warner Bros. to rename the Hollywood Theatre for himself and stage musicals there. The theater was leased to George Abbott and renamed the 51st Street Theatre in late 1936. The theater&#x27;s main entrance was relocated from Broadway to 51st Street, as Warner Bros. wished to use the Broadway entrance for films and the 51st Street entrance for legitimate productions. Abbott&#x27;s play &quot;Sweet River&quot; opened that October and closed after just five performances.

The 51st Street Theatre reverted to film in 1937; Warner Bros. planned to either host its own films or rent the theater out for screenings. The Hollywood Theatre name was restored in August 1937 with the screening of &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot;, the first premiere at the theater since &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Further films followed until October 1938, when another live production opened, the Gilbert and Sullivan-themed musical &quot;Knights of Song&quot;. This was followed by the 1939 edition of &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, a transfer from the Alvin Theatre, which ran for a month at the Hollywood. In 1940, the theater was again renamed the 51st Street Theatre, presenting a revival of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier that May. Though the play had been highly promoted, it ran for only 36 performances. This was followed in October 1940 by a three-week performance by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, then in November by performances from Colonel Wassily de Basil&#x27;s Original Ballet Russe.

The theater reverted to the Hollywood Theatre name and again began showing films. A renovation of the Hollywood Theatre was announced in mid-1941, when Eddie Cantor&#x27;s musical &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; was booked. &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; opened in December 1941 and ran for 129 performances, ultimately closing after Cantor became ill. Following &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot;, the Hollywood returned to showing films exclusively for several years. The film &quot;Casablanca&quot;, which subsequently became a hit and a classic, premiered at the Hollywood in 1942. Among the films screened at the Hollywood in the mid-1940s were &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943), &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; (1943), &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1944), &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1945), and &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946). The Hollywood Theatre became the Warner Theatre in August 1947 with the premiere of the film &quot;Life with Father&quot;.

===Mark Hellinger Theatre===

==== Late 1940s and 1950s ====

Wealthy producer Anthony Brady Farrell agreed to purchase the Warner Theatre in June 1948 for about $1.5 million; the sale was finalized the next month. Farrell planned to rename the theater for Mark Hellinger, a Broadway journalist and critic who had died the year before, and he proposed renovating the theater for legitimate plays and musicals. The theater was dedicated under its new name on January 16, 1949, and Farrell&#x27;s musical &quot;All for Love&quot; opened the next week on January 22, with Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, and Bert Wheeler. &quot;All for Love&quot; lost money but ran 121 performances. This was followed by S. M. Chartock&#x27;s three-week-long showcase of Gilbert and Sullivan productions in late 1949. Despite a string of early losses, as well as a weekly expenditure of $4,500 to $5,000 for the Hellinger&#x27;s maintenance, Farrell was optimistic about the theater&#x27;s potential to make money. Farrell&#x27;s musical &quot;Texas Li&#x27;l Darlin″&quot;, featuring Kenny Delmar, opened at the end of 1949. &quot;Texas Li&#x27;l Darlin″&quot; was the first hit in the Hellinger&#x27;s history, running for 293 performances.

&quot;Tickets, Please!&quot; transferred from the Coronet Theatre in late 1950, followed by the Harold Rome revue &quot;Bless You All&quot; at the end that year. Premiering in 1951 was &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot; with Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray, which had 279 performances. &quot;Three Wishes for Jamie&quot; opened the next year and lasted for 91 performances. Chartock returned in late 1952 with a four-week engagement of Gilbert and Sullivan productions, followed by Guthrie McClintic and the Greek National Theater with two plays by Sophocles. The musical &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot; by Jule Styne opened in 1953; &quot;The New York Times&quot; had reported by then that the Broadway entrance had been &quot;discontinued&quot;. The Broadway lobby was then leased out to a clothier in late 1953.

&quot;The Girl in Pink Tights&quot;, the final show of the late composer Sigmund Romberg, premiered in 1954 and closed after 115 performances. The Ballets Espagnols also performed at the Hellinger that November for a four-week run. The Amish-themed musical &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot; opened in January 1955 and was a hit with 461 total performances (some at the Winter Garden Theatre). The same year, the Hellinger hosted &quot;Ankles Aweigh&quot; for 176 performances. The Hellinger had its greatest success with the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, with a score by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened in March 1956 and, with 2,717 total performances, was the longest-running Broadway production ever at the time. Prior to the success of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, there was a rumor in the theatrical community that the Hellinger was destined to never host a hit. A year after &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened, Farrell sold the Hellinger to Max and Stanley Stahl, who had already purchased the neighboring building on Broadway. The new owners chartered a company called Mark Hellinger Theatre Inc.

==== 1960s to mid-1970s ====

In the 1960s, the Hellinger continued to host several popular musicals. Richard Rodgers and Samuel Taylor tried to stage their musical &quot;No Strings&quot;, but &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; producer refused to move. The New York Supreme Court ruled in February 1962 that &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; had to relocate, but Rodgers and Taylor had booked another theater by then. The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; then transferred to the Hellinger from the Lunt-Fontanne for the last seven months of the musical&#x27;s run. The Italian-language &quot;Rugantino&quot; was staged in 1964 with live supertitles on the proscenium, though it flopped in spite of critical acclaim. Styne, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green&#x27;s musical &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; also opened in 1964, featuring Jack Cassidy and Carol Burnett. &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; opened in 1965 with a score by Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner. The same year, a alcoholic bar was installed in the lounge&#x27;s rotunda.

The late 1960s was characterized by several unsuccessful musicals. The musical &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot; in 1966, with choreography by Michael Bennett, ended after just 12 performances. The Martha Graham Dance Company had a limited engagement at the theater the next year. Also staged in 1967 was &quot;Illya Darling&quot; with Melina Mercouri, which ran 319 performances without turning a profit. A third flop followed in 1968, the Biblical musical &quot;I&#x27;m Solomon&quot; with Dick Shawn and Karen Morrow. The same year, the Hellinger hosted ballet performances from Les Ballets Africains; a premiere of the documentary &quot;New York City—The Most&quot;; and a limited concert engagement by Marlene Dietrich. Two productions followed in 1969: Jerry Herman&#x27;s &quot;Dear World&quot;, featuring Angela Lansbury, and Alan Jay Lerner and André Previn&#x27;s &quot;Coco&quot;, starring Katharine Hepburn in her only Broadway musical.

The Hellinger hosted its first Tony Awards ceremony in 1969; it also hosted the 1970 Tony Awards. The Hellinger next staged the flop &quot;Ari&quot; and the final performances of the long-running off-Broadway production &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; in 1971. This was followed the same year by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, another classic, which ran for 720 performances over the next two years. A mixture of successes and failures followed. The Martha Graham Dance Company returned in 1974 and 1975 to critical acclaim. Conversely, the all-male revival of &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1974), &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; (1975), and &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&quot; (1976) were all flops that managed less than ten performances each. Meanwhile, the Stahls had unofficially put the Hellinger on the market by 1975, and the Nederlander Organization bought the theater the next year.

==== Late 1970s and 1980s ====

The Hellinger was not successful in its 1978 productions of &quot;Timbuktu!&quot; with Eartha Kitt or &quot;Platinum&quot; with Alexis Smith. This was followed in 1979 by &quot;Sarava&quot;, a musical with a score by Mitch Leigh; the Joffrey Ballet, with featured artist Rudolf Nureyev; and &quot;The Utter Glory of Morrissey Hall&quot;, which closed on its opening night. The Hellinger finally saw a success in late 1979 when Ann Miller and Mickey Rooney costarred in the burlesque &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;, which ran 1,208 performances over the next three years. The Tony Awards returned to the Hellinger in 1980 and 1981. After the closure of &quot;Sugar Babies&quot; in 1982, Comden and Green produced &quot;A Doll&#x27;s Life&quot;, which closed after five performances. Magician Doug Henning costarred with Chita Rivera in the 1983 musical &quot;Merlin&quot;, which ran for 199 performances. &quot;Merlin&quot; ended to make way for &quot;Chaplin&quot;, a musical that never opened. Afterward, the British musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; had a short run at the Hellinger in 1984.

Michael Bennett negotiated to buy a half-interest in the theater&#x27;s ownership in 1984, the same year that Jerry Weintraub purchased a stake in the operation of the Hellinger. In 1985, the Hellinger hosted &quot;Grind&quot; for 75 performances and &quot;Tango Argentino&quot; for about 200 performances. The 1985 film &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; was also partly shot on location at the theater. Throughout the remainder of the 1980s, the Hellinger showed short runs, solo shows, and industry bookings. The musical &quot;Rags&quot; ran for just four performances in 1986, and dance production Flamenco Puro appeared later the same year. The Hellinger then hosted the 1987 Tony Awards, as well as personal appearances from Smokey Robinson/Jean Carne, Virsky Company, Rodney Dangerfield, and the Georgian State Dance Company. The Hellinger hosted Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Glenda Jackson and Christopher Plummer in early 1988. At the end of the year, the theater premiered its last-ever legitimate production, &quot;Legs Diamond&quot;.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) had started to consider protecting the Hellinger as a landmark in 1982, with discussions continuing over the next several years. The LPC designated the Hellinger&#x27;s interior as a landmark on November 17, 1987, followed by the facade in January 1988. This was part of the commission&#x27;s wide-ranging effort in 1987 to grant landmark status to Broadway theaters. The New York City Board of Estimate ratified the designations in March 1988. The Nederlanders, the Shuberts, and Jujamcyn collectively sued the LPC in June 1988 to overturn the landmark designations of 22 theaters, including the Hellinger, on the merit that the designations severely limited the extent to which the theaters could be modified. The lawsuit was escalated to the New York Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States, but these designations were ultimately upheld in 1992.

===Times Square Church===

==== Lease ====

In February 1989, the Nederlander Organization leased the Hellinger to the Times Square Church, headed by the Rev. David Wilkerson, for $1 million per year on a five-year lease. At the time, the church occupied the 1,150-seat Nederlander Theatre, which was at standing-room only capacity five days a week. In addition, the Broadway theatrical industry was struggling to stage works, and James M. Nederlander said: &quot;It&#x27;s a short-term lease—five years is short term for me. It&#x27;ll pass before you know it.&quot; Had the Nederlanders retained the Hellinger as a legitimate venue, the organization could have rented the theater to a large musical for $1.04 million a year, but it would be far from a consistent income stream. &quot;Legs Diamond&quot; closed later the same month. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;To many theater people, the leasing of the Hellinger, [...] which has long been considered one of the best and most beautiful theaters for musicals, was a sad symbol of both the state of Broadway and of the Nederlander organization.&quot;

The Times Square Church moved to the Hellinger in March 1989. That August, the LPC held a hearing on whether the westernmost section of the theater could be demolished to make way for a hotel developed by Silverstein Properties. The planned hotel would have used air rights from above the theater, which would have necessitated restoring the Hellinger for legitimate use. The producer Cameron Mackintosh expressed interest in leasing the Hellinger for his production &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; in 1990, but he ultimately leased the nearby Broadway Theatre. Rocco Landesman of rival chain Jujamcyn Theaters had also offered to buy the theater, but he said high maintenance costs precluded him or any other producer from offering more than $7 million.

==== Purchase and subsequent years ====
Ultimately, in December 1991, the Nederlanders sold the Hellinger to the church for a reported $17 million. Wilkerson then spent several years renovating the theater for his congregation. In the years after the Times Square Church&#x27;s purchase, the church became so popular that the Hellinger could not accommodate all congregants, despite the theater&#x27;s 1,600-seat capacity. The congregation at the theater numbered 4,000 in 1997 and doubled within the next year. As a result, in the late 1990s, an 800-person overflow room and eight secondary meeting rooms was leased in the neighboring Novotel hotel. By 2001, screens were installed both in the lobby and in a neighboring annex to allow additional congregants to view services.

Theatrical producers have made several unsuccessful attempts to buy the theater from the Times Square Church. As early as 1993, Lloyd Webber had proposed buying the theater from the Times Square Church for his production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. In addition to Mackintosh and the Bennett estate, offers were reportedly made by former Canadian impresario Garth Drabinsky, theatrical operator Shubert Organization, and corporate producers Disney and Clear Channel. The Times Square Church maintains the theater&#x27;s historic interior decor and opens the theater to the public for regular services. The church also hosts tours of the theater, as during Christmas 2016, when it gave tours along with live performances of the Nativity play &quot;Bethlehem on Broadway&quot;.

==Notable productions==
Productions are listed by the year of their first performance. This list only includes Broadway shows; it does not include films screened there.

<text>The Plough Arts Centre is a theatre, cinema and art gallery in Torrington, North Devon, England.

The Plough is situated in a former Territorial Army drill hall on Fore Street in the centre of Torrington. The site was previously a 16th-century town house which was turned into a public house, The Plough Inn in 1750, giving the centre its current name. The pub was licensed until 1910 but had fallen into disrepair and was demolished in 1912. The building we see today was completed in 1913.

The Plough was founded in 1975 and opened with a performance by Dame Edith Evans. In 1991 financial problems threatened The Plough with closure: it was saved through a merger with the nearby Beaford Arts which was established in 1966 by the Dartington Hall Trust to promote and support the arts in rural north Devon. Beaford withdrew in 2002, and The Plough is now again independent and hosts theatre, cinema, music, comedy and art exhibitions. The theatre has 132 raked seats but has the capacity to expand to 240 people.

In 2014 a 60-year-old 35mm celluloid Westar projector was supplemented with a digital projector and enhancements to technical capabilities at the centre, including a new box office system. The money was raised by public fundraising backed by Alistair McGowan, who is a patron of The Plough. The campaign was also boosted by the $4,500 raised at an event with Michael Portillo.

== Workshops ==
The Plough Arts Centre runs many creative workshops for people of all ages and abilities. It is the home of the Plough Youth Theatre founded in 2010.

<text>Denis Lortie (born March 10, 1959) is a former Canadian Forces corporal. In 1984, he stormed into the Parliament Building in Quebec City and opened fire with several firearms, killing three government employees and wounding thirteen others. The National Assembly&#x27;s serjeant-at-arms, René Jalbert, volunteered himself to serve as a hostage, and conversed with Lortie for several hours before convincing him to surrender to authorities.

After a 1985 conviction of first-degree murder was overturned by the Quebec Court of Appeal, Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987, for which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole for ten years. Lortie was granted day parole in 1995, then full parole in 1996.

==Life==

Denis Lortie was born in Quebec on March 10, 1959, as the youngest son of eight children. His exact birthplace within Quebec is not publicly known. Lortie and all his siblings were physically and sexually abused by their father for many years. Lortie&#x27;s father reportedly fathered a child with one of his daughters. One of the Lortie siblings finally informed the police of the abuses in the late 1960s. In 1969, Lortie&#x27;s father was sent to federal prison for three years. In 1972, Lortie&#x27;s father finished incarceration but never returned to his family.

Lortie joined the Canadian Forces in the late 1970s after finishing high school in Quebec. Lortie served in the Logistics Branch at CFB Borden, CFB Valcartier, CFB Halifax and CFS Carp. On December 27, 1980, Lortie married Lisa Lévesque in Quebec City, and he was posted to CFB Halifax the following year. The couple had a son in 1982 and a daughter in 1983. At the time of the shooting, Lortie was posted to CFS Carp, near Ottawa, was ranked a corporal, and worked as a supply technician.

Lortie was bilingual in French and English. But even while speaking French, his native language, he encountered pronunciation difficulties. This resulted in irregular and halting speech. Lortie blamed his social and professional failures on his inability to speak English flawlessly, and was keenly aware that his poor English reinforced negative stereotypes of Francophones and Québécois. After the birth of his daughter, Lortie worried that he would become abusive in the manner of his father, and contemplated killing himself and his family before placing blame on the governing pro-sovereignty for his problems, disliking the party&#x27;s advocacy of a &quot;Francophone identity&quot; for Quebec. Lortie planned the killing spree as a means of broadcasting his discontent.

==Events==

===Before the shooting===
On May 7, 1984, Lortie left the CFS Carp military base, pretending that he needed time off to arrange a divorce with his wife. 
Lortie had previously attempted to secure leave from his base, but was refused. It was during this encounter that Lortie later claimed he saw the face of his father on the face of the officer that denied his request.
He rented a car, drove to Quebec City and took a guided tour of the Parliament Building. He then rented a room in a motel for the night.

The next day, May 8, 1984, at 9:30 a.m., Lortie walked into CJRP radio station in Quebec City, identified himself as &quot;Mr. D&quot;, and dropped off a sealed envelope containing an audiotape for one of the station&#x27;s hosts, André Arthur. He instructed the radio staff not to open the envelope until 10:30 a.m., but they opened it anyway, discovering that it was a statement of Lortie&#x27;s plans, in which he declared, &quot;The government now in power is going to be destroyed.&quot; By the time CJRP staff contacted police, Lortie&#x27;s plan was already under way.

=== Shooting===
At 9:45 a.m., Lortie entered the Parliament Building through a side door located on . He was dressed in combat uniform and armed with two C-1 submachine guns, an Inglis pistol, a duffel bag containing four hundred rounds of 9 mm NATO ammunition, as well as a knife strapped to his leg. As he entered the building, he shot and mortally wounded a receptionist, then killed a messenger whom he encountered in a corridor. He then went into a smoking room and shot and wounded a person there before moving to the cafeteria, but finally found his way into the Assembly Chamber, outside of which dozens of armed (SQ) officers, as well as more than a dozen operatives and Quebec City Police (many carrying M2 carbines), helicopters, and snipers were taking position.

Based on later testimony, it is clear that he intended to assassinate Premier René Lévesque and other members of the governing . His plan was to enter the Assembly Chamber during the parliamentary committee meeting, which was starting at 10:00 a.m. that morning. Instead of wearing a watch, Lortie timed his attack by listening to CJRP and waited for host André Arthur to end his segment. On that day, Arthur ended his broadcast 20 minutes early, leading Lortie to enter the building and make his way to the Assembly Chamber while it was mostly empty. He opened fire on the government employees still inside, killing one and wounding eleven.

===Lortie&#x27;s surrender===
The National Assembly&#x27;s sergeant-at-arms, René Jalbert, was informed that there was a man in military uniform with a gun in the Assembly Chamber. Upon stepping out of the elevator, Lortie asked him why he came, and fired his C-1 submachine gun inches from his face.

Jalbert told him that he too had been a soldier, with the , and that if Lortie would allow it, he would show him his discharge card. Lortie agreed, after which Jalbert persuaded him to show his own identification.

After this exchange, Jalbert persuaded Lortie to come into his office to discuss the matter, and release the other civilians in the Assembly Chamber. Jalbert talked to Lortie for more than four hours, ultimately promising him that he would be able to surrender to military police (since he was unwilling to surrender to civilian police). At 2:15 p.m., Lortie surrendered to officers of the SQ, Quebec City Police Service, and the National Assembly security.

For his actions, which likely prevented further death, Jalbert was awarded the Cross of Valour several months later, in the same National Assembly chamber that Lortie had burst into.

===Victims===
The following were killed in the shooting:

* Georges Boyer
* Camille Lepage (not to be confused with the French photojournalist Camille Lepage, who was also a victim of homicide)
* Roger Lefrançois

==Aftermath==
One of the contributing factors to the shooting, allegedly, was the easy access that Lortie had to both weapons and ammunition. Unlike other non-combat Canadian Forces Bases, CFS Carp, the base at which he was stationed, apparently did not have an armoury, or even ammunition lockers.

According to psychiatrist Pierre Mailloux, who was assigned to the case, Lortie had paranoid schizophrenia and had organized his crime during a psychotic episode, believing that he was acting on instructions given to him from God. Nevertheless, in 1985, Lortie was convicted of first-degree murder, but a new trial was ordered when the Quebec Court of Appeal determined the trial judge had made errors while instructing jurors about how they should weigh testimony from the psychiatrists heard in the case.

Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987.

In 1995, Lortie was released on day parole to a halfway house in Hull, Quebec, after being released from a minimum security correctional facility north of Montreal where he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment, classes to deal with aggression, and serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years. According to the Parole Board of Canada, Lortie no longer posed a threat to society, and &quot;patched his life together despite being responsible for one of the most notorious events in Quebec history.&quot;

Under the release terms, Lortie was required to spend every night at the halfway house between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. He was also required to let parole board supervisors know where he was at all times, and was restricted to a radius from the house. The relatives of some of Lortie&#x27;s victims believed he was not punished severely enough, with some believing he should have been executed, a punishment that could not be applied in the civilian courts, as Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976, though technically possible at the time via the Canadian Forces military justice system. 

Lortie was granted full parole in July 1996 and, as of 2007, was married, with a steady job and a house, and had reportedly been forthcoming with &quot;the people who monitor his case&quot;.

<text>Elliott ALGOL is a compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60, for the Elliott 803 computer made by Elliott Brothers in the United Kingdom. It was implemented by Tony Hoare and others. It differed slightly from the reference version of ALGOL, particularly in the supported character set. First released in February 1962, it is believed to be the first implementation of an ALGOL 60 compiler in a commercial context and was an unexpectedly popular product for the company.

<text>Pallor is a pale color of the skin that can be caused by illness, emotional shock or stress, stimulant use, or anemia, and is the result of a reduced amount of oxyhaemoglobin and may also be visible as pallor of the conjunctivae of the eyes on physical examination.

Pallor is more evident on the face and palms. It can develop suddenly or gradually, depending on the cause. It is not usually clinically significant unless it is accompanied by a general pallor (pale lips, tongue, palms, mouth and other regions with mucous membranes). It is distinguished from similar presentations such as hypopigmentation (lack or loss of skin pigment) or simply a fair complexion.

<text>Porthleven (; ) is a town, civil parish and fishing port in Cornwall, England. The most southerly port in Great Britain, it was a harbour of refuge when this part of the Cornish coastline was infamous for wrecks in the days of sail. The South West Coast Path from Somerset to Dorset passes through the town. The population at the 2011 census was 3,059.

==History==
Methleigh was the site of a fair and annual market from the year 1066. After the Norman Conquest, the Bishop of Exeter held the manor of Methleigh, but the Earl of Cornwall possessed the right to hold the fair. At the time of the Domesday Survey there were of arable land, of pasture and of underbrush. The population consisted of 15 villeins, 4 smallholders and 3 serfs.

Until 1844 Porthleven was within the parish of Sithney. The parish Church of St Bartholomew was built in 1842. The name Porthleven is probably connected with St Elwen or Elwyn, whose chapel existed here before 1270. It was rebuilt about 1510, but destroyed in 1549. There were also chapels at Higher Penrose and Lanner Veor (the latter founded in 1377) and a holy well at Venton-Vedna. The Vicar of Porthleven in the 1850s was the Rev. Thomas Lockyer Williams, a Tractarian who introduced practices into the parish which provoked dislike in the Rev. Canon John Rogers of Penrose, Rector of Mawnan and a canon of Exeter.

For local-government purposes, Porthleven was included within the nearby town of Helston, until many years of growth gained it a town council of its own. Its population at the United Kingdom Census 2001 was 3,190.

Porthleven&#x27;s most recognisable building is the Bickford-Smith Institute next to the pier and harbour entrance. It was built on the site of the old Fisherman&#x27;s Arms and was opened on 16 December 1884. The clock tower on the west corner is high. The building originally had a reading room, a committee room, a curator&#x27;s living room and two bedrooms. The Institute was grade II listed on 18 March 1991 and currently houses the town council and a snooker club. It featured (along with various other scenes from the town) as the incident room in an episode of the TV detective series &quot;Wycliffe&quot;. A picture of the building against a large breaking wave sometimes appears in the background of BBC UK weather forecasts, particularly when windy conditions and rough seas are expected. The Institute has a plaque to Guy Gibson VC, leader of the Dambuster Raid, on the wall facing the harbour. Gibson was born in India, but saw Porthleven – his mother&#x27;s home town, where his parents were married – as a home town as well. He visited there while on leave during the war, sometimes attending the Porthleven Methodist Church. His name is marked on the community&#x27;s war memorial (he was killed in 1944) and a street (Gibson Way) is named after him.

===The harbour===

William Cookworthy acquired leases on the Tregonning Hill quarries and shipped china clay to his porcelain factory in Plymouth. In 1826, 150 tons of china stone and 30 tons of china clay were exported, and in 1838, 500 tons of china stone. By 1876, 970 tons were exported and in 1883, 1002 tons. Granite was also exported, from the quarries at Coverack Bridges and Sithney.

Fifty-two fishing boats were built between 1877 and 1883, employing at times up to twenty people. They ranged in length from to and were built not only for Mount&#x27;s Bay ports, but for others in the UK and in South Africa.

Overnight on 12–13 December 1978, Police Constables Joseph James Childs and Martin Ross Reid of Devon and Cornwall Police were killed when their patrol car was swept into the harbour during a heavy storm. A stone memorial was erected on the south-facing harbour wall.

===Lifeboat===
Due to the prevailing westerly winds, it was easy for a ship under sail to be trapped in Mount&#x27;s Bay and wrecked nearby. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened Porthleven Lifeboat Station in 1863. A boat house was built at Breageside, from where the boat was taken to the water on a carriage. The &quot;Agar Robartes&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Charles Henry Wright&quot; (named after the donor) in November 1882. A boat house on the west side of the harbour entrance was opened in 1894, with a slipway to ease launching. The station was closed in 1929, as the neighbouring stations at and had been equipped with motor lifeboats that could cover the whole bay. The slipway was dismantled and the boat house used as a store for a while. It has since become the Shipwreck Centre museum.

==Protected areas==
Three of the four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) close to Porthleven, and the Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites are designated for their geological interest. They are Porthleven Cliffs SSSI, Porthleven Cliffs East SSSI, and Wheal Penrose SSSI. The Giant&#x27;s Rock, within Porthleven Cliffs SSSI, is a glacial erratic of unknown origin and unknown means of arrival, is near the entrance of Porthleven harbour. Wheal Penrose SSSI is a disused lead mine to the south with &quot;examples of typical lead zone mineralisation&quot;. The fourth, Loe Pool, is Cornwall&#x27;s largest natural lake, formed by a barrier beach known as Loe Bar which dams the River Cober.

Porthleven (like almost a third of Cornwall) lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Sport and leisure==
Porthleven has exploited its location and powerful swells to become one of Britain&#x27;s best-known surfing spots, described as &quot;Cornwall&#x27;s best reef break&quot;. Waves often exceeding break on a shallow reef that was shaped by blasting the harbour. Kayaking is also popular. RNLI lifeguards patrol the beach in the holiday season. The beach is separated from the harbour by a granite pier in front of the Porthleven Institute and clock tower. When the tide is out it is possible to walk about three miles east along Porthleven beach. There is also a coastal path with views of the beach below.

Porthleven Bowling Club is based at Methleigh Parc and affiliated to Bowls Cornwall and Bowls England. It was founded in 1959 and has lawn bowling and short-mat bowls facilities. The club and its members compete within Cornwall and nationally, and there are in-house competitions.

Porthleven has a non-league football club in the South West Peninsula League, which operates at levels 10 and 11 of the English football league system. The club&#x27;s home ground is at Gala Parc.

The traditional place for Cornish wrestling prize tournaments held in Porthleven in the 19th century was the &quot;Wrestling Field&quot;, now marked by a plaque. More recently tournaments have been held in the Recreation Ground.

The restaurateur Rick Stein opened a restaurant in the town, now taken over by fellow chef, Michael Caines.

==Twinning==
Porthleven is twinned with Guissény in Brittany, France.

==Notable residents==

Porthleven was the birthplace of the Victorian theologian Pender Hodge Cudlip and of David Jewell, an independent school headmaster in the late 20th century.

Porthleven was the home town of the Dambusters&#x27; commanding officer Guy Gibson. There is a road named in his memory. The Porthleven-born motor racing driver Chris Craft competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race for over a decade, including a third-placed finish in 1976, as well as two races in Formula One.

<doc id="948976" wikidata="Q19360432" url="?curid=948976" title="Lithuanian cuisine">
<text>Lithuanian cuisine features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of pickling were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Eastern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northeastern European countries. 

Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country&#x27;s history formed Lithuanian cuisine.

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (&quot;kugelis&quot; or kugel) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (&quot;vėdarai&quot;), as well as the baroque tree cake known as &quot;Šakotis&quot;. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs; French cuisine influence came to Lithuania in this way. The most exotic influence is Eastern (Karaite) cuisine, and the dish &quot;kibinai&quot; which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations that lived in Grand Duchy of Lithuania also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Russian and Polish cuisines.

==History of Lithuanian cuisine==

The earliest mentions of food and agriculture of the Baltic people (Aestii) and related customs comes from Tacitus circa 98 AD: &quot;they cultivate grain and other crops with a perseverance unusual among the indolent Germans.&quot;

The 9th-century traveler Wulfstan attested usage of mead among West Balts: &quot;There is a great deal of honey and fishing. The king and the most powerful men drink mare&#x27;s milk, the poor men and the slaves drink mead. ... There is no ale brewed among the Este but there is plenty of mead.&quot;

In the 14th century, Lithuania almost all today known cereals and legume were grown, but rye was the most popular, since it was easier to grow in the Northern European climate and the crop was more predictable. In the hillfort of Maišiagala in the layer of 13–14th century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legumes were found – winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, millet, buckwheat, lentil, vetches, peas, broad beans.

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that Vytautas The Great before the Battle of Žalgiris organized a big hunting in the Baltvyžis forest and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: wisents, aurochs, and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great, in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs. The Congress of Lutsk, hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by Nicolaus Hussovianus in his Latin poem &quot;Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis&quot; (&quot;A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison&quot;, 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with Bona Sforza, Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food – olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach, and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania had their own kitchen garden.
Daughter of Bona Sforza, Catherine Jagiellon after marrying John III of Sweden introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden. Son of Bona Sforza Sigismund II Augustus had an Italian chef Sigismondo Fanelli, living in Vilnius, Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.
The court account books of Alexander Jagiellon mention court officials also associated with the kitchen: the titles Master of the Kitchen was the magnate Petras Aleknaitis, while the actual functions of the kitchen-master were carried by kitchen senior Raclovas, other Kitchen Master is also mentioned – Mikalojus Jundilaitis and the Carver Butrimas Jokūbaitis Nemiraitis. In the 16th century, a water pipe was built from Vingriai springs straight to the kitchen of Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius.
In the sale contract made in 1623 by Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg, wife of Jonušas Radvila and Jonušas Kiška, she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, plums (&quot;prunus domestica&quot;), cherries, wild cherries, vitis, hawthorns, dog roses. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, artichokes, asparagus, lamb&#x27;s lettuce, rucola, garden cress, spinach, melons, beets, rushes, French parsley, Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, estragon, dill, true indigo and junipers. Wooden orangerie is also mentioned which was used to grow fig-trees and common walnuts. In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums, imported ginger, cinnamon, almonds and pepper.

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.

Archeological finds at the place of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania revealed a lot of information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist Jurgis Pabrėža described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th-century and 19th-century recipes &quot;à la Lithuanienne&quot; appeared in the French culinary books. The romantic image of Lithuania was associated with lush forests and game – no wonder the recipes &quot;à la Lithuanienne&quot; were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear, or grey partridge. &quot;La Cuisine classique&quot; by Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard, published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and sauce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit &quot;La gastronomie en Russie&quot;, published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes.

In the twentieth century in interwar Lithuania, many girls attended &quot;Amatų mokykla&quot; (The Trade School), where young women were trained to prepare various types of dishes and learned various recipes, proper table manners, economy and running the household. These schools led to spreading of similar recipes throughout the country.

During the past years, restaurants in Lithuania emerged which specialize in historic Lithuanian cuisine, culinary heritage and its interpretations.

==Bread==

One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread was eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark rye bread (&quot;ruginė duona&quot;) which is used more often than light wheat breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread. The dough is usually based on a sourdough starter, and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast – , which also had symbolical meaning of the home. Rye bread is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, buttered or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with caraway, or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on sweet flag leaves. Bread baking was considered an important ritual. Bread was baked in a special oven for bread - &quot;duonkepė krosnis&quot;.
Lithuanian proverb says - &quot;Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne&quot; (&quot;One can manage without gold, but not without bread&quot;).

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as &quot;grūdėtoji&quot;, i.e. &quot;seeded&quot; bread.

==Vegetables and spices==

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the potato; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with dill, but a tremendous variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

Cucumbers, dill pickles, radishes and greens are quite popular. Beets (&quot;burokai&quot;) are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making borscht and side dishes. Cabbage is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for soups, or wrapped around fillings (&quot;balandėliai&quot;). Tomatoes are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. Sorrel is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, horseradish (), dill (), caraway seed (), garlic, coriander, oregano, bay leaf, juniper berries (), hemp seeds and fruit essences. Vanilla and pepper were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.

Linseed oil was moderately popular.

==Foraging==

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is still alive.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the Dzūkija region from Druskininkai to Vilnius; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms are used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:
* &quot;Baravykas&quot; – king bolete;
* &quot;Voveraitė&quot; (literally, &quot;little squirrel&quot;), &quot;lepeška&quot; (in Dzūkija region) – chanterelle;
* &quot;Gudukas&quot;, &quot;vokietukas&quot;, &quot;kalpokas&quot;, &quot;vištelė&quot; – gypsy mushroom.

&quot;Baravykas&quot; is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried &quot;baravykas&quot; has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. &quot;Voveraitė&quot; is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. The most common dish using this mushroom is &quot;voveraitė&quot; sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. &quot;Gudukas&quot;, arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as &quot;lepšė&quot; (Leccinum scabrum), &quot;raudonviršis&quot; or &quot;raudonikis&quot; (literally, &quot;red-topped&quot;) (Leccinum aurantiacum), &quot;makavykas&quot; (Suillus variegatus), &quot;šilbaravykis&quot; (Xerocomus badius), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as &quot;baravykas&quot;.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. Bilberries (&quot;mėlynės&quot;) and lingonberries (&quot;bruknės&quot;) are the two most abundant species of wild berries. Cranberries (&quot;spanguolės&quot;) are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to Čepkeliai Marsh. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (&quot;blynai&quot;). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. Wild strawberries (&quot;žemuogės&quot;) are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

==Fruit==

Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit. Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (). Gooseberries () and currants () are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese, which is considered a dessert, is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of Radvila family chef from the 17th century. Sea buckthorn is used for juice and as a garnish.

==Meat==

The most frequently used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, and duck; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. Skilandis is a popular Lithuanian sausage and the original production form has been registered as an EU and UK Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under the name &quot;Lietuviškas skilandis&quot;. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania – the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. &quot;Skilandis&quot; was smoked for four weeks in a special room – &quot;kaminas&quot; – which was used for cooking. Smoking, curing and other meat preparation techniques differ in Lithuanian regions.

==Fish==

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as pike, zander or perch, are often baked whole or stuffed. Herring is marinated, baked, fried, or served in aspic. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, Stavanger. Salmon is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as eel or bream are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the Baltic Sea, especially in Neringa.

Crayfish are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.

==Dairy products==

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream are unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads, and so on. The sour cream &quot;Žemaitiškas kastinys&quot; is registered in the EU and UK as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG).

Lithuanian curd snacks called &quot;sūreliai&quot; are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk. A Milk road route was created which leads through important objects of milk production in Lithuania.

===Milk and milk derivatives===
There is a large variety of milk products—milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cream, and yogurt. The most traditional are buttermilk and soured milk, which are eaten with boiled potatoes.

===Cheese===

The traditional Lithuanian curd cheese &quot;Lietuviškas varškės sūris&quot; has been registered as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in the EU and UK. The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of Samogitia. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not many varieties of cheese in Lithuania, due to low levels of lactose intolerance. Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese &quot;Liliputas&quot; in 2015 was registered as an EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Hard cheese &quot;Džiugas&quot; ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmets and being used as to flavour recipes. &quot;Džiugas&quot; in 2019 was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication. In the interwar period Šėta was famous for its cheese, which was made in &quot;sūrinė&quot; (&quot;cheese house&quot;).
Small family farms throughout Lithuania also producing various types of artisan cheeses being sold in eco and farmer markets, restaurants.

==Regional cuisine==

Lithuania consists of five regions: Lithuania Minor (&quot;Mažoji Lietuva&quot;), Samogitia (&quot;Žemaitija&quot;), Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija.

Lithuania minor was famous for its fish, mainly freshwater – it was smoked, salted, roasted, dried. The best fish-soup, in Lithuania, similar to Bouillabaisse is also prepared in Lithuania Minor. 
Samogitia is known for its abundant varieties of porridge, crayfish, &quot;kastinis&quot; and a herring-onion soup &quot;cibulinė&quot;. 
Aukštaitija is known for potato dishes and &quot;vėdarai&quot;; Northern Aukštaitija is best known as a beer region of Lithuania. 
Suvalkija is known for quality smoked meat produce – variety of woods being used to gain subtle taste, some produce being smoked up to one month. 
Dzūkija, the most forested region is famous for mushrooms, berries, buckwheat dishes such as buckwheat cake (&quot;grikinė boba&quot;) and boletus soup. Meat curing by smoking is not practiced in Dzûkija. Instead, the salted cuts of meat remain in brine or are hung and air-dried.

Different types of woods were used for smoking the meat - in Samogitia and Aukštaitija alder tree with combination of juniper was used, in Suvalkija - only alder.

==Formal meal structure==

A structure of a Lithuanian meal in its full form, usually performed during festivities.

;Cold table

Slices of meat charcuterie, small types of salad, herring will be offered. The meal is usually cold, not warm.
Several types of various cold dishes will be served to choose from. It could be accompanied with some appetizer
such as bitter liquor.

;Soup

Soup is a very important part of Lithuania cuisine. Although it does not get much attention as the main dish, its purpose is to
be pleasant and revitalizing.

;Main dish

Main dish is served hot. It could be roasted chicken, beef or a type of main dish which the host is the most 
proud to present to the guests. Beer or wine will be offered with the main dish.

;Dessert

Dessert is served after some time after the main dish. It could be some sort of cake or curd with berries or jam.

;Coffee or tea

Coffee or tea could be served along with dessert or separately.

;Digestive

If guests are spending time at the table having interesting conversations digestive or more coffee or tea will be offered.

The meal structure of the day is also influenced by the ancient life in the farm or village. Usual workday was split into three parts - 
the work from the early morning till breakfast (&quot;pusryčiai&quot;), work before breakfast and dinner (&quot;pietūs&quot;) and work between dinner and evening meal (vakarienė). Breakfast was considered the most filling meal, dinner was considered a lighter meal and the evening meal was the lightest.
In the summer then the workday was the longest, light meal before breakfast (&quot;priešpusryčiai&quot;) and the meal before dinner and evening meal - &quot;pavakariai&quot; was provided. Up to this day Lithuanians eat quite filling breakfast and really light evening meals.

===Desserts===
Lithuanian-style cakes (&quot;pyragas&quot;) are often baked in a rectangular pan and sometimes have an apple, plum, apricot, or other fruit baked in; they are less frequently iced than is customary in the United States. These cakes are cut into squares for serving. Poppy seed is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread (Poppy seed roll and šimtalapis) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

For special occasions, torte may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, mocha, or rum buttercreams; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (&quot;kavinė&quot;) serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

Desserts include:
*&quot;Žagarėliai&quot; (also known as or ) – Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian Klejner cookies, similar to Mexican buñuelo.
*&quot;Kūčiukai&quot; or – very small rolls are baked and served with poppyseed milk; this is a traditional Kūčios&#x27; (Christmas Eve) dish.
*&quot;Ledai&quot; – ice cream is served everywhere in the summer.

==Drinks==

===Beer===


&quot;Alus (beer)&quot; is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic festivities and rituals. Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was &quot;Ragutis&quot; or &quot;Rūgutis&quot;. 21 September was known as the festive &quot;Alutinis&quot;, &quot;Koštuvės&quot; or &quot;Ragautuvės&quot;; the first beer was made using the harvest of the running year. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions. Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

===Midus===

&quot;Midus&quot; is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of mead made from honey. Baltic people were making &quot;midus&quot; for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller Wulfstan of Hedeby, who visited Prussians. Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian &quot;midus&quot; was recorded in a book by Olaus Magnus &quot;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&quot;, published in Rome in 1555. &quot;Midus&quot; was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century &quot;midus&quot; started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Today &quot;Midus&quot; is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian &quot;midus&quot; &quot;Stakliškės&quot;, fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.

===Fruit and berry wines===

Fruit and berry wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in Anykščiai. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

===Other===
*&quot;Arbata (tea)&quot; – chamomile, rosehip, thyme and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea if not more widespread. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes. Tea parties were popular in the interbellum Lithuania especially among high society.
*&quot;Gira (kvass)&quot; is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian kvass. Those brewed from rye bread and from caraway seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.
* &quot;Sula&quot; (birch sap) is a traditional drink, popular in summer.
*&quot;Degtinė (&quot;the burn&quot;)&quot; is the Lithuanian version of vodka, traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-distilled.
*&quot;Kava (coffee)&quot; is brewed in espresso makers or moka pots at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (&quot;kavinė&quot;) can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made &quot;gilių kava&quot; (acorn coffee) – a substitute for natural bean coffee which is still sold in a special shops as a delicacy. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius. Coffee culture was flourishing in 19th century in Lithuania. It was a prestige to have a special room for coffee drinking and a dedicated person who prepared coffee. First known caffes were established in Ribiškės and Lentvaris manors. Naturalist Georg Forster during his visit in Merkinė already tried coffee in local coffeehouse and wrote about it as of &quot;good quality&quot;. Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas in the 20th century.
*&quot;Starka&quot;, an aged vodka, as well as Krupnikas, a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th–18th centuries.
*&quot;Trauktinė&quot; (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. &quot;Trejos devynerios&quot; (&quot;999&quot;), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.
* &quot;Vynas&quot; (wine) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania – wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition &quot;Vyno dienos&quot; (&quot;Days of Wine&quot;) taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn&#x27;t very friendly for growing grapevines.

==Special occasions==
Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.

*Easter (&quot;Velykos&quot;) – The intricately painted Easter eggs that were prepared earlier in the week are eaten for breakfast. The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.
*Birthdays (&quot;Gimtadieniai&quot;) – The family&#x27;s favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one&#x27;s own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John&#x27;s Day (Joninės), June 23.
*Christmas Eve (Kūčios) – Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in Catholic Eastern Europe, but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.
*Weddings (&quot;Vestuvės&quot;) – The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a šakotis is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.
*Funerals (&quot;Šermenys&quot;) – The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners called at a restaurant or other similar venue.
*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties – The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian smorgasbord, topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host&#x27;s or hostess&#x27;s own family recipe, may be served.

==Contemporary cuisine and restaurants==
Currently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends—fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, and craft food. Restaurant culture and fine dining is most advanced in bigger cities—Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda. Every year, the 30 best Lithuanian restaurants are selected by &quot;Gero maisto akademija&quot; (&quot;Good Food Academy&quot;).

<text>NPL is a functional programming language with pattern matching designed by Rod Burstall and John Darlington in 1977. The language allows certain sets and logic constructs to appear on the right hand side of definitions, e.g.

 setofeven(X) &lt;= &lt;:x: x in X &amp; even(x) :&gt;

The NPL interpreter evaluates the list of generators from left to right so conditions can mention any bound variables that occur to their left. These were known as set comprehensions. NPL eventually evolved into Hope but lost set comprehensions, which made a reappearance in the form of list comprehensions in later functional languages.

<text>The Cornish pilot gig is a six-oar rowing boat, clinker-built of Cornish narrow-leaf elm, long with a beam of . It is recognised as one of the first shore-based lifeboats that went to vessels in distress, with recorded rescues going as far back as the late 17th century. The original purpose of the Cornish pilot gig was as a general work boat, and the craft is used as a pilot boat, taking pilots out to incoming vessels off the Atlantic Coast. At the time pilots would compete between each other for work; the fastest gig crew who got their pilot on board a vessel first would get the job, and hence the payment.

There is a World Pilot Gig championship held in the Isles of Scilly each year at the beginning of May. 

==History==
According to Richard Gillis, the first Cornish pilot gig was built at Polvarth, St Mawes in 1790 by the Peters family. The maritime historian Basil Greenhill simply states that little is known about the origins of this type. 

The working gig was planked with narrow-leaf elm from carefully selected trees. This was hand-sawn into quarter-inch (6.4 mm) thick planks, a job done with a high degree of accuracy. American elm was usually used for the keel and timbers, though some were built with oak keels. The overall length of most working gigs varied between ; the length was limited by the size of tree that could be found, since the Peters family (the major builder) insisted on no more than one scarph per strake. Whilst most had a beam, those intended for salvage work or general carrying would have more, with some examples ranging from up to or more.

As experience of gigs developed, they were built with a slight upward bend in the thwarts (by installing a pillar down to the keel), so that if the boat received a sharp blow to the side, the thwart could flex upwards a little instead of punching through the side of the hull and doing serious damage. Early gigs were built with very high quality copper nails and roves whose durability was not matched by those used in later years.

The working gig had a two-masted sailing rigusually a dipping or standing lug on the main and a standing lug or spritsail on the mizzen. The oars were made of ash and were long, in some instances . These were optimised for long-distance rowing and were used with a slower stroke than today&#x27;s racing boats (which have shorter silver spruce oars).

The work for gigs ranged from taking pilots out to ships, salvage work, visiting damaged ships to get them to book repairs at the shipyard that owned the gig, taking out cargo samplers to grain ships (the quality of the sample was used in selling the cargo) and a range of miscellaneous transport tasks. Where-ever more than one gig was heading out to any speculative job, they were racing for the work as it was customary for the ship&#x27;s captain to employ the first to arrive. This could involve various subterfuges to overcome the competition. A night-time departure may involve a gig crew setting off down the street to their boat in their stockinged feet so as not to wake another crew. St Mawes gigs would position themselves in a cove from which they could see Falmouth gigs departingthis gave them a head start if the Falmouth boat was heading for a desirable-looking target.

==Pilot gigs today==

Today, pilot gigs are used primarily for sport, with around 100 clubs across the globe. The main concentration is within Cornwall, Devon and the Isles of Scilly, however clubs exist in Suffolk, Sussex, Somerset, Hampshire, Dorset, Wales and London. Internationally, there are pilot gig clubs in France, the Netherlands, the Faroe Islands, Australia, Bermuda, and the United States.
All modern racing gigs are based on the &quot;Treffry&quot;, built in 1838 by William Peters of St Mawes, and still owned and raced by the Newquay Rowing Club. She was built for the Treffry Company, new owners of Newquay harbour. However non-racing gigs have been built which do not conform to the exact specification of the &quot;Treffry&quot; and are disallowed from racing in competitive races.
The sport is governed by the Cornish Pilot Gig Association, which monitors all racing gigs during the construction phase. The Association&#x27;s Standards Officer is responsible for measuring every gig at least three times during construction, to ensure that it conforms to the Standard set by the Association. Gigs are crewed by six rowers, and helmed by a coxswain. Modern gig racing dates from 1986, the founding of the CPGA, and the codification of class rules for the construction of new gigs.

In 2018 the 200th gig was registered on the CPGA register, built by W.C. Hunkin and Sons of Fowey. A new gig, complete with trailer and all equipment, costs over £32,000. From 2017, the CPGA has encouraged a &#x27;Club In A Box&#x27; scheme. This includes a fibreglass gig, which is much cheaper than a traditionally-built wooden gig and allows a club to form and begin training and fundraising for a competitive boat.

As of 2023, pilot gig racing is becoming more popular in the United States, especially on the New England coast where whaling was a major industry. These boats, however, are less regulated than their British counterparts. While modern rowing technology is considered inappropriate, there are no strict rules as to what can and cannot be raced. Boats are classed by number of rowers and their approximate age. The rules are also different during the race; generally &quot;fisherman&#x27;s rules&quot; apply—meaning that there are no rules.

Recently (2024), there has been a demand for more readily available information about gig rowing, leading to the creation of the &#x27;GigRower&#x27; website. This website, along with their social media pages, work with the CPGA to provide gig rowing news, information, and live streams of championships to the increasing number of gig rowers around the globe.

==World championships==

Since 1990, the World Pilot Gig Championships have been held annually on the Isles of Scilly. Held over the Early May bank holiday weekend, they are attended by over 2000 rowers and spectators. It is widely believed to be the busiest weekend on the islands, with an approximate doubling of population.

==Pilot gig clubs==
Pilot gig clubs are mostly located by the sea although there some that have been established at riverside locations. Pilot gig clubs might also have other types of rowing and sailing vessels. The majority of clubs are in the West Country, however clubs exist in Suffolk, Sussex, Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Wales and London. Internationally, there are pilot gig clubs in France, the Netherlands, the Faroe Islands, Australia, Bermuda, and the United States.

Many pilot gig clubs compete with each other through a series of events through the summer in the West Country, most notably at World Pilot Gig Championships. This is held at the Isle of Scilly, due to its prevalence there, as well as the historical impact the Isle of Scilly have on the sport. Other, more specific championships are held throughout the year at different clubs across the West Country, normally coinciding with &quot;regattas&quot; held by the clubs, which run mainly on an invitational basis.

88 pilot gig clubs are members of the Cornish Pilot Gig Association.

<doc id="949002" wikidata="Q5394174" url="?curid=949002" title="Strongman Super Series">
<text>The Strongman Super Series, known from 2001 to 2004 as the &quot;IFSA World Strongman Super Series&quot;, from 2005 to 2008 as the &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man Super Series&quot;, and reverting in 2009 to the &quot;World Strongman Super Series&quot;, is a sequence of grand prix events in the sport of strength athletics. It was introduced in 2001 in response to concerns that, unlike other individual sports such as golf or tennis, there was no recognized international &quot;tour&quot; in strength athletics. The Strongman Super Series ensures that there are a number of high-profile, professionally run contests during the year, with competitors&#x27; placings being used to decide the overall Super Series Champion.

Typically, ten to twelve athletes take part in each GP, comprising the top six in the international rankings and at least four qualifiers or wildcard entries. The winner of each grand prix receives ten series points, the second placed, nine, and so on. The highest scoring competitor at the end of the series is named World Champion.

World Class Events (&quot;WCE&quot;) ran the Super Series in co-operation with the International Federation of Strength Athletes (&quot;IFSA&quot;) from 2001 to 2004 until IFSA cut ties with WCE and World&#x27;s Strongest Man and began promoting their own grand prix events and world championships. In 2005, WCE signed a deal with Trans World International (&quot;TWI&quot;), the world&#x27;s largest independent producer and distributor of sports programming, to have the exclusive rights worldwide to be the only qualifying tour to the MET-Rx World&#x27;s Strongest Man event for 2005–2008. The top four athletes from each Grand Prix competition receive an automatic invitation to WSM.

On April 27, 2009 Giants Live, an arena-based series of live strongman competitions, was named the Official World&#x27;s Strongest Man Qualifying Tour for 2009–2011, thus taking over from the Strongman Super Series in this regard. The first 2009 qualifying event took place on May 17 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, and the second event being the Viking Power competition in Norway, and finishing off the 2009 season in Poland.

==Super Series World Champions==

===2001===

The International Federation of Strength Athletes co-produced the Strongman Super Series events from 2001 to 2004 along with World Class Events (WCE)/Ulf Bengtsson.


===2002===


===2003===


===2004===
===2005===
Beginning in 2005, WSM/WCE cut all ties with IFSA, who had begun promoting their own separate grand prix events and world championships. The Strongman Super Series then became known as the &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man Super Series&quot; and was the official qualifying tour for World&#x27;s Strongest Man from 2005 to 2008.

===2006===
===2007===

<doc id="949007" wikidata="Q1207587" url="?curid=949007" title="Dhāraṇā">
<text>Dhāraṇā () is the sixth limb of eight elucidated by Patanjali&#x27;s Ashtanga Yoga or Raja Yoga in his &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;. It is directing and maintaining the mind&#x27;s attention to a specific location of the body after sense-withdrawl has been attained.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dhāraṇā&quot; is translated as &quot;firmness, steadfastness, certainty,&quot; as &quot;the act of holding, bearing, wearing, supporting, maintaining, retaining, keeping back (in remembrance), a good memory,&quot; and also as &quot;collection or concentration of the mind (joined with the retention of breath).&quot; This term is related to the verbal Sanskrit roots &quot;dha&quot; and &quot;ana&quot;, to hold, carry, maintain, resolve. Dharana is the noun.

==Yoga Sutras==
Yoga Sutras verse III.1 states &quot;deśa-bandhaś cittasya dhāraņā&quot;, meaning:
* &quot;deśa&quot;: &quot;place&quot; &quot;location,&quot; &quot;spot&quot;
* &quot;bandhaś&quot; (&quot;bandhah&quot;): &quot;bound, fixed&quot;
* &quot;cittasya&quot;: &quot;of the mind,&quot; &quot;whose mind,&quot; &quot;senses&quot;
* &quot;dhāraņā&quot;: &quot;concentration,&quot; &quot;maintain&quot;

According to Bryant, in Yoga Sutras verse III.1 Patanjali defines &quot;dharana&quot; as &quot;concentration is the fixing of the mind in one place,&quot; maintaining the mind&#x27;s attention in one fixed place.

==Interpretation==
In the commentarial tradition, &quot;dhāraṇā&quot; is interpreted as &quot;holding&quot;, &quot;holding steady&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot;, or &quot;single focus.&quot; The &quot;Yogabhashya&quot; in its commentary on Yoga Sutras verse III.1 mentions focal points like the navel or the heart, while later commentators like Vacaspati Misra and Ramananda Sarasvati refer to the Vishnu Purana, which highlights theistic meditation, particularly visualizing Vishnu&#x27;s form.

==Practice==
The prior limb Pratyahara involves withdrawing the senses from external phenomena. &quot;Dhāraṇā&quot; builds further upon this by refining it further to &quot;ekagrata&quot; or &quot;ekagra chitta&quot;, that is continuous, uninterrupted lucid awareness. The commentarial tradition interprets it as single-pointed concentration and focus, which is in this context cognate with Samatha. Gregor Maehle defines Dharana as: &quot;The mind thinks about one object and avoids other thoughts; awareness of the object is still interrupted.&quot; The difference between &quot;Dhāraṇā&quot;, Dhyāna, and Samādhi, which together are called Samyama, is a gradual one of intensity and uninterruptedness.

<text>ALGOL Y was the name given to a speculated successor for the ALGOL 60 programming language that incorporated some radical features that were rejected for ALGOL 68 and ALGOL X. ALGOL Y was intended to be a &quot;radical reconstruction&quot; of ALGOL.

One such feature was the possibility to construct new codice_1&#x27;s at run-time, which was criticized as the &quot;ability to modify its own programs at run time&quot; while, on the other hand, it would have brought ALGOL Y to the same level of expressiveness as LISP.

&quot;Initially the proposal for an update to Algol was Algol X, with Algol Y being the name reserved for
the corresponding metalanguage. Van Wijngaarden produced a paper for the 1963 IFIP programming language
committee, entitled “Generalized Algol,” which contained the basic concepts which were eventually
incorporated into Algol 68.&quot;

<text>Johan Ernst Gunnerus (26 February 1718 – 25 September 1773) was a Norwegian bishop and botanist. Gunnerus was born at Christiania. He was bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros from 1758 until his death and also a professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen.

== Biography ==
Gunnerus was born and raised in Christiania in Norway. He enrolled at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark in 1737, but had to postpone his studies for three years because of poverty. He studied in Copenhagen from 1740, at Halle in Germany from 1742, and at Jena from 1744, where he received his Magister degree in 1745 and in 1753 was admitted to the Faculty of Philosophy. At Jena he published extensively, notably a work on natural and international law in eight volumes. In 1754 he was recalled to Denmark and appointed Professor and Rector at Herlufsholm. In 1758 he became Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros in Trondheim, Norway.

Gunnerus was very interested in natural history and accumulated a large collection of specimens from visits to central and northern Norway. He also encouraged others to send him specimens. Together with the historians Gerhard Schöning and Peter Frederik Suhm he founded the Trondheim Society in 1760. In 1767 it received royal recognition and became the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.

Gunnerus was vice President and Director Perpetuus of the Society from 1767 to 1773. The society began publishing its journal in 1761, entitled &quot;Det Trondhiemske Selskabs Skrifter&quot;, still published today as &quot;Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskabs Skrifter&quot;. In 1765 Gunnerus published a description of a basking shark in this journal, giving it the scientific name &quot;Squalus maximius&quot;.

Gunnerus was the author of &quot;Flora Norvegica&quot; (1766–1776). He contributed notes on the ornithology of northern Norway to Knud Leem&#x27;s &quot;Beskrivelse over Finmarkens Lapper&quot; (1767), translated into English in 1808 as &quot;An Account of the Laplanders of Finmark&quot;. In this Gunnerus was the first person to give a scientific name to the Greenshank. Gunnerus discussed a number of his findings with Carolus Linnæus, mainly known as Carl von Linné, with whom he was in correspondence. The original letters from Carolus Linnæus are held at the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in Trondheim, while the ones from Gunnerus to Linnæus are found at the Linnean Society of London.

Gunnerus was the first to suggest that since the northern lights were caused by the Sun, there also had to be auroras around the moon, Venus and Mercury.

In 1766, Gunnerus was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Legacy==
The plant genus &quot;Gunnera&quot; was named after him, as well as the Gunnerus Library.

<text>Pratyahara () or the &#x27;gathering towards&#x27; is the fifth element among the Eight stages of Patanjali&#x27;s Ashtanga Yoga, as mentioned in his classical work, &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; composed in the 2nd century BCE. It is also the first stage of the six-branch yoga (&quot;ṣaḍaṅgayoga&quot;) of the Buddhist Kālacakra tantra, where it refers to the withdrawal of the five senses from external objects to be replaced by the mentally created senses of an enlightened deity. This phase is roughly analogous to the physical isolation (&quot;kāyaviveka&quot;, Tib. &quot;lus bden&quot;) phase of Guhyasamāja tantra.

For Patanjali, it is a bridge between the &quot;bahiranga&quot; (external) aspects of yoga namely, yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, and the &quot;antaranga&quot; (internal) yoga. Having actualized the pratyahara stage, a practitioner is able to effectively engage into the practice of Samyama. At the stage of pratyahara, the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the senses of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don&#x27;t reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the practitioner to the next stages of Yoga, namely Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and samadhi (unification of mind), leading to the recognition (&quot;kaivalyam&quot;) of Purusha which is the aim of Patanjali&#x27;s Yogic practices.

==Etymology==
Pratyahara is derived from two Sanskrit words: &#x27; and &#x27;, with meaning gathering, and , a preposition meaning towards. Together they mean &quot;checking the outgoing powers of the mind, freeing it from the thraldom of the senses &quot;.

==Types of Pratyahara==
===Withdrawal of senses or Indriya Pratyahara===
This involves withdrawal of senses, or sensory inputs into our physical being, coming from our five senses, namely organs creating a sensory overload, and hence hinders collection of the mind, as in Dharana, the next stage of Yoga 

One of the most common practices for withdrawal of the senses is bringing the attention inwards towards the breath, observing it without trying to control it, as connection with the external senses and stimuli are all gradually severed. Another method is to concentrate on the point between the eyebrows, the Ajna chakra or third eye. Another common technique is to first reduce physical stimuli, then concentrate on one sense, such as hearing. The mind has a natural tendency to roam between the sensory inputs. In this situation, as there are no longer any other significant sensory inputs, when the mind gets tired of hearing, it is forced to turn inward. Pratyahara may make use of a meditation seat, such as Padmasana (lotus position), combined with Pranayama breath-control, Kumbhaka, and progressively more subtle internal objects of focus as the practitioner becomes more advanced. At the start, the objects are &quot;gross&quot;, directly available to sense perception, such as the points of focus (drishti) used to accompany yoga asana practice, including the space between the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, or the navel. More subtle objects may then be selected, such as the chakras, together with their attributes including position, colour, and number of petals.

===Withdrawal of Prana or Prana Pratyahara===
Control of our senses requires mastery over the flow of prana, as that is what drives the senses. To stop the scattering of valuable vital energy of the body or prana, we need to seek control over its flow, and harmonize it. This is done through various practices including bringing the entire focus to a single point in the body.

These two lead to the subsequent two types of pratyahara, the Control of Action or &#x27;Karma pratyahara&#x27;, which entails not just control of motor organs, but also right action or work, and Karma Yoga, surrender of every action to the divine and performing it as an act of service. This leads to the final form of pratyahara - the Withdrawal of Mind or &#x27;Mano pratyahara&#x27;, which is practiced by consciously withdrawing attention from anything that is unwholesome, and distracting for the mind such as by withdrawing attention from the senses, and directing it inwards

<doc id="949026" wikidata="Q131291" url="?curid=949026" title="Haemodoraceae">
<text>Haemodoraceae is a family of perennial herbaceous angiosperms (flowering plants) containing 15 genera and 102 known species, sometimes known as the &quot;bloodroots&quot;, found throughout the Southern Hemisphere, from Australia and New Guinea to South Africa, as well as the Americas (from extreme southeastern USA through tropical South America). 

Perhaps the best-known (and most popular in cultivation) genera from the family are the unusual &quot;Anigozanthos&quot; and &quot;Macropidia&quot;, both commonly called &quot;kangaroo-paw&quot; or &quot;kangaroo&#x27;s paw&quot; due to their fuzzy flowers. These genera are hugely popular in both private gardens and public landscaping projects in Mediterranean climate regions, such as in Chile, northwestern Mexico (Baja California), Southern California (and the Bay Area) and Western Australia, among other locations; the kangaroo-paws are valued for their hardiness, adaptability and low irrigation requirements, once established.

==Taxonomy==
The Haemodoraceae were first described by Robert Brown in 1810, and bear his name as the botanical authority. An alternative name has been Haemodoreae

The fourth Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (unchanged from the earlier APG systems of 2009, 2003 and 1998), also recognizes this family and places it in the order Commelinales, in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. The family of the Haemodoraceae then includes about sixteen sub-tropical or tropical genera found in the southern hemisphere, two in North America and three known cultivated genera in Europe.

==Description==
Haemodoraceae is characterized by distichous leathery leaves, which are alternate, succulent, rather large and often ensiform, with entire margins and parallel veins. The leaves are enclosed by a sheath with free margins and alternate, distichous (= in two vertical ranks).

The plants are hermaphroditic. Pollinators are primarily insects, but also birds or sometimes a small mammal. The wooly-haired flowers grow at the end of a leaflet stalk, in cymes (with lateral branches), panicles or racemes.

The family is represented in Southwest Australia by extreme diversity, including around six genera that only occur in that region. The endemic species include the kangaroo paws, &quot;Anigozanthos&quot; and &quot;Macropidia&quot;, and the most speciose genus of the family, &quot;Conostylis.

==Genera==
15 genera are accepted.
The term &quot;bloodwort&quot; can also apply to &quot;Sanguinaria canadensis&quot; (more often called bloodroot) or &quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; (more often called yarrow or common yarrow), in other families.

<doc id="949027" wikidata="Q7601273" url="?curid=949027" title="Star of the Guardians">
<text>Star of the Guardians is a series of four science fiction/space opera novels written by Margaret Weis without assistance from usual co-author Tracy Hickman. The original trilogy, &quot;The Lost King&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Test&quot;, and &quot;King&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;, concerns Dion&#x27;s adventures and eventual rise to the throne. A few years later, Margaret Weis realized that, while Dion had achieved his goals, the main characters of the series (sundered lovers Sagan and Maigrey) had not achieved peace, and penned the fourth book, &quot;Ghost Legion&quot;.

She has since completed a trilogy of spin-offs concerning the mercenary team Mag Force 7 introduced in &quot;King&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;. Based originally on The Magnificent Seven, the team developed a much more varied membership just in time to star in their own novels: &quot;The Knights of the Black Earth&quot;, &quot;Robot Blues&quot;, and &quot;Hung Out&quot;. Weis and Don Perrin released a collectible card game under the name &quot;Mag Force 7&quot;.

== The Lost King ==

Seventeen-year-old Dion Starfire has lived on a backwater planet, Syrac 7, with Platus Morianna for his entire life, but that life is about to turn upside down as Sagan has finally found them. Platus contacts Mendaharin &quot;Tusk&quot; Tusca, the son of an old friend, and pays him to take Dion off-planet. Platus himself stays behind and buys time with his life. Tusk and Dion travel to the planet Vangelis to seek the advice of General John Dixter. Sagan, for his part, manages to track down Maigrey Morianna who has also been off-radar for seventeen years. The fact that they were once lovers does not stop him from arresting her as a monarchist and sending her to trial. Sagan then travels to Vangelis to help put down the rebellion (i.e., Dixter&#x27;s forces). Dion goes voluntarily to the Warlord&#x27;s flagship, where Sagan and Maigrey informed him of his true heritage. The novel is punctuated by an attack from the Corasians, an alien race bent on conquering our galaxy.

== King&#x27;s Test ==
Though Dixter&#x27;s mercenaries fought honorably beside Sagan&#x27;s forces to repel the Corasians, Sagan orders them killed at the end of &quot;The Lost King&quot;; at the beginning of &quot;King&#x27;s Test&quot;, which picks up moments after, Dion sallies out to save his friends. He flees with Tusk and Nola (Tusk&#x27;s new girlfriend), though Dixter was captured. Maigrey leaves as well, traveling to the nauseous planet of Laskar, where a weapons magnate named Snaga Ohme has been building a new weapon. This space-rotation bomb, designed by Sagan and intended for his purchase, could theoretically destroy the entire universe. Maigrey buys it by selling her soul, in the form of her starjewel, only to realize that said jewel is the bomb&#x27;s arming key. Meanwhile, Dion, Tusk and Nola travel to Laskar as well, called by a distress call ostensibly from Maigrey, but actually sent by Abdiel, leader and only remaining member of the Order of the Black Lightning. These mind-seizers, as they are informally called, use their Blood Royal telepathy and nanobiotic machines to take control of their followers&#x27; minds. Finally, Sagan arrives as well, having learned that Dion is now in the grip of the most manipulative man alive. The action culminates in a weapons exhibition at Ohme&#x27;s, where Maigrey retrieves her starjewel, Dion publicly declares himself king and Sagan swears his fealty to him, Dion attempts to kill Sagan on Abdiel&#x27;s advice, and Sagan is forced to cede the bomb to his new king. Abdiel, for his part, escapes.

== King&#x27;s Sacrifice ==
This novel is set six months after the previous one. There is no sign of Abdiel—except in the reflection of a water glass standing on the desk of Galactic President Peter Robes. It seems that Abdiel was actually the man who orchestrated the Revolution. Dion is now a public celebrity, but has not managed to take any concrete steps towards establishing his rule. Sagan returns home to the monastery of the Order of Adamant, where he was born (his father had only one lapse in his life, but it clearly bore fruit), as Sagan the Elder lies on his death bed. It turns out to be a trap orchestrated by Abdiel, however. Abdiel takes Sagan to the Corasian galaxy, where he plans on—and will succeed at—prying the secrets of the space-rotation bomb from Sagan&#x27;s head and selling them to the Corasians. Maigrey organizes a rescue mission, while Dion sojourns on the home planet of one of his staunchest supporters, Bear Olefsky, a trip that doubles as Nola&#x27;s and Tusk&#x27;s honeymoon. There he meets Kamil Olefsky, Bear&#x27;s daughter, and they fall in love. Shortly thereafter, however, he is forced to pledge his hand to the daughter of one of his other allies so that Maigrey&#x27;s rescue attempt will succeed. Maigrey collects her supporters, including Brother Daniel, a member of Sagan&#x27;s order, and Xris and his Mag Force 7 team. With Dion&#x27;s eventual backup, she succeeds in rescuing Sagan and slaying Abdiel—but at the cost of several lives, including her own. Sagan, fulfilling a prophecy, is forced to kill her with his own hand to prevent Abdiel&#x27;s final blow from driving her insane. The planetoid is then destroyed; Sagan disappears, presumed lost.

The novel closes with Dion&#x27;s coronation. He welcomes John Dixter into the government as the Lord of Admiralty; says good-bye to Tusk and Nola, the only friends he&#x27;s ever had; prepares to meet his fiancee for the first time and marry her moments after; and welcomes Archbishop Fideles—Brother Daniel—as the new head of the galactic clergy. At the abbey of the Order of Adamant, monks and lay people watch the ceremony with joy, including a new member, Brother Paenitens.

== Ghost Legion ==
Dion, twenty-two years old, has been king of the galaxy for two years. His marriage to his wife Astarte has always been loveless, but recent desperation has caused him to open an illicit affair with Kamil. Xris is contacted by Dixter and asked to investigate an alarming development: something has stolen the space-rotation bomb—and literally walked through walls to do it. Tusk, for his part, is having trouble with his interplanetary taxi service, and is approached—or rather hijacked—by recruiters for a new mercenary army called the Ghost Legion. Maigrey, pacing the celestial halls of heaven, chafes with her inability to influence the mortal plane, and eventually breaks Divine Law to help move things along. When Dion develops a sudden sexual interest in Astarte, she realizes concurrently that he must be having an affair, and also that she herself is pregnant. Archbishop Fideles (formerly Brother Daniel) discovers a troubling secret: that Amodius Starfire, Dion&#x27;s uncle and former ruler of the galaxy, may have had an incestuous heir. Brother Paenitens sheds his cassock for his former life as Derek Sagan and informs Dion of this threat. Sagan then flies to the last known location of explorer Garth Pantha, who took the child off of Amodius&#x27;s hands. There he finds a planet, Vallombrosa, shielded from conventional sensors by life forms made of dark matter. On it, Pantha and Amodius&#x27;s son, Flaim Starfire, await, and to them Sagan swears his allegiance. Finally, Astarte leaves Dion and returns to her mother DiLuna on the planet Ceres.

When DiLuna discovers Dion&#x27;s affair, she sends assassins to kill Kamil, and Astarte hires Xris to help her protect her rival. The two retreat to Ceres, where Astarte is high priestess and can guarantee Kamil diplomatic immunity, to work out some compromise over Dion. They are attacked by members of the Ghost Legion (including the people who hijacked Tusk) and kidnapped from the temple, despite the best efforts of Xris, Raoul, the Little One, Brother Daniel and Kamil herself. Tusk, in the meanwhile, receives the scare of his life when Sagan, disguised as &quot;Lazarus Banquo,&quot; forces him to join the Ghost Legion. Tusk&#x27;s first task is to bring Dion to Vallombrosa, where the cousins finally meet. Flaim has the space-rotation bomb, and he wants Dion to renounce his kingship. When Dion refuses, Flaim sets him up: he has allied with the Corasians, and Dion will heroically die fighting them off. Flaim&#x27;s machinations drive a rift between Dion and Kamil, and his revelation of Astarte&#x27;s pregnancy also bring the couple together on friendly terms for the first time. Sagan creates a series of double-crosses and brings Flaim&#x27;s machinations to their knees: Tusk, after Sagan sets the situation up, convinces Flaim&#x27;s mercenaries to leave his service; Astarte is smuggled off by royalists; Dion, Tusk and Kamil escape; and with Maigrey&#x27;s help, Sagan gives his life to keep Flaim busy while the space-rotation bomb, finally truly armed, ticks its way towards destruction. The dark-matter creatures contain the blast, preventing it from consuming the entire galaxy, but Sagan, Flaim, Pantha and Vallombrosa are gone. Triumphant, the King and Queen return to their thrones; Kamil returns to college, ready to make her own way through the galaxy; Tusk is offered a commission by Dion and Dixter; and Sagan and Maigrey reunite in the afterlife, never again to part, even should all hell bar their way.

== Additional media ==

In addition to the books, Star of the Guardians has been made into a collectible card game by the same name. The game was released by Mag Force 7 in April 1995.

== Mag Force 7 members ==
Xris Cyborg - formerly a Federal agent, Xris (pronounced &#x27;Chris&#x27;) was brutally wounded when an investigation into a criminal organization, the Hung, turned out to be an ambush. He left the hospital 65% cyborg, walked out on his wife, and formed a mercenary team, &quot;Xris&#x27;s Commandos,&quot; during which time he came to the attention of a number of the galaxy&#x27;s more prominent military officers—Warlord Derek Sagan, General (and later Lord of Admiralty) John Dixter, and the Lady Maigrey Morianna, who hired him for an invasion of Corasian space (a feat never before attempted due to its suicidal nature). Xris was one of the few survivors of that raid, and (due to its almost total reorganization) his group was eventually renamed Mag Force 7.

Harry Luck - Mag Force 7&#x27;s premiere pilot, Harry is well-intentioned but oafish and rather slow on the uptake. He is the only member of Mag Force 7 to have also been in Xris&#x27;s Commandos and is intensely loyal to its leader. Very little is known about his history and personal life, which in some ways suits the character quite well. He is often regarded as dumber than a post, as there are several jibes in the series referring to injuries sustained to his rear end as possibly damaging his intelligence. Actually his intelligence was damaged from one too many stun blasts to the head.

Raoul de Beausoleil - Hailing from the planet of Adonis, where beauty is prized above all else, Raoul is known primarily for the size of his wardrobe, his well-maintained hair, nails and physique, and constant use of make-up. Formerly an employee of weapons magnate and fellow Adonian Snaga Ohme, he found himself drifting after his employer&#x27;s demise and signed on to the Lady Maigrey&#x27;s rescue mission. He has been with Xris ever since. Raoul is a Loti, a recreational drug user who maintains a constant euphoria, although no one from Mag Force 7 has ever seen Raoul use any type of drugs. Xris harbors an idea that Raoul is perfectly drug-free and is silently laughing at everyone being fooled by his clever act. He is also one of the most clever and deadly poisoners in the galaxy; his favorite trick is to hide poison in his lip gloss, creating a kiss that is truly to die for. He is also a notoriously bad shot with any form of projectile weaponry.

The Little One - a diminutive and enigmatic figure, approximately the height of a small child, constantly swaddled in an oversize raincoat and battered fedora, from under which peer two bright eyes. The Little One (no known gender) is a formidable telepath, and hangs out with Raoul because his drug-induced bliss is soothing. Raoul also acts as its mouthpiece, as The Little One cannot (or at least does not) talk. The Little One&#x27;s only known armament is a blowgun with poisoned darts; its main talent is to keep Raoul focused and provide the team with telepathic reconnaissance. The Little One is eventually revealed to be a Tongan, a member of an extremely reclusive race, and becomes the first recorded example of that species in medical history. Xris made that discovery after finding him in a pool of blood in a hotel bathroom, thinking him almost dead. Dr. Quong revealed that the injuries were mild and he looked that way normally.

Darlene Mohini - formerly Dalin Rowan, Xris&#x27;s fellow Fed. After the botched investigation on TISor 13, in which Xris became a cyborg, Rowan realized that he was under the eyes of the Hung. He faked his own death and changed his gender, becoming Major Darlene Mohini of the Royal Navy, a signal-intelligence and electronic countermeasures officer on a distant star base. Xris thought she had set him up and hunted her down, only to get the shock of his life; the two eventually reconciled their differences, especially after Mohini was instrumental in foiling a plot to assassinate His Royal Majesty Dion Starfire. It is unknown whether Mohini was officially invited to join Mag Force 7, nor if she accepted, but she remained active in the group&#x27;s endeavors for some time to come. In the second book of the series, &quot;Robot Blues&quot; Xris refers to her as a member of Mag Force 7, in the beginning as well as the end.

== Minor Members ==

Dr. Bill Quong - Dr. Quong is the team&#x27;s medical expert. Although reason dictates he could gain more golden eagles (Currency) by opening a private practice, all his attempts to do this have thus failed. The main reason being he tends to refer to people as machines, due to his degree in engineering, and logic in the simple fact that humans are but biological machines. As such, he proves to be a great asset to Xris, keeping both his cyborg and human components in shape. He is also adept at the use of firearms. He also has an odd fascination with The Little One, often poking and prodding him in order to write more on his paper about the Tongans.

Tycho - Tycho is the team&#x27;s sniper and money manager. He is from a humanoid race often referred to as &quot;Chameleons&quot; due to their ability to change color to suit their backgrounds. As such they are completely nude most of the time, a fact many people take a moment to get used to. They are also quite slender, to the point it makes hitting one from range difficult. They are much like reptiles in the fact that they are taller than humans and have elongated limbs. They are also unable to learn human speech, and no human is ever seen in the series as being able to understand their language. As such, Tycho requires the use of a translator, which either is highly defective, or his race has some highly imaginative sayings, such as &quot;All for one, and damn the torpedoes!&quot;. There are two Tychos in the series. The first, a sniper and vegetarian, is killed by a grenade in the second book of the series. Earlier in the book, Tycho remarks that he doesn&#x27;t much mind dying, as his life insurance payout would be massive and tax free to his family. The second Tycho, his younger brother (one of 11 capable of taking his place), joins the team after his brother&#x27;s death, and as part of a tradition, assumes Tycho&#x27;s name, and all of his unfinished contracts. The second Tycho is a Demolitions expert, as well as another expert in money management (&quot;It runs in the family&quot;). He prefers chocolate to all other foodstuff. As a note, Xris thought that Tycho was indistinguishable from his brothers and sister, mother and father, and every single one of his race.

Jamil The team&#x27;s military expert, and the obligatory wise cracking individual of military background. Jamil is a black male of a moderate build. He is apparently very handsome as he is quite the womanizer, having 2 wives, somewhat legally, as well as many one time flings throughout the galaxy. Whereas Harry is slow to catch on, Jamil is quick like a whip, although many times what he says is heavily ladled with sarcasm. As it is, anything that was or is used by the military, Jamil can give specifications as well as use, minus heavily passworded computers. Jamil often takes his shots where he can get them. When impersonating a superior officer to Xris (Jamil was a Colonel, Xris was a Captain) he used this time to take pot shots at Xris by ordering him around, making him do such things as moving baggage.

<doc id="949030" wikidata="Q105035" url="?curid=949030" title="Beslan">
<text>Beslan (; , &quot;Beslæn&quot;, ) is a town and the administrative center of Pravoberezhny District of the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania, Russia, located about north of the republic&#x27;s capital Vladikavkaz, close to the border with the Republic of Ingushetia. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 36,728, making it the third largest town in the republic behind Vladikavkaz and Mozdok.

It was previously known as &quot;Tulatovo/Tulatovskoye&quot; (until 1941) and &quot;Iriston&quot; (until 1950).

==History==
Beslan was founded in 1847 by migrants from elsewhere in Ossetia and was unofficially called Beslanykau (&quot;the settlement of Beslan&quot;) after a local lord, Beslan Tulatov. In official use, however, the town was known after Tulatov&#x27;s surname as Tulatovo or &quot;Tulatovskoye&quot;. It was renamed Iriston (lit. &quot;Ossetia&quot;) in 1941. From 1942 to 1943 the Germans tried to take Beslan, on the Adyghea-Beslan-Mozdok line. In 1950, when the town was rapidly industrialising, it was renamed Beslan.

===Beslan school hostage crisis===
On 1 September 2004, Beslan&#x27;s School No. 1 was seized by a group of at least thirty-two Islamic terrorists related to the Second Chechen War. The siege ended on 3 September with a bloody shootout between the terrorists and the Russian security forces. According to official data, 334 people were killed, 186 of them children, and hundreds more wounded. All but one of the hostage-takers were killed, with the survivor arrested and later tried and convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Beslan serves as the administrative center of Pravoberezhny District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Pravoberezhny District as Beslan Town Under District Jurisdiction. As a municipal division, Beslan Town Under District Jurisdiction is incorporated within Pravoberezhny Municipal District as Beslanskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Beslan is an important railway junction, situated on the main line between Rostov-on-Don and Baku, and is the starting point of a branch line to Vladikavkaz. It is an industrial-agricultural town dominated by a large corn processing plant established in the 1940s.

===Transportation===
The town is served by the Beslan Airport.

==Geography==
Beslan lies about north of Vladikavkaz, the capital of the republic, and about south of Moscow.

==Ethnic groups==
As of 2021, the ethnic composition of Beslan was: 
*Ossetians: 87.9%
*Russians: 9.2%
*Armenians: 1.2%
*Others: 1.7%

==Education==
One of the schools in Beslan is the Ivan and Konstantin Kanidis School. It was dedicated in 2010 and named after teacher Ivan (Yanis) Kanidis and his son; the teacher died during the Beslan school siege in 2004 at School No. 1. The governments of Greece and Norway paid 2.5 million euros through the United Nations Program of Development to have the school built. The school&#x27;s athletic programs specialize in soccer.

Another school is located on Kominterna Street. It replaced School No. 1, which closed after the hostage crisis. Officials chose not to give the replacement school, located across the street from School No. 1, a number. Immediately after School No. 1 closed, classes for children who would have attended it were held at School No. 6.

==Notable people==
*Alan Dzagoev (b. 1990), Russian professional association football player
*Zaurbek Sidakov (b. 1996), a 2020 Olympic champion and two-time World Champion amateur freestyle wrestler

<text>ALGOL 68S is a programming language designed as a subset of ALGOL 68, to allow compiling via a one-pass compiler. It was mostly for numerical analysis.

==Implementations==
A compiler for ALGOL 68S was available for the PDP-11, written in the language BLISS. The multiprocessor version designed for the C.mmp has been preserved at the PDP Unix Preservation Society archive.

Charles H. Lindsey created another implementation of ALGOL 68, named ALGOL 68S, for Sun-3, Sun SPARC (under SunOS 4.1), Sun SPARC (under Solaris 2), Atari ST (under GEMDOS) and Acorn Archimedes (under RISC OS).

==Chief differences from ALGOL 68==
The main differences between ALGOL 68 and 68S, as summarised from Appendix 4 of the Informal Introduction, include:
* No &quot;union&quot;
* No &quot;flex&quot;, but &quot;string&quot;s are handled specially
* No arrays inside structures (but references to arrays were allowed) and a similar restriction on arrays of arrays (multidimensional arrays are nonetheless permitted)
* Limits on use of &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; to aid implementing on small computers
* No &quot;heap&quot;
* No parallel processing
* Limits on the order of declaration and other small syntactic differences to allow one-pass compiling
* No &quot;format&quot;s

<text>Crises is the eighth studio album by English musician and songwriter Mike Oldfield, released on 27 May 1983 on Virgin Records. Oldfield started recording the album towards the end of his 1982 tour supporting his previous record, &quot;Five Miles Out&quot;. It marked a continuation of Oldfield&#x27;s experimentation with more accessible music which began in the late 1970s; side one contains the 20-minute &quot;Crises&quot; and side two contains a collection of shorter songs which feature vocalists Maggie Reilly, Jon Anderson, and Roger Chapman. Oldfield produced &quot;Crises&quot; with drummer Simon Phillips, who also plays on the album.

&quot;Crises&quot; reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and became Oldfield&#x27;s most successful record of the 1980s following the release of the single &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, which went to number one in nine countries and sold in excess of a million units. Oldfield supported the album with the Crises Tour across Europe in 1983 that featured most of the musicians that played on the album.

==Background and recording==
By the 1980s, Oldfield had shifted musical direction from the longform compositions that he had become known for throughout the previous decade, towards more commercial and straightforward rock and pop songs. By the time he had finished the 1982 world tour in support of his previous album &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; in December of that same year, Oldfield had already started work on a follow-up. &quot;Crises&quot; sees Oldfield explore heavy metal elements which he had been a fan of for some time and enjoyed playing.

Oldfield described side one as material that he had wanted to write and perform &quot;for personal satisfaction&quot;, while side two is &quot;very commercial, full of singles&quot;. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s a case of keeping everybody happy.&quot; The North American version of &quot;Crises&quot; featured a different running order to capitalize on the commercial songs by switching the order of the sides, adding the non-album single &quot;Mistake&quot; as the lead track, and moving &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; to the end of its side. This North American version has not been reissued since its initial pressing. The &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; single from this album includes the rare track &quot;Rite of Man&quot;.

The album was recorded from November 1982 to April 1983 at Tilehouse Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire, using an Ampex ATR 124 tape recorder, a Neve 8108 with Necam console and Westlake Monitors. Oldfield used a Gibson SG Junior for overdriven guitar sounds and a Fender Stratocaster for clean sounds. Tama drums were Simon Phillips&#x27; brand of choice for drums on the album; Phillips also did some production work. Oldfield makes extensive use of Oberheim and Fairlight keyboards. Asked how he recruited Chapman and Anderson in an interview, Oldfield answered &quot;we just hang out in the same bar&quot;.

==Songs==
===Side one===
The title track of the album is a twenty-minute-long piece, featuring a small amount of vocals, sung by Oldfield. The beginning and end of the track are driven by a synthesised lead passage, stylistically similar to the opening theme to Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. Oldfield rated &quot;Crises&quot; as one of the best tracks he had done since &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; features Oldfield&#x27;s touring vocalist Maggie Reilly, who had also sung on his previous albums. Oldfield had singer Hazel O&#x27;Connor sing on an early version of the track, which was then titled &quot;Moment of Passion&quot;, but it failed to produce sufficient results. He then booked Reilly for a studio session, for which he prepared by drinking wine and writing a set of lyrics using a rhyming dictionary. Reilly sang the lyrics in a rock style at first, which prompted Oldfield to suggest a softer tone and &quot;in the manner of a lullaby&quot;. The idea worked, despite recording the song in small sections and using multiple drop-ins which took some time to finalise and piece together.

&quot;In High Places&quot; was written by Oldfield with lyrics by himself and Yes vocalist Jon Anderson, who sings on the track. The pair had worked on several occasions prior to recording &quot;Crises&quot;, and Oldfield had enjoyed Anderson&#x27;s vocal style and how easy it was working with him. Anderson was living in Barbados at the time of writing, so Oldfield phoned him from England and sang the song&#x27;s tune to him, after which Anderson went away and wrote lyrics to it. The two later met and finished the song in Oldfield&#x27;s studio. The track features Pierre Moerlen, who had toured with Oldfield and played on his albums, on vibraphone.
On the occasion of Virgin Records founder Richard Branson&#x27;s launch of the then-largest hot-air balloon ever made, the song was released as a single in 1987, four years after the Crises LP.

&quot;Foreign Affair&quot; features Reilly on vocals, who co-wrote the lyrics with Oldfield.

&quot;Taurus 3&quot;, a short fast-paced guitar piece unlike the previous two long multi-themed &quot;Taurus&quot; tracks featured on &quot;QE2&quot; and &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; respectively.

&quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; features vocals by Roger Chapman. Oldfield wrote the song with Chapman&#x27;s voice in mind.

== Artwork ==

The album&#x27;s cover art was by Terry Ilott and was originally created as an illustration for an edition of J. G. Ballard&#x27;s &quot;The Drowned World&quot;. Oldfield makes reference to the artwork with the line, &quot;the watcher and the tower, waiting hour, by hour&quot; (printed in the back cover of the LP, and sung by Mike Oldfield on the title track). In the interview mentioned before, Oldfield stated that &quot;I&#x27;m the man in the corner, and the tower is my music&quot;.

== Charts ==
It spent 19 weeks on Norway&#x27;s album chart, peaking at No. 1 for two weeks, and is Oldfield&#x27;s best selling album there. The album also topped the charts in Germany and Sweden.

<doc id="949049" wikidata="Q7774394" url="?curid=949049" title="The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game">
<text>The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game is an out-of-print collectible card game published by Precedence Entertainment in December 1999 and based on Robert Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; fantasy novel series. The game was somewhat unusual among contemporary collectible card games because it required a play mat with tokens and customized six-sided dice to play. It uses some similar game mechanics to the &quot;Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game&quot; and the &quot;Tomb Raider Collectible Card Game&quot;, which were also published by Precedence.

== Overview ==
Opposing players represent the forces of good or evil and reenact the epic struggle for victory as told in Jordan&#x27;s books.
While building up forces in the form of supporting characters and troops, and enhancing them with powerups, the player tries to weaken the opponent by hampering them with effects and inflicting damage during battles. These battles are fought over &quot;challenges&quot;, missions that each player can initiate. The winner of the challenge receives a specific reward as specified by the challenge. The dice are used to generate four different kinds of abilities, needed for recruiting characters, doing damage, and generating support or opposition during the challenges and the Last Battle.

Players try to obtain dominance by controlling the &quot;Pattern&quot;, which is accomplished by winning the Pattern challenge that is initiated each turn. Dominance gives a player the advantage of knowing what the opponent does before acting himself. When the Pattern is filled with 20 tokens, the game&#x27;s final act commences: The Last Battle. All characters and troops able to fight must enter the battleground for this epic clash. Rounds of battle are fought until one player has generated more than five support over the opponent&#x27;s total opposition; that player wins the game. The other way to win is by eliminating the opponent&#x27;s starting character.

== Game play ==
(Taken from the old Precedence site)

===Released card sets===
# The Wheel of Time: Premier Edition (300 cards)
# 1st expansion set: Dark Prophecies (150 cards)
# 2nd expansion set: Children of the Dragon (154 cards)
# Limited Enhancement set: Cycles (containing just 4 cards)
# Promo cards: various cards given away as prizes, gifts or found in booster boxes.

Although they were rumored to be in their late design stages, the 3rd expansion &quot;The White Tower&quot; and the revised base game &quot;2nd Edition&quot; never came to be due to Precedence&#x27;s demise.

===Card types===
====Characters and troops====
Character cards represent the significant individuals in the game. All characters have allegiances to different factions within the game, which determines how much it costs to recruit them and be able to play them from hand. Most characters have some special ability that they can use as listed in their effect text. Characters have up to four abilities at various ratings: Politics (green), Intrigue (Blue), One Power (white) and Combat (Black). The numbers in these colored boxes are how many dice the character rolls of that color. Troops are like characters, but they represent large amounts of secondary characters in the game and they usually only have a Combat Ability.

A player can normally only have one copy of a troop or character in the game unless they have the &quot;Multiple&quot; trait. Troops and characters usually participate in challenges, but do not interact with one another directly. Instead, characters interact with characters and troops interact with troops.

====Advantages====
(Including Starting Advantages)
Advantages are long-term effects that a character, the player, or troops can gain. Advantages tell a player what they can affect (Character, Troop, Player, World [world affects all players]). Until discarded, the advantage remains in effect. If the card an advantage is attached to leaves play, so does the advantage.

Prophecy cards are very powerful advantages, and have certain requirements that must be met before they can be played. They reflect the various concepts of the Prophecies from the Jordan novels.

====Challenges====
Challenges represent the goals a player tries to accomplish to win the game. Challenges have various effects depending on whether they are successful or not. Characters and troops must be allotted to participate in challenges in order to try to get them to succeed. Many challenges allow a player to gain Pattern, some have other effects.

====Events====
Events represent actions taken by characters or a happening that is beyond their reach. The effects are determined as soon as the card is played. Its effects must be resolved immediately and no other events can be played until after the effects of the first event have been resolved. Unless it says otherwise, effects expire at the end of the current turn. Some events are limited events that a player can only play during their action round. There are few events which specify when they can be played, and most events are simply played when appropriate.
===General information===
====Ability symbols====
Ability symbols are marked on the dice. Each book a player rolls on the green die indicates a point of Politics they can spend, each Chalice on the blue Intrigue, each Yin-Yang on the white is One Power and each Rider and Horse on the Black is Combat. Most all cards have a number of these symbols listed at the bottom, which represents the cost of recruiting the card.

The other three symbols on the dices are used in challenges. The sword counts as a point of support for a challenge, the shield counts as a point of opposition, and the skull counts as damage done toward the opposition.

Some dice have sides with multiple symbols. These faces count as either symbol, depending on what the dice is rolled for.

There are also colored blank tokens used to show which challenges players are participating in and numbered tokens used to keep track of how much of an ability a player has generated.

====The Pattern====
The Pattern is the focus of the game. Each turn a token is to be placed on the Pattern. Depending on how various challenges go during the turn, the token could be in the neutral area, the light area, or the dark area. When there are 20 tokens on the Pattern, the last battle starts, in which the side with the most tokens has an advantage.

====Last Battle====
The Last Battle is a special challenge at the very end of the game that goes on until a player has enough points to win. 
&#x27;It&#x27;s the big battle at the end of every good book, where all the cards are on the table and it&#x27;s do or die time!&#x27;, according to Precedence ads.

====Dominance====
Whichever faction has the most pattern tokens on their side has dominance. This affects who goes first and last at the various stages of a turn.

====Allegiances====
It is easier to for a player to play a character card when they have other cards with the same allegiance on the table, and it is less expensive to recruit cards of the same allegiance.

====The factions====
&quot;Dragon Reborn&quot;: Led by Rand al&#x27; Thor, the faction of Light attempts to sway the Pattern to their side to stop the Forsaken.

&quot;The Forsaken&quot;: Never truly trusting one another, but working together to bring their own darkness to the Pattern and rule the world.

<doc id="949056" wikidata="Q5456285" url="?curid=949056" title="Fivepenny Piece">
<text>The Fivepenny Piece were a five-piece band, originally formed in 1967 in the area of East Lancashire around Ashton-under-Lyne and nearby Stalybridge in Tameside. The band met and performed on Wednesday nights at Ashton&#x27;s Broadoak Hotel, which gave them their original name The Wednesday Folk.

==Career==
Their break came when they entered and won the Granada Television talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1968 (not to be confused with ATV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; which didn&#x27;t begin until 1973), which led to a contract with the Noel Gay agency, a recording contract with EMI, and their new name.

Many of their mostly self-penned songs reflected their roots, using Lancashire dialect, with references to the mining and weaving trades, the mills and factories, and the Lancashire characters who lived in the area. But there was another side to the group&#x27;s music, perhaps best described as more pop-oriented. The band&#x27;s music is most often categorised as folk, though many feel that is too limiting a description.

The original personnel were John Meeks (born 24 March 1937, Stalybridge, Cheshire) (guitar, vocals); John&#x27;s sister Lynda Jane Meeks (1 August 1947, Stalybridge – 22 January 2013) (vocals); brothers George Radcliffe (9 August 1937, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire – 2002) (bass, vocals) and Colin Radcliffe (born 19 January 1934, Ashton-under-Lyne) (guitar, vocals); and Eddie Crotty (24 February 1942, Stalybridge – 11 April 2009) (guitar, vocals). John Meeks and Colin Radcliffe wrote most of their best-known songs, although Crotty also penned several. The unofficial sixth member of the band was the drummer Phil Barlow, who accompanied them in many of their concerts and on their albums.

During the band&#x27;s 1970s heyday they released over a dozen albums for EMI and then Philips, and reached the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart with their LP &quot;King Cotton&quot;. They performed multiple times on national television, and had their own BBC Television series, &quot;The Fivepenny Piece Show&quot;.

By the early 1980s the group had reached an impasse, and John Meeks&#x27; departure was followed soon afterwards by Lynda Meeks. With John&#x27;s replacement Trevor Chance (born 1 March 1942, Gilsland, Cumberland) and Andrea Mullins (formerly of the Caravelles), the band continued until 1985 when they broke up.

They reformed in the mid-1990s, and played occasional gigs with various personnel, including the Lancashire folk singer and comedian Bernard Wrigley and Pete Brew. Crotty and George Radcliffe continued to play in the band, along with Mullins. Salford-born guitarist and vocalist Paul Johnston joined the band in the late 1990s as they continued to perform, their final show being at the Grand Theatre in Lancaster around 2004.

George Radcliffe ran the &#x27;Star Inn&#x27; pub in Ashton-under-Lyne in the early 80&#x27;s and died at the end of 2002, and Eddie Crotty, the band&#x27;s only remaining original member, died of a heart attack in hospital on 11 April 2009, aged 67, after being ill for the previous nine years. Lynda Jane Meeks died from cancer on 22 January 2013, aged 67 years, at the Christie Hospital in Manchester.

For a while in the 1970s the group had a weekly interlude spot on the BBC programme &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; with Esther Rantzen.

<text>The Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language (ESPOL) is a programming language, a superset of ALGOL 60, that provides abilities of what would later be termed a &quot;system programming language&quot; or &quot;machine oriented high order language&quot; (mohol), such as interrupting a processor on a multiprocessing system (the Burroughs large systems were multiprocessor systems). ESPOL was used to write the &quot;Master Control Program&quot; (MCP) on Burroughs computer systems from the B5000 to the B6700.
The single-pass compiler for ESPOL could compile over 250 lines per second.

ESPOL was superseded by NEWP in the mid-to-late 1970s.

<doc id="949068" wikidata="Q6953482" url="?curid=949068" title="NELIAC">
<text>The Navy Electronics Laboratory International ALGOL Compiler (NELIAC) is a dialect and compiler implementation of the programming language ALGOL 58, developed by the Navy Electronics Laboratory (NEL) in 1958.

It was designed for numeric and logical computations and was the first language to provide a bootstrap implementation.

==Origin==
NELIAC was the brainchild of Harry Huskey, then chairperson of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and a well known computer scientist, and supported by Maurice Halstead, the head of the computing center at NEL. The earliest version was implemented on the prototype AN/USQ-17 computer (called &quot;the Countess&quot;, after Countess Ada Lovelace) at the laboratory. It was the world&#x27;s first self-compiling compiler, a trait called bootstrapping. This means that the compiler was first coded in simplified form in assembly language &quot;the bootstrap&quot;, and then rewritten in its own language, compiled by this &quot;bootstrap&quot; compiler, and recompiled by itself, making the &quot;bootstrap&quot; obsolete.

It is considered a variant of ALGOL 58 because of similarities to that language, but within two years, the ALGOL committee produced other versions of ALGOL, and NELIAC and ALGOL diverged.

==Use==
The compiler was used on the Countess to produce a version for the CDC 1604, and later self-compiled on that machine. Many other versions were produced for commercial computers such as the UNIVAC 1107, 490, and 418, and the IBM 704 and 709. The production version of NELIAC was a second generation system (for the AN/USQ-20, a modernized and militarized version of the AN/USQ-20), compiled by the first version, but including full decoding of algorithmic expressions and, later, an input/output (I/O) system missing on all other versions.

The decompiler was a curiosity. The first version ran on the Countess, but was later ported to the CDC 1604, and to other computers, and received some notice at some universities. However, it turned out that, at that time, there were few programs worth decompiling.

NELIAC was never intended to be a commercial product. Its primary advantage over other compilers of the day was its portability to other computers, and its one-pass compiler architecture which made possible such fast compile times that it compiled 60 to 120 times faster than other high-level programming languages which used multi-pass compilers. The JOVIAL compiler made 14 passes, for example. The simplicity of the language and its rapid compile times permitted much faster development cycles than other contemporaneous compilers. It was an in-house NEL effort to make possible a more cost-effective solution to the problem of computer system development.

NELIAC was used by the Royal Canadian Navy to develop software for the Command and Control System 280 (used on the DDH-280 destroyers) in the years 1967 to 1971. The Canadian Navy established a Program Generation Centre in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada for this software development. The host computer was the Litton L304F containing 160 kB of memory. Because of memory constraints the NELIAC application software was later rewritten in assembler code.

NELIAC was used to implement an experimental shipboard anti-submarine warfare system, and was also used for the development of the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA) project which developed a strategic command and control system installed on aircraft carriers and cruisers. Perhaps the most successful NELIAC application was control of the U.S. Navy automated High Frequency Direction Finding network (Classic Bullseye) which went into production in 1968 and lasted until the early 1990s.

In addition, NEL developed NELOS, a batch operating system which provided input-output for magnetic tapes, printers, and telecom equipment, provided sequenced compiling of jobs, and a symbol library permitting linking of very large computer applications and executing them on-line. These included suites of information management programs, including databases, free form queries with a precursor of IBM&#x27;s GIS, and reporting applications. NECPA and NELOS went to sea in 1966.

==NELIAC&#x27;s end==
However, NELIAC programs were not easily portable because the language permitted manipulation of binary characters which were dependent on word lengths. Further, the NELIAC language had no input-output schemes. Also, its looping statement was unusually strict in that the index variable had to hit the end value exactly, or else an infinite loop would occur. These were the Achilles&#x27; heels of NELIAC.

Many other well-known computer experts like Niklaus Wirth made contributions to the project, but ultimately NELIAC fell out of favor after the Navy Department standardized on compilers with commercial support.

<text>E.S.R., Inc. was an American manufacturer of educational toys during the 1960s. The company’s founders included William H. Duerig and Irving J. Lieberman, both involved in missile research at Kearfott Guidance in New Jersey, and C. David Hogan, an engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology (who happened to be renting a room from Duerig and his wife). Together the three brainstormed Lieberman’s concept for a simple mechanical computer, and showed a prototype at the annual Toy Fair in New York City.

With encouragement from toy buyers, the three engineers established E.S.R., Inc. in 1963 to produce and market their new toy, dubbed the Digi-Comp I, which has been referred to as the first home computer. According to Duerig, the initials &quot;E.S.R.&quot; didn’t actually stand for anything. Originally the group had wanted to name their company Electronic Systems Research, but that name was already taken; an attorney suggested using just the initials. (Later product packaging fleshed out the name as “Education Science Research,” but officially the company remained E.S.R., doing business at 34 Label Street in Montclair, New Jersey.) 

Digi-Comp I became a best-selling toy, its sales passing 100,000 units within several years. Several other products followed, all supplied by outside inventors to be manufactured and marketed by E.S.R. John Godfrey, an engineer at General Electric in Schenectady, NY, brought his concepts for both Dr. Nim and Digi-Comp II to E.S.R.’s attention. Joseph Weisbecker, from RCA in Princeton, NJ, who designed games on the side, came up with the idea for Think-a-Dot. Both Lieberman and Duerig continued their careers at Kearfott through E.S.R.&#x27;s heyday. Dave Hogan, with expertise in plastic injection molding, played a pivotal role on the manufacturing side as the company&#x27;s general manager. 

By the early 1970s, with the advent of electronic toys and calculators, E.S.R.&#x27;s sales were in steep decline. The company purchased the Long Island-based educational game publisher EduCards, and for several years continued operation under that name, until being bought out in turn in the mid-1970s.

<text>Emerald Lake is a freshwater lake located in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. Yoho National Park is one of the 4 contiguous National Parks in the heart of Canada&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, along the boundary of British Columbia and Alberta Provinces, the other Parks are Kootenay, Jasper, and Banff. 

==Nearby features==
Emerald Lake Lodge, a high-end lodge or hotel, is on a peninsula jutting into the lake. It was founded in the 1920s and completely rebuilt in the 1980s. A quiet 2 lane paved road about 9 km / 6 miles long connects the busy Trans-Canada Highway with Emerald Lake, the exit is well marked. A hiking trail circuits the lake, the first half of which is accessible to wheelchairs and strollers, many other more advanced hiking trails go in different directions up into the mountains.

The railway and timber town of Golden BC is the nearest town to Emerald Lake that is outside the Park boundaries, it is about 50 km / 30 miles distant to the west in the low valley of the Columbia River headwaters, and has many lodging options, the small historic railway village of Field is in Yoho Park near the highway exit to Emerald Lake, and has a large Park-operated Information and Visitor&#x27;s Center, Field Village also has gas, food and a few B &amp; B&#x27;s. The Park Service Center of Lake Louise, which has limited lodging, is about 30 km / 20 miles to the east of Emerald Lake in neighboring Banff National Park, while the famous resort town of Banff, located on the southeast edge of that Park, is about 60 km / 40 miles further east of Lake Louise, it has a large number of hotels as does the town of Canmore, located just outside the Banff Park boundary. Vehicle / RV campgrounds are common throughout the region for summer use, reservations made well in advance are highly advised for hotels and campgrounds during summer, which is early June to late September on an average weather year.

==Wildlife==
Many wild animals live in the area and are protected by Park Law, Brown (Grizzly) Bears and Black Bears are fairly common, they co-exist quite well with humans as the Park has strict laws on garbage control and good advice to Park Visitors on practicing bear safety and being &quot;Bear Aware&quot;. Mountain Goats and Bighorn Sheep are seen at higher altitudes, and many smaller mammals are common everywhere. Hunting is strictly prohibited in the Park, fishing is permitted with a Park license. 

==Surrounding geographical features==
Emerald Lake is enclosed by mountains of the President Range, named after the President and Vice-President of the coast to coast Canadian Pacific Railway, built in 1885 and which runs through Yoho National Park. Other peaks are Mount Burgess and Wapta Mountain. The Emerald Basin opens to the west and traps rain and snow storms, causing frequent rain in summer and heavy snowfalls in winter. This influx of moisture works with the lake&#x27;s elevation of 1200 meters / 4400 feet above sea level to produce a unique selection of flora. Trees found here are more typical of B.C.&#x27;s wet interior forests of the Columbia Mountains immediately to the west, such as western red cedar, western yew, western hemlock and western white pine. The alluvial fan on the northeast shore produces wildflowers in abundance during late June and early July.
==Climate==
Brief snowstorms, which usually melt in a few days, occasionally occur at valley level in June or September due to the latitude of 53 degrees and the generally high elevation. Daytime temperatures in June or September average 20 C / 70 F, in July and August it can reach as high as 33 C / 90 F. Winter temperatures December to March are always below freezing, averaging -15 C / 0 F and sometimes down to -30 C / -30 F. Snowfall is usually substantial, about 1 meter / 3 feet or more of snow stays at lake level in winter, increasing with altitude to 10 meters / 30 feet or more on the mountain tops.

Due to its 53 degree latitude and moderately high altitude, the lake is frozen from November until late April or early May. The vivid green color of the water is caused by powdered rock from the glaciers, which reflects the blue-green spectrum of sunlight. The rock type and the amount of it in the water causes the color to vary from lake to lake and month to month, even week to week.

==Human interaction==
===Naming===
The first non-indigenous person to set sight on Emerald Lake was Canadian guide Tom Wilson, who stumbled upon it by accident in 1882. A string of his horses had gotten away, and it was while tracking them that he first entered the valley. The lake had an impression on him: &quot;For a few moments I sat [on] my horse and enjoyed the rare, peaceful beauty of the scene.&quot; It was Wilson who gave the lake its name because of its remarkable color, which due to a different rock type producing the sediment that is suspended in the glacial water, reflects the green spectrum of sunlight rather than the blue spectrum seen in Moraine, Hector, Bow and Peyto Lakes in neighboring Banff National Park. However, this was not the first time Wilson had named a lake &#x27;Emerald&#x27;. Earlier that same year he had discovered another lake which he had given the same name, and that name even appeared briefly on the official map. This first lake however, was shortly renamed Lake Louise.

===Restrictions===
During the summer months, canoe rentals are available from Emerald Lake Lodge. In winter, the lake is a popular cross country skiing destination. As a general rule, Canada&#x27;s national parks do not permit private or business land ownership within their boundaries, and all development is strictly controlled by Parks Canada for environmental preservation. Development permits are rare, and then only given after extensive government review and consultation. The land the business occupies is leased from Parks Canada. Most businesses in the national parks were established decades ago, and current approval is exceedingly rare. There is a strict &quot;need-to-reside&quot; law for Canadian Rockies national parks; to live in a park, residents must either be employed within the park, or own a business that is based in the park.

<text>Dip circles (also &quot;dip needles&quot;) are used to measure the angle between the horizon and the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (the dip angle). They were used in surveying, mining and prospecting as well as for the demonstration and study of magnetism.

Georg Hartmann first discovered dip angle in 1544, when he noticed the needle on a compass dipped towards the north hemisphere. Rather than explore this phenomenon, Hartmann sought ways to eliminate it. However, Robert Norman around 1576 investigated dip angle further and in 1581 described in print a device to measure this phenomenon.

Early dip circles were not accurate and gave poor results. Over the next 300 years many improvements were made, including reducing the friction between the needle and its pivot and encasing the circle in glass. Between the late 18th century and late 19th century the design approached its peak. Improvements which made the dip circle a practical aid for polar navigation were made by Robert Were Fox FRS, who developed in the 1830s the first dip circle that could be used on board a moving ship. Another important improvement to the instrument was developed in the 1830s by the Dublin physicist Humphrey Lloyd, who devised a way of attaching a magnetic needle at right-angles to the dip needle in order to measure the intensity of force (by seeing the extent to which the right-angle needle deflected the dip-needle).

By World War I the most advanced dip circles were being made. With the development of electronic systems dip circles became obsolete.

<text>Ghulam Nabi Azad (born 7 March 1949) is an Indian politician who served as Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha between 2014 and 2021. He also served as the Chief Minister of erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir from 2005 to 2008. On 26 September 2022, Azad announced his own political party as Democratic Progressive Azad Party. He is the chief patron cum founder of Democratic Progressive Azad Party.

Azad served as Minister of Health and Family Welfare. He has served as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs in the Manmohan Singh government until 27 October 2005, when he was appointed the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. On 26 August 2022, Azad resigned from Indian National Congress and mulled creating a new party at the national level.

He also led the party successfully in the 2002 Assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir. He was bestowed with the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian award, in 2022 by the Indian Government in the field of Public Affairs.

==Early life==
Ghulam Nabi Azad was born in a village named Soti of Gandoh tehsil (Bhalessa) in the formerly princely state of Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s Doda district. His parents were Rahamatullah Batt and Basa Begum. He attended the local school in his village. Later for higher studies he moved to Jammu and received his Bachelor&#x27;s of Science degree from G.G.M. Science College. Furthermore, he also received a Master&#x27;s in Zoology degree from the University of Kashmir, Srinagar in 1972.

==Political career==
Azad started his career soon after working as the secretary for the Block Congress Committee in Bhalessa in 1973. Two years later, he was nominated as the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Youth Congress. In 1980, he was appointed the President of the All-India Youth Congress.

After being elected to the Seventh Lok Sabha from Maharashtra&#x27;s Washim (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1980, Azad entered into the Central government as Deputy Minister in charge of Law, Justice and Company Affairs Ministry in 1982.

Subsequently, he was elected to the Eighth Lok Sabha in 1984 and was a member (1990 - 1996) from Maharashtra in Rajya Sabha. During Rao&#x27;s government, Azad took charge of Parliamentary Affairs and Civil Aviation ministries. He was subsequently elected to Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir during the term of 30 November 1996 to 29 November 2002 and 30 November 2002 to 29 November 2008, but resigned on 29 April 2006 as he became Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on 2 November 2005.

The People&#x27;s Democratic Party, a coalition partner of the Indian National Congress in Jammu and Kashmir, withdrew its support for Azad&#x27;s government, and rather than attempt to sustain his government by requesting a vote of confidence, Azad resigned on 7 July 2008, and later left office on 11 July 2008.

===Union government===

In the second United Progressive Alliance Government, led by Manmohan Singh, Azad was sworn in as the Health Minister of India. He was elected to Rajya Sabha for the fourth and fifth terms from Jammu and Kashmir during the term of 30 November 1996 to 29 November 2002. He vowed to expand the National Rural Health Mission, which has mobilized half a million health workers, all across India, and later his ministry also launched a National Urban Health Mission, to serve the slum dwelling urban poor.

He has suggested a late marriage age of between 25 and 30 for population control, and has said that lack of electricity &amp; thereby absence of TV entertainment in rural areas will cause people to produce more children.

===Leader of Opposition===
In June 2014, after the National Democratic Alliance won a majority in the Lok Sabha and formed the Union government, Azad was appointed the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, where Congress still held the majority.

In 2015, Azad got re-elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir, despite the PDP-BJP alliance holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly.

===Resignation from INC===
In August 2022, Azad resigned from the post of chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Congress campaign committee hours after his appointment. Sonia Gandhi accepted the resignation from Azad. On 26 August 2022, he resigned from all positions including primary membership of the party. In his resignation letter, he cited destruction of consultative process by Rahul Gandhi as a reason.

== Democratic Progressive Azad Party ==
On 4 September 2022, Azad announced the formation of a new political party after resigning from Congress. He said the people of Jammu and Kashmir will decide the name and the flag for the new party.

On 26 September 2022, Azad announced the name of his new party as Democratic Progressive Azad Party. The flag of the Democratic Azad Party has three colours: mustard, white, and blue.

==Personal life==
Azad married Shameema Dev Azad, a well known Kashmiri singer, in 1980, and they have a son Saddam Nabi Azad and a daughter Sofiya Nabi Azad.

==Positions held==
==Awards==
*In March 2022, Ghulam Nabi Azad received Padma Bhushan from President Ram Nath Kovind.
*Outstanding Parliamentarian Award 2015, at Parliament House, New Delhi on 1 August 2018

<doc id="949096" wikidata="Q537792" url="?curid=949096" title="Geissler tube">
<text>A Geissler tube is a precursor to modern gas discharge tubes, demonstrating the principles of electrical glow discharge, akin to contemporary neon lights, and central to the discovery of the electron. This device was developed in 1857 by Heinrich Geissler, a German physicist and glassblower. A Geissler tube is composed of a sealed glass cylinder of various shapes, which is partially evacuated and equipped with a metal electrode at each end. It contains rarefied gases—such as neon or argon, air, mercury vapor, or other conductive substances, and sometimes ionizable minerals or metals like sodium. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, there is an electric current through the tube, causing gas molecules to ionize by shedding electrons. The free electrons reunite with the ions and the resulting energic atoms emit light via fluorescence, with the emitted color characteristic of the contained material. 

Colorful decorative Geissler tubes were made in many artistic designs around the turn of the century, to demonstrate the new technology of electricity. Simple straight ones were used as high voltage sensors in physics experiments. The technology of gas-discharge lighting pioneered in Geissler tubes evolved around 1910 into commercial neon lighting, seen today.

==Application==
Geissler tubes were mass-produced from the 1880s as novelty and entertainment devices, with various spherical chambers and decorative serpentine paths formed into the glass tube. Some tubes were very elaborate and complex in shape and would contain chambers within an outer casing. A novel effect could be obtained by spinning a glowing tube at high speed with a motor; a disk of color was seen due to persistence of vision. When an operating tube was touched by the hand, the shape of the glowing discharge inside often changed due to the capacitance of the body. 

Simple straight Geissler tubes were used in early-20th-century scientific research as high voltage indicators. When a Geissler tube was brought near a source of high voltage, alternating current, such as a Tesla coil or Ruhmkorff coil, it would light up even without contact with the circuit. They were used to tune the tank circuits of radio transmitters to resonance. Another example of their use was to find nodes of standing waves on transmission lines, such as Lecher lines used to measure the frequency of early radio transmitters. 

Another use around 1900 was as the light source in Pulfrich refractometers.

Geissler tubes are sometimes still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of gas discharge tubes.

==Influence==

Geissler tubes were the first gas discharge tubes, and have had a large impact on the development of many instruments and devices which depend on electric discharge through gases.

One of the most significant consequences of Geissler tube technology was the discovery of the electron and the invention of electronic vacuum tubes. By the 1870s better vacuum pumps enabled scientists to evacuate Geissler tubes to a higher vacuum; these were called Crookes tubes after William Crookes. When current was applied, it was found that the glass envelope of these tubes would glow at the end opposite to the cathode. Observing that sharp-edged shadows were cast on the glowing tube wall by obstructions in the tube in front of the cathode, Johann Hittorf realized that the glow was caused by some type of ray travelling in straight lines through the tube from the cathode. These were named cathode rays. In 1897 J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays consisted of a previously unknown particle, which was named the &quot;electron&quot;. The technology of controlling electron beams resulted in the invention of the amplifying vacuum tube in 1907, which created the field of &quot;electronics&quot; and dominated it for 50 years, and the cathode-ray tube which was used in radar and television displays.

Some of the devices which evolved from Geissler tube technology:
*Vacuum tubes
*Xenon flash lamps (for flash photography)
*Xenon arc lamps (for movie and IMAX projectors)
*X-ray tubes
*Sodium vapor lamps used in streetlights
*&quot;Neon&quot; signs, which use both visible light discharge from neon and other gases and phosphor excitation from ultraviolet light
*Mercury vapor lamps
*Mass spectrometers
*Cathode-ray tubes, employed in the oscilloscope and later in television sets, radar, and computer display devices
*Electrotachyscope (an early moving picture display device)
*Fluorescent lamps
*Plasma globes
